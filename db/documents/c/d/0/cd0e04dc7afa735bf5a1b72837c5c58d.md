The overall survival is 70% to 88% after 10 years.

Mortality of DIP ranges anywhere between 6% to 28%.

There are not many longitudinal studies characterizing the rate of disease progression. In one such study, Remy-Jardin et al. reported that ground glass changes, emphysema, and centrilobular nodules increased from 28% to 42%, 26% to 40%, and 33% to 35%, respectively, in current smokers during a mean follow-up period of 5.5 years.

Continuation of smoking certainly is associated with a poorer outcome.

Children with DIP tend to have a poorer prognosis, particularly for those with ABCA3 mutations.
