Laser therapy for the treatment is an effective and safe treatment modality for multiple types of scars. Several studies have demonstrated high patient satisfaction rates with the cosmetic outcome of various laser treatments. The emergence of fractional ablative laser devices has led to superior outcomes with decreased downtime compared to traditional fully ablative lasers, thereby increasing the appeal of laser treatment for patients. In addition to making existing scars less noticeable, laser therapy can also be used prophylactically to minimize post-operative scarring.
