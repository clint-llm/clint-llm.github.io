Beta-lactamase inhibitory therapy has shown correlations with kidney, liver, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and nervous system adverse effects.****Although most antimicrobial therapy is short term, and bloodwork to assess kidney and/or liver function is generally not required for healthy individuals, several at-risk patient populations require additional monitoring. Given that beta-lactamase inhibitors undergo renal elimination, patients with chronic kidney disease must undergo routine screening and dose adjustment to prevent renal toxicity and acute kidney injury.Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infection due to the death of protective gut microflora. Beta-lactam antimicrobial/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination therapies are no exception to this rule. Therefore, patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal issues, such as inflammatory bowel disease, as well as patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS, should receive additional monitoring for these gastrointestinal side effects.
