Interactions between epithelium and mesenchyme (embryonic connective tissue) are necessary for the development of all organs of female and male urogenital systems, except for the gonads.

The urogenital system is formed from intermediate mesoderm, while the lining of the urethra, urinary bladder, and reproductive system is composed of endoderm. Primordial germ cells that migrated from the epiblast through the primitive streak then appear at the primitive gonads at the beginning of week 5, to invade the genital ridges at week 6, as stated above.
