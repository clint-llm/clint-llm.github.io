Historically, Jacques Cousteau is credited for the first extreme altitude diving record in 1968 when he mounted an expedition to Bolivia and Peruâ€™s Lake Titicaca, searching for submerged Inca treasure at an altitude of 12,507 ft (3812 m). In 1982 a team led by Charles Brush and Johan Reinhard set a new record at the Lago Licanbur volcano in Chile at 19,400 ft (5900 m), and another team led by Nathalie Cabrol (SETI Institute/NASA Ames) at the same location in 2006. At the date of this publication, however, the highest recorded dive was at the Pili Volcano in Chile at 20,000 ft (6000 m) by Philippe Reuter, Claudia Henriquez, and Alain Meyes. The highest scuba dive in the continental United States was done in September 2013 by John Bali at the Pacific Tarn Lake in Colorado at 13,420 ft (4090 m).
