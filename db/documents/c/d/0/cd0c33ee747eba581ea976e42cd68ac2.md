Pre-operative planning and proper intra-operative execution is the key to successful scalp reconstruction. The surgeon should have good knowledge of scalp anatomy, hair physiology, skin biomechanics, andÂ available local tissue to allows for excellent aesthetic reconstruction. Nurses who look after these patients should be fully aware of the potential complications that can occur in the post-operative period. At the first sign of infection, vascular compromise or graft necrosis, the plastic surgeon should be notified. All this points to the necessity of an interprofessional team approach, to managing these cases. This interprofessional team includes surgeons, surgical nursing, and pharmacists in the event of post-procedure infection or prophylaxis. Such an approach best guarantees an optimal patient outcome.
