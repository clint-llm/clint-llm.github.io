Status epilepticus is a neurological emergency requiring immediate evaluation and management to prevent significant morbidity or mortality. Previously, status epilepticus was defined as a seizure with a duration equal to or greater than 30 minutes or a series of seizures in which the patient does not regain normal mental status between seizures. The Neurocritical Care Society guidelines from 2012 revised the definition to a seizure with 5 minutes or more of continuous clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity or recurrent seizure activity without recovery between seizures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of status epilepticus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of status epileptics.
- Describe the typical presentation of status epilepticus.
- Identify the treatment and management options available for status epilepticus.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the treatment of status epilepticus and improve patient outcomes.
