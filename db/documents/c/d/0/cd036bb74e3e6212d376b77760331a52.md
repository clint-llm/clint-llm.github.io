The cause of mycosis fungoides is unclear. The following are various hypotheses proposed:

- Genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, most commonly deletions and translocations involving several different chromosomes or chromosomal segments.

- Environmental and occupational exposure to solvents and chemicals has been implicated in the etiology of the disease.

- An infectious etiology that is of human T-lymphotropic virus Type 1 has been suggested, but conclusive evidence has still not been found.

- Cytokines such as IL-2 and IL-4 may play a role, as they show higher levels in patients with mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.
