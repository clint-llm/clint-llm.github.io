Colestipol is available to patients in two forms. It is available as an oral tablet or, in granular form, as a powdered suspension. The powdered suspension is also available in a flavored form to improve palatability. However, the flavored suspension must be taken with caution in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU), as it contains phenylalanine.

Patients with PKU must consult their healthcare provider before initiating therapy with a flavored colestipol suspension. Powdered suspensions of colestipol should be mixed with water or other fluids before ingestion to prevent inhalation or esophageal distress. Other medications, such as fat-soluble vitamins, should be taken 1 hour before or 4 hours after the administration of colestipol.

Colestipol tablets are recommended in doses of 2 grams to 16 grams per day. Therapy should be initiated at a dose of 2 grams per day.

Colestipol powdered suspension is recommended in doses of one packet to six packets per day. One packet contains 5 grams of colestipol.

- **Tablet**
- 1 g per tablet, oral

- **Powdered suspension**
