Acoustic neuroma may be treated by:

- Observation if small and in elderly patients with numerous comorbidities

- Stereotactic radiotherapy or

- Open craniotomy. The type of treatment depends on the surgeon experience and patient preferences

The main surgical approaches are:

1. Retrosigmoid: This is the workhorse approach in skull base surgery. It provides good access to the cranial nerves located in this region as well. Tumor of any size can be approached with the possibility of hearing preservation via this route.

2. Middle cranial fossa: This is also a hearing preserving approach that is mostsuitable for tumors with a dominant intracanalicular componentand a small cisternal component. The main disadvantage is the need fortemporal lobe retraction, which may produce postoperative seizures and venous infarct if the vein of Labbe is damaged.

3. Translabyrinthine: Suited for patients with large tumors and no serviceable hearing, The advantage is that facial nerve can be exposed early and protected and the cerebellum need not be retracted. But the access to the contents of jugular foramen and lower parts of the foramen magnum is limited.

After surgery, an MRI is required within 6-12 months to document the extent of tumor removal and serve as a baseline. The most common complications of surgery include injury to the anterior inferior cerebral artery, hemorrhage, cerebellar trauma, facial paralysis, hearing loss (the most common)and hydrocephalus.
