Nearly all acute hand amputations are the result of trauma.  Medical stabilization must be the first priority in the care of the patient with a hand amputation. Once stabilized, a timely evaluation and treatment plan is critical. The ultimate decision between replantation and revision amputation is dependant upon several factors, including injury mechanism and timing, access to care, medical comorbidities, and patient goals. No matter the treatment course, hand amputations are known to be devastating injuries with tremendous physical, emotional, and economic, and societal costs.
