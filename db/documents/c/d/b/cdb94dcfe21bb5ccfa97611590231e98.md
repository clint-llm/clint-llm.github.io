The tensor fasciae lata is mainly perfused by a deep perforating branch of the superior gluteal artery. The superior gluteal artery is a terminal branch of the internal iliac artery. The superior gluteal artery is the primary source of blood supply to the gluteus maximus muscle as well.

The fascia lata, as it travels anteriorly to medially an opening, is formed known as the saphenous opening. This patency of the fascia lata allows for the great saphenous vein to pierce the cribriform fascia and traverse through the saphenous opening. The great saphenous vein drains into the deep femoral vein bringing deoxygenated blood from the lower extremity.

The descending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery brings blood to the fascia lata, in particular, is perforated at the level of the thigh, proximal.
