Patients should routinely be educated on the risk versus benefit profile of corticosteroids, including the risk of corticosteroid-induced myopathy. Patients should be advised toÂ contact their provider if they notice weakness developing. Patients should be informed that physical activity can help prevent and mitigate the effects of corticosteroid-induced myopathy, and should be prescribed physical therapy as part of a preventive and treatment regimen.
