- Pentamidine is known to cause an elevation in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy.

- Other findings in pentamidine toxicity include - Hypotension, clinically apparent hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis, renal impairment, which can cause a rise in serum creatinine, cardiopulmonary arrest, and leucopenia.

- According to a previously published study, charcoal hemoperfusion has previously beenÂ employed as an antidote for overdose or toxicity.

- Due to the multi-organ toxicities caused by pentamidine, it is not a commonly chosen therapy except in conditions where other first or second-line agents have failed to respond.
