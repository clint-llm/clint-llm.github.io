Hypersensitivity to lamotrigine or its ingredients is the primary contraindication for the administration of lamotrigine.

Evaluating gender, age, and contraceptive use is essential when considering starting lamotrigine. While some studies in humans have not shown an increased risk for congenital malformations during lamotrigine therapy during pregnancy, animal studies have demonstrated that an increased risk exists. The drug is pregnancy risk factor C; animal studies have shown the risk for congenital malformations. Clinicians should recommend their pregnant female patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry.

- Lamotrigine is present in breast milk and is detectable in the blood of breastfed infants. Symptoms of lamotrigine in infants include poor feeding, drowsiness, rash, and apnea. These symptoms can improve with the discontinuation of lamotrigine. If the benefits outweigh the risks in treating epilepsy during lactation/breastfeeding, clinicians should consider monitoring infant lamotrigine levels.

- Consideration for other drugs' effects on glucuronidation merit consideration, as glucuronic acid conjugation primarily metabolizes lamotrigine.

- Drugs that induce lamotrigine glucuronidation include carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir, and primidone.

- Valproic acid inhibits lamotrigine glucouronidation.

- Concurrent use with central nervous system (CNS) depressants may increase the potency of CNS depression.

- Lamotrigine reportedly interferes with urine drug screening and can cause false-positive readings of phencyclidine.
