Since ocular hypotony can considerably harm the vision, surgeons, their support team, and the patient should take measures to avoid its occurrence following surgery. In glaucoma filtering surgery, surgeons should pay attention to the careful use of intraoperative antimetabolites.

Care should be taken to prevent antimetabolite contact with the conjunctival edges resulting in conjunctival thinning and bleb leaks. Placement of releasable sutures, which can be removed post-operatively, resulting in increased aqueous outflow, enabling titration of intraocular pressure, is an effective method to prevent early postoperative hypotony.

Releasable sutures have also been useful in preventing wound leaks and hypotony after vitreoretinal surgery.

A patient who suffers from postoperative hypotony from wound leak must understand the risk of infection from the leakage site and be prescribed topical antibiotics. Some antibiotics, such as topical aminoglycosides, induce conjunctival inflammation, stimulating wound healing and closure of the conjunctival defect. Furthermore, the patient should be given specific instructions to avoid direct physical trauma to the hypotonic eye. This can result in more damage to the eye, including globe rupture and intraocular hemorrhage. A protective eye shield is appropriate to cover the hypotonic eye during sleep.
