Safety procedures are required to minimize the introduction of static electricity, fuel and ignition sources into the hyperbaric environment, to decrease the risk of fire. Everyone inside must wear cotton or cotton blend sheets and scrubs. Oily substances and alcohol must be avoided, and ignition sources are not allowed. In rare cases, where the patient has difficulty equalizing their ears during the pressure change, myringotomy tubes may have to be placed.

Depending on the injury of the patient, dressing changes and wound debridement may be required before the patient enters the hyperbaric chamber. If patients require monitoring during the hyperbaric treatment, appropriate sensors will have to be applied and connected to pass-through connectors in the hull. If the patients require medications or infusions, those may need to be prepared for special infusion pumps. Good communication between the primary surgical service and the hyperbaric medical team is of the utmost importance.
