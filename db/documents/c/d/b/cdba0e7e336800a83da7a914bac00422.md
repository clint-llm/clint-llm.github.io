Treatment for alcoholic cardiomyopathy is directed towards source control.

The mainstay for treatment is complete abstinence from alcohol. Management should include providing patient resources and counseling.

Symptomatic management for patients with secondary heart failure and manage associated complications is warranted.

Some studies have suggested that even moderation of alcohol consumption similar outcomes as compared to abstinence.

Pharmacologic therapy should include goal-directed heart failure therapy as used in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction. This includes a combination of beta-blockers, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, diuretics, aldosterone receptor antagonist and angiotensin blocker-neprilysin inhibitor (if LVEF is less than or equal to 40%). The use of carvedilol, trimetazidine with other conventional heart failure drugs have been proven to be beneficial in some studies.

Some promising new treatments are targeting the pathways that are involved in the pathogenesis of ACM such as myocyte hypertrophy, cell necrosis and fibrosis, and oxidative stress; however, these are still under investigation.
