PML is a progressive and fatal disease. At present, the primary goal of treatment is to improve the chances of survival. Factors that improve survival rates include a low viral load of JC virus in PCR CSF samples, high CD4 count, and contrast enhancement on radiological imaging. Furthermore, in patients with AIDS, initiation of antiretroviral therapy has been known to improve survival rates. A robust adaptive cellular immune response is a good indicator of prolonged survival as evidenced by the presence of PML specific CTL lymphocytes in the serum of patients who have recovered from PML. Among transplant recipients who develop PML, it was found that those that underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation fared better with lower mortality rates and higher survival rates over patients who had undergone solid organ transplantation.

With respect to patients who develop natalizumab-induced PML, improved survival rates were noticed in patients with certain prognostic factors, which include younger age, low JC viral load, reduced neurological dysfunction prior to initiation of therapy, and an enhanced mass on contrast imaging.

In patients who develop PML-IRISÂ following antiretroviral therapy, administration of steroids and contrast-enhancing MRI imaging were good prognostic indicators for survival.
