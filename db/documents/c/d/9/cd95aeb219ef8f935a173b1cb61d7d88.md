To measure the PCWP, a catheter is inserted through a central vein (either femoral, subclavian, or internal jugular) and advanced into the superior or inferior vena cava to reach the right atrium. The internal jugular vein is the preferred access.

The location of the catheter can be determined by the waveform on the monitor or by measuring both the systolic and the diastolic pressure with the tip of the catheter. In the right atrium, both the diastolic and the systolic pressure are usually less than 5 mmHg (with mild variations). While in the right ventricle, the systolic pressure is about 25 mmHg, and the diastolic pressure remains similar to right atrial diastolic pressure (<5 mmHg). In contrast, the pulmonary artery systolic pressure is similar to the right ventricular systolic pressure in the absence of pulmonic stenosis, but the diastolic pressure increases to about 10 mmHg.
