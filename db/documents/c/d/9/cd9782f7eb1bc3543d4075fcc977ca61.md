JHR is a transient clinical reaction and therefore, does not have many specific histopathologic findings.Â Histopathologic findings in skin lesions during JHR show acute inflammatory changes (dilatation of small blood vessels and capillaries, dermal edema, perivascular and interstitial polymorphonuclear round cell, and leucocytic infiltration) along with the existing syphilitic pathology.
