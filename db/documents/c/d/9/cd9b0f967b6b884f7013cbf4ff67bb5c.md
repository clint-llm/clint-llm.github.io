The discovery phase of the pharmaceutics process involves establishing a receptor, enzyme, protein, RNA, DNA, or protein that modulates a biochemical process as a potential contributor to the pathophysiology of a disease process. They often base this on literature reviews of basic science investigating disease mechanisms. For example, the immune regulating receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 were implicated in reducing the immune system's response to cancer.

The chemical optimization and production phases focus on improving the drugs' drug and manufacturing characteristics found in the discovery phase. For example, with antibodies, this would include selecting the proper subtype of antibody to prolong its half-life in the body and enhance or suppress complement fixation or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Preclinical testing, pharmacology, and toxicology testing involve using models of the disease tested. These animal models often harbor close approximations of human diseases, such as human tumor implants in immune-incompetent mice (xenograft tumor models), or are a relatively poor approximation of human pathologies as the forced swimming test. Standard pharmacology models involving testing for cardiovascular, CNS, and renal effects are performed in in-vitro and in-vivo models such as I(Kr) potassium channel antagonism, and prolongation of the QT interval is assessed in telemetered dogs. These are often not required for targeted drugs such as antibodies. Toxicology testing involves standard protocols with doses and duration that extend beyond the expected human dosing (in animal lifetimes). These are often used to determine the first dose used in human trials and determine any particular toxicity concerns that will require monitoring in the early clinical trials.
