# Introduction

Myelin sheaths insulate the axons of nerves. These sheaths are a lipid-rich extension of the plasma membrane produced in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by Schwann cells and by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). The myelin sheath is regularly interrupted along the length of the axon by specialized regions called the nodes of Ranvier, which are necessary for the propagation of an action potential along the axon.

# Structure and Function

The nodes of Ranvier are characterized by short (1um), specialized regions in the axonal membrane that are not insulated by myelin.  Although it is bare of myelin at the node, the axon is in direct contact with the microvilli of the Schwann cells in the PNS, or with processes of astrocytes in the CNS (Figure 1).

The long, myelin-covered section of axon between nodes is the internode.  The purpose of the myelin sheath is to increase the speed of transmission by acting as an electrical insulator.  In non-myelinated axons, the action potential must propagate continuously along the plasma membrane.  Under myelin, there is increased resistance to movement of charges across the membrane, resulting in rapid propagation of the voltage signal within the axonal cytoplasm to the next node.  The action potential must be ‘amplified’ at each node by the influx of sodium ions as the voltage signal dissipates along the length of the myelinated axon.

The nodes of Ranvier, including adjacent regions, contain a high concentration of the structural proteins ankyrins, which are responsible for the anchoring of proteins to the axonal cytoskeleton.

# Embryology

During development, nodes form relatively densely along the axon, then the internode length increase as the embryo grows and the axons stretch along their length.  In humans, peak myelination occurs in the first year of life, beginning in the peripheral nervous system, followed later by myelination in the brain and spinal cord. The largest diameter axons are also the first to be myelinated.

The assembly process of nodes of Ranvier requires 1) the expression of specific structural proteins within the axon and 2) interactions with glial signals.  First, the neuronal expression of ankyrin (ankG) structurally interacts with voltage sodium channels and other nodal proteins.  Secondly, sodium channels concentrate within axonal membrane adjacent to new myelin sections, termed heminodes.  The ion channels, restricted in movement by the paranodal SpJ, are clustered as two neighboring heminodes merge to form a node of Ranvier.  In the CNS, there is also a redundant, independent mechanism of node formation by glial signals.  Node formation in the CNS is also mediated through interactions with oligodendrocyte-secreted proteins such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans.

# Surgical Considerations

Disruption of myelin sheath integrity leads to disruptions in nerve conduction and, if severe enough, complete conduction block. Minor acute damage to peripheral nerves will often resolve unaided.  Conduction velocity may still be slower after recovery because Schwann cell-mediated remyelination occurs with thinner myelin and with nodes more closely spaced along the axon.

# Clinical Significance

Disruption of the nodes of Ranvier and myelin may also occur as a result of autoimmune disorders, including Multiple sclerosis (MS), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), and lupus.  Injuries to the white matter such as during neonatal hypoxia or following traumatic brain injury may also result in subsequent demyelination.

Multiple sclerosis characteristically presents with multiple lesions to the white-matter that develop across time.  Although reduction of conduction velocity, or complete conduction block, due to demyelination is the primary pathology associated with MS, the long-term progression of the disease symptoms also correlates with axonal damage caused by direct immune interactions with nodal/paranodal proteins.  For example, disruption of paranodal septate-like junctions due to loss of NF155 disrupts conduction by permitting extracellular current flow and the inappropriate redistribution of potassium channels into the node.

Guillain-Barre syndrome is an immune-mediated neuropathy that is mediated by antibodies that cross-react with endogenous proteins enriched in peripheral nerves, such as the ganglioside GM1 or members of the neurofascin adhesion molecule family, such as NF155.

Age-dependent changes to the molecular distributions of nodal and paranodal proteins may be implicated in cognitive decline.  In aged rodent and primate nerves, there is an increase in the inappropriate distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels into the nodal and paranodal regions.
