Water toxicity can occur due to numerous etiologies but is challenging to diagnose as it presents with vague symptoms of altered mental status, disorientation, confusion, nausea, and vomiting which may resemble psychosis. It may be misdiagnosed on presentation, due to the variability of symptoms. To avoid more serious outcomes like seizures and coma early detection is vital. Untreated cases may also lead to death.
