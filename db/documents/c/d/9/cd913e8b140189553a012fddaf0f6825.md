Specific nerve blocks in the anterolateral abdominal wall can provide regional anesthesia by infiltrating local anesthetic around the relevant nerve. As such, the transversus abdominis plane block (between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles) is used to anesthetize the thoracoabdominal, iliohypogastric, and ilioinguinal nerves that run in this plane.

An indirect hernia repair may require the manipulation and visualization of the superficial inguinal ring, which puts the ilioinguinal nerve at risk. The nerve enters the inguinal canal here and can subsequently be damaged, resulting in a sensory alteration of the scrotum, root of the penis, labia major, and inner thigh.

The intercostal nerves can be crushed or severed during thoracotomies. This can result in subsequent thoracoabdominal nerve dysfunction, typically causing chronic pain and rectus muscle paresis.

Surgical incisions over the anterolateral abdominal wall pose the risk of nerve damage. Depending on the location of the incision, different nerves can be affected. Pfannenstiel incisions can damage the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, while paramedian and subcostal incisions are more likely to damage the thoracoabdominal nerves.
