Radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) is contraindicated in the following:

- Pregnancy

- Breastfeeding

- Carcinoma with no iodine uptake

- Graves ophthalmopathy (moderate to severe)

- Severe thyrotoxicosis

- Vomiting

- Diarrhea

The radioactive substance can pass through the placenta and may cause definitive thyroid damage and irreversible mental retardation to the developing fetus. Contraceptive use is a strong recommendation to females of childbearing age who are planning radioactive iodine therapy. A negative pregnancy test should be a consideration before initiating therapy as pregnancy and breastfeeding are absolute contraindications.
