Human trafficking, a human rights violation, is a pressing public health concern that transcends all races, social classes, demographics, and gender. No population is exempt from the ever-present threat of traffickers. Healthcare providers come into contact with individuals being trafficked, usually in the emergency department. Trauma-informed care acknowledges patients’ life experiences to deliver effective care, improve patient engagement, minimize the risk of continued trauma, and reduce missed opportunities. Identifying signs of trauma, recognizing verbal and nonverbal cues, assessing a victim’s response, and referring to appropriate team members are key components of effective trauma-informed care. Missed opportunities to identify, inform, and empower these victims perpetuate this physically and psychologically debilitating disease.
