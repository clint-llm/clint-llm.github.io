The mediastinum is an anatomical space between the lungs that houses the thymus, heart, large blood vessels, lymph nodes, nerves, and portions of the esophagus and trachea. It is bound anteriorly by the sternum, posteriorly by the thoracic vertebrae, superiorly by the thoracic inlet, inferiorly by the diaphragm, and laterally by the pericardial and mediastinal pleurae. It divides into anterior, middle, and posterior compartments. Mediastinal masses encompass a broad histopathological spectrum, ranging from benign to malignant. Fifty percent of mediastinal masses occur in the anterior compartment, the most common of which are thymoma, teratoma, thyroid goiter, and lymphoma. Middle mediastinal masses typically include congenital cysts, while posterior mediastinal masses are often neurogenic tumors, such as schwannomas. The focus of our discussion will center on anterior mediastinal masses.
