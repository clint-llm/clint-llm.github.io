The MYC family is composed of regulator genes and oncogenes that encode transcription factors that regulate the cell cycle. Translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8 is the hallmark of BL, occurring in approximately 95% of cases. The t(8;14)(q24;q32) is the most common translocation in BL, occurring in 70% to 80%.

In addition to the characteristic translocation of c-MYC, many gene mutations have been identified, including truncating mutations of ARID1A, amplification of MCL1, truncating alterations of PTEN, NOTCH, and ATM; amplifications of RAF1, MDM2, KRAS, IKBKE, deletion of CDKN2A, and CCND3 activating mutations.

In endemic BL, EBV latent proteins prevent apoptosis in B-cells containing the C-MYC translocation via EBNA1 protein, BHRF1 protein, EBER transcripts, vIL-10, BZLF1, and LMP1. The prevention of apoptosis likely gives rise to the malignant clone of B-cells. EBV is implicated in promoting genomic instability, telomere dysfunction, and DNA damage. Plasmodium falciparum prompts the reactivation of latent EBV. Additionally, P. falciparum can activate toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) which induces immunoglobulin-MYC translocations. Cytidine deaminase allows for B-cells to switch from IgM expression to the expression of other immunoglobulin subtypes. Aberrant expression of cytidine deaminase is correlated with C-MYC translocation. The enzyme is not detected in HIV-positive patients that do not have Burkitt lymphoma.
