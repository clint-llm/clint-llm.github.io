Physicians, advanced practice nurses, nursing personnel, and midwives must be aware of what constitutes normal versus abnormal labor. Without proper education, skills, and strategies, appropriate management cannot occur, and poor outcomes become likely for birthing mothers and their neonates. Discerning patterns of abnormal labor will allow for proper intervention and management. This will decrease morbidity and mortality and improve patient outcomes. This activity characterizes normal versus abnormal labor and highlights the critical role of the interprofessional birth team in providing optimal care and counseling to the birthing mother and the infant.

**Objectives:**
- Describe when the 3 stages of normal labor begin and end.
- Identify potential reasons for abnormal labor and potential interventions that can be done.
- Explain how the uterine activity is assessed and identify the adequacy of contractions as well as tachysystole during labor.
- Define labor arrest in both latent and active stages of the first phase of labor.
