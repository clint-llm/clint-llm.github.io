Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal aneuploidy characterized by meiotic nondisjunction. The phenotypic holoprosencephaly and midline fusion aberrancies are related to a defective fusion of the prechordal mesoderm. Patau syndrome has a mortality of over 95%. This activity addresses this condition and provides clinicians with the information to evaluate and manage this condition when it presents.

- Review the factors relating to the prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 13.
- Summarize the management options available for trisomy 13.
