**The Gleason Scoring System**

The Gleason prostate cancer score has been shown, over time, to be the most reliable and predictive histological grading system available. Developed initially by pathologist Dr. Donald Gleason in the 1960s, it has stood the test of time and has been universally adopted for all prostate cancer pathological descriptions.

The Gleason scoring system is based on the microscopic arrangement, architecture, or pattern of the glands in the prostate rather than on the individual cellular characteristics that define most other cancers. The pattern is given a grade from 1 to 5, with 1 representing an almost normal microscopic glandular pattern and appearance, to 5 where no glandular architecture remains, and there are only sheets of abnormal cancer cells.

The Gleason score always contains two grades in the form of numbers and then a total score. The predominant Gleason grade pattern is always the first number, 1 to 5, and the second number would be any secondary or minor pattern, also graded 1 to 5. So the absolute best and lowest risk Gleason score would be Gleason 1+1=2, and the worst high-grade pathology would be Gleason 5+5=10. In real life, these histological extremes are rarely seen.

If only one Gleason grade or pattern is seen, then the Gleason score would consist of the same Gleason grade repeated and added together as in Gleason 3+3=6, which happens to be the most commonly found Gleason score.

Low-grade tumors would be any Gleason score of 3+3=6 or less.

Intermediate-grade cancers would be a Gleason score of 3+4=7. This would mean that most of the tumor was Gleason grade 3, but a smaller portion was the more aggressive Gleason grade 4.

A Gleason score of 4+3=7 or higher would be considered high-grade cancer.

While architecture or pattern, as described by the Gleason score, is certainly a major component of the histological diagnosis of prostate cancer, it is not the only criterion. For example, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane carboxypeptidase that exhibits folate hydrolase activity which is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues. Its presence would suggest prostate cancer.

Other significant microscopic histological features and prognostic indicators of prostate cancer would include:

- Infiltrative glandular growth pattern

- Absence of a basal cell layer

- Atypically enlarged cell nuclei with large nucleoli

- Increased mitotic figures

- Intraluminal wispy blue mucin

- Pink amorphous secretions

- Intraluminal crystalloids

- Adjacent High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (High-Grade PIN)

- Amphophilic cytoplasm

- Cribriform pattern

- Perineural invasion

- Neuroendocrine cells

The number of positive biopsies also has a prognostic value. In a study of 960 intermediate-grade (Gleason 3+4=7) prostate cancers followed for at least four years, 86% of patients with less than 34% positive biopsies demonstrated a stable PSA compared with only 11% of patients who had more than 50% of their biopsies found to be positive.

Cancer volume is another important prognostic parameter, but it is difficult to measure accurately with available technology. Prostatic MRI is currently our best instrumentation for estimating tumor volume.

Perineural invasion is somewhat helpful in predicting extracapsular tumor extension and may be associated with slightly higher tumor aggressiveness, but studies are conflicting on its clinical usefulness.

**The "New" Gleason Scoring System**

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new classification system based on clinical experience with the old Gleason scoring system that suggested very little difference in clinical outcomes in lower Gleason score patients but somewhat different ones in the higher grades.  The following is a summary of the "New" Gleason system:

- Grade Group 1 (Gleason Score less than or equal to 6): Only individual discrete well-formed glands

- Grade Group 2 (Gleason Score 3+4=7): Predominantly well-formed glands with a lesser component of poorly-formed, fused, or cribriform glands

- Grade Group 3 (Gleason Score 4+3=7): Predominantly poorly-formed, fused, or cribriform glands with a lesser component of well-formed glands

- Grade Group 4 (Gleason Score 8): Only poorly-formed/fused/cribriform glands; or predominantly well-formed glands with a lesser component lacking glands; or predominantly lacking glands with a lesser component of well-formed glands

- Grade Group 5 (Gleason Scores 9 or 10): Lacks gland formation (or with necrosis) with or without poorly formed, fused, or cribriform glands

In clinical practice, Grade Group 1 is histologically considered "low grade," Grade Group 2 is "intermediate grade," and Grade Group 3 or higher is "high grade" disease.

**The National Comprehensive Cancer Network**

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is a consortium of 31 major academic cancer centers in the United States, most designated as Comprehensive Cancer Centers by the National Cancer Institute. Some of the institutions involved include the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University, the Cleveland Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Roswell Park, MD Anderson, and the Dana-Farber/Brigham Cancer Center, among others. They periodically review and set guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and management of all stages and types of cancers via a consensus process. Their recommendations are considered the definitive, authoritative standard guidelines for cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment in the United States.

**Pre-Malignant Lesions**

**High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (High-Grade PIN)**

The Gleason system is a very good way of grading prostate cancers, but there are situations where the microscopic appearance of prostatic tissue is not malignant even though the individual cells appear very abnormal and dysplastic, similar to how most cancer cells in other tissues would typically appear.  In high-grade PIN, cells will usually show very large nucleoli, but marked pleomorphism is not present.  The prostatic ducts and glandular patterns appear normal with a normal peripheral basal cell layer. This condition is considered pre-malignant and is called high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (high-grade PIN). A low-grade PIN is considered benign and is usually not reported.

First described in 1969, only the high-grade PIN lesions are clinically significant as they are closely associated with prostate cancer. For example, 80% to 90% of all radical prostatectomy specimens will demonstrate high-grade PIN on careful examination. These findings make rebiopsy or at least close observation reasonable and necessary in cases where the only high-grade PIN is initially found.

Recent studies suggest that the actual risk of finding invasive or high-grade prostate cancer in men with high-grade PIN is lower than previously thought but still relatively high at 24%. A repeat prostate biopsy at 6 to 12 months has long been recommended, but additional options are now available. These include saturation prostate biopsies, MRI prostate imaging, genomic testing, and MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided biopsies.

Some have suggested that these patients be followed with an active surveillance program, similar to what is used in patients with proven, low-grade prostate cancer. With a lack of consensus on the recommended follow-up, each case needs to be evaluated and treated individually after a full discussion with the patient of the risks, benefits, and limitations of each alternative.

**Atypical Small Acinar Proliferation (ASAP)**

Also considered a premalignant lesion, atypical small acinar proliferation indicates that there are small foci of atypical prostatic glands that are suspicious for cancer, but there is insufficient overall evidence of malignancy to formally diagnose cancer. As first described by Montironi et al. in 2006, it is described as "a focus of small acinar structures formed by atypical epithelial cells."

There is a reported 40% to 50% chance of finding overt prostate cancer on repeat biopsy, so the consensus recommendation is to repeat the prostatic biopsy with or without MRI image guidance, 3 to 6 months after the initial diagnosis of atypical small acinar proliferation.

Recently, it's been suggested that in some cases of high-grade PIN or atypical small acinar proliferation, it may be possible to use newer genomic testing, alterations in MRI prostate imaging, and PSA level changes to identify patients who can be closely monitored as an alternative to mandatory repeat biopsies. While not yet the standard of care, the opportunity to avoid re-biopsies in up to 2/3 of these patients is very attractive and appears to be safe, at least on a preliminary basis, in selected patients at this time.

It is generally thought that the presence of both high-grade PIN and atypical small acinar proliferation in the same patient increases the overall risk of developing a malignancy, but this has not been definitively proven.

**Atypical Adenomatous Hyperplasia (Adenosis)**

First described in 1941, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia is defined as a well-circumscribed nodule or lobule of small prostatic glands that are closely packed. What sets it apart from a diagnosis of prostate cancer is the presence of basal cells and the absence of significant cytologic atypia. There is some controversy regarding whether atypical adenomatous hyperplasia is a premalignant lesion or not, but the consensus suggests that it has relatively low malignant potential by itself and does not routinely warrant a repeat biopsy.
