Persistent corneal epithelial defects result from failure of re-epithelialization and complete healing within two weeks of corneal epithelial insult, even after conventional treatment. Though not commonly encountered, they pose a management challenge as they are often refractory to standard supportive treatment. Persistent epithelial defects necessitate prompt and vigilant treatment to avoid associated potential complications, such as infection, vision loss, corneal scarring, melting, and even perforation. This activity reviews the etiopathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, current and novel management options for persistent epithelial defects. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the persistent epithelial defect.
- Identify the risk factors for developing a persistent epithelial defect.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of persistent epithelial defect.
- Review the management options for the persistent epithelial defect.
