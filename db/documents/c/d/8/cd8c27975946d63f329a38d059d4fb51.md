The mechanosensory neurons are periphery neurons that stretch to the spinal cord to connect to the central nervous system. All of the low threshold mechanoreceptors come from precursor neural crest cells in early development. These transient, multipotent cells move from the dorsal neural tube to the periphery in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in parallel with skin development. The skin originates from the ectoderm, and the mesoderm, and these axons from the DRG grow to meet the skin. Neurons that specialize early express Ngn2; these include A-beta and A-delta afferents. Later development expresses Ngn1, creating C afferents.
