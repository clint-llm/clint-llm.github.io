Most clinicians should have the knowledge and ability to evaluate and treat patients for acute pain syndromes and use opioid analgesics on a short-term basis. Those patients that require long-term pain control may receive a referral to a pain specialist.

All clinicians who regularly prescribe opioids should be familiar with opioid use disorder treatment and be aware of local referral options. They should seek a referral to specialists when use disorder, pain, psychiatry, or mental health assistance is needed.

If a patient has a use disorder, providers should refer the patient to both an addiction/use disorder and pain management professional. Unfortunately, clinicians specializing in pain and use disorders are rare, and it is difficult for most clinicians to find appropriate referrals.

Documentation is of particular importance when opioid analgesic prescribing is involved. Clinicians should maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date records, including copies of all prescription orders for all controlled substances, opioid contracts, instructions given for use, and the name, telephone, and address of the pharmacy dispensing them. Accurate medical records demonstrate that the prescription and management of an opioid analgesic prescription was medically necessary. Thorough medical records protect the prescriber and the patient.
