Simulation-based training has long had recognition as a necessary adjunct to traditional methods of teaching. They are most useful in the medical field where they develop the skills of new personnel without putting patients at risk, while at the same time, increasing their performance and retention of knowledge, especially at times of extreme stress.

Simulation-based training has helped improve patient outcomes and helped streamline the medical response to disasters; this is affected by improving communication and coordination in multi-disciplinary teams. Other factors that have led to the success of simulation-based training include the development of evidence-based medicine, with the implementation of standardized protocols, evaluation of the shortcomings, and program outcomes. SBTs also allow for repetitive exposure and practice, which would not only be extremely slow and tedious using traditional methods but may not be possible with regards to disaster response.
