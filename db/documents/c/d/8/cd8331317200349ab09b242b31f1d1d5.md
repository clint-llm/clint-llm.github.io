Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia results in high bladder pressure leading to renal reflux effects, bladder damage, and various types of dysfunctional voiding. Up to 50% of patients with DSD suffer complications if no intervention is done. A metanalysis revealed varying success rates for different treatment modalities: botulinum A injections into the external sphincter (reported success rates = 64% to 100%) or bladder (44% to 76%), urethral stents (9% to 91%), sphincterotomy (48% to 85%), transurethral incision of the bladder neck (82%), pharmacologic therapy (44% to 76%), and sacral neuromodulation (60%).
