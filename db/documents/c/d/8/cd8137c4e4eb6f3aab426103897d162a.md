Although rare, VKH must be considered in cases of eye pain and associated headache and/or meningeal signs.

The therapy goals are not only to reduce clinically apparent disease but also to decrease the progression of the complications of VKH disease through proper identification and early treatment.

Corticosteroids have an established role in treating VKH, but data show increased recurrence and complications when used as monotherapy and without IMT.
