The differential diagnosis of pigmented purpuric dermatitis includes nummular dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, cutaneous vasculitis, Kaposi sarcoma, and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Cutaneous vasculitis can often be distinguished clinically as palpable purpura with variable cutaneous necrosis, whereas most pigmented purpuric dermatitis lesions are not palpable and tend to present most commonly as purpuric macules and patches, although papules and plaques may occur.Â The clinical history often is helpful as most lesions of pigmented purpuric dermatitis are not pruritic, in contrast to dermatitis, which is typically pruritic. The presence of lower extremity edema favors venous stasis changes.

Early stages of CTCL (mycosis fungoides) may resemble pigmented purpuric dermatitis clinically. There also have been reports of patients initially presenting with pigmented purpuric dermatitis who later declare as CTCL.
