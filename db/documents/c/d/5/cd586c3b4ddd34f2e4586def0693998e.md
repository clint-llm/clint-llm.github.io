**Thyroid Antibodies in Euthyroid Pregnant Women**

Studies have shown an overall prevalence of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO Ab) in women of childbearing age is 6% to 20%.

At present, there is not sufficient evidence to warrant supplementation of levothyroxine in euthyroid pregnant women with TPO Ab positivity. A small dose of LT4 25 to 50 mcg daily can be considered in TPO Ab-positive euthyroid pregnant women with a prior history of miscarriage.
