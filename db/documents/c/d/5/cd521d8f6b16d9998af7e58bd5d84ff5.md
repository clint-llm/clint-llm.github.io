SABAs rarely have any adverse effects when used in the usual doses, but higher and systemic doses can have similar outcomes to sympathetic stimulation on the body; the most common is tremor. Other adverse effects include anxiety, palpitations, and tachycardia. Elevated SABA doses can also cause lactic acidosis, decreased serum potassium and magnesium levels, and hyperglycemia.

LABAs can cause cardiac dysrhythmias and muscle cramps in normal doses in long-term use, especially when taken as the sole management drug for asthma without steroids. There is evidence of tolerance in the case of long-term use of LABAs.

Systemic exposure to B2 agonists can cause systemic vasodilation, potentially leading to hypotension and can trigger headaches. Hypotension may also cause hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatching in the lung.

Regular B2 agonist use in the treatment of asthma in the absence of corticosteroids may deteriorate in the chronic stage of the disease, as long-term tolerance to the antagonistic effect of B2 agonists is documented.

B2 receptor-related side effects caused by beta-blockers include Raynaud phenomenon, hypoglycemia during exercise, muscle cramps, and increased airway resistance.
