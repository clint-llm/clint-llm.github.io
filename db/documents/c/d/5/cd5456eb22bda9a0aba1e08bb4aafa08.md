Trazodone is an antidepressant that works by inhibiting both serotonin transporter and serotonin type 2 receptors. It is a triazolopyridine derivative. Trazodone inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and blocks the histamine and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. It also induces significant changes in 5-HT presynaptic receptor adrenoreceptors. The full spectrum of trazodone’s mechanism of action is not fully understood, explaining its off-label uses. Trazodone is in the category of SARI drugs (serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors), with other members being phenylpiperazine, etoperidone, lorpiprazole, and mepiprazole.

Clinical studies have shown trazodone to be comparable in efficacy to other drug classes, such as TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants), SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor) in treating major depressive disorders. Also, trazodone has better tolerance than second-generation SSRIs, which are highly associated with insomnia, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.

Furthermore, a recent study on human astrocytes showed trazodone helps decrease inflammatory mediator release and helps normalize trophic and metabolic support during inflammation of neurons, which is associated with major depression.
