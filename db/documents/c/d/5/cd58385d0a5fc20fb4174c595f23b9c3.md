Immediate evaluation of suspected colloid cysts includes the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) of emergency medical management if the patient may be at risk for acute hydrocephalus and neurologic deterioration. A thorough neurologic exam is important to identify any neurologic deficits, but imaging remains the cornerstone of evaluation for patients with a colloid cyst.

A colloid cyst is typically not visualized on plain radiographs of the head, and thus, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head are more important imaging studies.

**CT Head**

CT of the head can be quickly obtained to identify acute hydrocephalus.  On CT imaging, the colloid cyst is typically a circular, hyperdense mass at or near the foramen of Monro. Rarely are colloid cysts isodense, hypodense, or calcified.

**MRI Brain**

MRI is the preferred method for imaging colloid cysts. On T1 sequencing, a colloid cyst can have variable characteristics and be either hyperintense, isointense, or hypointense. With gadolinium administration, the colloid cysts should not enhance. Rarely a peripheral enhancement will be noted around the colloid cyst, which most likely represents a vessel stretched over the colloid cyst.

On T2 sequence imaging, most colloid cysts are hypointense. They may also have a heterogeneous T2 signal. Low signal intensity on T2 imaging may suggest the contents of the colloid cyst are more viscous and thus harder to aspirate. On FLAIR sequencing, most colloid cysts have a similar intensity to the surrounding CSF. Most colloid cysts have decreased signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging.
