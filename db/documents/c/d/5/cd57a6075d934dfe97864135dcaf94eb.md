EEG activity reflects the temporal summation of the synchronous activity of millions of cortical neurons that are spatially aligned. Analyzing and interpreting the EEG is both an art and science. The normal EEG is extremely diverse and has a broad range of physiological variability. This activity illustrates EEG normal waveforms, and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care of patients who are evaluated by EEG.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the temporal summation of the cortical neurons in an EEG.
- Discuss why a systematic approach is necessary in performing an EEG.
- Explain how EEG waveforms are characterized.
- Outline normal EEG waveforms, and explain the role of the interprofessional team in providing care of patients who are evaluated by EEG.
