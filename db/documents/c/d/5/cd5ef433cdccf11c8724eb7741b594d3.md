X-rays and MRI are not usually done for tinnitus unless there is an unexplained difference in hearing and balance in the ears.

An audiogram is a hearing test measuring hearing levels to determine hearing loss. The patient is asked to match which of the tones matches their tinnitus. The audiologist introduces that sound as to volume, and the patient estimates how loud they hear their tinnitus. Hearing via the bone of the ear is tested and compared with the hearing via the earphone called an air-bone test. If the patient hears better with the bone test, this suggests a condition called otosclerosis which is treatable. Patients with otosclerosis, in whom the stapes fail to move well, can have surgery that corrects the otosclerosis and restores air conduction. In some patients, tinnitus is relieved. In others, tinnitus remains or becomes worse.

The audiologist measures how long tinnitus is relieved by masking tone. The longer the tinnitus is inhibited, the better the prognosis.
