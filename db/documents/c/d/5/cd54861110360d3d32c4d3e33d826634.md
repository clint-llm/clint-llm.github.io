The location of the artery of Adamkiewicz is very important for many surgical procedures since lack of flow to this vessel can cause ischemia to the spinal cord (discussed in the Clinical Significance section). Several surgical subspecialties must consider its location, including vascular surgery (thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair), orthopedics (thoracolumbar spine surgery), neurosurgery (resection of intramedullary tumors), as well as urology and pediatric surgery (retroperitoneal dissections).

Anatomical evaluation of the artery of Adamkiewicz is often performed preoperatively via computerized tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography to avoid neurological complications, and there are several documented cases of change in surgical approach if the artery of Adamkiewicz and planned approach are on the same side. Care must be taken to distinguish the artery of Adamkiewicz from the anterior radiculomedullary vein, which is very similar in shape and may follow a very close course to the artery of Adamkiewicz. To avoid confusing the 2, it is imperative to trace the artery from the aorta (termed the “continuity technique”). Of note, preoperative imaging may be difficult in patients with bony abnormalities (scoliosis, osteophytes, narrowing of intervertebral foramen), or patients with extensive arterial disease.
