Ileus often presents in postoperative patients characteristically present with obstipation and the intolerance of oral consumption. Ileus primary results from an active slow wave but the absence of spike-wave activity. While slow waves get produced by the pacemaker cells of the GI tract, they don’t cause contractions by themselves. An action potential, as seen by a spike-wave on top of the slow-wave, is needed for the slow-wave to reach a threshold low enough for the propagation of a full action potential, and consequent stimulation of various GI tissue. In this condition, there is continuous inhibitory neural activity and potential peritoneal irritation from the stasis of food.

Infectious diarrhea, which can be caused by many organisms, has a general theme of rapid, powerful peristalsis that results in a reduced transport time leading to an increased number of bowel movements, as well as a lack of time for absorption and water extraction to occur, leading to bulky and watery stools.

Achalasia, characterized by a perpetually contracted lower esophageal sphincter (LES), is due to the absence or disruption of the ganglionic cells in the myenteric plexus. As these nerves are responsible for esophageal sphincter relaxation and esophageal propulsion, the LES is unable to relax, and food cannot pass through to the stomach.

Hirschsprung disease is a failure of neural crest cells, the precursors to the myenteric plexus, to migrate to the intestines; this leads to constriction of the affected segment, as well as the failure of the intestines to propel food forward. This failure causes a buildup of food in the affected area as well as intestinal distension, and the inability to produce a bowel movement, often seen as a failure to pass meconium.

Diffuse esophageal spasm which can present as dysphagia, heartburn, and regurgitation, is primarily caused by an aberrant response to esophageal distension. Instead of relaxing in response to swallowing and consequent esophageal distension, the esophagus is unable to do so and remains in the contracted state, preventing proper peristaltic movement.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is a chronic problem resulting in the contents of the stomach to reflux back into the esophagus due to an incompetent LES that fails to stay in its contracted state leading to damage of the esophageal epithelium. This condition can have many complications, the most severe of which is disruption of the normal mucosa, and the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. GERD is commonly exacerbated by specific foods and drinks such as certain proteins, alcohol, and caffeine, as they enhance gastric secretion significantly by stimulating chemoreceptors in the mucosa of the stomach, leading to increased release of HCl by the parietal cells, and an increase of the acidity of gastric contents.
