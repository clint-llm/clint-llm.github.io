Differential diagnoses of DLE include granuloma faciale, tinea faciei, cutaneous tuberculosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, lymphoproliferative disorders, and sarcoidosis. DLE-induced scarring alopecia can be confused with lichen planopilaris, tinea capitis, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. Hypertrophic DLE may be confused with keratoacanthoma, squamous cell cancer, hypertrophic lichen planus, and prurigo nodularis.
