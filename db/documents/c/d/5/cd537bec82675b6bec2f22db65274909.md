Neonates may not display any symptoms for the initial few months of life, as such complicating the diagnosis of HIV. Studies have suggested that children may remain asymptomatic until 3-5 years of age. In untreated children, the most commonly exhibited manifestations of HIV infection include but are not limited to: recurrent bacteremia, increased opportunistic infections, frequent diarrhea, cardiomyopathy, hepatitis, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, oral candidiasis, cancers, and central nervous system manifestations, such as growth delay, delayed cognition, low IQ, and frequently global developmental delay.

CDC strongly recommends testing of all pregnant females for HIV as part of the standard prenatal care. This testing proves to have a better prognosis of the neonate. However, due to a lack of adequate healthcare access in certain geographical areas of the world, the unknown HIV status of pregnant females leads to inadequate treatment and poor outcomes of the neonate.
