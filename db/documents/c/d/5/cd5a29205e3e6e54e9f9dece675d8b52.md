Treatment includes the release of pupil block, if present, by means of iridotomy, iridectomy, or lens extraction. If the intraocular pressure cannot be controlled medically after releasing any pupil block, surgery may be required. Because these eyes may be more likely to develop aqueous misdirection, precautions must be considered when undertaking surgery.

**Medical Treatment**

- Aqueous suppressants: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor topical/oral (dorzolamide, brinzolamide acetazolamide, methazolamide), beta-blocker (timolol, levobunolol), alpha-agonist (brimonidine tartrate, apraclonidine).

- Increase trabecular outflow: The effectiveness of medications with this mechanism of action (rho kinase inhibitors, pilocarpine) may be reduced as the trabecular meshwork is obstructed due to peripheral anterior synechiae.

- Increase uveo-scleral outflow: Prostaglandin analogs (latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost, tafluprost); however, these may increase inflammation so if there is any chronic inflammatory etiology leading to the chronic closed-angle it may be avoided.

**Laser Treatment**

- Iridotomy: This can be performed using an Nd-Yag laser with or without argon laser pre-treatment

- Argon Laser Peripheral Iridoplasty: This may be beneficial in reducing appositional angle closure caused by non-pupillary block mechanisms, such as plateau iris syndrome.

- Micropulse trans-scleral cyclophotocoagulation

- Continuous transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. This has traditionally been reserved for refractory glaucoma with poor visual potential.

- Endocyclophotocoagulation.

**Surgical Treatment**

- Phacoemulsification/lens extraction

- Surgical iridectomy

- Trabeculectomy

- Phacoemulsification in a patient with less than 180 degrees of angle-closure

- Phacoemulsification with trabeculectomy in more than 180 degrees of angle-closure

- Phacoemulsification with endocyclophotocoagulation

- Phacoemulsification with viscogoniosynechiolysis with endocyclophotocoagulation

- Glaucoma drainage device
