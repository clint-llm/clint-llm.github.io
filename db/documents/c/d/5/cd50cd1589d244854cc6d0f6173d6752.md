Primary CMV infection in immunocompetent patients is usually asymptomatic. The virus reactivation in these patients is typically asymptomatic. However, immunocompromised patients develop symptoms in different body organs, including CMV colitis. Antibody response to CMV infection results in raised specific immunoglobulin (IgM) antibodies reflecting an acute or relapsing-infection pattern. Raised IgM antibody levels eventually decrease over the next 3 to 6 months and may take up to 12 to 24 months. The persistence of IgM antibodies could be related to concomitant immunosuppression. Immunoglobulin IgG antibodies are produced within a week of IgM antibodies. Patients who develop CMV IgG antibodies are considered “seropositive.”

The gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon, then the esophagus, are common sites of CMV infection. The role of CMV in patients with inflammatory bowel disease is a topic of debate; whether the CMV reactivation is responsible for the exacerbation of the disease in patients with established inflammatory bowel disease, or the reactivation is a consequence of the disease or treatment, and the possibility that CMV acts as an innocent bystander.
