The pathophysiology of bullosis diabeticorum is not completely clear and appears to be multifactorial. In a study by Bernstein and colleagues, authors demonstrated that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes have a marked reduced threshold to suction blister development compared to age-matched normal controls, with a highly significant difference (p<0.01).

Moreover, it has been postulated in the literature the role of disturbances in calcium, magnesium, and carbohydrate metabolism.
