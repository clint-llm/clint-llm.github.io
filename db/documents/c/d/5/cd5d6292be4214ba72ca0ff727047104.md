Neural tube defects are a spectrum of congenital anomalies that include cranial defects and open or closed spinal dysraphism. Open spinal dysraphisms or spina bifida aperta are often seen during the physical examination as visible lesions and include malformations such as myelomeningocele. On the other hand, closed spinal dysraphisms or spina bifida occulta are non-visible lesions, usually with no apparent signs recognized during physical examination. Thus, patients are often asymptomatic with no future complications and usually, do not require treatments. Myelomeningocele generally occurs during embryonic development due to incomplete closure of the spinal neural tube during the first month of pregnancy. It ultimately leads to an exposed neural tissue or meninges with a fluid-filled sac that protrudes at the affected vertebral level.
