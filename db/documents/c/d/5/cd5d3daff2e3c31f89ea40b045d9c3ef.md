Nadolol is a medication used to treat angina and hypertension, which are significant risk factors for the development of coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and a host of other cardiovascular conditions. Nadolol belongs to the class of beta-blocker medications. Off-labeled it is used for the management of atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias due to congenital long QT syndrome, ventricular premature beat, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia, gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage prophylaxis in patients with liver cirrhosis, and thyrotoxicosis. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, adverse drug reactions, toxicity, management, and contraindications for using nadolol as a valuable agent in managing hypertension, angina, and other conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of nadolol.
- Identify the most common adverse effects associated with nadolol therapy. 
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients on nadolol therapy. 
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team members to enhance care delivery and improve outcomes for patients receiving nadolol.
