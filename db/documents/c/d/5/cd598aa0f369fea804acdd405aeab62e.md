**Surface Anatomy**

It is essential to understand the topography of upper eyelids. The eyelid skin crease is where the levator aponeurosis attaches to the subdermal tissues via anterior branches: immediately above this is the eyelid fold which usually "hides" the upper eyelid skin crease. Between the skin crease and the upper eyelid margin is the tarsal platform. Ideally, the ratio of the tarsal platform to the distance between the upper lid crease and the brow should be 1:1.618 (Golden ratio or phi).

Temporal hooding is a common finding because of a combination of temporal brow ptosis and lateral dermatochalasis. Assessment will allow the surgeon to determine the need to reposition the brow tail or if direct lid surgery alone can address such temporal hooding. The degree of dermatochalasis can be more pronounced in certain diseases like thyroid eye disease, following trauma, the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, blepharochalasis, xanthelasmata, angioneurotic edema, amyloidosis and elastolysis (Cutis laxa).

From the inferior border of the brow to the upper eyelid margin, the distance should be no less than 20 mm. Often this needs to be 25 to 30 mm, depending upon age, gender, and position of the brow. Finally, the lash curve needs to be assessed to ensure a healthy and attractive lash curve is preserved or created with appropriate upper eyelid surgery.

**Cross-Sectional Anatomy**

**Eyelid Lamellae**

At the level of the tarsal plate, the upper eyelid has an anterior lamella of the upper eyelid skin and orbicularis oculi muscle. Upper eyelid skin measures about 850 microns in thickness and does not significantly become thinner with age. However, the eyelid skin does lose its elasticity with age. Pretarsal skin tends to be smooth in youth but will acquire lines with age related to loss of elastin and also weakened attachments to the skin from the levator aponeurosis. The posterior lamella at this level is composed of the tarsal plate and tarsal conjunctiva.

Above the tarsal plate, the anterior lamella is made of skin and orbicularis muscle with a fine layer of fat under the orbicularis. The middle lamella is made of the orbital septum, and the posterior lamella of the levator aponeurosis, Muller’s muscle, and conjunctiva.

**Tarsal Plates**

The upper tarsal plates span the upper eyelids becoming the ligamentous medial and lateral canthal tendons. The upper tarsal plates are about 10 mm in height although it has been shown that there is a statistical difference in the average tarsal height of Caucasians (10.1 mm) when compared to Japanese tarsal height (8.2 mm).

**Orbital Septum**

The orbital septum is a multi-layered structure that arises from the arcus marginalis and inserts on the inferior levator aponeurosis. Its insertion is lower in Asian eyelids. Behind the orbital septum is the preaponeurotic fat. The medial septum over the nasal fat is thinner than the rest of the septum: this covers the nasal upper eyelid fat pad. The septum is the surgeon's friend as the levator is protected by the preaponeurotic fat, in front of which is the orbital septum.

**Fat Pads**

The upper eyelid has 2 fat pads which are separated by a loose septum. The medial fat pads of the upper and lower lids are paler than the other fat pads. The more yellow color of the central fat pad in the upper eyelid may be because of higher amounts of beta-carotene and lutein in this fat compared to the medial fat pad.

**Levator Aponeurosis**

The levator palpebrae superioris muscle, innervated by the superior division of the third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve), becomes an aponeurosis soon after turning downwards at the Whitnall’s ligament. The aponeurosis inserts into the anterior surface of the upper third of the tarsal plates with insertions also going to the skin which form the eyelid crease.

**Muller’s Muscle**

Muller’s muscle is supplied by the sympathetic system. It arises from the levator muscle and inserts into the superior border of the tarsal space. Just above the tarsal plate, lies the superior peripheral marginal arcade on Müller’s muscle.

**Lacrimal System**

The lacrimal gland consists of the palpebral lobe and the orbital lobe. Both these glands send ductules into the superolateral fornix where the aqueous secretions are released. The lacrimal gland is not usually visible but may become prominent as a "lateral fat pad" if it prolapses forwards.

**Canthal Tendons**

The medial canthal tendon is a complex structure with superior and inferior limbs as well as reflections anteriorly and posteriorly.

The lateral canthal tendon attaches the tarsal plates to the lateral orbital rim with 2 main limbs: the anterior limb attaches to the anterior orbital rim and fuses with the lateral orbital condensation. The posterior limb inserts into the Whitnall's tubercle 3 to 4 mm behind the orbital rim, just above the horizontal. A further condensation inferiorly attaches at about 45 degrees to just inside the inferolateral orbital rim, about 3 to 4 mm behind the rim and has been called a "lateral tarsal strap." There is some debate about whether this is a truly distinct structure, as opposed to the infero-lateral retinaculum that is seen below the lateral canthal tendon and the structure that is properly released whenever elevating the lateral lower eyelid attachment.
