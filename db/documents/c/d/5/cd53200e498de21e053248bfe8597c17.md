There are several pre- and postnatal maturational processes that serve to modulate action potential formation and propagation. Below, we will specifically address changes in ion concentration, ion channel density, and ion channel location. Additionally, the speed of action potential propagation along myelinated axons is increased throughout development as myelin thickens, and the distance between nodes of Ranvier lengthen.

During embryonic development, the intracellular concentration of sodium significantly decreases.

Early in development, action potentials are relatively slow-rising and elongated. However, a developmental increase in sodium channel expression produces a more rapid depolarization, while a concurrent increase in potassium channels results in a shorter duration of action potentials.
