Despite the lack of formal guidelines, a collaborative care approach towards myopia prevention, detection, and management is required. Given the rising prevalence of myopia, which develops from childhood, public health needs to advocate for policies that encourage outdoor activity. Screening for myopia in schools or other forums requires a team of individuals such as trained technicians or nurses and a system in place for referral to an eye care provider for evaluation. Ophthalmologists optometrists manage treatment decisions such as the initiation of pharmacological or optical therapy to halt myopic progression.

Additionally, optometrists and ophthalmologists play an important role in screening for pathological myopia and its associated complications. Collaboration between glaucoma, vitreoretinal and medical retinal specialists ensures patients receive specialized care when necessary. Occupational therapists and optometrists specializing in low vision play an important role in visual rehabilitation, helping individuals maintain an independent living and maximize their vision when it is limited due to their disease.
