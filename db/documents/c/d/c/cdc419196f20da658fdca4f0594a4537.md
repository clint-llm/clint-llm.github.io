Colostrum, the initial milk produced by the breast during pregnancy, can be expressed during the third trimester and begins to be secreted in larger volumes after birth. Lactogenesis II begins at 2 to 3 days postpartum and is often called transitional milk. This milk gradually changes from colostrum to mature milk. The quantity of milk increases rapidly. The immunoglobulins and proteins decrease, and the lactose, fat, and calories increase. Lactogenesis III is mature milk and replaces the transitional milk. This milk is more bluish-white and not as thick. Mature milk contains 20 kcal/ounce and nutrients specific to meet the needs of the growing infant. It continues to have immunoglobulins and other antibacterial components.
