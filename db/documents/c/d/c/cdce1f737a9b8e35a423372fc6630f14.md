The gestational sac is the first structure seen in pregnancy by ultrasound as early as 4.5 to 5 weeks of gestational age, but it is only 97.6% specific for the diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy. Early pregnancy obstetric ultrasound is essential in differentiating between intrauterine pregnancy, pregnancy of unknown location, and ectopic pregnancy as well as assessing pregnancy viability. This activity reviews the interpretation of early pregnancy obstetric ultrasound findings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and providing follow up care for patients diagnosed with a pregnancy of unknown location or uncertain viability.

**Objectives:**
- Describe embryonic development and sonographic features of early pregnancy between 5 and 8 weeks of gestation and their specificity for establishing the diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy. 
- Review the technique for performing a comprehensive first-trimester two-dimensional obstetric ultrasound.
- Summarize currently used criteria for establishing early pregnancy failure diagnosis. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with a diagnosis of pregnancy of unknown location or uncertain viability.
