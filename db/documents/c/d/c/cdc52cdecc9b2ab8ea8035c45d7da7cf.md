Internal degloving injuries are usually associated with high-energy trauma and can be devastating. More commonly known as Morel-Lavallee lesions, when in the pelvic or thigh region, a degloving occurs when the superficial fascia separates from the deep fascia in a shearing mechanism. This not only disrupts the vascular and lymphatic channels that span these two layers but creates a potential space for fluid collection. The hemolymphatic fluid that collects is a nidus for infection and may put the overlying skin at risk for necrosis. Management depends on lesion size, severity, and associated injuries.
