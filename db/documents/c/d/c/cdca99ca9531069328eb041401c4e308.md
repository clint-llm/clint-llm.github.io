Zidovudine has a high frequency of several side effects that limits its use.

Side effects include:

- Nausea/vomiting (18.8 to 89%)

- Diarrhea (7 to 78%)

- Headaches (15 to 38%)

- Myalgias

- Insomnia

- Bone marrow suppression (has been reported as high as 45%)

- Peripheral myopathy

- Elevated liver enzymes

- Lactic acidosis

- Hepatotoxicity

Drs. Jain and Mayer conducted an editorial review in which they examined studies that involved zidovudine for HIV-1 nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis. Their research found that 11.7 to 16.5% of patients stopped taking zidovudine due to side effects and that side effects were reported as high as 54.5% in those that did complete a 28-day regimen that included zidovudine.

Long-term treatment with zidovudine can cause a modest elevation of liver enzymes. The elevated liver enzymes do not require dose adjustments due to the elevations being asymptomatic and transient in most cases. Rare cases of acute cholestatic hepatitis, severe acute fatty liver with lactic acidosis, and noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Some of the hepatotoxicity has been attributed to zidovudine causing inhibition of the mitochondrial gamma polymerase leading to mitochondrial depletion and dysfunction.

Bone marrow suppression seen with zidovudine includes neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia. Anemia requiring blood transfusions was reported to be as high as 19.7% with the use of zidovudine.
