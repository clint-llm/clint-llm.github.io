GLP-1 belongs to a class of molecules known as “incretins,” molecules that stimulate a decrease in blood glucose levels. The release of these molecules depends on the oral intake of glucose and other nutrients. This contributes to the “incretin effect,” a phenomenon by which oral ingestion of glucose induces a greater increase in the release of insulin as opposed to an intravenous load of glucose.

GLP-2 is involved in proliferative effects on small intestine mucosa.

Glicentin shows some glucagon-like activity, while the roles of oxyntomodulin and GRPP in humans are unclear at present.
