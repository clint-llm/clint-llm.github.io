Protocols are available for the initiation of antithrombotic and anticoagulation. If antithrombotic therapy is initiated, nurses will monitor vitals at least every 15 minutes and provide neurological assessments hourly. Nurses may also play a role in short-term and long-term monitoring, especially in closely identifying signs/symptoms of bleeding. Nurses can also follow-up with patients post-hospital discharge. All patients should have baseline labs collected before the initiation of anticoagulation. For warfarin monitoring, baseline INR is measured, as well as liver function tests and renal function. For other OAC monitoring, baseline complete blood count, liver function tests, prothrombin time, aPTT, renal function is appropriate to measure and follow-up annually and when clinically indicated.
