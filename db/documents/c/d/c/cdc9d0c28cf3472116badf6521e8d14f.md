Adenoiditis occurs when there is inflammation of the adenoid tissue resulting most commonly from infection, allergies, or irritation from stomach acid. Adenoiditis rarely occurs on its own and is typically involved in a regional disease process such as adenotonsillitis, pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, or laryngopharyngeal reflux. Continual irritation may lead to adenoid hypertrophy, which is responsible for many of the complications of adenoid disease. Adenoiditis can be classified as acute or chronic. This activity reviews the presentation and management of patients with adenoiditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline how to diagnose a patient with adenoiditis.
- Describe medical and surgical treatment considerations for patients with adenoiditis.
- Summarize potential complications of adenoiditis.
- Explain how well-coordinated interprofessional teams can improve outcomes for patients with adenoiditis.
