Homeostasis of intraocular pressure is of vital importance to overall eye health and function. Disruption of this fine balance may have devastating consequences, contributing to the pathogenesis of glaucoma, uveitis, and choroidal detachment.

The definition of ocular hypertension (OHT) is intraocular pressure that is two standard deviations above the mean IOP (16 mmHg) with normal visual fields and no detectable glaucomatous damage.

Primary open-angle glaucoma is a chronic degeneration of the optic nerve characterized by the  American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) as showing evidence of optic nerve damage from optic disc abnormalities, and retinal nerve fiber structure abnormalities, or reproducible visual field defects without other explanations.

Anterior uveitis, an inflammation of the anterior uveal tract, frequently leads to derangement of intraocular pressure homeostasis. In some cases, inflammation of the pars plicata of the ciliary body can result in the ciliary body to shut down, resulting in IOP that is below the normal range. In other cases, inflammation of the anterior uveal tract disrupts aqueous outflow, resulting in elevated IOP. In this case, prolonged elevation in IOP will result in glaucomatous optic neuropathy (inflammatory glaucoma).

In the setting of decreased intraocular pressure or hypotony, serous choroidal detachment is a distinct danger. Increased transmural pressure secondary to decreased IOP results in transudation of serum into the suprachoroidal space. The result is a progressive detachment of the retina and choroid.
