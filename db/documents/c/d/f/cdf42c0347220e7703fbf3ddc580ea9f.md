Inherited bone marrow failures occur secondary to germline mutations passed down from parents or arising de novo. Most are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, reticular dysgenesis) while a small subset is inherited in X-linked recessive (dyskeratosis congenita, 2% of FC) or autosomal dominant patterns (Blackfan-Diamond anemia, reticular dysgenesis).
