The function of the arteries of the heart is to provide oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium to allow for contraction of the heart, which causes blood to circulate throughout the body. The arteries of the heart are also capable of autoregulation and can control the amount of blood flow supplying the heart according to its need. The coronary arteries receive the most blood flow during diastole because this is when the heart is relaxed, and they received the least blood flow during systole because this is when the myocardium contracts are decreasing the blood flow through the coronary arteries.
