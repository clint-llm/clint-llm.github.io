Radical inguinal orchiectomy is the standard procedure for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Trans scrotal orchiectomy or biopsy of the testicular mass is contraindicated for the risk of tumor seeding of the lymphatic drainage. Spinal or general anesthesia may be used. An inguinal incision is made to expose the external and internal iliac canal. External iliac fascia is opened, revealing the spermatic cord. The spermatic cord is controlled to stop retroperitoneal lymphatic and venous drainage of tumor cells. After that, deliver the testis from the scrotum and ligate vas deferens and spermatic arteries separately. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is done if necessary. Reapproximate the external oblique fascia and close the skin in standard fashion. Conduct a follow-up study by staging and referring the patient for appropriate adjuvant therapies.
