Patients who are on teriparatide therapy should be monitored by serum calcium measurements at one month of treatment, with subsequent follow-up intervals according to serum calcium level and the physician’s discretion. If hypercalcemia is present, the dose of supplemental calcium should be reduced first; if it does not return to baseline, treatment should be administered every other day; if it persists, treatment should be discontinued, and the patient should undergo a diagnostic investigation to determine the cause of hypercalcemia.

BMD requires evaluation 1-year post first dose.

Before starting treatment, serum and urinary calcium should be measured because both hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria constitute contraindications to recombinant PTH therapy.
