With numerous medications readily available for a variety of medical conditions for inpatient and outpatient settings, epinephrine is not often a topic of discussion until a patient exhibits severe medical deterioration. Because of its physiologic effects, epinephrine is a common agent used in "code" situations, including ventricular fibrillation and PEA. These situations require the expertise and skills of the entire interprofessional healthcare team comprised of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, EMTs, and other health professionals. During these circumstances, there is a team leader, usually an attending clinician, who oversees and makes medical decisions for the patient. The clinician, along with the help of other healthcare professionals and students, interprets EKGs and indicates if and when epinephrine is required. From an emergency medical technician standpoint in prehospital settings, epinephrine comes already prepared for administration, versus other hospital settings where the person administering the drug must draw it with a syringe. Interprofessional communication is vital during these times, so all healthcare professionals are aware of the necessary steps required to resuscitate the patient.

The proper dosage of medication must be administered within an appropriate period to limit the risk of toxicity; thus, there should be a pharmaceutical consult on these cases. Communication among all team members must be fluid, as all members function as an interprofessional team, not as individuals operating in silos of expertise. Researchers recently conducted a randomized, double-blinded trial in the United Kingdom whose primary endpoint was to examine the survival rate at thirty days of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, with secondary outcomes to study the rate of survival until hospital discharge with favorable neurologic outcome. The study included more than 8,000 patients; roughly half were given parenteral epinephrine or saline placebo, with appropriate standard care. The conclusion was that there was a higher thirty-day survival with epinephrine as opposed to saline placebo. However, there was no improvement in neurologic outcome.

Interprofessional management of epinephrine therapy will yield the best patient outcomes with the fewest adverse effects. [Level 5]
