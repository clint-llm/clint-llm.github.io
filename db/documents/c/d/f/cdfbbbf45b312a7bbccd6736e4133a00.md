While most limb salvage treatment is focused on limiting amputations, especially major amputations (above the ankle, requiring a prosthetic for ambulation), amputation may also be optimal for some patients to allow for participation in rehabilitation with a prosthesis. However, retrospective studies have demonstrated that only 65% of patients with below-the-knee amputation and 29% of above-the-knee amputation amputees were ambulatory at one year.
