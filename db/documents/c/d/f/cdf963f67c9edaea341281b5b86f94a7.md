Laparoscopic and robotic approaches are the preferred options for adhesiolysis.

Adhesiolysis is typically done with sharp dissection using scissors with or without an energy source. Hook electrocautery is more common in the minimally invasive approach. Caution is essential to avoid the lateral spread of thermal effects. More recently, bipolar electrosurgical devices such as Ligasure or Ultrasonic shearing devices such as Harmonic scalpel have been used efficiently with less blood loss and faster operating times. It is crucial to avoid deviating from the normal planes and creating new planes using these devices. Clips or ties (in the open approach) may be necessary to tie vessels. Serosal tears of the bowel or capsular injuries require individual attention to achieve hemostasis and maintain the integrity of the organs. Seprafil is occasionally used to minimize adhesions development. It is a bioabsorbable membrane made of hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose.

In several studies, chemically modified sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose absorbable adhesion barrier is safe and aid in decreasing the incidence and severity of future adhesions.
