Several diagnostic tools are available to assess the presence of trigger points with individual advantages.

- **Ultrasound imaging:**Ultrasound is often used to analyze the thickness and consistency of muscle nodules and the sliding of the various tissue layers. Some studies analyzed TPs using ultrasound elastography by doppler variance imaging while inducing vibrations with a handheld vibrator. Myofascial trigger points appear as focal and hypoechoic nodules, with decreased vibration amplitude. (indicates increased stiffness and modified blood supply compared to normal tissue)

- **Micro-dialysis:** This method is used to measure inflammatory mediators in TPs such as bradykinin, substance P, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, CGRP, interleukin 1 beta, serotonin, interleukin 6 and 8, and norepinephrine.

- **Electromyography:**This is used to evaluate the electrical activity of active and latent TPs (test is done both at rest and during active motion). Generally, the TPs have increased electromyographic activity with synergistic muscle contraction compared to the normal muscles.

- **Infrared thermography:** This tool is used to assess skin temperature in TPs areas. At present, it is used as an auxiliary test due to conflicting results.

- **Magnetic resonance elastography:**At present, there is no consensus on the validity of results obtained from MRE because of its low sensitivity.
