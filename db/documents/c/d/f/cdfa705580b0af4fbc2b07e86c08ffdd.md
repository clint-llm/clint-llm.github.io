Polymerase chain reaction procedures begin with the collection of a small sample of DNA in a test tube.

The specific temperature is determined based on the physical and chemical properties of the specific primers used in the solution.

In order to initiate the functionality of DNA polymerase, double-stranded DNA is mandatory for the occurrence of replication.

Following 30-40 cycles, repetitive cycles eventually taper off due to the limited capability of the reagent as well as other contributing factors such as accumulation of pyrophosphate molecules, excessive self-annealing, and the presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample.

Proteinase K has the propensity to break down Taq polymerase.

Following the aforementioned steps of PCR, the next step includes agarose gel electrophoresis using ethidium bromide.

There are various advantages of using PCR in basic and biomedical sciences. Over the years, it has acquired a renowned reputation making it the gold standard procedure for a multitude of reasons.

**Real-time PCR**

Real-time PCR is an alternative method to examine small segments of DNAÂ  via the shortened duration of the cycles, elimination of post-PCR procedural handling steps, implementing fluorogenic labels as well as efficient detection of emissions.

The disadvantage of real-time PCR in comparison to conventional PCR is that it requires opening the system to track the progression of amplicons.

**Reverse Transcriptase-PCR**

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a procedure that uses mRNA for DNA amplification via DNA polymerase.

To date, Real-time PCR and RT-PCR are employed simultaneously to assess the quantitative difference in gene expression among various samples.

Samples for PCR testing may be acquired from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, nostril, and oral cavity.
