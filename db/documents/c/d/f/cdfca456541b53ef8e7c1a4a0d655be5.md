Since the main vessel that supplies the labial arteries with blood is the facial artery. Damage to the facial artery or any location proximal to the labial arteries results in compromised blood flow. Compromised of blood flow to the labial arteries can come in many forms. Neoplasm, trauma, and infection can cause occlusion or reduced blood flow to the labial arteries; this may result in a decrease in metabolic activities of the tissues in the mid-face region.

The Kiesselbach plexus contains a branch of the superior labial artery. If this plexus is damaged, the anterior nasal septum may bleed. Anterior nasal bleeds usually come from the Kiesselbach plexus. These bleeds tend to occur in children due to mechanical nasal trauma. Fortunately, anterior nasal bleeds are controllable with compression, packing, or chemical cauterization.
