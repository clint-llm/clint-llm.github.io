Children have smaller axial lengths than adults. The emmetropization process starts as early as two years of age, gradually progresses to myopia, and eventually develops into emmetropia by 14 years. Hyperopia occurs when the axial length of the eye at birth is 18 mm, which increases to 23 mm by the age of 14 years, resulting in a myopic shift of 15 D. However, consecutive corneal flattening and lens thinning compensate for this myopic shift, leading to emmetropia.

Conversely, children predisposed to myopia have a large axial length at birth, which supersedes the emmetropization process, resulting in rapid progression to myopia during childhood. However, the progression slows during young adulthood and plateaus by the age of 18 years. However, the progression of myopia continues until the age of 25 years in a few individuals. After 25 years of age, any progression can be attributed to lens thickening, resulting in a myopic shift.
