There have been some studies done to highlight the etiologies and risk factors associated with a hamstring injury. All the studies tend to suggest hamstring injury has a multifactorial etiology. Interaction among various risk factors is of paramount significance when considering the etiology of this type of muscle injury. A previous hamstring injury, older age, and peak quadriceps torque are strongly associated with the risk of a hamstring injury. Ethnicity, particularly African and Aboriginal origin and a higher level of competitiveness, have also been found to be associated with a higher incidence of a hamstring injury.****

A university study performed by eliminating the previous history of a hamstring strain concluded that high-speed running and maximum stretch of the hamstring during contact sports, hurdle jumping, falling, or dancing are associated with an increased risk of an injury.****In a Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) study analyzing the risk of hamstring injury in professional soccer players, previous hamstring injury had a significant association with increasing the future hamstring injury while age didn't show significant association. Injury risk decreased in goalkeepers compared to the outfield players, injury decreased in away matches compared to the home matches, and more injury rates were seen during the regular season compared to the pre-season.

The British Medical Journal published an article with a prospective study done in 100 professional soccer players, which showed functional asymmetry of the muscles predisposed them to a higher risk of sustaining a hamstring injury.****Likewise, high-intensity training sessions, a higher level of competitiveness,****positions in play that demand more running (e.g., wide receiver in American football) are associated with more hamstring injuries.****
