Central venous catheters (CVC) are frequently used in critical care units, hemodialysis units, and oncology units for the administration of intravenous fluids, medications, blood products, parenteral nutrition, vasoactive medications, hemodialysis, and hemodynamic monitoring. Unfortunately, the presence of indwelling CVCs increases the risk of the formation of thrombi, emboli, and infection than patients with peripheral catheters by 200%. This activity outlines and reviews the care of patients who have an indwelling central venous catheter and the role of the interprofessional team in taking care of it.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors associated with central venous catheter insertion.
- Describe evidence-based patient cleansing and skin preparation techniques.
- Explain evidence-based central venous catheter dressing change recommendations.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with central venous catheters.
