The sense of vibration is perceived and conducted to the brain via integumentary and nervous systems. Skin is involved in the conduction of distortion from the environment to the external capsule of PCs in the dermis, and from the central neurite of PCs, the neuronal signal transmits via the dorsal column-medial lemniscus to the VPL nucleus of the thalamus. From the VPL nucleus, the final transmission is to the somatosensory area of the cerebral cortex.
