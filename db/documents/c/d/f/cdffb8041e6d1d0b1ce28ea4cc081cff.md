A host of intracardiac complications can stem from infective endocarditis. Acute valvular incompetence can lead to symptoms of heart failure and occur in around one-third of cases. This can occur secondary to acute valve perforation or from the compromise of the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles. Mitral or tricuspid valve regurgitation can lead to atrial enlargement and the subsequent emergence of atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular dysrhythmias as well. Less commonly, intracardiac abscesses (14%) and atrioventricular blocks (8%) emerge.

Peripheral embolization can also have far-reaching extracardiac complications. Right-sided vegetation can lead to arterial emboli that manifest as disseminated pulmonary abscesses, pneumonia, empyema, or focal regions of pulmonary infarctions. Neurologic sequela constitutes the most severe and prevalent extracardiac complications, impacting 15% to 30% of all cases.

Less common complications include acute renal failure stemming from either immune-mediated glomerulonephritis or focal infarction secondary to occlusive emboli. Splenic infarcts and abscesses, especially in the setting of S. aureus infection, can also occur from infected emboli. Acute mesenteric ischemia and subsequent bowel necrosis and perforation is a feared complication of arterial embolization.
