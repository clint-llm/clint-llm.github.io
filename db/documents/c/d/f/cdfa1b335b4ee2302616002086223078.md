Proper patient selection is critical to avoid injury and ensure the efficacy of the treatment. Critical aspects to keep in mind when considering the use of lumbar HVLA are the indications and goals of treatment. HVLA is typically applied to treat acute or chronic low back pain when making a specific lumbar diagnosis. Lumbar osteopathic diagnosis follows many of the same principals as the diagnosis of other parts of the spine (Fryette's laws).

The most fundamental way to diagnose the lumbar spine involves direct palpation to assess the posterior aspect of the transverse processes. After the provider determines the facet orientation in a neutral position, the spinal level in question may be placed into flexion and extension via direct manipulation of the spine or, more fundamentally, by patient positioning. The flexion/extension portion of the diagnosis is determined by which movement results in greater neutralization of the spinal segment.

This method describes the most classic means of diagnosing a type 2 dysfunction or dysfunction at one specific level. Type 1 dysfunctions involve multiple spinal segments that side-bent and rotated in opposite directions, generally involving three or more segments. These methods of diagnosis are subject to inter-evaluator bias, though training can improve consensus between providers.
