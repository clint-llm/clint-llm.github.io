PLDs are severe injuries to the wrist, and the patient should be counseled accordingly. Closed treatment has been shown to have inferior outcomes to open treatment. Apergis et al. reviewed 28 patients with PLD and found that the 8 treated with closed reduction and casting had fair-to-poor outcomes at a six-year follow-up.

Radiographically, 71% of patients had persistent unsatisfactory films, and 56% had identifiable post-traumatic arthritis, which was unassociated with poor clinical outcomes.
