Patient education is of extreme importance in preventing the disease, especially in the context of the lack of an effective treatment. Patient education should focus on efforts to prevent the contamination or consumption of date palm sap. The WHO also recommends avoiding exposure to bats and pigs and avoiding exposure to bat-bitten fruits or raw date palm sap. Protective clothing is recommended for people involved in the slaughter of animals. Human-to-human transmission during an outbreak can be contained by limiting exposure and the use of personal protective equipment. Contact tracing and quarantining potential contacts form a large part of an outbreak response.
