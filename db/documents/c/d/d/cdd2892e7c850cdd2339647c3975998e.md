**A successful scenario must be clean and concise, including:**

- Education goals and objectives

- Intended outcome

- Critical actions checklist

- Simulation set-up

- Case narrative

- Scenario flow diagram with branch points

- Instructor notes

- Debriefing plan

**Additional steps for scenarios:**

- Design with a story-board or a scenario builder template.

- Simulation scenario design is best completed in a stepwise fashion focusing on intended learners, goals and objectives, gaps to fill, level of fidelity, feedback, and didactics.

- The goal of an educational scenario is to make it challenging enough to be engaging, but not so challenging that it is frustrating. Know your audience.

- Dry run/rehearsals are key to success.

- Allow enough time for debriefing sessions; this is the most important aspect, and simulation without debriefing solidifies rather than corrects mistakes and misconceptions.

- Use feedback for the learners and participants to modify and fine-tune scenarios for future success.
