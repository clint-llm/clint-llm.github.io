Complications include severe hemorrhage or sepsis from an incomplete septic abortion. Prompt surgical management is indicated when the patient is unstable. It is also important to rule out ectopic pregnancy, presenting with vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal and/or pelvic pain.

Patients can present with different forms of shock, including hemorrhagic, septic, and cervical. Infection following an incomplete abortion is low. In low-income countries where females had surgical management of incomplete abortion, the infection rate was 0.1% to 4.7%, whereas it was only 0.1% to 0.5% in high-income countries. Infection is secondary to retained products of conception and can be the result of various bacteria, the most common being genital flora (group B strep, B. fragilis, and E. coli).
