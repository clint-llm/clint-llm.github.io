As mentioned previously, the RN is subdivided into the RNp and the RNm. Both of these neurons are arranged in a somatotopic distribution, with the upper limb corresponding with the dorsomedial region, and the lower limb correlating with the ventrolateral portion.

It is important to distinguish the subsections of the red nuclei because each possesses a unique neuronal pathway, and therefore dictates a separate neurologic function. For example, among quadrupedal animals, the RNm closely mirrors the pyramidal tract when animals navigate through obstacles and perform various coordinated extremity movements.****As mentioned previously, the RNm is largely rudimentary in adult humans (and therefore bears a lesser neurologic role), most likely due to the development (and functional redundancy) of the corticospinal tract as well as the pyramidal system.

In contrast, theÂ RNp provides an important connection between the motor and premotor cortices as well as the cerebellum, and inputs directly into the inferior olivary nucleus.

In summary, the parvocellular division of the RN is particularly prominent in the adult human brain and may play a role in cognitive-motor function, while the magnocellular RN only demonstrates functional relevance in early development through primitive movements, and becomes less functionally significant with aging.
