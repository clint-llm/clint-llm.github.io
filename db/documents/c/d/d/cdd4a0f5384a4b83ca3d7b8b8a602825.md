The exact prevalence of McArdle disease is not precisely known and appears to range from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 200,000 in the United States. The variation between the prevalence according to genetic data and the prevalence according to diagnosed cases is attributable to the delay in the making of a diagnosis. One study analyzed gene frequency and next-generation sequencing data to report the true prevalence of the disease among populations. The results of that study revealed that the disease is much more common than previously thought, and has a prevalence of 1 in 7,650 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1/5,362-1/11,108). An additional method used by the same study looked at the two most common mutations and recorded a prevalence of 1 in 42,355.

In some areas of the USA, such as the Dallas/Fort Worth area, the prevalence of McArdle disease on the basis of the genetic data is reported to be 1/100000.

In terms of gender, in McArdle disease the following ratios of men to women have been noted:

- Spain 55:45

- Italy 65:35

- UK 50:50

In terms of age, most McArdle disease cases present in the second or third decade of life. Wolfe et al report a unique precedent of McArdle disease manifesting in a 73 years old patient.
