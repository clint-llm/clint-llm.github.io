German scientists identified Treponema pallidum as the agent that causes syphilis in 1905. One year later, a test to diagnose this infection was developed. Its genome was sequenced in 1998. Treponema genus is a spiral-shaped bacteria with a rich outer phospholipid membrane that belongs to the spirochetal order. It has a slow metabolizing rate, as it takes an average of 30 hours to multiply.

T. pallidum is the only agent that causes venereal disease. The other T. pallidum subspecies cause non-venereal disease that is transmitted via non-sexual contact: Treponema pertenue causes yaws, Treponema pallidum endemicum causes endemic syphilis, and Treponema carateum causes pinta. All the treponematoses have similar DNA but differ in their geographical distribution and pathogenesis.

The only host for the organisms is humans, and there is no animal reservoir. Syphilis is considered a sexually transmitted disease as most cases of syphilis are transmitted through vaginal, anogenital, and orogenital contact. The infection can rarely be acquired via non-sexual contact, such as skin-to-skin contact, or via blood transfer (blood transfusion or needle sharing). Vertical transmission occurs transplacentally, resulting in congenital syphilis.
