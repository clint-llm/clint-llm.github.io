Electrodiagnostic testing, which includes electromyography and nerve conduction studies, can be used to confirm the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy, locate the location of pathological ulnar nerve compression and differentiate between mononeuropathy, polyneuropathy, plexopathy, and radiculopathy. This activity describes the invaluable role of electrodiagnosis in ulnar neuropathy and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with ulnar neuropathy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in ulnar neuropathy. 
- Describe the nerve conduction findings in a patient with ulnar neuropathy.
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with ulnar neuropathy.
- Outline the importance of communication among the interdisciplinary team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with ulnar neuropathy.
