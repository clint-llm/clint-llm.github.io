Meteorism, also known as tympanites, is characterized by the accumulation of gas in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Gas may cause the sensation of bloating or distension and often leads to discomfort. Modification of eating habits and avoidance of certain triggers may help to alleviate many of these symptoms. This activity reviews the causes and presentation of meteorism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the cause of meteorism.
- Describe the pathophysiology of meteorism.
- Explain the investigation of a patient with meteorism.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by meteorism.
