There are a few concerns regarding the waveforms in EEGs. Firstly, the choice of the reference electrode should be such that it cancels out the normal waveforms and amplifies only the pathological ones. It must be remembered that an EEG is influenced by all electrical activity occurring both remotely and locally; however, the closest electrical activity would be the most prominent influencer. The reference electrode should be placed in a location where it captures all the interfering waveforms as well. The next concern for the reference electrode is that there must be a significant potential difference to facilitate the charge movement without acceleration. This means that a reference electrode placed too close to the pathological site would essentially have the same potential as the active electrode, making the recording not useful for interpretation.
