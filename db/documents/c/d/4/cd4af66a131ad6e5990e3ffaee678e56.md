The clinical presentation of rotational vertebral artery syndrome varies from patient to patient. Typically, they will have a history ranging from transient ischemic attacks to devastating strokes of the posterior circulation that are evoked by head rotation and generally resolve with derotation of the neck. Most commonly, patients report dizziness, syncope, impaired vision/nystagmus, nausea, Horner syndrome, and other motor and sensory deficits that occur with head rotation. Unfortunately, the reported clinical findings most common are not specific to bow hunter's syndrome but rather are commonplace in disorders of the neurovestibular system.
