Ranitidine is contraindicated in patients who have previously experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to ranitidine or any of the product components. Small case series and analyses demonstrate conflicting results regarding cross-sensitivity among H2-receptor antagonists; caution is advised.  Due to differences and similarities between the chemical structures, there is speculation that some H2 blockers have less risk of cross-reactivity than others.

Furthermore, patients with any history of acute porphyria should avoid ranitidine because it may trigger porphyric events.

Clinicians urge patients to seek professional medical care and contraindicate the over-the-counter product when they have difficulty or pain when swallowing food or have blood in vomit or stool. Concurrent use is contraindicated with other acid reducers, kidney disease, or in patients younger than 12 years old.
