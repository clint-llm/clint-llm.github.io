The development of the visual system during the age of active neural plasticity depends on several factors, including the quality of the visual stimulus, the integrity of the visual pathway, and the child's general health status.

The quality of the visual stimulus sent to the cortex is further determined by the accurate bending of rays of light entering the eye to focus on the retina. In the presence of a refractive abnormality, parallel rays of light incident on the anterior refractive apparatus of the eye are refracted incorrectly. Therefore, the refracted light rays fall in front of or behind the retina. In astigmatism, refracted rays form a two-point focus due to the meridional difference in the refractive structures of the eye.

AccommodationÂ is the ability of the eye to exact a given dioptric change in power with respect to a change in viewing distance to keep the retinal image clear. The stimulus to accommodation is a blurred retinal image. The increased crystalline elasticity and amplitude of accommodation, which is common in this young age group, tend to predispose children to slightly overestimated myopia when objective refraction is done without cycloplegia.

Refractive error determined by Mohindra retinoscopy is comparable to static retinoscopy when the accommodative tonus is eliminated by a cycloplegic agent.
