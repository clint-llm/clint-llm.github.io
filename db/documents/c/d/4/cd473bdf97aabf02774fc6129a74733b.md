A felon is an infection that occurs within the closed-space compartments of the fingertip pulp. The swelling leads to intense throbbing pain. The surrounding tissues are at risk for ischemia if the blood flow is compromised by compression from edema and pus formation. Treatment involves incision and drainage of the infected pulp space and oral antibiotics. If left untreated the underlying bone, joint, or tendons may become infected. This activity describes the pathophysiology of felon and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of felon.
- Describe the causes of felon.
- Summarize the treatment options for felon.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by felon.
