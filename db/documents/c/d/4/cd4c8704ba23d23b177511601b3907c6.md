Tracheoesophageal fistula is detectable on prenatal ultrasounds around 20 weeks; however, as the scan has a sensitivity of 26%, it is commonly diagnosed after birth when the previously mentioned symptoms first present. Surgical correction is the preferred method of treatment and is usually successful in preventing recurrent fistulas and/or tracheomalacia. The most common post-operative complication occurring within 48 hours is an anastomotic leak which can resolve with a course of antibiotics and close monitoring.

For those mothers at risk of preterm delivery, corticosteroids should be provided from 23 to 34 weeks gestation to accelerate lung maturation and surfactant production. After birth, the infant can receive an exogenous surfactant preparation; the surfactant preparations can be natural, such as those derived from animal lungs or human amniotic fluid or entirely synthetic. Current guidelines state that in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, a natural surfactant preparation should be administered. Additionally, the infant is given oxygen, prophylactic antibiotics for sepsis, and intubated if necessary.
