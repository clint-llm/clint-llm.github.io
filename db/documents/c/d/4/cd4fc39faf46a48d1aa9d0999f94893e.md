**Hypoxemic Hypoxia**

Low oxygen tension in the arterial blood (PaO2) is due to the inability of the lungs to properly oxygenate the blood. Causes include hypoventilation, impaired alveolar diffusion, and pulmonary shunting**.**

**Circulatory Hypoxia**

It is due to pump failure (heart is unable to pump enough blood, and therefore oxygen delivery is impaired).

**Anemic Hypoxia**

It is because of a decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity due to low hemoglobin leading to inadequate oxygen delivery.

**Histotoxic Hypoxia (Dysoxia)**

Cells are unable to utilize oxygen effectively, the best example of this is Cyanide poisoning which inhibits the enzyme cytochrome C oxidase in the mitochondria, blocking the use of oxygen to make ATP.
