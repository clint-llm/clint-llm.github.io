Complications of epiphrenic diverticula can arise from both the disease process as well as the treatment process.

Complications can be due to the size of the diverticulum leading to regurgitation, stasis of food, and aspiration. Other complications are due to inflammatory and malignant changes within the diverticulum. These include ulceration, focal adhesions, abscesses, fistulas, bleeding, perforation, and malignant degeneration.

Postoperative complications include esophageal leak, dysphagia, and acid reflux. The risks can be reduced with an understanding of the pathophysiology behind the diverticulum and properÂ surgical technique. Combining a myotomy with a diverticulectomy minimizes the risk of suture line leak from 35 to 15%.
