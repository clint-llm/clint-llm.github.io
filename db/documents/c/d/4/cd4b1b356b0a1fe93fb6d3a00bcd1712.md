- AWE is a chronic or recurrent disorder characterized by progressive visual loss and often ocular irritation or discomfort.

- AWE usually occurs after the age of 40 and is more common in patients with a history of eye trauma or surgery, topical ocular medications, atopic dermatitis, and acne rosacea.

- AWE is diagnosed clinically with slit lamp and confocal microscopy. Pathology and confocal microscopy are also characteristic but not necessary for diagnosis.

- AWE is treatedÂ with 1% silver nitrate applied topically and usually resolves within 2 to 3 weeks of a single treatment.
