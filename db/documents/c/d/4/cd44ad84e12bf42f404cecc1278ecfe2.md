An audiologist is a person who provides the audiometry test to determine the type and severity of the hearing loss. They also work closely with patients after cochlear implant insertion to provide therapy, which allows patients to receive maximum benefit from the device. They may also adjust the device to the patient's needs. Otolaryngologists are the medical physicians who provide the diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss and determine which patients meet the criteria for cochlear implants. Otolaryngologists also perform the surgery of cochlear implantation. There are general otolaryngology physicians, otologists, and neurotologists who may perform this surgery. Otology and neurotology require an additional 1 to 2 years of training after completing an otolaryngology residency.

Regularly scheduled follow-up is necessary for successful outcomes after cochlear implantation. The adult cochlear implant patient should have his or her external devices evaluated and programmed annually. Pediatric patients require evaluation at least twice yearly. Many children are seen more frequently than twice a year if any questions arise on how their listening skills are developing and to ensure that their devices are programmed appropriately.
