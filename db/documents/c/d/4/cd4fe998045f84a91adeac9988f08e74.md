Insufficient sleep is a prevalent condition, with up to a third of the U.S. adult population reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per night.

Short sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours was reported to affect 37% of adults aged between 20 to 39 years, 40.3% of adults aged between 40 to 59 years, and 32% of adults 60 years or older in this survey. Differences among races were also noted, with 53% of non-Hispanic blacks, 34.5% of non-Hispanic whites, 35.2% of Mexican Americans, and 41.7% of other ethnicities reporting regular short sleep durations. There were no significant differences in prevalence between men (39.8%) and women (35.8%).

Other studies have reported similar findings of more than one-third of the surveyed population reporting a typical sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours.

The National Health Interview Survey assessed different occupational groups for the prevalence of short sleep duration, defined as a self-reported sleep duration of 6 or fewer hours a day. According to the survey, in the transportation/warehouse industry category, production, installation, maintenance, and repair jobs had the highest prevalence of short sleep duration. In contrast, the manufacturing category's installation, maintenance, and repair jobs showed the highest prevalence of short sleep duration.
