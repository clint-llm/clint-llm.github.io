Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare cancer of the liver and it displays features that make it very different in its behavior and clinical findings from conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)[1]. FL-HCC accounts for less than 1% of all primary hepatic malignancies. Unlike conventional HCC, FL-HCC is more common in a younger patient population and has a significantly lower incidence. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of FL-HCC and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this malignancy.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with FLC.
- Identify the gold standard for the treatment of FLC.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with FLC.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team that can enhance patient care when deciding the treatment and management of patients with advanced disease.
