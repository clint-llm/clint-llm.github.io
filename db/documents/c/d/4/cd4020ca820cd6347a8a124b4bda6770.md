Histologically, osteoma cutis is characterized by the existence of dense eosinophilic deposits in the subcutaneous tissue and the dermis. There are bony spicules with prominent cement lines and calcification. Bony spicules can sometimes perforate the epidermis through a process of transepidermal elimination. There is no associated cartilage formation since the majority of bone formation arises through membranous ossification. Osteoma cutis may demonstrate osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. In large deposits, Haversian systems can be observed. Rarely, bone marrow elements are identified.

Perforating osteoma cutis is a sporadic and peculiar form characterized by a central crater enclosed by squamous epithelium, corresponding to a transepidermal elimination channel.

The immunohistochemical study, as well as special stains, are usually not contributory to the diagnosis of osteoma cutis.
