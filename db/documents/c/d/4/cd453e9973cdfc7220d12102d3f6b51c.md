It presents as symmetrical, well-marginated, erythematous, shiny plaques with multiple pinpoint redder spots, “cayenne pepper spots” involving the glans, prepuce, or both. Vegetative, erosive and “multiple” lesion variants have also been reported. Usually, the condition is asymptomatic, though pruritus may be present.

The course tends to be chronic and may persist for months to years, and sometimes poorly responsive to topical treatment.
