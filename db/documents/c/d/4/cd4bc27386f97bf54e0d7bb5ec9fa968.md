The biceps tendon consists of 2 heads originating from the coracoid process (short head) and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula (long head). The tendon attaches to the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. The biceps tendon is a strong supinator of the forearm and serves as a weak elbow flexor. Some reports also mention the long head biceps tendonâ€™s contribution to the stability of the glenohumeral joint. Rupture of the proximal biceps tendon can be treated conservatively, while injury to its distal attachment usually needs surgical intervention. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of the biceps tendon and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of biceps tendon rupture.
- Review the presentation of biceps tendon rupture.
- Outline the management options available for biceps tendon rupture.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of biceps tendon rupture and improve outcomes.
