Current guidelines do not suggest routine laboratory testing for therapeutic monitoring of dipyridamole. There are no required scheduled laboratory evaluations for associated toxicities. The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology does suggest monitoring the patients for toxicity while undergoing perfusion testing with particular attention for signs of hypoperfusion, including extremity cyanosis, pallor, or decreased temperature.
