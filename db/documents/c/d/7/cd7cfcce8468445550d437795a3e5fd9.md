Injury to the thoracolumbar spine can occur from motor vehicle accidents, falls from height, recreational accidents, and occupational injuries. Because the thoracolumbar junction is more vulnerable than other segments of the spine, it is a very common area of injury due to its intrinsic biomechanics.

In the event of high-velocity spine injuries, there is an associated 25% risk for accompanying spinal cord injury (SCI), which can subsequently have devastating effects on the patient with loss of individual productive years and an associated high cost to society.
