Immunoprophylaxis via RhIg is of value when alloimmunization has not yet occurred. If an Rh-negative mother has been found to have positive anti-D antibody titers, then RhIg treatment will not be effective, and those mothers should not be given RhIg. Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and GynecologistsÂ advises routine antibody testing before giving RhIg.

Even with the availability of RhIg for the management of potential Rh incompatibility, the risks of alloimmunization have not been completely eliminated. Contributing factors include inappropriate RhIg administration (i.e., dosing, timeline according to recommendations) and occult fetomaternal bleeding that occurs before the advised RhIg dosing at 28 weeks. Often, the potential source of bleeding cannot be determined.

Most of the discussions of the antibodies involved have been non-specific thus far; however, it is important to make some distinctions between the different types of antibodies. If an Rh-negative mother is antibody positive for IgG, this is of clinical concern because IgG antibodies can cross the placenta and cause HDN. However, it is possible that an antibody screen can be positive for IgM antibodies (i.e., Lewis antibodies); however, these are not of clinical consequence since they do not cross the placenta.
