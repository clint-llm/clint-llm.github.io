Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related mortality globally. The estimated age-standardized incidence and mortality rates in 2018 worldwide for both sexes of all ages is 19.7 per 100000 inhabitants, and the mortality rate is 8.9 per 100000 patients, according to Globocan.Â The incidence increases significantly by six times when it is related to obesity.

These are detected in 6 to 10% of all CRC diagnosed before age 50; that is, its incidence would be 2 per 100000 inhabitants in the world population.
