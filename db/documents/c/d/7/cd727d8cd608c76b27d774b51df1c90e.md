A multipronged, interprofessional approach involving a physician, otorhinolaryngology surgeon, gastroenterologist, surgeon, and psychologist is recommended.

Since patients with halitosis are generally psychologically depressed, diffident, or even socially isolated, they should be offered mental health counseling. To help get rid of halitosis, an aggressive approach is necessary to make the diagnosis so that treatment can be effective and durable.

Halitosis is an embarrassing medical issue that concerns a vast majority of people that can, apart from a host of medical complications, affect a person’s life and interactions with other members of society. It could lead to depression and even a sociocultural boycott of sorts in extreme cases, hence the need to tackle the issue judiciously and with extreme sensitivity. An empathetic approach by the clinician is of prime importance in handling a patient with halitosis. It would be helpful if one involves a nutritionist and psychologist in the treatment protocol to prevent recurrences and to keep halitosis at bay forever.
