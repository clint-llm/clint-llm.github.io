When heparin toxicity occurs, protamine is recommended for reversal of heparin’s anticoagulant effect. Patients with life-threatening or severe bleeding or patients who undergo surgery may require protamine for reversal. Neutralization of heparin occurs when protamine binds to the heparin by ionic properties. The protamine-heparin complex is inactive, and heparin is unable to act as an anticoagulant. Protamine administration should be via slow IV push with no more than 50 mg over 10 minutes. Administration of protamine too rapidly has been associated with severe reactions, most commonly, hypotension, pulmonary edema, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and pulmonary hypertension. These effects also present with high doses of protamine, repeat doses of protamine, and previous exposure or current exposure. Anaphylaxis can also occur with protamine administration. Because of heparin’s short half-life, time from administration of heparin is used to determine the initial dose of protamine needed for reversal. Every 1mg of protamine administered neutralizes 100 units of heparin. Heparin neutralization should occur within about 5 minutes of protamine administration.
