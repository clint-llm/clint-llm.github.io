The protocol includes the achievement of the CVS, recognition of aberrant anatomy, the performance of intra-operative time out before clipping or cutting the cystic duct or artery, use of intraoperative cholangiogram to define unusual anatomy, knowing the appropriate bailout procedures, and possible referral to a tertiary care center. Infrared fluorescent cholangiography can aid in defining anatomy and conversion to open can sometimes enable safer dissection.

Techniques during the procedure that can facilitate visualization of the anatomy include retraction of the gallbladder infundibulum towards the umbilical fissure to open the hepatocystic triangle. Another method for avoiding injury is the identification of anatomical fixed landmarks with the pneumonic B-SAFE, which stands for the bile duct and the base of segment 4 (B), Rouviere's sulcus (S), hepatic artery (A), umbilical fissure or the fissure between the left lateral and left medial segments and is a continuation of the falciform ligament (F), and enteric viscera such as the duodenum and pylorus (E).
