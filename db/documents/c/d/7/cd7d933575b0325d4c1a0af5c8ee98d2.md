There are numerous differences between male and female morphology in the head and neck region, including but not limited to:

- Hairline shape (males typically have an M-shaped hairline and females have a rounded hairline)

- Hairline position (males often have a higher hairline than females, particularly as patients age)

- Eyebrow position (male eyebrows are classically located at the supraorbital rim, while female brows are often positioned higher)

- Eyebrow shape (male eyebrows are classically described as flatter than females', but this depends largely on grooming preference and fashion)

- Frontal bossing (males almost always have a more prominent supraorbital ridge than females)

- Eyelid creases (males generally have lower supratarsal creases than females, typically located 7-8 mm above the lash line in Caucasian males and 10-12 mm above in females; in non-Caucasian patients, the creases may be lower or absent in either gender)

- Zygomatic arch width (males frequently have narrower midfaces than females)

- Facial fat pads (males commonly have fuller buccal fat pads and females have more malar fat volume)

- Nasal radix depth (Caucasian males often have a deeper nasal radix than Caucasian females)

- Nasal dorsum height (males often have a higher, straighter, or convex dorsum as compared to a lower and potentially slightly scooped female nasal dorsum)

- Nasal tip rotation (male leptorrhine nasal tips are classically described as less rotated than females, with a nasolabial angle of 90-95 degrees, compared to a female angle of 100 to 115 degrees; the angle can be more obtuse in shorter women)

- Skin thickness (males tend to have thicker, oilier skin than females, which is important to consider when reducing bone volume because the surgeon must overcorrect in order to account for soft tissue depth)

- Lip thickness (males usually have thinner lips than females, although age may be a greater determinant of lip volume than gender)

- Dental show (males tend to demonstrate less maxillary dental show at rest than females; younger females, in particular, are more likely to demonstrate upper dental show in repose)

- Dental profile (male teeth, particularly incisors, have a more square shape with sharp corners, whereas female teeth tend to have a rounded contour and may be smaller overall)

- Facial hair (generally, only males have facial and cervical hair, the latter of which may blend with thoracic hair; female facial hair tends to be very limited unless advanced age or an endocrine abnormality is present)

- Mandibular angle (males often have more acute mandibular angles than females, rendering the posterior jaw more defined)

- Mandibular height (males generally have a taller mandibular ramus than females, which also contributes to the prominence of the mandibular angle)

- Mandibular width (males tend to have a wider mandible than females when measured between the angles)

- Masseter volume (male masseter muscles are often larger than females, thus making the mandible and lower face appear fuller)

- Chin width (male chins are usually wider than female chins, paralleling the greater mandibular width at the angle)

- Chin protrusion (male chins tend to project farther anteriorly than female chins)

- Laryngeal prominence (the thyroid and cricoid cartilages of the male larynx tend to be more visible than the female equivalents)

Over time, sexual dimorphism in the face fades, leading to less clear-cut differences between male and female features, which likely accounts for the adage that "old married couples start to look alike." For this reason, aging face surgery is often combined with gender affirmation surgery in older patients in order to re-establish sexual dimorphism.
