Hepatocytes are primarily responsible for the synthesis of hepcidin. Hepcidin is produced initially as a preprohormone with eighty-four amino acids. It is then cleaved into a prohormone, which gets cleaved again, forming hepcidin. The final hepcidin protein has 25 amino acids. Many factors influence hepcidin gene expression. Up-regulation occurs during inflammatory states and is primarily mediated by IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine released from a variety of cell types. Transferrin, an iron-binding transport molecule in the blood, can also up-regulate hepcidin production, signaling that iron storage in the serum is adequate and that the release of iron from intracellular storage is not currently needed. Erythroferrone is a hormone produced by erythroblasts during erythropoiesis. It down-regulates the hepcidin gene expression. Hepcidin gene is also downregulated during hypoxic conditions. Both erythroferrone and hypoxia signal a demand for iron to construct new hemoglobin molecules.
