Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare inflammatory papulosquamous disorder of unknown etiology. There are 6 strikingly distinct subtypes that occur in both children and adults. Fundamental elements noted across all subtypes include distinct, well-demarcated plaques of various sizes with characteristic reddish-orange hue, which may have varying degrees of the scale. More generalized subtypes often demonstrate intervening areas of unaffected skin, known as "islands of sparing," which is a signature characteristic of PRP. This activity reviews pityriasis rubra pilaris and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Idnetify the types of pityriasis rubra pilaris. 
- Summarize when pityriasis rubra pilaris should be considered on differential diagnosis. 
- Outline the management considerations relevant to pityriasis rubra pilaris treatment.
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid diagnosis of pityriasis rubra pilaris and subsequently decrease associated morbidity in affected patients.
