Anthropometry is essential in the diagnosis of marasmus; this may be difficult to perform in a reliable and repeatable manner in low-income countries.

The diagnosis of marasmus is made if there is a MUAC of less than 115 mm or if the weight for height Z score is greater than three standard deviations below the mean.

Laboratory investigations can be used in the diagnosis of protein-energy malnutrition along with the investigation of associated mineral deficiencies. Laboratory investigations recommended by the WHO include hemoglobin and blood smear, blood glucose, serum albumin, electrolytes, stool microscopy, and culture, including investigation of parasites, human immunodeficiency virus testing, and urine microscopy and culture.

A full blood cell count can help to identify low levels of hemoglobin or abnormalities in the red cell indices; furthermore, a blood film smear can be used in the diagnosis of anemia and malaria in some circumstances. Iron studies, folic acid, and B12 levels are also frequently used.

Other investigations frequently used as part of a nutrition profile include specific tests for plasma proteins such as transferrin, albumin, and thyroxine-binding prealbumin.
