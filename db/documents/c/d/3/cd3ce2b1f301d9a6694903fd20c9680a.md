Adverse effects include hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal failure, cough, and angioedema.

In the PARADIGM-HF trial comparing sacubitril/valsartan to enalapril 10 mg twice per day, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a higher incidence of hypotension and symptomatic hypotension. Sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a lower risk of elevation in serum potassium or serum creatinine and a lower risk of cough than enalapril. More patients experienced angioedema in the sacubitril/valsartan arm than in the enalapril; however, this outcome was not statistically significant.
