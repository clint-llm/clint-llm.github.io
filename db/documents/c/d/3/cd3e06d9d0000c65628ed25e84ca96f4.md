The diagnosis of neuroma is mainly dependent on history and examination. In cases where there is uncertainty, X-rays can be taken to rule out bone injury as a cause of pain and to rule out bone malignancy. Ultrasound, computed tomogram (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show well-defined soft tissue mass but are rarely necessary investigations.

There are no laboratory tests that would aid diagnosis. After surgical excision, it is common practice to send lesions for histopathology examination to rule out malignancy.
