The development of the middle meningeal artery, similarly to other blood vessels, occurs via angiogenesis and receives guidance from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other growth factors. During development, a series of aortic arches arise, arranged from cranial to caudal. From these arches, the third arch gives rise to the stapedial artery. The stapedial artery arises from the internal carotid artery and is later incorporated by the external carotid artery. The stapedial artery will then divide, giving rise to the middle meningeal artery. By the 10th week of development, the stapedial artery will normally degenerate. Due to the complex nature of middle meningeal artery development, many anatomic variations and anastomoses may be seen.
