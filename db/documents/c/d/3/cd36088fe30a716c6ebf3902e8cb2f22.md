Neural tube defects are the most common severe central nervous system anomalies, only second to cardiovascular abnormalities resulting in congenital morbidity and mortality. The nervous system is ectodermal in origin. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord formed by folding of dorsal part neural plates under the influence of underlying notochord and prechordal mesoderm and closure anterior (cranial) and posterior (caudal) neuropores by a process called neurulation that begins as early as 3 and 4 weeks of conception. Failure to complete neurulation results in neural tube defects (NTDs). This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the prevention and treatment of NTDs.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications for the surgical management of neural tube defects.
- Describe potential complications associated with surgical versus non-surgical management of neural tube defects.
- Outline the treatment and management options for surgical versus non-surgical management of neural tube defects.
- Explain why careful planning and discussion with the interprofessional team involved in managing patients with closed neural tube defects will lower the associated morbidity and improve patient outcomes in both pre and postoperative patients.
