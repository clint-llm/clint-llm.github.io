Celiac ganglia are two nerve bundles located around the celiac trunk at the T12-L1 spinal levels. They represent a mass of nerve cell bodies that are part of the autonomic nervous system and are responsible for innervation of the gastrointestinal tract and abdominal organs. They carry sympathetic input to abdominal parenchyma and are vital for coordinating digestive functions of the gastrointestinal tract, including motility, secretion, and absorption.
