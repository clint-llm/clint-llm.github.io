Imaging evaluation of Chiari malformations varies, with Chiari I evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically in a child or adult, whereas Chiari II to IV are often first evaluated by ultrasound in utero, with fetal MRI assessment performed for further characterization.

MRI of the head and cervical spine is the test of choice in evaluating Chiari I. This will demonstrate cerebellar tonsillar descent greater than 5 mm below the foramen magnum (McRae line). In addition, a decreased size of the posterior fossa and a syrinx may be seen.

Other useful tests in the management of patients with Chiari I malformation include:

- Myelography: Of special value as an alternative in patients in who an MRI cannot be obtained.

- CT or x-rays of the neck and head: May reveal common associated bony defects, particularly of the craniocervical junction relevant for surgical planning, such as basilar invagination.

Fetal sonography, often during the second-trimester anatomy scan, demonstrates the typical imaging features of Chiari II and III malformations. One classic imaging finding on ultrasound is the lemon sign of the anterior frontal calvarium, with loss of the normal convex curvature and flattening or inward bowing/scalloping that results in a shape similar to a lemon.

Fetal MRI can demonstrate the cerebellar hypoplasia/aplasia of Chiari IV and V and further evaluate the neural tube defects and hindbrain herniation of Chiari II and III. MRI also better demonstrates the tectal beaking that occurs in Chiari II.

Laboratory studies are not of help in the evaluation of patients with Chiari malformation. However, laboratory studies are needed during planning for surgery. Routine studies like the complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile, electrolyte levels, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG) will suffice.
