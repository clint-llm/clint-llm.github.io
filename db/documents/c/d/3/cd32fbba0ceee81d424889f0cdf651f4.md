Depending upon the etiology, genetics, immune-phenotype, and morphology, there are different classification systems for AML.

The most common risk factor for AML is myelodysplastic syndrome. Other hematological disorders that increase the risk of AML include myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia.

Several congenital disorders like Down syndrome and Bloom syndrome also increase the risk of AML, which tends to present in the early 20s.

Environmental exposures like radiation, tobacco smoke and benzene are also risk factors for AML

Finally, previous exposure to chemotherapeutic agents is also a risk factor for AML.
