Trichoepitheliomas and spiradenomas appear similar and often occur simultaneously. Trichoepitheliomas are differentiated from cylindromas by the presence of horn cysts. Spiradenomas can prove exceedingly difficult in some cases to differentiate from cylindromas. Within a spiradenoma, there may be populations of basaloid cells that appear indistinguishable from a cylindroma. They will often appear more circumscribed and nodular than cylindromas. Spiradenomas are typically solitary lesions that often exhibit intermittent pain and are tender to palpation, as opposed to the majority of cylindromas which are painless. Thorough histopathologic examination of the entire lesion is vital in difficult cases to differentiate between cylindromas and spiradenomas.

Cylindromas may transform into the malignant cylindrocarcinoma in a rare number of cases. Malignant cylindromas are more frequently associated with Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome. The malignant form exhibits more rapid growth, atypical and asymmetrical architectural features, and invasive pattern of growth. Cytological features may include nuclear pleomorphism and crowding, loss of the characteristic jigsaw puzzle pattern, loss of intervening hyaline sheaths, loss of the biphasic cell population, and development of necrosis. Malignant cylindromas exhibit aggressive local infiltrative growth patterns and have been known to metastasize. Immunohistochemical stains do not help differentiate between benign or malignant lesions.
