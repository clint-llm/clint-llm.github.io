**Mechanism**

Ranitidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine H2-receptors. The reversible inhibition of H2-receptors in gastric parietal cells results in a reduction in both gastric acid volume and concentration. Ranitidineâ€™s acid-lowering effect is more pronounced for basal and nocturnal acid secretion than it is for food-stimulated acid secretion. Additional indirect effects of ranitidine are decreased pepsin secretion and increased nitrate-reducing bacterial flora.

**Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics**

When dosed orally, ranitidine has a bioavailability of 50%, which is relatively unaffected by food. The peak levels occur 2 to 3 hours post-administration for oral administration and occur 15 minutes after intramuscular administration. Ranitidine is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life ranging from 2.5 to 3 hours, and because of the renal elimination, the half-life may increase to 4 to 5 hours in patients with kidney dysfunction.
