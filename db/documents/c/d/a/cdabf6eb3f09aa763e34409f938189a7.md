Injury to the retroperitoneum can result in damage to any of the organs of this space including the adrenal glads; aorta; inferior vena cava; second and third parts of the duodenum; pancreatic head, neck, and body; ureters; ascending and descending colon; kidneys; esophagus; and rectum. These injuries may exist in isolation or, especially in the case of trauma, exist with other retroperitoneal, abdominal, spinal, or pelvic injuries.

When spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding is identified, the search for concomitant pathology that may be the source of the bleeding must ensue. This includes assessing for anticoagulation use, recent fibrinolytic therapy, renal masses, adrenal masses, gynecological complications, pancreatitis, or aortic and renal aneurysms.

In the event of iatrogenically induced retroperitoneal bleeding, the specific location of bleeding must be identified. Here, the specific catheterization pathway utilized by the performing proceduralist must be sought as the nidus of bleeding initiation will most likely have initiated along this pathway. A complete vascular analysis is key to assess for vascular rupture, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, fistula, or wall hematoma.
