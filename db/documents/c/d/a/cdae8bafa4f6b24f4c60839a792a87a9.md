Noninvasive CTA and MRA have replaced most of the diagnostic uses of conventional invasive angiography. Beyond anatomic diagnosis, CTA and MRA can provide a functional assessment of vascular lesions that is comparable to conventional angiography.Â A systematic review showed the overall diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR), compared with invasive FFR to be 81.9%; however, this drops to 46.1% if in CT-FFR value is between 0.70 and 0.80, and this is where invasive FFR is essential.
