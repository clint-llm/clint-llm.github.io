Reflux nephropathy (RN) often presents in early adulthood with various clinical manifestations of chronic kidney disease. Reflux nephropathy was previously called chronic pyelonephritis as it was believed to result from childhood recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). It occurs in approximately 1 to 3 percent of children and is associated with 7 to 17 percent of children developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) across the globe. RN may account for up to 10 percent of ESRD etiologies in adult patients. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of reflux nephropathy and illustrates the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different presentations of reflux nephropathy.
- Review the evaluation of reflux nephropathy.
- Identify management options for reflux nephropathy.
- Summarize how improved coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of reflux nephropathy and subsequently enhance the care of patients with this condition.
