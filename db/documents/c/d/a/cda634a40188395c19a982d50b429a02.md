Many different types ofÂ conditions can affect the eyelids. An example of a common condition is when the glands that produce oil in the eyelid can become obstructed or infected and cause a painful, inflamed nodule on the eyelid. If the nodule is infected, it is called a hordeolum. If the nodule is a sterile collection of debris from an obstructed gland it is called a chalazion. Another common condition that can affect the eyelids is known as blepharitis. This is when the eyelid margin becomes inflamed and irritated.
