When a patient presents to a provider with renal calculi, a complete understanding of medical and surgical treatment options is mandatory for the provider. The patient should be educated about the available options and risks and benefits of them. With extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), the chances of retreatment and adjunctive treatments should be explained.

Preoperative evaluation and preparation will allow the provider to maximize the success rate of ESWL with minimal chances of unforeseen complications. The role of the anesthetist is necessaryÂ to ensure adequate analgesia. The provider must be present during the procedure to ensure an optimum SFR. The nurse or assistant should be present for patient monitoring and administrating medications if necessary. After ESWL, the patient should be educated about diet alterations to reduce the risk of recurrence of renal calculi.
