Familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV familial dyslipidemia) is a disorder characterized by the overproduction of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) from the liver. As a result, the patient will have an excessive number of triglycerides and VLDL on the lipid profile that can cause acute pancreatitis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of familial hypertriglyceridemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of familial hypertriglyceridemia. 
- Explain how comorbid conditions play an important role in the diagnose of patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia.
- Outline the treatment of familial hypertriglyceridemia.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by familial hypertriglyceridemia.
