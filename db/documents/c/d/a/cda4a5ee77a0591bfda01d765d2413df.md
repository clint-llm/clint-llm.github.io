In the acute care setting, patients receiving amiodarone will need continuous cardiac monitoring and should receive frequent reassessment of vital signs and clinical conditions.

Per the American Heart Association and Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, patients who are hemodynamically unstable from tachyarrhythmias more rapid than 150 beats per minute should receive direct current cardioversion. If cardioversion is unsuccessful, these patients may receive treatment with amiodarone. Hemodynamically unstable patients with heart rates less than 150 beats per minute need to have other etiologies explored as the cause of their instability. However, treatment with cardioversion or amiodarone may still be necessary.

Anticoagulation is a consideration in all patients receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation who have no clear contraindications. A CHA2DS2-VASc score may aid clinical decision-making regarding the initiation of anticoagulation.
