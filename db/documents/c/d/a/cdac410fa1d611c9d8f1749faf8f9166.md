The prognosis of Fanconi anemia is poor. Severe aplastic anemia is the main cause of mortality that leads to death before 10 years of age in the absence of a diagnosis. Survival has been improved in developed countries due to a reduction in mortality by bleeding, or infection complications. However, living well into adulthood has increased the chances of cancer development. Most of the individuals eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia. Regular monitoring of patients is needed for cancer in those who have undergone a bone marrow transplant. Most of the patients have other associated birth defects, such as developmental delay, kidney problems, and microcephaly.
