Congenital bronchial atresia is a rare condition characterized by focal obliteration of a proximal segment of a bronchus. The apicoposterior segmental bronchus of the left upper lobe is the most reported lobe involved, which is followed by the right upper, middle, and lower lobes. Although a rare entity, bronchial atresia has been associated with other prenatal lung malformations including congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, bronchopulmonary sequestration, congenital lobar emphysema, and lesions of mixed pathology. This activity describes the pathophysiology of bronchial atresia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of bronchial atresia.
- Review the presentation and examinaiton findings for a patient with bronchial atresia.
- Summarize the treatment and management options for bronchial atresia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by bronchial atresia.
