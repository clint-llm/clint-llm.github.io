- Varenicline excretion is via the renal route, and thus it is crucial to monitor renal function. Before initiating a patient on varenicline, the clinician should obtain a baseline creatinine.

- Patients on varenicline require close monitoring for signs or symptoms of depression, agitation, behavior changes, skin reactions, or suicidal ideation.

- Smoking during pregnancy is widespread and poses a significant public health issue. Varenicline and other newer pharmacologic agents have not been studied well and generally are not used to promote cessation during pregnancy. Because varenicline is a relatively new drug on the market, few studies have shown strong evidence for either major positive or negative outcomes associated with the gestational use of varenicline. Currently, controlled studies have shown no evidence of an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, major congenital malformation, or intrauterine death. Due to limited efficacy and pregnancy safety data, varenicline is not a standard recommendation as a smoking cessation aid for pregnant women. Further studies are necessary for this topic. If a patient has been exposed to varenicline inadvertently during the first trimester, the recommendation is to perform a detailed fetal anomaly scan.
