Multiple intracranial tumors affect the medulla and hinder its functions. Those include primary and secondary tumors. Primary tumors include medulloblastoma, glial tumors, ependymoma, and hemangioblastoma.

To address lateral medullary lesions in which the nucleus solitarius could be affected, Daniel D.Cavalcanti et al. 2016 described the lateral medullary zone approach in microsurgery to resect a dorsolateral medullary lesion. He went through the foramen of Luschka, making an incision in the inferior cerebellar peduncle, and called this technique the lateral medullary zone approach. The authors provide a precise explanation for the retrosigmoid approach. They open foramen of Luschka and then identified the origin of the cranial nerves, subsequently incising the Inferior cerebellar peduncle.

Disruption of carotid reflex mechanism forms the underlying basis for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, the nucleus solitarius, as a central chemoreceptor, forms one of the sites involved in this syndrome due to central hypercapnic hypoventilation. Paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b) gene mutations correlate with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, and these genes transcribe proteins that are necessary for chemoreceptors in the nucleus solitarius, neurons expressing Phox2b have intrinsic chemosensitivity.
