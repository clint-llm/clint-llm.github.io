Ensuring neonates and infants receive appropriate nutrition in the hospital and outpatient setting necessitates a team-based approach. The pediatrician, gastroenterologist, NP, PA, or nurse would first gain an understanding of the child's overall health, feeding regimen and schedule, and any concerns the parent might have through the interview and history-taking. The nurse would meticulously measure the infant's growth parameters as accurate measurements are vital, and the team would compare them with previous measurements to determine if the infant is receiving adequate feedings.

If the child is being breastfed and there are parental concerns with breastfeeding techniques, the team could refer to a lactation consultant who would be able to offer guidance to the parent by evaluating their current method and providing education and support. If the quantity of feeds is an issue, the health providers will work with the parent to make a plan that sets feeding and weight goals for the infant. For infants receiving commercial formula, the team may also recommend fortification with iron and supplementation with vitamin D and either order and administer these in the inpatient setting or provide prescriptions for these nutrients for the parents to fill at the pharmacy.
