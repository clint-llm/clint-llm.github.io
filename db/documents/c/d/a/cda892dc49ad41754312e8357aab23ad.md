The muscle layer of the heart is termed the myocardium and is made up of cardiomyocytes. The myocardium is found in the walls of all four chambers of the heart, though it is thicker in the ventricles and thinner in the atria. This disparity is due to the difference in the generation of the force of contraction needed for propelling blood between the atria and the ventricles, with ventricles requiring much more power.
