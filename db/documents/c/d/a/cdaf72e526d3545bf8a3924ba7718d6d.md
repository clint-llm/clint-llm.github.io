Goodpasture syndrome is a rare disorder. The incidence of the anti-GBM disease is approximately 0.5 to 1.8 cases per million per year in Asian and European populations. It is responsible for 1-5% of all kinds of glomerulonephritides. Furthermore, it accounts for 10%-20% of crescentic glomerulonephritis.

**Race, Gender, and Age-related Distribution**

Goodpasture syndrome is seen more commonly in Whites than in the Black population, however, it may be more prevalent in certain ethnicities, such as the Maori people of New Zealand. The syndrome has bimodal age distribution, 20-30 years and 60-70 years. The occurrence of the disease is more in younger men and older women.

There is a subgroup of patients that is double-positive for both antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-GBM antibodies. This subgroup is mainly found in males 60-70 years old.
