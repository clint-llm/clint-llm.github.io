Treating premature ejaculation often requires a multimodal approach incorporating behavioral, psychological, and pharmacological therapies. In general, the physiology of the sexual act is not impaired to damaged in pure premature ejaculation. As such, it is not an actual disease, and there is no physiological function to "fix" or surgery to repair the damage as there is no injury to repair. Sexual activity other than vaginal intercourse can be used to produce female orgasm, which rarely results from purely vaginal intercourse.

It is important to note that there is no surgery for premature ejaculation. In the past, penile implants were sometimes empirically inserted in men with premature ejaculation, generally leading to disastrous results.

**Behavioral Therapy**

Several behavioral therapies may be options to increase tolerance and delay ejaculation; in essence, training the patient to learn how to recognize that ejaculation is imminent and teach him, through habituation and training, how to delay ejaculation. Two of the most frequently recommended examples include the stop-and-start technique and the squeeze method.

- Start-and-Stop Technique: Engage in usual sexual activity until there is the beginning of a feeling of ejaculation. Immediately stop all sexual activity and mentally focus on something different, such as reading a book. When sexual excitement has waned sufficiently, resume sexual activity. When performed consistently, it can help train and habituate the system to delay ejaculation naturally.

- Squeeze Method: Like the Stop-and-Start technique, the patient is instructed to start normal sexual activity until there is a sensation that ejaculation will be coming. At that point, the patient or his partner will grasp the head of the penis and gently squeeze the area where the glans joins the shaft. This is not painful and typically reduces the erection very quickly. After a suitable pause when sexual excitement has sufficiently declined, sexual intercourse may be resumed. Over time, when performed consistently, this can cause a delay in subsequent ejaculation. The squeeze technique allows 64% of patients to regain ejaculatory control, but this success declines to about 1/3 after three years.

Both of these approaches are repeatable as necessary. (As described by Masters and Johnson in their 1970 book Human Sexual Inadequacy.) The goal, according to Masters and Johnson, is to eventually reach a point where there is vaginal penetration but no ejaculation for about 15 minutes. While effective in many cases, at least in the short term, these behavioral methods primarily focus on distraction along with the forced reduction in sexual stimulation and excitement, which many couples find unnatural and disturbing as it reduces their overall sexual satisfaction and intimacy.

**Masturbation and "Second Try" coitus**can help delay ejaculation by taking advantage of the refractory period after an initial ejaculation. The first ejaculation occurs as it normally does, either through intercourse or masturbation. The should be about 1 hour before the next attempt. For most men, there is a refractory period immediately after an ejaculation where sexual stimulation takes longer, and ejaculation is naturally delayed. These methods take advantage of this natural effect. The actual optimal timing of the refractory period will vary, so the 1 hour period suggested is just a starting point and can be adjusted for each individual. These techniques may overcompensate and result in the loss of libido (sexual interest) or an inability to become aroused a second time, especially if the "second try" is attempted too soon. If that happens, the timing should be adjusted, or alternative techniques should be used.

Stress reduction techniques can be helpful. These include using a non-verbal signal to indicate an interest in sexual activity that evening. This could be as simple as moving a centerpiece or vase on the dining table. A "yes" or "no" response would be a countermove of some sort. The couple agrees that if the signal is "no," there is no guilt, shame, or blame.

Having an ED remedy available on "standby" can be helpful in some situations to reduce performance anxiety, even if it's never actually utilized.

Thickened condoms have been found to prolong penile hyperemia, improve erectile rigidity, increase erection time, lengthen pre-ejaculatory time after vaginal penetration, and help overcome premature ejaculatory problems.

Exercise for both men and women has been reported to help prevent premature ejaculation.

Other behavioral techniques include cognitive distraction, alternate sexual positions, adjusting the interval between sexual encounters, increasing the frequency of intercourse, and extending foreplay.

Behavioral therapy can help delay ejaculation but does not "cure" the disorder. It does not directly deal with any underlying psychological causes or consequences and will not fix all relationship issues. Associated medical or biological conditions such as ED or hyperthyroidism must be addressed separately. Behavioral therapy should be included in the treatment plan for treating premature ejaculation as it has no side effects and offers some immediate help.

**Pharmacological Therapy**

**Topical anesthetics**applied to the penis have been used with some success. This involves the self-application of topical desensitizing medications such as lidocaine sprays/creams to the tip and shaft of the penis 10 to 15 minutes before the initiation of sexual activity. This avoids potential systemic side effects compared to SSRIs.

In Europe, a dose-metered anesthetic spray is approved and available for premature ejaculation. It uses a combination of local anesthetics, lidocaine, and prilocaine and seems to offer reasonably satisfactory results in the most severe cases.

**SSRIs**are considered a first-line medical treatment in most cases of premature ejaculation. In the United States, there are no drugs specifically approved for the treatment of premature ejaculation, but SSRIs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, and clomipramine have been commonly used successfully off-label to treat primary and secondary premature ejaculation. These drugs delay ejaculation by inhibiting the serotonin transporter, thereby increasing serotonin's action at the post-synaptic cleft, which delays ejaculation.

Typical drug selection and dosage ranges include fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg/day, paroxetine 10 to 40 mg/day, sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day, citalopram 20 to 40 mg/day, and escitalopram 10-20 mg/day. A meta-analysis review suggests that paroxetine may be the most effective of these medications in treating premature ejaculation.

Unfortunately, SSRIs need to be taken daily for optimal efficacy and carry the potential for side effects, including decreased libido, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction.

Premature ejaculation can return upon discontinuation of the medication, so most men need to take these drugs on an ongoing basis. Some men who respond to SSRI therapy may have to remain on SSRI medication indefinitely.

**Clomipramine,**which is chemically a dibenzazepine tricyclic antidepressant and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is used as a second-line therapy for premature ejaculation and can be tried when other SSRIs have failed.

Full therapeutic benefits are typically apparent after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy. Potential side effects include erectile dysfunction and decreased libido. As with other SSRIs, clomipramine can be taken on an "as needed" basis 3 to 5 hours prior to sexual activity, which mitigates the potential side effects of daily use; however, this may not be as effective for premature ejaculation as daily therapy. It is FDA-approved only for use in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder but has many off-label uses.

**Dapoxetine**is an SSRI recently developed specifically for premature ejaculation, which is now available in Europe. It is effective when taken 1 to 3 hours prior to sexual activity. However, the drug has not yet been approved in the US. European data indicate that its side-effect profile is poor and discontinuation rates are extreme at up to 90%. This is due to its high rate of side effects (diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, nausea, and orthostatic hypotension), high cost, sub-optimal performance, and the need to schedule intercourse.

**Tramadol**is generally used as a pain medication as it has activity at opioid receptors, which may affect penile sensation. It also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin reuptake. These combined effects can be useful in treating premature ejaculation as a second-line agent.

Non-selective beta-adrenergic blockers have also been tried with partial success in patients who failed to respond to SSRIs.

Alpha-adrenergic blockers, such as tamsulosin and silodosin, can help with premature ejaculation by increasing IELT, but they often lead to other ejaculatory problems, such as retrograde ejaculation or anejaculation.

There is currently no FDA-approved medical therapy for premature ejaculation, although there is substantial information on the off-label efficacy of SSRIs for the disorder.

**Psychological Treatment**

Psychotherapy may be used to address the negative thoughts and emotions that can lead to problems with sexual relationships. It can help the patient become less anxious about sexual performance and give them enhanced sexual confidence.

Current psychotherapy for premature ejaculation tends to be short-term and integrates behavioral, cognitive, systems, and psychodynamic approaches. The intention is to help the patient learn to control ejaculation and resolve the cascade of negative psychological effects and feelings this causes. (low self-esteem, performance anxiety, lowered libido, sexual avoidance, negative relationship issues, self-loathing, increased partner's hostility, etc.)

Effective therapy includes three general principles.

- Patient empowerment, in which men feel that they can create, change and impact contextual factors.

- Creating a friendly, safe environment where issues, choices, obstacles, and meanings of the patient's behavioral, psychological, and relationship issues can be explored.

- Providing hopefulness as well as establishing realistic expectations regarding outcomes.

Specific psychological treatment of premature ejaculation incorporates multiple goals:

- Learning and practicing behavioral modification techniques that can delay ejaculation and provide more control.

- Improving confidence in the patient's sexual performance.

- Reducing performance anxiety.

- Modifying habitual or rigid sexual practices that lead to poor performance.

- Overcoming obstacles to improved intimacy.

- Resolving ongoing relationship and interpersonal issues that help maintain the sexual disorder.

- Identifying and resolving any thoughts, perceptions, or feelings that interfere with normal sexual function.

- Increasing communication.

Sex therapy is the specific branch of psychotherapy devoted to managing sexual problems. They extensively use behavioral techniques (Stop-and Start, Squeeze Technique) but also address relationship issues, emotional factors, performance anxiety, unrealistic expectations, and partner concerns. Many PE patients fear sexual excitement and may not realize the restrictive impact this has on their partner and the relationship. There is a tendency to excessively focus solely on his own sexual performance and lack of ejaculatory control, which results in a lack of adequate attention to his partner.

One technique used by sex therapists is to eliminate the performance anxiety issue by forbidding full intercourse for a limited period, only allowing limited intimate touching but no intercourse or ejaculation. The degree and type of this touching are gradually expanded as control is achieved. Combined with other techniques, this approach can be successful as well as sensate focus therapy.

Overall, the combination of psychosexual therapy together with behavioral modification techniques and pharmacological treatment has seen the most success.

**Combination Therapy**

Combination therapy with SSRI medications, ejaculatory delay techniques, local desensitization methods, psychological help, and behavioral (sex) therapy can successfully treat most cases of premature ejaculation and has seen the most success.

In committed relationships, success rates with combination therapy are reported to be as high as 85%. However, the likelihood of a relapse is also high, as reported recurrence rates are 20% to 50%.

- Numerous case reports indicate that combination medical therapy is far more effective than solo drug treatment for premature ejaculation.

- A phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor and an SSRI medication are recommended, especially in cases where there is concomitant ED.

- Combining pharmacologic and behavioral treatment is more efficient than pharmacotherapy alone.

**Summary of Treatments**

**Behavioral**

- Seek ways to reduce performance pressure on the male.

- Consider using alternate sexual activities other than vaginal intercourse to produce female sexual satisfaction.

- Using a non-verbal signal for one partner to indicate interest in sexual activity to the other can help reduce stress.

- A standby ED therapy can help reduce performance anxiety.

- Teach the "top-and-start" or the "squeeze" techniques as described by Masters and Johnson.

- Use a condom with or without a topical local anesthetic to diminish penile sensation.

- Consider using a second condom to further reduce penile tactile sensation.

- Use the "second try" trick, where the second attempt at coitus will usually enjoy significantly delayed ejaculation.

- Consider masturbation 1 to 2 hours before sexual intercourse. This will tend to delay ejaculation, similar to the "second try" technique above.

**Pharmacological**

- Treat any underlying associated physical or medical problems such as ED.

- In cases where premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction are both present, treat the ED first.

- Medical therapy for premature ejaculation is primarily with SSRIs which are used off-label.

- Daily drug therapy appears more effective than intermittent or "as-needed" treatment.

- Drugs for erectile dysfunction, such as phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, have only limited effectiveness for premature ejaculation when used alone but will help with associated ED.

- Non-selective beta-adrenergic blockers or clomipramine can be used in cases where SSRIs have failed.

- Tramadol may be considered when all the above therapies are inadequate or unsuccessful.

**Psychological**

- Discuss issues with both partners.

- Inform the couple that although there is no physical damage or injury, it is still a real problem that requires medical help to overcome.

- Teach them that premature ejaculation is a very real and common disorder.

- It is not possible to overcome the problem without help.

- Relieve unrealistic feelings of guilt or blame.

- Premature ejaculation is nobody's "fault" and will respond to treatment.

- The commitment and involvement of the partner in treatment will significantly improve the outcome.

- Obtain a mental health consultation to identify underlying psychological problems and relationship issues that may need attention.

- Consider a referral to a certified sex therapist or another mental health professional with experience in premature ejaculation.

- Psychological treatment and "sex therapy" is often the preferred treatment as it deals with the underlying causes and may permanently cure the disorder without drugs.

A combination of treatments, including behavioral modification techniques, psychosexual (sex) therapy, an ED drug, and a daily SSRI medication, is more effective and provides better overall outcomes than any single therapeutic modality treatment.
