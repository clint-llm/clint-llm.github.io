Nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and primary care providers need to know thatÂ not all lesions on the face are due to acne. Acneiform eruptions have many causes and in many cases are caused by occupational exposure or certain medications. Erroneously treating these patients for acne often exacerbates the condition. It is best to consult with a dermatologist if the diagnosis is in doubt.

It is important to educate the public that acneiform eruptions is a transient skin disorder and has many causes. In many cases, simply removing the offending agent or limiting exposure to the organism can lead to the resolution of the disorder. The prognosis in most patients is excellent, and there is usually no residual scarring. Patients should be warned not to scratch the lesions as this can lead to scars and keloid formation.
