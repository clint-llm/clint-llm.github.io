The pathogenesis of akinesia in adults broadly appears to stem from pallidonigroluysian degeneration that predominantly leads to freezing.

In patients with PD, the principal cause of akinesia appears to be a dysfunction in phasic and tonic dopamine release. This is in contrast to resting tremors caused mainly due to a dysfunctional tonic phase of dopamine release.

Fetal akinesia has been associated with around 320 genetic variations that could all present with this syndrome. Pathologically speaking, the pathology is evident at all levels, including theÂ brain, spinal cord, motor neuron, neuromuscular junction, and the muscle.
