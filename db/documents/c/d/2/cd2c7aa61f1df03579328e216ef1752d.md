With the recent advances in transcatheter technologies, valve replacement techniques, and surgical repair, the community must establish institution-based standards to deliver high-quality cardiac care. Early diagnosis at the primary care level with providers, cardiologists, interventional cardiologists, and surgeons with timely referral to the higher center can improve outcomes. With optimal care and follow-up, serious side effects of severe aortic valve disease and HOCM, such as heart failure, bacterial endocarditis, and ventricular arrhythmias that lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, can be prevented.

Interprofessional involvement by a team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists (cardiologists, surgeons), and nursing staff in assessing and managing cardiac disease will lead to better outcomes. In cases where medication management is used, a cardiology specialty pharmacist may also be part of the care team. Each caregiver involved in the case must maintain open communication channels and accurate and updated records for the entire team. Nurses will often serve as coordinators for actions and communication between the various specists on the case, as well as providing patient counsel and assisting during surgical procedures. This interprofessional model will help drive the best patient results. [Level 5]
