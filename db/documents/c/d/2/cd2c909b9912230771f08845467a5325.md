AAT is best managed by an interprofessional team of health professionals that includes a pediatrician, geneticist, pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, and internist. During the first three decades of life: liver dysfunction is a major threat to the health of affected individuals, while pulmonary dysfunction is not a major concern. Beyond the first two to three decades of life, the natural history of people with severe deficiency of AAT is less clear, and the survival estimates for subjects with severe deficiency of AAT vary among series, presumably due to differences in study populations. Relatively normal survival appears possible for nonsmoking asymptomatic individuals,Â although long-term follow-up in a population-based study is needed for confirmation. The FEV1 is a major determinant of survival in AAT-deficient individuals, with the mortality rising as FEV1 falls below 35% of predicted. Other parameters that are used to predict are decreased lung density as assessed by chest CT.
