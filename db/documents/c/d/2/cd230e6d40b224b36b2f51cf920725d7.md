Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a primary headache syndrome characterized by recurrent unilateral episodes of headache associated with cranial autonomic symptoms. Headaches are sharp and stabbing in nature and occur greater than five times per day, up to forty times per day in some cases. Associated cranial autonomic features include ipsilateral lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, facial flushing, eyelid edema, miosis or mydriasis, diaphoresis, or aural fullness.

CPH is in a family of headache syndromes called the trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs). TACs are characterized by unilateral trigeminal nerve distribution pain that occurs in tandem with ipsilateral cranial nerve autonomic symptoms. The TACs include paroxysmal hemicrania, cluster headache, hemicrania continua, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT).

The international classification of headache disorders third edition (ICHD-3) defines chronic paroxysmal hemicrania as follows:

A. At least 20 attacks fulfilling criteria B to E without a remission period, or with remissions lasting less than three months, for at least one year:

B. Severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain lasting 2 to 30 minutes

C. Either or both of the following:

- At least one of the following symptoms or signs, ipsilateral to the headache:

- Conjunctival injection or lacrimation
- Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea
- Eyelid edema
- Forehead and facial sweating
- Miosis or ptosis

- A sense of restlessness or agitation

D. Occurring with a frequency greater than five per day

E. Prevented absolutely by therapeutic doses of indomethacin

F. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 disorder
