**Factors That Predict Successful Weaning from ECMO**

- Normal laboratory findings of lactic acid

- Echocardiographic evidence of complete cardiac recovery with EF >25%

- An aortic velocity-time interval of >10 cm on minimal ECMO support settings (1.5 L/min)

- Lateral mitral annulus peak systolic velocity (TDSa) > 6 cm on minimal ECMO support settings

- Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) >12mm on minimal ECMO support settings

- Mean pulse pressure- the higher the pulse pressure the more likely the patient can be successfully weaned.

- No signs of ventricular dilation with stable left and right-sided filling pressures

**Factors That Predict Mortality in Weaned Patients**

- Age >60 years old

- Prolonged ECMO with associated complications

- Low pH with high lactate levels

- Elevated sequential organ failure assessment score

When patients have a failure to wean from ECMO they should be properly identified with the discussion of long-term support or if the patient may need transplantation of their organs. The discussion should be performed to determine if the patient is a candidate for a ventricular assist device for a bridge to possible transplantation or if the patient or needs destination therapy with a ventricular assist device for the remainder of their life.
