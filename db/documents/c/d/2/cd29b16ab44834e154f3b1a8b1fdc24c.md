Perianal abscesses are the most common type of anorectal abscesses. These abscesses can cause significant discomfort for patients. They are located at the anal verge and if left untreated, can extend into the ischioanal space or intersphincteric space since these areas are continuous with the perianal space. They can also cause systemic infection if left untreated. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of perianal abscess and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of perianal abscess.
- Review the presentation of perianal abscess.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for perianal abscess.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with perianal abscess.
