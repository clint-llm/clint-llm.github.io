The venous plexuses that reside around the vertebral column allow for metastasis of cancer from the pelvis. The sacrum can also be the site for primary sarcomas. Sacral tumors can result in lumbosacral plexopathy.

Sacral fractures may occur secondary to trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accidents) or fall in the elderly. This trauma may lead to S2-S5 sacral nerve root injury that results in sexual dysfunction and bowel or bladder incontinence, which may present as peripheral numbness and decreased rectal tone in an acute setting.
