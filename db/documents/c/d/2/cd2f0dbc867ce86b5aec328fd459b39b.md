Before the procedure, the clinician should educate the patient on the risks/benefits, preventative measures, with patient expectations addressed. While a physician performs intralaminar epidural injections, there is a need for other personnel like the X-ray technician, nurse to monitor the patient, and a medical assistant to assist with the medications. During the procedure, the patient requires monitoring by the nurse. The intralaminar epidural injection is not a cure but a temporizing method of pain control. To improve outcomes, there should be coordination with physical/occupational therapy (PT/OT), primary care physicians, and neurosurgery/orthopedic surgery to determine which is the best method for more long-term pain relief. Patients should receive instruction from the physical therapist on proper biomechanics, strengthening/stretching exercises, ergonomics, and lifestyle changes. Reasonable consideration and exclusion of differential diagnoses, as well as the appropriate trial of conservative measures - including PT/OT, oral medications, and modalities - should be performed before any invasive procedure.
