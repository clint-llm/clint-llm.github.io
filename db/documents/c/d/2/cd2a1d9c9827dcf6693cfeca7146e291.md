There are three main indications for catheter ablation. (

- Definitive treatment of symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT), atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), unifocal atrial tachycardia, or atrial flutter;

- AF with lifestyle-impairing symptoms and failure of antiarrhythmic agents.

- Symptomatic idiopathic ventricular tachycardia (VT).

However, for VT in the setting of structural heart disease, catheter ablation is generally reserved for failure of drug-therapy or as adjunctive therapy in the setting of frequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharges
