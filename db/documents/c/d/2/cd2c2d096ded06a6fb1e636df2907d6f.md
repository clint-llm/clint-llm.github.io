**Manual Approach: Physiotherapy**

All the superficial and deep muscular layers must be considered when SCM dysfunction needs to be addressed.

For congenital torticollis, representing a third of congenital muscular abnormalities, physiotherapy plays an important role in either solving the dysfunction or accelerating recovery after a possible surgery. Recommended conservative therapy includes stretching exercises, voluntary movements to improve posture (if the child is not too small), or modifications in the child's posture made by the parents.

Some pathologies may require an initial surgical approach, including intramuscular hemangioma, pseudosarcomatous proliferative myositis, pseudotumor of infancy (fibromatosis colli), and rupture of the sternocleidomastoid.

Recent studies show that the SCM has increased electrical activity in patients with chronic neck pain compared to subjects without chronic pain. Patients suffering from chronic cervical pain demonstrate a more significant fat infiltration within the SCM than patients without pain.

Additionally, alterations of the electromyographic spectrum of the SCM are linked to the presence of temporomandibular disorders. This evaluation approach can be a tool to verify the existence of mandibular dysfunctions.

**Osteopathy and Manual Therapy**

Osteopathic treatment to help SCM recovery after surgery should also positively affect scar formation. With gentle and non-invasive techniques, osteopathic manipulation can address all myofascial layers of the neck and the spaces between the cervical vertebrae.
