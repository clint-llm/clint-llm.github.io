In the setting of “red flags,” aggressive diagnosis and likely surgical options should be explored. Examples of these red flags include:

- Cauda equina syndrome (issues controlling bowel/bladder, difficulty starting urination)

- Infection (high suspicion in IV drug user, history of fever, nighttime chills)

- Tumor suspected (known history of cancer; new-onset weight loss)

- Trauma (fall, assault, collision)

Fortunately, the majority of patients will improve without surgical treatment. A course of at least 6 weeks of physical therapy with an emphasis on core strengthening and stretching should be attempted. Non-surgical intervention includes cognitive therapy, lifestyle modification and modification of the activity that may exacerbate the pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), and epidural injections. Epidural injections may provide moderate, short-term relief of pain due to disc herniations, but the literature regarding the usefulness of injections for chronic non-radiating back pain is less certain. Certainly, the literate does not advocate against injections as a non-operative treatment option.

Unfortunately, many patients do not respond to conservative treatment. With a failed conservative course, the patient has three options: (1) continued pain, (2) complete avoidance of activities that elicit pain, or (3) surgical intervention. Again, the surgical options for disc herniations, as well as degenerative spinal stenosis, should be reserved for those with either neurologic deficits, degenerative spondylolisthesis, or pain limiting daily functions.

Operative intervention includes:

- Lumbar discectomy with fusion: The Swedish Lumbar Spine Study Group has reported systematic evidence on the superiority of outcomes of fusion for degenerative lumbar disc disease when compared with nonsurgical treatment.

- Lumbar total disc replacement:

One of the most cited guides on the outcomes of surgical versus conservative management for lumbar disc herniations comes from the Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT). In their report, patients electing for surgery had better outcomes at 3 months,  years, and 4 years compared to patients who did not elect surgery. The literature regarding the optimal surgical procedure, approach, and roles for decompression/instrumentation continues to expand. Literature shows that a traditional open surgery compared to a microdiscectomy, is broadly similar in outcomes and effectiveness. In regards to the amount of disc removed during a discectomy, while a “limited” discectomy provides better pain relief and patient satisfaction compared to a subtotal discectomy, they have a higher risk of repeat herniations. Patient outcomes and satisfaction are similar in repeat/revision micro discectomies as compared to their initial discectomy. The operation, at times, requires overnight hospitalization; but frequently, these surgeries are designed to be outpatient procedures.

The patient needs to understand that while surgical intervention has favorable outcomes for relieving radicular pains, the results are less predictable for non-radiating lower back pain.
