Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a group of genetic conditions inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.

Several different gene mutations (insertion, deletion, frameshifts, missense, and nonsense mutations) can cause Waardenburg syndrome. There are four clinical variants, type 1 and type 2 are the most common types. Type 1 is due to the mutations in the PAX3 gene, which clinically manifests as congenital deafness (sensorineural), dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of medial corner of eyes), neural tube defects, cleft palate, and lip with patchy depigmentation of hair and skin. These symptoms are associated with pigmentary abnormalities of the eyes. Type II WS is due to mutations in the MITF gene.

The inner canthi of both eyes are normal but have some other features similar to  type-1. Type-III WS is an extreme presentation of type I with the abnormality of upper limbs. Type IV WS is due to mutations in the genes for one of its receptors, EDNRB or endothelin-3, usually autosomal recessive. As it is a genetic disease, there is no definitive treatment for Waardenburg syndrome, but supportive treatment with cochlear implants and surgery in case of association with Hirschsprung syndrome can be done. Genetic counseling is necessary.
