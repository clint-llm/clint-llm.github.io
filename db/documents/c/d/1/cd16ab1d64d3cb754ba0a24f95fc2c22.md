Patient and caregiver education should be at the forefront of frontotemporal dementia management plans. Information regarding the disease process and progression, especially the behavioral components, can alleviate social stress and guilt associated with potential, perceived patient misconduct. Preparing families and caregivers for the physical, psychological, social, and financial toll that may follow the diagnosis can stabilize the care environment and promote the overall effectiveness of the care team.
