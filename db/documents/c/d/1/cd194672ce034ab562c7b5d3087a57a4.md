As previously stated, cardiac outflow separation occurs around week six. The truncus arteriosus becomes divided into an ascending aorta and pulmonary artery via spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum. Failure of spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum results in a congenital heart defect known as transposition of the great arteries. In this condition, the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk are flipped, creating a right to left shunt.

The aorta arises from the right ventricle, and the pulmonary trunk arises from the left ventricle. As a result, physiologic changes occur in theÂ ventricles. The high pressure of the aorta will cause right ventricular hypertrophy. The low pressure of the pulmonary artery will cause left ventricular atrophy. This condition is incompatible with life unless a shunt is present, which allows the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
