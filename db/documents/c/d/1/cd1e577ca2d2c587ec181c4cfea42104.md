Benign murmurs tend to resolve with time, though some may still progress onto adulthood never showing any symptoms. When a murmur is deemed benign, there is no need for further clinical monitoring and the patient should live a healthy normal life. It is only important to document such findings as to prevent further stress and unnecessary work-up in the future. It should be noted that no activity restrictions or endocardial prophylaxis are needed as to not deprive the child/patient of any sports or work participation.
