Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide (antimicrobial drug class) that works directly on the synthesis of folate inside microbial organisms, e.g., bacteria. Sulfamethoxazole achieves this directly as a competitor of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) during the synthesis of dihydrofolate via inhibition of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. Trimethoprim is a direct competitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in its inhibition, which halts the production of tetrahydrofolate to its active form of folate. The combination of these two agents is meant to create a synergistic anti-folate effect; tetrahydrofolate is a necessary component for synthesizing purines required for DNA and protein production. When used alone, these drugs only act in a bacteriostatic manner. However, when used in the combination of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, they block two steps in the bacterial biosynthesis of essential nucleic acids and proteins, thus can be bactericidal, e.g., urine.

Sulfamethoxazole is hepatically metabolized by the CYP450 system; it is a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Its half-life is 6 to 12 hours, increasing to between 20 and 50 hours in renal failure. Trimethoprim has a half-life of 8 to 10 hours, is minimally metabolized in the liver, and is primarily excreted in the urine, essentially unchanged.
