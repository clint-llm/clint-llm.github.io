Risk factors for the acquisition of mutations in key genes leading to neuroblastoma have yet to be identified, although exposures during conception and pregnancy are a topic of investigation. Neuroblastoma can develop either sporadically or be transmitted in the germline. Most familial cases of neuroblastoma occur due to the inheritance of highly penetrant mutations in either the ALK or PHOX2B genes.ALK, more common transforming mutations involve polymorphisms in BARD1 (2q35), LIN28B (6q16.3), or FLJ22536 (6p22.3). Cytogenetic aberrations can further include loss of chromosome 1p and 11q, copy number variation in 1q21, and gain of 17q.
