Emphysema is caused by chronic and significant exposure to noxious gases, of which cigarette smoking remains the most common cause, and 80% to 90% of patients with COPD are cigarette smokers identified, with 10% to 15% of smokers developing COPD. However, in smokers, the symptoms also depend on the intensity of smoking, years of exposure, and baseline lung function. Symptoms usually begin after at least 20 packs per year of tobacco exposure.

Biomass fuels and other environmental pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and particulate matter are recognized as important causes in developing countries affecting women and children greatly. A rare hereditary autosomal recessive disease, alpha one antitrypsin deficiency, can also lead to emphysema and liver abnormalities. However, it only contributes to 1% to 2% of cases of COPD. It is a proven risk factor and can present with pan-acinar bibasilar emphysema early in life.

Other etiological factors are passive smoking, lung infections, and allergies. Moreover, low birth weight as a newborn makes one more prone to develop COPD later in life.
