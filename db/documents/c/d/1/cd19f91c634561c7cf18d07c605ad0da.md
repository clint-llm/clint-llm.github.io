The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is indicated for patients with paroxysmal vertigo in whom benign positional paroxysmal vertigo is considered in the differential. These patients experience vertigo in brief episodes lasting less than one minute with changes of head position and return to total normalcy between episodes. Light-headedness or a sensation of nausea might last longer than one minute, but if the sensation of movement persists for more than one-minute alternative diagnoses must be considered. Dizziness is a common complaint, and serious causes must be considered and excluded first. Non-paroxysmal vertigo is more likely to be caused by a vestibular syndrome or central etiology, such as brainstem stroke.
