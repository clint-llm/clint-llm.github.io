Radiologic findings depend on the form of silicosis. In simple silicosis, chest X-ray shows variable features consisting mainly in well-defined opacities ranging from 1 to 10 mm in diameter, located in the upper lobe and posterior portion of the lung. CT-scan findings consist of multiple small nodules with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Some nodules may be calcified.

In acute silicosis, chest X-ray shows bilateral consolidation associated with ground-glass opacities. CT-scan findings consist of numerous centrilobular ground-glass opacities with consolidation.
