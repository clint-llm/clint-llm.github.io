Cameron lesions are a rare cause of upper GI bleeding that is localized to the gastric body mucosa of patients with large hiatal hernias. It causes occult bleeding and chronic iron-deficiency anemia. These lesions are often missed on initial endoscopy and can cause fatal complications. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Cameron lesion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of Cameron lesions.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with Cameron lesions.
- Describe the laboratory and imaging findings associated with Cameron lesions. 
- Review some interprofessional team strategies that can contribute to improved outcomes for patients with Cameron lesions.
