The vestibular nucleus spans from the rostral medulla to the caudal pons. It is located bilaterally along the floor of the fourth ventricle and is lateral to the sulcus limitans.

The vestibular complex subdivides into four major nuclei:

- Lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN)

- Medial vestibular nucleus (MVN)

- Superior vestibular nucleus (SVN)

- Descending (inferior) vestibular nucleus (DVN)

- **LVN**- The LVN, also known as Deiter’s nucleus, extends along the lateral column of the vestibular complex. It is bordered by the SVN, MVN, and DVN. Lateral to the LVN are the sensory fibers of CN VIII.

- **MVN**- The MVN, also known as the nucleus of Schwalbe, is the largest of the four nuclei in total cell volume and, unlike the others, runs mostly in the medial column.

- **SVN**- The SVN, also known as the nucleus of Bechterew, extends along the lateral column in an elongated, elliptical form. It is the most rostral of the vestibular nuclei. It is bordered ventral-laterally by the LVN, dorsally by the superior cerebellar peduncle, and medially by the fourth ventricle. Additionally, it also merges with the trigeminal nucleus ventrally.

- **DVN**- The DVN is the most caudal of the nuclei and is neighbored superiorly by the LVN, medially by the MVN, posteriorly by the lower end of the fourth ventricle, and anteriorly by the reticular formation.
