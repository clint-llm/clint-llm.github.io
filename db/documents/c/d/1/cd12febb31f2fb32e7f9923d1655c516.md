Multiple etiologies for esophagitis have been identified such as reflux esophagitis, Medication (Pills) induced esophagitis, infectious , eosinophilic and radiation esophagitis.

- Reflux or erosive esophagitis that occurs because of the reflux of gastric contents into the stomach leading to mucosal injury is one of the most common causes of esophagitis.

- Infection esophagitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungal and parasitic microorganisms with the least common being bacteria and the most common being fungal.

- Pill induced esophagitis is most commonly associated with oral bisphosphonates like alendronate, some antibiotics like tetracycline, doxycycline, and clindamycin. NSAIDs, aspirin, ferrous sulfate, potassium chloride, and mexiletine has also been reported as a cause of pill-induced esophagitis.

- Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is now thought to be a chronic immune antigen-related esophageal disease with almost similar symptoms of esophagitis but histologically have squamous mucosal inflammation caused by predominant eosinophilic infiltration.

- Radiation-induced esophagitis is associated with radiotherapy related toxicity and can present as both in acute and chronic forms.
