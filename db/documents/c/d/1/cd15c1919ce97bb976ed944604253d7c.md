Yellow nail syndrome (YNS) frequently goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for many years. These patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms including cough, recurrent infection, lower extremity edema, and nail discoloration, which are present in conditions far more prevalent than YNS, such as heart failure, venous insufficiency, infection, or medication side-effect. It can lead to patients being referred to a myriad of specialists in the fields of cardiology, infectious disease, endocrinology, and pulmonology. Although a more common illness is more likely in patients who present with 2 or 3 signs and symptoms of the triad of YNS, health professionals must communicate effectively and rule out these other illnesses in a way that limits unnecessary testing, treatment, and consultation. Health care providers need to keep YNS on the differential as it is a clinical diagnosis.

Approximately one-third of patients with YNS have all three signs/symptoms simultaneously.
