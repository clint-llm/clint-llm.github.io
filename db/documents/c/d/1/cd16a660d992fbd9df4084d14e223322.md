It is a rapidly fatal tumor with mortality within six months from liver failure or hemorrhage. Tumor rupture may occur and result in hemoperitoneum. Once this happens, transarterial embolization is usually the first intervention done to stabilize the patient and stop the bleed. However, there is no definite recommendation on treating acute bleeding of liver angiosarcoma due to the rarity of the tumor. Some patients have also been reported to develop features of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
