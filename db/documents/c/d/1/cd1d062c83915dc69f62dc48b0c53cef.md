This guidance is relevant for medical and nursing staff in ICU, OR, renal dialysis units, and chemotherapy units where frequent interactions with CVCs are likely. The settings with a prolonged patient stay or where patients will be treated as outpatients with indwelling catheters for long periods should pay particular attention.

The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommends: "Healthcare workers caring for a patient with a vascular access device should be trained, and assessed as competent, in using and consistently adhering to the infection prevention practices described in this guideline."
