The pathology in dermatitis herpetiformis and GSE results from an IgA dominant autoimmune response to transglutaminase molecules. In GSE, the principal target is tissue transglutaminase, whereas in dermatitis herpetiformis there is increasing evidence that epidermal transglutaminase 3 (TG3) may be the dominant antigen. Both proteins have significant homologies in their enzymatic domains and are expressed in normal epidermis, where TG3 is important in cross-linking and maintenance of the cornified envelope.

The series of events that result in inflammation and itch in dermatitis herpetiformis remains to be fully elucidated. Hypotheses include the release of TG3 from keratinocytes into the papillary dermis, where it can bind circulating IgA antibodies, or that circulating complexes of TG3 and IgA are deposited in the skin.
