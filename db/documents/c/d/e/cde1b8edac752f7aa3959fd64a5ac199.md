Burns commonly present acutely. They can be due to many modalities, including thermal, chemical, electrical, or radiation. Often, burns result in superficial (first degree) and partial thickness (second degree) burns, and less commonly full-thickness (third-degree) burns. Circumferential, full-thickness burns, whether on limbs or trunk can produce a splinting or tourniquet effect which compromises limb circulation and may reduce respiratory muscle movement, resulting in limited respiratory function. This is due to the inflexibility of the damaged tissue, which is caused by eschar formation. If untreated, this can result in distal ischemia, compartment syndrome, respiratory failure, tissue necrosis, or death. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and techniques for performing an escharotomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of burn patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for an escharotomy.
- Describe the technique used for escharotomy.
- Identify the complications of escharotomy.
- Explain how interprofessional team's coordination and communication in burn patients requiring an escharotomy can improve outcomes.
