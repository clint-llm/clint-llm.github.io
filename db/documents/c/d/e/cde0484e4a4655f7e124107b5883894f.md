The cardiovascular system consists of two main loops, systemic circulation, and pulmonary circulation. The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to provide adequate circulation of blood through the body. Pulmonary circulation allows for the oxygenation of the blood, and systemic circulation provides for oxygenated blood and nutrients to reach the rest of the body.
