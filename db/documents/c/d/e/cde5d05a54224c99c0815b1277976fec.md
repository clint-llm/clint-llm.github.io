If the level of occlusion is at the ophthalmic artery, there may be no treatment options available to the patient. This is because posterior ciliary circulation is blocked, and there is no collateral circulation to the inner layers of the retina.

Therapy must be started before the tissue is irreparably damaged.

The degree and location of occlusion will affect the response to treatment.

The adequate partial pressure of oxygen must be maintained long enough for the retinal vessels to recanalize. This usually occurs within 72 hours.

The largest published case series (Hayreh) showed the natural progression of disease without treatment with hyperbaric oxygen.

- Some patients had transient symptoms for minutes to hours that resolved without treatment, and theyÂ were left with minimal visual impairment.

- ABout 80% of patients without cilioretinal arteries had the final visual outcome of finger counting or less, and only 1.5% had a final vision of 20/40 or better in the affected eye.

- Patients with cilioretinal arteries had much better outcomes the those who did not.
