Vasodilation occurs when the smooth muscle located in the blood vessel walls relax. Relaxation can be due to either removal of a contractile stimulus or inhibition of contractility. Numerous stimuli, including acetylcholine, ATP, adenosine, bradykinin, histamine, and shear stress, can activate eNOS and COX pathways that form nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, respectively. NO and prostacyclin produced within endothelial cells utilizes intracellular secondary messengers. NO primarily uses cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) for cellular effects, whereas prostacyclin effects are primarily mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

Other mediators involved in vasodilation are generated during enhanced muscle activity. These stimuli include pCO2, lactate, K, and adenosine. Venous pCO2 levels increase during exercise due to the high turnover of the Krebs cycle to meet the oxygen demands of skeletal muscle. There is a net gain in lactic acid produced by exercising muscle due to increased glycolysis activity. Skeletal muscle cells release K ions into the interstitium during an action potential. During exercise, there is also an increase in the breakdown of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), yielding adenosine. The above mediators produced can diffuse to adjacent arterioles and have powerful vasodilatory effects to increase the oxygen and nutrient supply to exercising muscle when demand is enhanced.
