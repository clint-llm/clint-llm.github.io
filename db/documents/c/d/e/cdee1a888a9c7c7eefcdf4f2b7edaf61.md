Prevention is crucial in good outcomes for patients with latex allergy. Ancillary staff, technicians, nurses, and clinicians involved in caring for the patient are the first line in the prevention of incidental exposure to latex if the patient is admitted to the hospital. If they have symptoms, an allergist and immunologist would be helpful in determining if there is sensitization and a true latex allergy. Lastly, if there are persistent symptoms, a dermatologist could be consulted to aid in the treatment.
