**Surgical pearls in preventing complications:**

- Resecting insular block provides a window for subsequent disconnection procedures

- The most common reasons for seizure persistence include incomplete corpus callosotomy, frontoparietal disconnection, and incomplete insular resection.

- The early placement of cottonoid at the foramen of Monro minimizes, along with the prophylactic EVD placement, minimizes the risk of hydrocephalus.

- The osteoplastic bone flap ensures better cosmetic results with reduced risk of the surgical site infection.

**Surgical and functional outcomes:**

Functional hemispherectomy/hemispherotomy provides equivocal seizure control (80% seizure-free Engel class 1 at two years) in comparison to that of the anatomical hemispherectomy. The pediatric population also shows significant neurocognitive and behavioral improvement following epilepsy surgery.

Motor deficits also gradually improve, with 84% of patients eventually being able to walk independently or with minimal assistance.
