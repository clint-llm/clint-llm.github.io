Tinea manuum is a superficial mycosis of the palm, dorsum, or interdigital folds of one or both hands. It is usually caused by dermatophytes, although rare cases caused by Hendersonula toruloidea and Scytalidium hyalinum have been reported in the literature.

Tinea manuum frequently coexists with tinea pedis, but occasionally, localized forms may affect the hands exclusively. Tinea manuum is distributed worldwide, and, as with other dermatophytoses, other people (anthropophilic), animals (zoophilic), and soil (geophilic) are the most common sources in the United States.
