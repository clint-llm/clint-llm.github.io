The radial notch of the ulna articulates with the medial side of the radial head to form the PRUJ.

The annular ligament attaches anteriorly to the radial notch, courses around the radial head, and attaches posteriorly to the radial notch, stabilizing the joint during rotation.

The lateral collateral ligamentous (LCL) complex consists of the annular ligament in addition to the radial- and ulnar-components of the LCL complex.  The LCL complex has contiguous fibers that also insert and become confluent with the annular ligament.  The LCL complex originates on the lateral humeral epicondyle near the axis of elbow rotation. The LUCL attaches distally to the supinator crest.

The quadrate ligament limits the rotation of the radial head by attaching the radial neck to the inferior portion of the radial notch. There is also a minimal limitation of supination from the oblique cord, a cord of fibrous tissue that runs from the ulnar tuberosity to just inferior of the bicipital tuberosity.
