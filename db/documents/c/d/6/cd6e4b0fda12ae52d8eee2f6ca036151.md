Because of the availability of the HIB vaccine, acute epiglottitis due to H. influenzae is less common (though this is sporadically increasing due to public misconception regarding vaccination), though still remains the single most common pathogen responsible for the condition in both adults and children. Thus, most health care providers may have less insight into the disorder. This lack often leads to delays in starting antibiotics. Acute epiglottitis can result in sudden airway obstruction. It is never wise to send the patient anywhere without proper monitoring and resuscitative equipment if this diagnosis is remotely suspected.

Other conditions that can mimic the presentation include an airway obstruction from a foreign object, acute angioedema, caustic ingestion causing airway compromise, diphtheria, or peritonsillar and retropharyngeal abscesses.
