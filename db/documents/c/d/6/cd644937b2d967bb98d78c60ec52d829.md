Damage to the gluteus minimus or the superior gluteal nerve may result in a Trendelenburg gait (gluteal gait). A positive Trendelenburg sign demonstrates pelvic sagging on an unsupported side when asked to stand on one leg; this indicates that the abductor muscles on the ipsilateral (supported) side are weak or non-functional. The gait presents as an individual leaning towards the supported side during the swing phase of the gait to compensate for an appeared longer lower extremity due to the pelvis sagging on the unsupported side. Fractures to the greater trochanter may result in a Trendelenburg gait due to the location of the distal attachments of gluteus minimus.

Tendinopathy of the gluteus minimus results in a condition known as greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). GTPS is characterized by lateral hip pain. It is often confused with trochanteric bursitis, which is a misleading term due to the direct involvement of the bursae and its very rare occurrence. Greater trochanteric pain syndrome presents similarly to tendinopathy of the rotator cuff muscles in which the disorder occurs at the trochanteric enthesis. A physical examination will reveal tenderness to palpation of the greater trochanter and observation of a Trendelenburg gait.
