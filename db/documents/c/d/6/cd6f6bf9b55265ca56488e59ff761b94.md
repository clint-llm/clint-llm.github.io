These patients with refractory angina that can undergo transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis (TMLR) are those that are unable to perform daily routine activities such as climbing stairs, walking a block, or cleaning the furniture in the house without experiencing chest pain. Their quality of life is poor, and they have reduced life expectancy. These patients have quit smoking and have already tried multiple times optimal medical management therapies and standard revascularizations. When there is no available option left to relieve symptoms of angina, TMLR is available.

On physical exam, there is no specific constellation of findings that indicated refractory angina that needs TMLR. In general, cardiac examination should be done. Usually, these patients will show signs and symptoms of stable angina. They have episodic chest pain from stress or exertion. During an episode, they can also experience tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, anxiety. They can have S3 or S4 sounds on physical examination. EKG must be obtained in any patient that comes in with chest pain. EKG for these patients might show transient ST-segment depression or no findings at all.
