Stable fractures are typically immobilized 4 to 8 weeks followed by rehab and bracing another 4 to 6 weeks until pain-free ROM and have achieved normal strength. Unstable fractures are often immobilized 6 to 12 weeks, followed by work until regaining motion and strength.

Pain management is always a concern in the postoperative periods. One study showed that transdermal buprenorphine and codeine-acetaminophen provided superior pain control than celecoxib in the six weeks following ORIF with a volar locking plate, thus citing better compliance and faster functional recovery.

AAOS 2009 Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend adjuvant treatment with vitamin D for the prevention of CRPS development following distal radius fractures (moderate level of recommendation).

Preventive measures of distal radius fractures mainly revolve around fall prevention, which is especially relevant in the elderly population.
