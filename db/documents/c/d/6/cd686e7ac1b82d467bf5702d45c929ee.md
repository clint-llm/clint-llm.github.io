The thyroid gland, consisting of two connected lobes, is one of the largest endocrine glands in the human body, weighing 20 to 30 g in adults.

Thyroid adenomas are benign lesions of the thyroid gland. These lesions may be inactive or active in producing thyroid hormones. In the case of being active, they may be referred to as toxic thyroid adenomas. Patients with thyroid adenomas are usually asymptomatic. However, biochemical and clinical hyperthyroidism can be caused by a toxic adenoma, defined as an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (AFTN). Most thyroid adenomas do not cause any symptoms and are usually diagnosed incidentally by ultrasound of the thyroid gland. Less frequently, they might present as a palpable thyroid nodule or generally as an easily seen growth on a patient's neck.
