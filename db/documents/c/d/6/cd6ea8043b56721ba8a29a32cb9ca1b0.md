The clinical presentation of hypertyrosinemia varies depending on the etiology.

HT1 is the most severe type of hypertyrosinemia and presents in two forms. The acute form presents within the first two months of life. The usual presentation is hepatomegaly, jaundice, bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, and a deranged coagulation profile.

Without treatment, death from progressive liver failure may ensue in the first two years of life. The chronic form presents with a milder phenotype characterized by chronic liver disease and hypophosphatemic rickets related to renal Fanconi syndrome. Other features described are failure to thrive, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and respiratory failure.

HT2 typically presents with eye and skin involvement in the first year of life. Eye symptoms include photophobia and excessive lacrimation due to dendritic keratitis caused by the deposition of tyrosine crystal over the cornea. Skin lesions comprise tender hyperkeratotic plaques involving palms, soles, elbows, knees, and ankles. Almost one-half of the patients with HT2 also have varying degrees of intellectual disability.

Patients with HT3 present with neurological symptoms ranging from ataxia to seizures and intellectual disability. An HT3 patient with a normal phenotype has also been reported in the literature.
