Diaphyseal femur fractures are commonly encountered in association with other high-energy injuries. These injuries can lead to life-threatening sequelae. Prompt intervention and thoughtful management lead to the best patient outcomes. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of diaphyseal femur fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of injury that can lead to a diaphyseal femur fracture.
- Review the approach for evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential diaphyseal femur fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Outline the treatment options for diaphyseal femur fractures, depending on patient population and fracture severity and location.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of diaphyseal femur fracture and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
