While the pathophysiology of oral lichen planus is not entirely understood, the two main proposed mechanisms are antigen-specific and non-specific mechanisms.

The antigen-specific mechanism suggests that antigen presentation by Langerhans cells or basal keratinocytes leads to the activation of CD4+ helper T cells, stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory T-helper 1 (Th1) cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ).

The non-specific mechanism suggests that the activation of mast cells releases pro-inflammatory mediators such as proteases and the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases. This results in T cell infiltration of the superficial lamina propria, disruption of the basement membrane, and eventual keratinocyte apoptosis.

The chronic nature of OLP has been postulated to be due to the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and the inhibition of the transforming growth factor control pathway (TGF-β/Smad), leading to hyperkeratosis and the appearance of distinct white lesions.
