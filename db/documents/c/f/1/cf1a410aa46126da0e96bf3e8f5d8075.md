Pandya et al. examined specimens from 27 patients with OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) who received radiation therapy involving the jaw and neck. He found significant tissue atrophy and severity of dysplasia, an increased presence of fibrinous exudative necrosis, vessel wall thickening, with oropharyngeal ectasia of the salivary gland. In addition, dense fibrosis with thick fibers was a common finding of post-radiation tissue in the same patients. Similar findings at other sites may be inferred regarding increased tissue fibrosis and hypoxia due to damaged microvasculature; glands within the dermal layer will also be affected similarly. These findings again confirmed the microvasculature thrombosis and tissue fibrosis characteristic of post-radiation skin changes that lead to eventual ulcers.
