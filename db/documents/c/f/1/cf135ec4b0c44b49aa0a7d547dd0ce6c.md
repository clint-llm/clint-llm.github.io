NSAIDs have long been used as safe and effective over-the-counter and prescription formulations for pain relief and fever reduction. It is estimated that 14 million Americans age 45 and older use NSAIDs daily. As the population continues to age, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) expects a marked rise in the use of this drug class that will mirror the expected increased prevalence of painful conditions, such as osteoarthritis and inflammatory diseases. It then comes as no surprise that the rate of adverse events associated with NSAID consumption will also likely escalate. Previous studies have shown that 5% to 7% of hospital admissions result from drug toxicity, with non-aspirin NSAIDs contributing to 11% to 12% of those admissions.
