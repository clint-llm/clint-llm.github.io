In addition to the fluoroscopy instrument, preferably with a biplane camera or a C-arm, a standardized LP kit is required. It contains a 22 or 25 gauge spinal needle, 10 ml of Lidocaine 1%, gauze pieces, paper drapes, skin disinfectant material, and a short 25 gauge needle for the lidocaine subcutaneous administration. The regular spinal (Quincke) needle is a traumatic needle with a cutting bevel. The Sprotte or Whitacre needles are non-traumatic needles. The choice of the needle depends on the physician's preference and training. Both types of needles have pros and cons. Although the non-traumatic needles have fewer chances of post lumbar puncture headache, they are difficult to maneuver and assess the depth. Therefore, the 22 or 25 gauge size needles are commonly used. Typically a 3.5 inches needle is sufficient, but a long needle with a length of 5.5 inches should be available if required.
