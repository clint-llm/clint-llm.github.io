Routine examinations with a gynecologist are encouraged for the long-term combined oral pill or intrauterine device birth control options to monitor side effects and possible pregnancy. Levonorgestrel undergoes metabolism by the liver and is subject to impairment in patients with liver dysfunction. Therefore, monitoring liver function tests at the time of administration may be beneficial. Also, drugs containing CYP3A4 cytochrome p450 liver-enzyme inducing properties require close vigilance when a patient takes levonorgestrel. Patients may need to consider another emergency contraceptive method to avoid drug-drug interactions. These liver-enzyme-inducing drugs can cause rapid metabolism and decrease the efficacy of levonorgestrel when there is concomitant use.
