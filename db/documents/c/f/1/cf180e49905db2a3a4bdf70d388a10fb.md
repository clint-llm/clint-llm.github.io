Other causes of optic disc edema such as from intraocular inflammation, central retinal vein occlusion, compressive optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, diabetic papillopathy, and ischemic optic neuropathy should be distinguished.

Pseudopapilledema also presents with elevated optic nerve head appearance and blurred margins.Â  It may be a result of congenital dysplasia, optic disc drusen, or tilted optic disc.
