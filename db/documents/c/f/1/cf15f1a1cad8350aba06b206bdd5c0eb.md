Simulation of situations such as fires has proven to be an efficacious way of preparing employees to handle such situations. Therefore, virtual reality devices may be used to simulate fires and prepare staff to respond to fires appropriately.

While OSHA fire safety guidelines are the same between different organizations, carrying out these guidelines may look different at various institutions, so quality improvement projects can play an important role in individualizing an emergency response plan to fires within the operating room.

Community outreach and patient education are also essential to help people prevent and respond to fires. Programs for people at higher risk, or care for people at higher risk, such as children, to experience fire-related injury both improve their knowledge of fire safety and enhance actionable steps taken to prevent fires.

Finally, identifying patients at the highest risk of being harmed by fires, whether it be because of working in a high-risk profession, having little background in fire safety, or living in conditions where fires are more likely, should be performed. Specifically, working with these populations to improve their competency in fire safety may improve outcomes in the event of a fire.

Fire safety cannot be stressed enough, given the high risk of casualty when a fire occurs. Prevention strategies and proper treatment can save lives and improve overall outcomes.
