Pertinent to factor V Leiden, it is essential to understand the relative risk of VTE risk compared to other thrombophilia conditions that help to guide management decisions. This risk is depicted in the below format for easy understanding.

Protein S deficiency

So a patient having conditions like heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, heterozygous prothrombin gene mutation, protein C, and protein S deficiency do not require lifetime anticoagulation. Thus patients with these thrombophilia conditions, management is no different than the management guidelines of the general population. Per ASH guidelines, 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation is recommended for the first episode of venous thrombosis. Duration of anticoagulation in individuals with underlying other thrombosis-provoking conditions like malignancy that increases their risk for recurrent DVT needs to be made based on the underlying condition rather than based on these these thrombophilia conditions.
