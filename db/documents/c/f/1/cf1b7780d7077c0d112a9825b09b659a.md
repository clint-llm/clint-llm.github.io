As previously described, there is squamous epithelium above the ring and columnar epithelium below it. This differentiates it from esophageal webs, which have squamous (esophageal) epithelium on both sides. In initial studies, it was described as being triangle-shaped on cross-section and formed by a core of connective tissue with an overgrowth of muscularis mucosa and smooth muscle fibers creating an annular band.
