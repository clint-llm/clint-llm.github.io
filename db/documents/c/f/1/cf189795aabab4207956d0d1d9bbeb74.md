LGEA may have anatomical variations. For example, one study reported a very rare variation discovered by cadaver dissection. After its splenic origin, it could cross the pancreatic parenchyma in its posterior superficial portion; it exits posteriorly from the superior border of the pancreas, to finally branch into an omental branch, into a duplicated LGEA and another branch that ends in the main trunk of the left gastroepiploic artery.
