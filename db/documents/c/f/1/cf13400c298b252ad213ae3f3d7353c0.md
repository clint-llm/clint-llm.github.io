Early treatment with hyperbaric oxygen is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality as well as maximizing salvageable tissue. Some studies have demonstrated a 50% relative mortality reduction with the addition of hyperbaric oxygen to surgery and antibiotic therapy.  Clostridium perfringens growth is restricted at O2 tensions up to 70 mm Hg, and alpha-toxin production is halted at tensions of 250 mm Hg. High O2 tensions also achieve bacteriostasis, encourage free radical formation, and facilitate neutrophilic oxidative burst function.

Because alpha-toxin production is rapid and tissue infection can spread up to 6 inches an hour, adequate HBO treatment not only halts the disease process but also allows for optimal debridement since a clearer delineation of dead versus viable tissue can be seen. Recommended treatment is O2 at 3 ATA for 90 minutes three times in the first 24 hours and twice a day for the next 2 to 5 days. Treatment length should be tailored to the patient’s therapeutic response. Surgical debridement should be performed in between HBO treatments. Proper antibiotic therapy is also essential; animal models favor the combination of intravenous penicillin plus clindamycin.
