The LCA is typically benign with an excellent prognosis post-splenectomy. However, there have been reported cases of malignant LCA. A literature review by Sarandria et al. of 180 LCA cases revealed that massive splenomegaly (splenic weight greater than or equal to 1500 gm and/or length greater than 20 cm preoperatively) is associated with malignant transformation (p-value < 0.05).
