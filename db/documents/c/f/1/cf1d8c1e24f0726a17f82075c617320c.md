The pulmonary veins are extremelyÂ vascular. Any surgical procedure in the thorax should be careful not to damage them. There are several congenital conditions associated with left pulmonary malformation, as mentioned below. Most of these conditions require surgical correction if medical management has failed.

The pulmonary veins merit consideration during any surgical procedure of the lung, such as a segmentectomy, lobectomy, or transplant. Indications for these interventions are commonly cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, emphysema, benign tumor, or malignancy. Traditionally these procedures were done openly through a posterolateral thoracotomy approach. A relatively new minimally invasive technique in thoracic surgery, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, VATS, has shown to have a lower incidence of complications than classic open surgery.
