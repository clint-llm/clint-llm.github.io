Variable data have been reported on the incidence of fat embolism and fat embolism syndrome. Clinical diagnosis of small fat embolism or mild cases of fat embolism syndrome may be missed and go away unnoticed. In one study, about 67% of orthopedic trauma patients have fat globules in their blood. If the blood sample was taken from a site close to the area of the fracture, the incidence is closer to 95%.

Fat embolism and fat embolism syndrome also can occur intraoperatively while repairing a long bone fracture. With a transesophageal echocardiogram, fat embolism has been detected in close to 41% of patients.

Fat embolism has a higher incidence than fat embolism syndrome. In the landmark study carried out by Gurd, using the established clinical criteria, an incidence of 19% of fat embolism syndrome was reported in a group of trauma patients. Since early open reduction and internal fixation has become the standard of care for repairing fractures of long bones, the incidence of fat embolism and fat embolism syndrome has gradually decreased. Most recent studies show an incidence of about 1% to 11%.
