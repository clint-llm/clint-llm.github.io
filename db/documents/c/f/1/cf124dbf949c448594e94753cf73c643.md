There is clear evidence that supports pediatric dyslipidemia with the onset and severity of atherosclerosis. Lipid profiles during late childhood and adolescence predict lipid profiles in adulthood in the third and fourth decades. Screening for dyslipidemia is beneficial in childrenÂ with additional risk factors like diabetes, obesity, and a family history of premature atherosclerosis.

Children with FH have a 90% lifetime risk of developing coronary artery disease. In children with FH, changes in endothelial function and carotid intima-media thickness can be detected, which are reliable markers of clinical outcomes in later life. Therefore, early detection and control of dyslipidemia are strongly recommended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in adulthood and also reduce morbidity and mortality.
