Providing palliative care requires an interprofessional team approach. It includes managing a broad range of refractory symptoms, including shortness of breath, agitation, delirium, and pain. In the current context, most healthcare institutions have a palliative management team that assesses patients for their palliative needs. The team usually consists of a physician, nurse, pharmacist, pain specialist, religious figure, and a member of the ethics committee. Palliative care should be individualized for each patient based on goals of care discussions with the patient and family. Nurses and the pharmacist are vital team members as theyÂ closely monitor the patient for adverse effects and effectiveness of the sedative medications. In addition to pharmacological methods to relieve pain, there are also several non-pharmacological methods available. Some of these nonpharmacological methods are radiation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, heat, ice, or coolant sprays and may warrant the inclusion of other specialties such as pain medicine, radiation oncology, etc.
