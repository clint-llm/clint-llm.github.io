Mpox belongs to the family: Poxviridae, subfamily: chordopoxvirinae, genus: orthopoxvirus, and species: mpox virus. On electron microscopy, the mpox virus is relatively large (200 to 250 nanometers). Poxviruses are brick-shaped, surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope with a linear double-stranded DNA genome.

Mpox is a zoonosis and is spread from animals to humans. The animal reservoir for the disease is thought to include squirrels, rats, monkeys, primates, prairie dogs, hedgehogs, pigs, and mice found in the African regions from where mpox was previously widely reported.
