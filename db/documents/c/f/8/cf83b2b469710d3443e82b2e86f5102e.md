When the subthalamic nucleus or the tracts leading to or from the structure is damaged, hemiballismus can result. Hemiballismus characteristically causes ballistic flailing movements of an extremity that occurs contralaterally to the injured subthalamic nucleus. The most common etiology of hemiballismus is stroke. Hemiballismus is a relatively rare condition occurring as the sole manifestation of stroke in only roughly 0.4% to 0.54% of acute stroke.

First-line treatment for hemiballismus includes medications such as tetrabenazine, intrathecal baclofen, topiramate, or antidopaminergics such as haloperidol or chlorpromazine. In severe cases that are unresponsive to medication, surgery to implant electrodes for deep brain stimulation is a potential intervention. Surgical pallidotomy is another mechanism that has been used to treat intractable hemiballismus.

Subthalamic deep brain stimulation can also help patients with Parkinson’s disease with excessive movement-related symptoms, not responding to medications. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has also been an option for treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder.
