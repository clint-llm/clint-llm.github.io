**Neuroanatomy**

The dorsal column is a three-order neuronal pathway that functions as a method of signal transmission throughout the spinal cord to the brainstem. This pathway specifically controls conscious appreciation of vibration, fine touch, 2-point discrimination, and proprioception.

Anatomically, the cerebellum is also involved in truncal and extremity balance and coordination. It is inferior to the occipital lobe; it contains two lateral hemispheres lesions and one medial vermis. The cerebellum is associated with the movement of the body and is part of the human brain, which allows the body to make voluntary and coordinated movements and balance.

Although the cerebellum is also involved with coordination, Romberg's test detects the integrity of the posterior dorsal columns and proprioception, the body's awareness of its own movement and position in space. It is important to understand that a negative Romberg test does not confirm cerebellar dysfunction, but the clinician may rule in the etiology of ataxia due to cerebellar damage. It is crucial to note that both the dorsal column and cerebellar damage may result in ataxia.

**Physiology and Disease States Affecting Proprioception**

Sensorimotor integration of the body is dually controlled by cerebellar input and the posterior column medial lemniscus tracts. The dorsal columns carry proprioception sense (sense of position and joint sense). Important sensory inputs to maintain balance include three peripheral modalities: vision, the vestibular apparatus, and proprioception.

Another disease state that involves the dorsal column and proprioception disruptive behavior is the late complication of vitamin B12 deficiency, termed subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD). This condition is an example of the degeneration of the posterior column pathway due to the disrupted formation of myelin and, thus, nerve transmission through saltatory conduction.

Due to the demyelination, the nerve impulse conduction is disrupted, resulting in clinical proprioceptive impairment. In addition to the late sequelae of Vitamin B12 deficiency, a clinical state involving the vasculature of the spinal cord can also result in clinical manifestations such as ataxia and proprioceptive deficit. Posterior cord syndrome is a clinical disease resulting from posterior spinal artery infarction. This sequel can involve impairment of vibration sense, proprioception, and loss of reflexes below the lesion with sparing of pain and temperature sensation.

Lastly, in a spinal cord hemisection, known as Brown-Sequard syndrome, the posterior column pathway of the spinal cord is usually affected. Most cases of Brown-Sequard syndrome are related to trauma. The classic clinical picture involves ipsilateral hemiparesis, loss of vibration and proprioception, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature.

These disease states mentioned above may all result in ataxia as well as many other physical manifestations. To rule out certain disease states, such as Brown-Sequard syndrome, as the etiology for a proprioceptive deficit, taking a thorough past medical history (including trauma history)is crucial. The role of the evaluator is vital for early goal-directed care.
