Colorectal malignancies start occurring more commonly in the fifth decade of life, although the incidence of colorectal cancer has recently stabilized and is even slightly regressive in most parts of the developed world. The risk is approximately a 6% lifetime risk. There now appears to be an increase in presentation of patients younger than 50 with colorectal malignancies, and since this group of patients does not currentlyÂ fall into screening recommendations, they may present with aggressive and advanced disease in the emergency setting.
