There are between 30,000 and 50,000 global cases of Japanese encephalitis each year. Severe disease is estimated to occur in about one in 250 infections. Transmission is seasonal in temperate climates and peaks between May and October, but the risk persists year-round in more tropical climates. The time of greatest risk for infection is during the rainy season and the pre-harvest period in rice cultivating areas due to increased mosquito vector populations. Most mosquito bites occur between dawn and dusk. Twenty-four countries in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific have endemic Japanese encephalitis virus transmission placing more than three billion people at risk for infection. Major outbreaks occur every 2 to 15 years. Between 1965 and 1975 more than one million cases were reported in China alone. The introduction of routine childhood vaccination programs in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan has nearly eliminated the risk in vaccinated patients despite ongoing infection in endemic animals and birds. Most cases in these areas are now reported in unvaccinated visitors.
