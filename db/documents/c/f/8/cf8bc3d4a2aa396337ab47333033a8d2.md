EVs have a wide range of clinical applications that includes both diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. Additionally, their use as vaccines or vaccine adjuvants has shown promising results in basic and preclinical research, and few of these applications have entered clinical studies. For example, EVs offer a promising role as diagnostic markers for thrombotic diseases, cancer, and neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and multiple sclerosis. EVs isolated from blood or tissue fluid samples from patients with these diseases have shown different cargo and surface markers as compared to those isolated from non-diseased individuals.  Recognizing these differences provides necessary tools for early diagnosis and the prognosis of these diseases. An example is the change of profile of lysoglycerophospholipid in the membrane of EVs isolated from the serum of cancer patients.

Both natural and engineered EVs could be useful in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Also, EVs could be utilized as drug or gene delivery vehicles. In fact, EVs isolated from mesenchymal stem cells are an example of a natural EV that harbors therapeutic effects. The regenerative effect of MSCs is a consequence of their paracrine action rather than the direct replacement of the injured tissue, so the administration of conditioned medium or EVs derived from the stem cells has a regenerative effect equivalent to that produced by the stem cells themselves.  MSC-derived EVs improved several conditions in experimental animals, including diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy.

MSC-derived exosomes are now in a clinical trial as a regenerative treatment for COVID19 patients with severe lung injury. These exosomes repair the damage caused by the virus in lung and respiratory epithelial cells. In addition to their regenerative effect, EVs extracted from bone marrow MSCs showed other benefits like reduction of tumor growth when injected in mouse models with hepatocellular carcinoma.

The engineered EVs also carry great potential as a therapy for several diseases; this includes cancer, immune-associated diseases, neurological, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Scientists adopted several strategies to engineer EVs for therapeutic purposes. One approach is to insert proteins on the membrane of the vesicle that has a therapeutic benefit or that target EVs to a specific type of cells like cancer cells. They also modified the content of the EVs to carry a particular protein or nucleic acid that would combat a particular disease. Grafting of the EVs with artificial nanoparticles is another strategy that could improve the kinetics or the targeting of the EVs. Many potential anticancer and antimicrobial therapies have been invented and at different stages of the trials. For example, EVs carrying ACE2, the receptor of the COVID19 virus, showed promising results regarding their use as antiviral medicine.

EVs serve as vaccines in different ways. One example is the direct utilization of microbe-derived EVs as vaccines, which were proven to be effective in protecting against some bacterial diseases. EVs derived from the outer membrane of the gram-negative Neisseria meningitides, also called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), are currently used as a vaccine against meningitis that is already licensed by several countries all over the world. Another way to use EVs as vaccines is to load microbial surface antigens on EV membranes. This method gives the vaccine higher potency than when using the soluble form of the antigen. Also, the EVs are efficient carriers for DNA and RNA vaccines. They protect the nucleic acid and increase the vaccine potency. Additionally, they are effective adjuvants for different types of vaccines. A unique advantage of the EVs is their potential to carry more than one component of the vaccine, giving a chance for higher potency.

In conclusion, the emerging field of extracellular vesicles allows for a greater understanding of the mechanisms of most biological processes and diseases. Besides, EVs are potential tools for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of many diseases. The field is still in its beginning, and a lot of effort by physicians and researchers is needed to unlock these possibilities. Involving EVs in the curricula of undergraduate and medical students is necessary to push the process and get the utmost out of these potentials.
