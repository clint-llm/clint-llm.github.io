Spontaneous intestinal perforation in the newborn is defined as a single bowel wall perforation typically occurring in the terminal ileum. It is a life-threatening condition that affects very low birth weight infants (birth weight of less than 1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (birth weight of less than 1000 g) infants. The exact pathophysiology of spontaneous intestinal perforation is a subject of debate. Prematurity and low birth weight are significant risk factors. Diagnosis relies on the typical radiographic finding of pneumoperitoneum. Spontaneous intestinal perforation is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis, prompt surgical consultation, and management are of utmost importance. This activity reviews the incidence, pathophysiology, and role of the interprofessional team in managing spontaneous intestinal perforation.

**Objectives:**
- Review the clinical presentation of spontaneous intestinal perforation.
- Describe the evaluation of infants with spontaneous intestinal perforation.
- Summarize the management recommendations for spontaneous intestinal perforation.
- Outline the prognosis for infants with spontaneous intestinal perforation.
