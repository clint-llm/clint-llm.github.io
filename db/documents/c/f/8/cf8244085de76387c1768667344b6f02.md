Errors in the development of HbA can lead to significant consequences for the newborn infant to adulthood. Beta-thalassemia is a genetic mutation where there is a reduced amount or absence of beta-globin chain synthesis. A reduced amount of beta-globin chains results in a decrease in hemoglobin in red blood cells, decreased red blood cell production, and anemia. There are more than 200 mutations reported with the majority of these caused by point mutations in the functionally essential gene regions for beta-globin chain production.

Sickle cell anemia is the result of a non-conservative missense mutation, a change of one nucleotide in the beta-globin gene region. This mutation will cause red blood cells to distort into a "sickle" shape when deoxygenated. These sickle cell RBC (HbS) can continuously change their form, which results in their premature destruction intravascularly.

In both diseases, hydroxyurea has been shown to improve the quality of life for patients.
