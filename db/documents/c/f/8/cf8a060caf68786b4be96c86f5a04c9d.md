A cervicogenic headache (CGH) presents as unilateral pain that starts in the neck. It is a common chronic and recurrent headache that usually starts after neck movement. It usually accompanies a reduced range of motion (ROM) of the neck. It could be confused with a migraine, tension headache, or other primary headache syndromes. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of various cervicogenic headaches and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical etiology and pathophysiology of cervicogenic headaches.
- Summarize the relevant components of examining and evaluating cervical spine injuries, including any indicated diagnostic imaging and possible differential diagnoses.
- Discuss the various treatment options available for cervicogenic headaches.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cervicogenic headaches.
