Certain structural deformities such as facial and pulmonary abnormalities are characteristics of Potter syndrome. A definitive diagnosis is made by visualization of bilateral renal agenesis.

**Ultrasonography (USG):**Prenatal abdominal and transvaginal USG is the mainstay investigation to accurately evaluate the renal agenesis.

**Other imaging:**Antenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in defining renal malformations in equivocal or inconclusive USG findings. Amnioinfusion is helpful in better visualization in cases of decreased amniotic fluid. Chest radiography is useful in detecting pulmonary hypoplasia and hemothorax. Cardiotocograph helps in detecting any congenital heart defects through the evaluation of fetal heart rate.

**Laboratory analysis:**In patients with suspected Potter syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities such as hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, or metabolic acidosis are evident due to renal failure. Urinalysis for hematuria, or proteinuria but the serum creatinine level is the best indicator of renal function. Chromosomal analysis is recommended in those with physical findings associated with trisomy 7 or 13. An autopsy is performed only in already dead infants.

Invasive prenatal diagnosis (amniocentesis) is offered if required. Prenatal checkup and regular follow-up for the amniotic fluid index is required to make an early diagnosis of oligohydramnios and so to prevent the complications.
