Hantavirus is a lethal infection, and despite optimal treatment, mortality rates are high. Because the infection can involve many organs, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, ICU nurses, a hematologist, nephrologist, pulmonologist, and a neurologist. The key is to prevent the infection in the first place.

Prevention is best approached by minimizing human-rodent contact. Pest control and removal of mice from living areas are key. Ventilating homes and allowing natural light into the area for neutralization of the virus by ultraviolet light may prevent the spread of the infection. Minimize food available for rodents. When disposing ofÂ dead rodents, carefully handle them using air filtration and gloves.
