Because orocutaneous fistulas (OCF) are uncommon, misdiagnosis of those from a dental origin is not unusual. In the study of Lee et al., the majority of patients were misdiagnosed initially. Oral cutaneous fistulas were thought to be an epidermal cyst (24,2%), furuncle (21.2%), subcutaneous mycosis (15.2%), squamous cell carcinoma (9.1%), basal cell carcinoma (6.1%), and foreign body granuloma (6.1%).
