Patients suffering from Kleine–Levin syndrome can present to either their primary care physician, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, or somnologist. Psychotherapy can be provided by non-physician professionals such as psychologists. Physicians can direct pharmacotherapy after being formally diagnosed with Kleine–Levin syndrome. To help with advanced workup of the disease neuropathology, neuroradiologists may be employed to evaluate, for example, functional MRIs. Thus, it requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that need to remain cognizant of KLS's unique presentation as patients can present initially to a wide array of specialists. Clinical awareness of this condition can lead to improved patient care and outcomes. [Level 5] Improved interdisciplinary communication enhances the quality of care of patients with KLS and further enhances their clinical outcomes.
