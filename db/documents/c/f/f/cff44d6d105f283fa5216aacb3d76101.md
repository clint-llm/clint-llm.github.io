Clomipramine is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or CYP450 2D6 inhibitors. Clomipramine therapy may not initiate until at least 14 days after discontinuation of the MAO. Other S-RIs or MAOIs may be added or started two weeks after discontinuation of clomipramine. CYP450 2D6 inhibitors may result in increased drug levels of clomipramine. Initiating clomipramine is contraindicated while being treated with linezolid or IV methylene blue, nor can it be started during the acute phase after myocardial infarction. Other contraindications to clomipramine include patients with any degree of heart block, prolonged QTc interval, arrhythmia, acute heart failure, mania, liver disease, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or allergy to clomipramine.
