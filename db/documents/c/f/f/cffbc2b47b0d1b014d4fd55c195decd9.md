Plasmapheresis is an intensive care procedure that needs appropriate decisions, specialized skill-based training, close monitoring, and follow-up for best clinical outcomes. It is recommended that a customized dedicated chart must be designed at all centers performing plasmapheresis procedures. This should include a brief history, with established/presumptive diagnosis.

The basis for the procedure, along with patient-specific concerns, must be listed. This chart should also indicate the total number of plasmapheresis sessions planned. The healthcare professionals must clearly discuss the clinical and/or laboratory parameters to monitor the effectiveness of the procedure and enlist criteria for completion/discontinuation. The urgency of the procedure (emergency, urgent, or routine) must be delineated while planning for plasmapheresis. These holistic goals can ensure the effectiveness and reduce complications of plasmapheresis in clinical settings.
