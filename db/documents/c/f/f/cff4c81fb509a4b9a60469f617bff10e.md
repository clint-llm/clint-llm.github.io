Various studies have mentioned the presence of the supernumerary muscles of the pharynx that originate from the petrous portion of the temporal bone and get inserted on the superior constrictor muscle. This muscle is known as the petropharyngeus muscle. Apart from the petropharyngeus, other variations of the stylopharyngeus muscle may also be present such as the occipitopharyngeus, mastoidopharyngeus, and the azygopharyneus.  These supernumerary muscles have been thought to play a role in abnormal swallowing, pharyngeal clearance, phonetics, modulation of respiration, obstructive sleep apnoea, and dysphagia.

Studies have also reported the presence of an additional muscle sheet of the stylopharyngeus muscle that inserts into the tonsillar bed. These muscle fibers are short in the course and intermingle with the palatopharyngeus muscle and the superior constrictor of the pharynx. The incidence of occurrence of this additional muscle is high in females compared to that in males; this may be the result of aging, which may cause degenerative changes in the main stylopharyngeus muscle (descending bundle). Unlike the descending bundle, the additional insertion does not contribute to pharyngeal clearance.  Their function is to pull the tonsillar bed dorso-superiorly.
