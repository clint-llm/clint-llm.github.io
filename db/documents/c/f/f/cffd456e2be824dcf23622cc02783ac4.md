Peripheral vascular disease is primarily driven by progressive atherosclerotic disease resulting in the reduction of major organ blood flow and end-organ ischemia. The process of atherosclerosis is complex, with the involvement of numerous cells, proteins, and pathways. Important non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors have been identified in the advancement of atherosclerosis.

Risk factors include:

- Tobacco use

- Diabetes mellitus

- Hypertension

- HIV

- High cholesterol

- Age more than 50 years

- Elevated homocysteine levels

- BMI greater than 30

- Family history of cardiovascular disease

Of the above risk factors, smoking is associated with the highest risk of PAD development with an odds ratio of 2.7 (95% CI 2.4–3.1). History of cardiovascular disease and diabetes are also significant risk factors with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% CI 2.2-3) and 1.9 (1.7-2.1), respectively.
