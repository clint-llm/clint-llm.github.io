Patients with T-cell deficiencies, including SCID, should not vaccinate with the live-attenuated vaccine because there is a danger that the antigen reverses its pathogenicity and causes physical illness. Patients with IgA deficiency should not receive IgG preparations that are not highly purified because there is a danger of a hypersensitivity reaction. If the immune system does not recognize the IgA in the preparation, this can be life-threatening. Patients with DiGeorge syndrome should not be transplanted with a thymus older than 14 weeks because a graft-versus-host reaction may occur.Â The donor can be one of the siblings or a parent if genetic compatibility exists. Blood group compatibility for major antigens such as the ABO system and Rh system must match.
