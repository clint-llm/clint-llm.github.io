The many causes of hyperbilirubinemia can be divided into causes of unconjugated versus conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and then further classified. Some conditions that can cause hyperbilirubinemia to include:

- Dubin-Johnson syndrome

- Gilbert syndrome

- Crigler-Najjar syndrome (type 1 and type 2)

- Extra-hepatic biliary obstruction

- Familial intra-hepatic cholestasis

- Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC)

- Drug-induced hepatotoxicity

- Hemolysis

- Cholestasis of pregnancy

- Viral hepatitis

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- Wilson disease

- Hemochromatosis

- Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency

- Cirrhosis

It is important to differentiate Rotor syndrome from other diseases causing hyperbilirubinemia. Normal alkaline phosphatase levels and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase help distinguish Rotor syndrome from disorders associated with biliary obstruction. Abnormal urinary coproporphyrin excretion and normal liver histology help distinguish this entity from DJS.
