Microdontia is where teeth appear smaller than expected. Classification is dependent on severity. Localized microdontia describes a singular tooth that is smaller than normal, relative generalized microdontia, describes teeth that appear smaller due to the larger relative size of the maxilla or mandible, and true generalized microdontia describes the involvement of the entire dentition.

Macrodontia is commonly detected on routine dental radiographs between the ages of 8 and 13 when most of the permanent dentition begins to erupt. Isolated teeth that appear larger than normal are typically left untreated; however, generalized macrodontia should be noted, as this condition is likely attributed to a genetic or developmental condition.

Taurodontism presents radiographically as teeth with larger than normal pulp chambers and shortened roots, two findings that cannot be observed clinically.

Fusion is generally identified during a routine dental examination or when the fused teeth are in the esthetic zone, as seen when a large single tooth occupies the normal space of two teeth. Patients may not be aware of their abnormality unless the condition poses an esthetic or functional challenge.
