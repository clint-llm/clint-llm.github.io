Vestibular dysfunction can contribute to symptoms of varying severity and frequency but can nevertheless be debilitating and anxiogenic. Patient education is an important part of the clinical management of vestibular dysfunction. The initial focus of treatment must be on an accurate diagnosis informed by a detailed history, comprehensive physical examination, and supporting diagnostic testing. Once the diagnosis is established, counseling is provided regarding the diagnosis and prognosis. Creating an individualized care plan empowers the patient to take responsibility and initiative for self-care.Â Medications for symptom control are often helpful, but patients should be counseled about the side effects and potential drug-drug interactions these medications may produce.
