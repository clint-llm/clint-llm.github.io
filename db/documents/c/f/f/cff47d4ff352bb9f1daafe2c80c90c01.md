- Per the manufacturer, there are few absolute contraindications to the use of sulindac. The first is a previous hypersensitivity reaction to sulindac or other NSAIDs. NSAID hypersensitivity can present in a variety of ways.
- It can result in chronic respiratory disease because of the formation of nasal polyps.
- Cutaneously it can present with urticaria and angioedema, and in severe instances, it can even result in generalized anaphylaxis.

- The other absolute contraindication is in patients in status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operations.

**Box Warnings**

- NSAIDs increase the risk of serious and fatal cardiovascular thrombotic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction. This risk can occur in an early phase of treatment and may increase with the duration of administration.

- NSAIDs increase the risk of serious and fatal gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines. These adverse events may occur at any time while using and without warning symptoms. Senior adults are at higher risk of serious gastrointestinal events.

**Cautions/Warnings**

- Sulindac can increase the risk of hypertension or exacerbate existing hypertension.

- It increases the risk of hospitalizations for patients with heart failure.

- Cholestatic hepatitis cases are reported in some patients. Therefore, if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.), sulindac should be discontinued.

- Chronic use of NSAIDs is linked with renal papillary necrosis and other renal injuries. Therefore, caution must be exercised in patients with heart failure, impaired renal function, liver dysfunction, volume-depleted patients, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly.

- Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been observed in patients taking sulindac, so discontinue the use if any signs or symptoms of DRESS develops.
