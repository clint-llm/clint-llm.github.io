The gold standard of surgical intervention for lumbar disc herniation is discectomy or removal of disc material contributing to symptoms. Historically completed through an open approach, several more MIS options are presently available, giving the surgeon multiple options. Â A recent Cochrane Database systematic review comparing open versus minimally invasive discectomy presented low-quality data suggestive of lower infection rates and shorter hospital stays for minimally invasive techniques, though with possibly inferior improvements in the low back and leg pain.

Since the relatively recent adoption of endoscopic techniques, research available thus far appears to indicate a general reduction in immediate post-operative disability and hospital stay with equivalent outcomes compared to MIS and open techniques. Additional long-term, high-quality studies are warranted before superiority among these methods may be assessed, though each offers unique advantages.****The long-term implications of the relatively minimal surgical exposure necessitated by MIS or endoscopic approaches have been topics of debate.

Lumbar discectomy has a success rate between 60 and 90%.

Preoperative weight reduction and abstinence from smoking have beneficial effects on outcomes.

Comparative studies have demonstrated similar clinical results following MIS and SD/MLD.

In a survey study among spine surgeons for surgical management of symptomatic discs:

- 63% preferred MLD

- 53% percent preferred early mobilization (first postoperative day).

- 59% preferred to follow up with patients clinically.

**Comparative study between OD, MLD, MED, and FE:**

**A comparison between SD and MLD-**A meta-analysis found no benefit.

**Comparison between SD and MED-**Mean hospital stay, bleeding, and time to return to work were lower in MED, but long-term pain results were equivalent.

**Comparison between MLD and FE-**No significant difference in clinical results in terms of pain, complications, or recurrence. Endoscopy and MED only reduced hospital stay and intraoperative bleeding.

**In a meta-analysis from 1997 to 2020**,**OD, MLD, MED, and FE**were associated with:

- **Recurrence**in 4.1%, 5.1%, 3.9% and 3.5%;

- **Re-operations**in 5.2%, 7.5%, 4.9% and 4%;

- **Wound complications**in 3.5%, 3.5%, 1.2% and 2%;

- **Durotomy**in 6.6%, 2.3%, 4.4% and 1.1% ;

- **Neurological complications**in 1.8%, 2.8%, 4.5% and 4.9% respectively; and

- **Nerve root injury**in 0.3% for MLD, 0.8% for MED, and 1.2% for FE.
