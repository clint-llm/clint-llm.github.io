All postpartum infections can progress to sepsis, bacteremia, shock, and death if not treated appropriately. Necrotizing fasciitis is especially notable for its rapid progression to fulminant infection and death. A notable complication of endometritis and deep space infections of the pelvis is SPT. Endometritis affects the endometrium and myometrium but can progress beyond the uterus to include abscess, peritonitis, and pelvic thrombophlebitis.
