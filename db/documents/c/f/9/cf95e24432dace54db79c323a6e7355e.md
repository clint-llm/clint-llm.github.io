Neurolysis is the application of chemical or physical agents to a nerve to cause a temporary or permanent degeneration of targeted nerve fibers. When the nerve fibers degenerate, it interrupts the transmission of nerve signals. If these nerve fibers are carrying nociceptive signals, it can, therefore, provide pain relief. The most frequently employed modes of neuroablative therapy: radiofrequency (heat), chemoneurolysis (chemical), and cyroablation. This activity reviews the role of neuraxial neurolysis for pain control and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with chronic pain.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique of neuraxial neurolysis.
- Describe the indications for neuraxial neurolysis.
- Recall the complications of neuraxial neurolysis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to provide better care of patients with chronic pain by managing them with neuraxial neurolysis.
