Currently, research has shown that the superoxide molecule and its progeny are present in most aerobic cells and that they portray an immense array of important functions in a variety of cell types.

One of the most studied and most relevant reactions involving superoxides is that of the respiratory burst, initiated by NADPH oxidase. This enzyme, found in phagocytic leukocytes, converts oxygen to superoxide radicals within the phagolysosome to defend the body from pathogens.
