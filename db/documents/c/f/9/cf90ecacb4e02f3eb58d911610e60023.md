U.S Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has not approved any medication for the treatment of marijuana use. Pregnant women identified using marijuana should be referred for psychological counseling, detoxification, and psychiatric services. The goal is the eventual cessation of any drug use. Neonates exposed to marijuana should be evaluated for exposure to other drugs and managed accordingly. Marijuana and tobacco exposure routinely does not need medical treatment. Simultaneous exposure to drugs such as opioids may require a prolonged hospital stay and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome management.
