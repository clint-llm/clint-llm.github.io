The diagnosis of Dressler syndrome is not easy and can be confused with many other cardiac disorders. Hence, it is best managed with an interprofessional team that includes a cardiac nurse, emergency department physician, cardiologist, radiologist, and intensivist.

Most patients with suspected Dressler syndrome are treated in an outpatient setting with close follow-up unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable. The approach typically involves NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) tapered over 4 to 6 weeks as the accumulated pericardial fluid diminishes.  Patients who do not respond to NSAID therapy may be given a 1-week course of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) tapered over a 4-week period.

More severe cases of Dressler syndrome may require pericardial drainage by the cardiac surgeon or cardiologist.

The outlook for most patients with Dressler syndrome is excellent.  However, the recovery may take 2 to 4 weeks.
