Around 1.5 million women experience the menopause transition each year. Although 70 to 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms, only 15 to 20% of women have significant interference with quality of life and seek help. The average duration of hot flashes is about 5.2 years, with symptom onset one year before the final menstrual period and declining thereafter. About 27 to 60% of women report vaginal dryness or dyspareunia in association with menopause. Around 50% of women report sleep disturbance. There is a reported 3-fold risk for the development of a major depressive episode during perimenopause.
