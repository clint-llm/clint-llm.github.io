Ginger root is a whole plant-based food. It can be consumed in healthy breakfast items such as oatmeal and chia seed puddings, as a spice in Indian or Asian curries and cuisine, in soups, in salad dressings, in herbal tea as crushed or minced root, in powder form as a supplement, in juice or a smoothie to flavor the beverages, in baking, or the hard candy form for the common cold and sore throat. The recommended serving is a tablespoon of ground ginger or 2/3 cup of freshly ground ginger.

The most common edible form of ginger root is in its yellow/beige form. Methods of consuming ginger for a healthy lifestyle include whole, crushed, or minced in herbal tea, powdered form as a supplement, juice form as a flavor, or crystallized candy form for the common cold and sore throat. Ginger pills can be prepared by adding fresh ginger juice to ginger powder and blending it in mortar and pestle until it becomes a thick paste; it can be rolled into pills once dried. The proportion of juice to powder is roughly 4Â to 1. Two tablets can be taken three times a day.
