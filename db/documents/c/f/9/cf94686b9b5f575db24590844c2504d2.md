It may be difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions based on clinical evaluation alone. The onset and progression may hint one way or another, as benign lesions tend to grow slower. The presence or absence of pain can also help predict the nature of the offending lesion, as the most common malignant lesion, adenoid cystic carcinoma, can exhibit perineural invasion. Usually, orbital imaging is helpful and often necessary to confirm and characterize a possible orbital lesion. Characteristics to discern are whether the tumor is solid vs. cystic, well-defined vs. infiltrative, the presence or absence and amount of calcification, the presence of fat or fluid, bony remodeling or destruction, and contrast enhancement.

Computed tomography (CT) is quick, widely available, cost-effective, and especially helpful for lacrimal fossa anatomy. It is widely considered as the initial imaging modality of choice for lacrimal gland lesions, especially if a benign tumor is suspected.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more expensive, harder to obtain, and a longer duration study, but it gives superior soft tissue detail. The various image processing sequences available allow for detailed characterization of the mass in question. Unlike CT, MRI has limited bone visualization but can better evaluate tumor involvement of orbital nerves, important for adenoid cystic carcinoma.

Some cases may require both CT and MRI imaging and a biopsy before further management decisions.
