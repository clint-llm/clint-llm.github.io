Systemic lupus erythematosus, along with other forms of CLE, is mainly a clinical diagnosis supported by clinical features. Confirmatory histopathologic examination with skin biopsy is indicated when there is diagnostic uncertainty. Laboratory studies like anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La are indicated as well. Direct immunofluorescence can be used to help support the diagnosis if histopathology is uncertain. Immunofluorescence shows a granular pattern of deposition of immunoglobulin at the dermal-epidermal junction.
