Ethanol derives from the fermentation of naturally occurring sugars. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature for the chemical compound ethanol is a structural composition consisting of a pair of carbon atoms with an alkyl group coupled with an -OH functional group; the -OH group makes it chemically an alcohol. Unlike methanol, butanol, propanol, etc., humans can consume ethanol in its purest form withoutÂ dying.
