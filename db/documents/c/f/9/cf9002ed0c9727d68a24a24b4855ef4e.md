A Smith fracture is a break to the end of the radius. The end part of the bone, which forms part of the wrist joint, is displaced or angled in the direction of the palm of the hand. Often, this injury occurs by a fall to the back of a flexed wrist but can occur in any fall to an outstretched hand. This type of injury will typically show swelling, bruising, and deformity towards the wrist, showing the prominence of the top of the forearm with the wrist appearing to be a step below. It is important to check for any numbness of the hand and ensure blood flow to the hand is not compromised by squeezing the fingernail and seeing if color returns promptly. The arm and hand should be immobilized, and the patient should get transported to advanced medical care where the area can be assessed by a healthcare provider, and X-rays are obtainable. The appearance of the broken bone on X-ray will determine the best course of management; this may be simple casting if the site of the break can be reduced and is in a good position. However, if the fracture is more significant, it may require surgical correction.
