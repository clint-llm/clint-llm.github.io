The incidence of PPCM is uncertain, perhaps due to the misdiagnosis of this identity. Despite this, the available information from multiple studies has shown that PPCM varies geographically. In the United States, the incidence has been reported to be as low as 1 case per 4,000 live births in comparison with the higher incidence in Nigeria of 1 case in every 100 live births.

Women older than 25 years with a mean age of 30 years were found more likely to develop PPCM. Other important factors related to the presence of PPCM include hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy, the presence of anemia, and African descent.

In the other hand, Hispanic women are the ethnicity with the least PCCM incidence.
