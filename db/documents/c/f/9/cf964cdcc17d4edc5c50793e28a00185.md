Post-operative delirium (POD) can occur from anywhere between 10 minutes after anesthesia up until discharge from the hospital. It is commonly recognized in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) as sudden, fluctuating, and usually reversible disturbance of mental status with a degree of inattention. Severely reduced arousal or deep sedation should not be confused with alterations in brain function, as hypoactive delirium is the most common form of POD. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of postoperative delirium and examines the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Ascertain the populations most at risk of developing postoperative delirium. 
- Review the common presentations of postoperative delirium. 
- Explain the optimal management strategies for postoperative delirium. 
- Explain how an interprofessional approach is imperative to the effective recognition and management of postoperative delirium.
