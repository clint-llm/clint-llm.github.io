PKU in the United StatesÂ is detected by the state newborn screening program which measures the Phe/Tyr molar ratio on a filter paper blood spot (from a heal prick) by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). This test is usually done 1 or 2 days after birth. Newborns with PKU can appear normal at birth with the first signs appearing after several months. Neonates with elevated blood Phe may have a BH4 deficiency which could also result in elevated Phe levels. Commercial microarray genotyping (for example, 23andme.com) for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can provide the carrier status for PKU variants common in those with Northern European descent. Knowing carrier status could be useful for future parents; if both are carriers of a PKU variant, there is a 25% of having a child with PKU.
