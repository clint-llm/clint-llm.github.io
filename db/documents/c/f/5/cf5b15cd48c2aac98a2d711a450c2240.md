Radiation therapy following breast-conserving surgery remains the quality of care. It not only decreases the prospect of recurrence within the breast but also improves overall survival.

The substitution of hormonal therapy for radiotherapy could also be a good option in older women with a very limited life expectancy.

Standard fractionation involves extending the radiation over six to 6.5 weeks.

A boost dose of radiation to the lumpectomy site tends to decrease recurrences within the breast. The absolute benefit of the additional radiation is greater in younger women.
