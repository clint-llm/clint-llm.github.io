- B-cell lymphomas are commonly found in mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis patients.

- The presence of mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in Hep-C infected individuals is associated with increased mortality, whereas, in other infections, prognosis relies on the infection itself.

- The major causes of death include Hep-C related hepatopathy and severe infections related to immunosuppressive therapy used.

- Multiorgan involvement can occur, which is always a poor prognostic sign.
