After the first year of life, partial seizures are the most common seizure type in patients with epilepsy. The incidence of all partial seizures is approximately 20 cases per 100,000 population between the age of 1 to 65 years in the United States. It is estimated that around 6% to 12% of patients with epilepsy have simple partial seizures; these are frequently associated with other types of seizures. There is no reported predilection for gender, race, or ethnicity. Incidence has been increasing in older people, especially those with cerebrovascular disease.
