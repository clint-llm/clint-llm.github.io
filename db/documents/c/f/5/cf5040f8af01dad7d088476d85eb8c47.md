Esophageal varices are most commonly the result of liver cirrhosis. As the hepatic tissue becomes scarred, the vasculature can become compressed and obstructed, leading to portal hypertension. Portal hypertension leads to increased pressure in the veins of the esophagus and stomach. The increased pressure results in the development of varices. Specifically, varices can develop in the para-esophageal collateral veins supplied from the azygos vein and short gastric veins supplied from the splenic vein.
