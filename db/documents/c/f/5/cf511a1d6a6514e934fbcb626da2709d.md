Ureteroscopy has evolved in the past few decades with the advent of new scopes and various accessories to help increase the safety of the procedure. However, complications, both minor and severe, still exist. Minor complications include hematuria, mild urinary tract infection, double-pigtail stent discomfort and transient creatinine elevation. More severe complications, though rare, include severe urosepsis, extra-ureteral or submucosal stone migration, ureteral perforation, ureteral stricture, and ureteral avulsion.
