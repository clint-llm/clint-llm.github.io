Most geriatric cervical spine injuries are secondary to falls (greater than 60%). They can, however, occur secondary to any traumatic mechanism (for example, motor vehicle accidents, assault, forced hyperextension or hyperflexion injuries). Geriatric patients have a higher risk of low-energy injuries secondary to, but not limited to, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and a generalized decrease in the spinal columns physiologic protective capabilities secondary to decreases in total mobility and degenerative changes.
