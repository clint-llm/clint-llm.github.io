Many cases of isthmic spondylolisthesis are asymptomatic.  However, the most common symptom of presentation is low back pain, which may be mechanical in nature. Patients also can present with neurogenic claudication symptomatology such as back and leg pain and discomfort associated with walking. These symptoms need to be differentiated from vascular claudication, which is exacerbated by ambulation and gets better with rest.  Other patients can present with symptoms of specific dermatome of lumbar radiculopathy depending on the compressed nerve root and the amount of subluxation or stenosis. Physical examination can show different degrees of findings ranging from normal to paraplegia. However, the most common findings are depressed deep tendon reflexes, positive straight leg signs, and diminished sensations. Some patients can have specific pain-related weakness of lower extremities. Usually, patients with chronic isthmic spondylolisthesis do not present with significant motor weakness; however, acute isthmic spondylolisthesis can present with paralysis and loss of bowel and bladder function.  Since L5-S1 is the most commonly afflicted level, an L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis will typically cause radicular symptoms that correlate with the L5 exiting nerve at that level such as weakness in ankle dorsiflexion and hallux extension.
