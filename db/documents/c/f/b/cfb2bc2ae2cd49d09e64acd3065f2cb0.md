Non-odontogenic tumor of the jaw is a term that encompasses a vast range of pathologies that cannot be fully dealt with below. Instead, the focus will be on pathology that is more commonly encountered in clinical practice, although many are still exceedingly rare. Six tumors will be covered in detail: osteosarcoma, fibrous dysplasia, central giant cell granuloma, osteoma, osteochondroma, and osteoblastoma. Below is a more thorough classification of non-odontogenic tumors of the jaw, divided by tissue of origin, highlighting the breadth of the topic.

**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of the bone, accounting for over half of all primary bone tumors. Osteosarcoma of the jaw accounts for 6% of all osteosarcoma,s and after squamous cell carcinomas are the second most common malignancy of the jaws.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

Fibrous dysplasia is a fibro-osseous disease that causes abnormal bone maturation and remodeling. It does not cause a discrete lesion but leads to abnormal bony swellings and has therefore been included as an important form of non-odontogenic tumor.

It can occur in monostotic (80 to 85%) and polyostotic forms (single vs. multiple bones, respectively). McCune-Albright syndrome is a form of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. There are associated cutaneous changes in the form of café-au-lait spots and widespread endocrinopathies. Jaffe-Lichtenstein syndrome is another polyostotic form of fibrous dysplasia with café-au-lait spots but the absence of endocrinopathies.

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Central giant cell granuloma is the most common non-odontogenic tumor that affects the jaws, accounting for 7% of benign jaw tumors.

**Osteoma**

An osteoma is a benign, slow-growing proliferation of compact or cancellous bone.

Gardener syndrome must be investigated as an underlying diagnosis in either the presence of multiple osteomas or osteoma in children. This is an autosomal dominant condition that leads to osteomas, fibromatosis, and polyposis of the large intestines. These adenomatous polyps ultimately undergo malignant transformation and lead to adenocarcinomas of the large intestines in all patients.

**Osteochondroma**

Osteochondroma is a benign hamartoma in the form of cartilage capped, bony outgrowth. They are primarily found in the axial skeleton in areas of endochondral ossification. Consequently, they are rare in the facial skeleton, as this primarily undergoes membranous ossification. When they do occur, they appear in the mandibular condyle, occasionally also occurring in the coronoid process.

**Osteoblastoma**

Osteoblastoma is a rare benign neoplasm; it is primarily found in the vertebral column but can occur in the jaws, most commonly the mandible. There is significant debate surrounding their natural course of progression and histology; consequently, diagnosis can be challenging.

Surrounding literature will often use terms such as ‘osteoid osteoma,’ ‘juvenile active ossifying fibroma,’ and ‘aggressive osteoblastoma’ to describe this pathology. Osteoid osteoma is histologically indistinguishable from osteoblastoma but will exhibit pain as a more prominent feature. Some believe it represents a different pathology entirely, and others feel it is an early phase of the developing osteoblastoma. Juvenile active ossifying fibroma and aggressive osteoblastoma both describe the same subtype of osteoblastoma. This aggressive subtype, described above, is more often seen in young adults.
