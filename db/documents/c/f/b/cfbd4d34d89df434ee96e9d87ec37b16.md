3D**-**SPECT imaging requires a rotating multi-headed gamma camera, a collimator, and a radio-labeled tracer specific to the target tissue. The basic function of the camera is the detection of photons produced by gamma decay of the tracer compound, which is emitted in all directions from the patient. The collimator functions to filter these photons, allowing only particles that are parallel to the detector through. The collimator, therefore, focuses the radiation, and collimator selection influences the sensitivity and resolution of the final image.

The number of gamma camera heads increases the resolution of the final image and decreases the amount of time required for the scan. However, high-quality images can be produced with single-headed cameras by skilled medical physicists and nuclear radiologists.
