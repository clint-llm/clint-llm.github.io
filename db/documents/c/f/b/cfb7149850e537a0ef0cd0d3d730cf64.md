Because of the diverse presentation of hypophosphatemia, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of an internist, endocrinologist, intensivist, general surgeon, and nurse practitioner.  Specialty trained nurses and physician assistants administer ordered treatments and provide feedback on response to the team. Pharmacists review oral and parenteral treatment, including dosage and drug compatibility. The effects of hypophosphatemia are broad and impact nearly every system. Symptoms of this deficiency become apparent below 0.32 mmol/L. In general, all symptomatic patients need treatment with phosphate; asymptomatic patients may be observed and monitored. The outlook for patients depends on the primary condition causing the hypophosphatemia. If the cause is benign, then treatment outcomes are excellent.
