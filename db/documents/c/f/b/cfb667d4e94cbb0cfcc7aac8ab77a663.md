**Adverse Effects**

**Respiratory Depression**

Opioid receptors are abundant in the respiratory center in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, peripheral chemo and baroreceptors in the carotid bodies and vagi, and mechanoreceptors of the airways and lungs. Stimulation of these receptors leads to irregular and slow breathing, eventually developing hypercapnia and hypoxia.

**Constipation**

Opioid receptors are widely distributed throughout the autonomic nervous system (ANS), especially making their presence felt in the gastrointestinal ANS. Opioid receptor activation by agonists causes slowing of propulsive motility of the gut mediated through inhibition of acetylcholine (ACh) by myenteric neurons and partially inhibiting purine and nitric oxide release from inhibitory motor neurons. Furthermore, their stimulation decreases chloride secretion through inhibition of secretomotor submucosal neurons, resulting in reduced passive water movement into the lumen, which causes the development of hardened stools leading to increased constipation.**See Fig 6.**

**Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope**

Opioid receptors are present in cardiac tissue; their activation leads to hyperpolarization of membranes and activation of the vagus nerve. These changes result in peripheral vasodilation and bradycardia, which ultimately causes hypotension.Â Peripheral vasodilation gets further exacerbated by systemic histamine release.

**Endocrine Abnormalities**

Stimulation of opioid receptors located in the hypothalamus inhibits GnRH release, which results in reduced estrogen and testosterone secretion. Hence, chronic activation of these receptors leads to osteoporosis and sexual dysfunction, presenting as decreased libido, infertility, and increased bone fragility.

These receptors in the hypothalamus cause reduced the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in low levels of ACTH and cortisol. Low cortisol levels present clinically with nonspecific symptoms- anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue, lethargy, and fever.

**Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion (SIADH)**

Administration of opioids has also been documented in some case studies to cause ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary due to the stimulation of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus. The stimulation of these receptors leads to the inhibition of GABA, which removes the inhibitory effect of the neurotransmitter on the secretion of Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This hypersecretion of ADH can even lead to hyponatremia in severe cases. This phenomenon is unrelated to the well-established fact of increased ADH release in response to the nociceptive transmission.

**Immune Dysfunction**

Opioid receptors are present on immune cells, namely natural killer (NK) cells, and phagocytes, and their stimulation leads to repression of their activity resulting in blunting of the immune response and delayed wound healing.

**Sleep Changes**

Activation of opioid receptors in the medium pontine reticular formation alters normal sleep pattern. Opioid agonists through stimulation of these receptors increase the duration of light sleep, consequently decreasing deep and REM sleep duration.

**Mood Changes**

Chronic stimulation of MOR reduces neuronal flexibility and production of neurons in the hippocampal region leading to mood dysregulation and eventually, social withdrawal.

Pathophysiology of Tolerance and Addiction

It is a reasonable inference that the most significant hindrance to the prescription of opioids as analgesics is the eventual development of tolerance to the opioid medications rendering them ineffective over prolonged durations. Chronic opioid administration has a propensity to lead to irreversible dysfunction of the endogenous opioid system making it inefficient to respond to the various stressors; this mainly occurs due to reduced production of endogenous opioids. The inability of the endogenous opioids to react appropriately to outside stressors will cause the users to ultimately become dependent on exogenous opioids to mimic the action elicited by the exogenous opioid system. Henceforth, this propels the increased risk of hyperalgesia, dependence, and when unchecked, eventually leading to addiction.

The molecular basis for the development of tolerance to opioids has been the topic of many studies. Earlier, it was believed to occur due to downregulation of MOR on chronic exposure to opioids, but recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon alone cannot explain opioid tolerance given that downregulation has been observed to occur inconsistently with different agonists. It can concur from various in vivo studies that desensitization and uncoupling of MOR from downstream signaling pathways and ion channels play an essential part in the development of tolerance. Observations have noted an increased concentration of cAMP in cells exposed to prolonged doses of morphine, which may be the result of cellular adaptive changes through increased activity of adenylyl cyclase and possibly other mediators of the pathway.

Another type of molecules observed to be involved in desensitization of opioid receptors are beta-arrestins that cause internalization of receptors. In vivo studies performed using beta-arrestin-2 knockout mice have shown a failure to develop analgesic tolerance to chronic opioid administration. It has also been well documented that different agonists recruit different subtypes of arrestins suggesting desensitization and internalization are regulated by the type of agonist and the corresponding stimulated receptor. For example, morphine shows increased tolerance ability compared to other exogenous opioids due to its variable beta-arrestin recruitment activity. Furthermore, chronic exposure to opioids, either exogenous or endogenous leads to receptor phosphorylation on specific amino acid residues located on the intracellular C-terminus through activation of protein kinases, another phenomenon suspected to be responsible for tolerance development. Receptor phosphorylation recruits arrestin molecules which ultimately decide the fate of the G protein-coupled opioid receptor.

As mentioned earlier, chronic opioid administration cuts down the endogenous opioid production, particularly in the locus cerulus resulting in increased secretion of NE. This high tonic secretion of NE even after the occurrence of a stressful event is considered pathological characterized by a state of agitation and hyperexcitability. Researchers have noted some form of discrepancy in the sensitivity of opioid receptors between genders. Women present with reduced opioid sensitivity compared to men resulting in higher excitability in response to stressors, but consequently, addiction is more prevalent amongst the male gender.
