Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that results from a blunt injury to the brain.

The GCS measures the following three functions:

- **Eye Opening (E):**4-spontaneous, 3-to voice, 2-to pain, 1-none

- **Verbal Response (V):**5-normal conversation, 4-oriented conversation, 3-words, but not coherent, 2-no words, only sounds, 1-none

- **Motor Response (M):**6-normal, 5-localized to pain, 4-withdraws to pain, 3-decorticate posture, 2-decerebrate

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) primarily affects the white matter tracts in the brain. Clinically, patients with DAI can present in a spectrum of neurological dysfunction. This can range from clinically insignificant to a comatose state. However, most patients with DAI are identified to be severe and commonly have a GCS of less than 8. A diffuse axonal injury is a clinical diagnosis.
