Predisposing conditions for perinephric abscess include diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and urinary tract infection and structural abnormalities.

The presentation of a patient with a perinephric abscess is usually non-specific. Patients often present with insidious onset of fever, flank pain, abdominal pain, and fatigue. They may refer pain to the groin or leg area with the extension of infection. Symptoms such as dysuria and urinary frequency typical of urinary tract infection are usually not present in many patients with perinephric abscesses. The most common symptoms were fever and chills in a Korean study of 56 patients admitted with perinephric abscesses.

Elderly patients and patients with autonomic neuropathy, in other words, patients with diabetes or chronic alcoholism, present with more indolent symptoms.
