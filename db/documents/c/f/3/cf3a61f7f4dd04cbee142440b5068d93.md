A valve is a mobile, thin sheet of tissue present in a pathway, and maintains a unidirectional flow through the passage. The heart valves become insufficient, or they get stenosed. Patients with damaged aortic valves are managed with medicines, aortic valve repair, surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Stent placement reduces the lumen of the aortic valve and is not favorable hemodynamically, but there is no difference in the clinical outcomes of two types of valves.
