Hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola is a benign skin disorder but because of poor cosmesis, treatment is desired. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the nurse and pharmacist. There is no medical agent that can erase the skin disorder; some type of mechanical treatment like laser or cryotherapy is required. The treatments are painful and there is the risk for forming keloids and scars.
