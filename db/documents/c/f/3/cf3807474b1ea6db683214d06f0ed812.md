Untreated hypotension can be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Norepinephrine is a first-line agent for hypotension that does not respond to fluid therapy and can be a powerful adjunct in managing a critically ill patient. Members of the interprofessional team must be knowledgeable about pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and the indications and contraindications of norepinephrine use so that it can be utilized effectively to manage hypotension that does not respond to volume resuscitation alone. This activity reviews the indications, dosing, adverse drug reactions, and mechanism of action for norepinephrine as a valuable agent in managing hypotension. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who may benefit from norepinephrine.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the treatment considerations for patients with hypotension.
- Review the management for patients with septic shock.
- Explain the common complications of norepinephrine administration.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving norepinephrine.
