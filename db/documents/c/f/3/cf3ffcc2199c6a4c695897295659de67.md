The breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) is a system for the standardization of mammogram reports. Developed by the American College of Radiology in 1993, its goal is to provide information to referring clinicians and patients in a language that is clear, meaningful and standardized across facilities. Based on scientific data and developed by the worldâ€™s leaders in breast imaging, the BI-RADS system describes key mammographic findings and outlines appropriate follow-up and management.
