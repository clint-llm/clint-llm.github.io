There are some contraindications for itraconazole use. The main one is heart failure or a history of heart failure due to itraconazoleâ€™s potential cardiotoxic effects. Another contraindication is liver failure or disease because itraconazole can cause hepatotoxicity. Itraconazole is also contraindicated in pregnant patients. It has demonstrated teratogenic and embryotoxic effects in animal studies. Researchers found itraconazole to cause eye defects in babies whose mothers had exposure to the drug during pregnancy in a systematic review.

Itraconazole also has the potential for many drug-drug interactions because it is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (specifically CYP3A4) in the liver, like many other drugs. For example, patients taking itraconazole and terfenadine, astemizole, or cisapride may have serious cardiac rhythm disturbances. Itraconazole can also prolong the sedative effects of medications such as midazolam and triazolam, which means clinicians should avoid this combination. Itraconazole can also enhance the effects of oral antidiabetic drugs, which can result in severe hypoglycemia. It is essential to consider drug-drug interactions when prescribing itraconazole, especially if the same cytochrome enzyme metabolizes the other drugs in the liver.
