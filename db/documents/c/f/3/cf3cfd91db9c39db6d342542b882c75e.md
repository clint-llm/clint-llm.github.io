The injury occurs when a child is swung around by the arms, or lifted by one arm. Even seemingly innocuous acts such as pulling on a child’s arm to keep them from falling can lead to radial head subluxation.  The displacement of the annular ligament causes discomfort and pain when the child tries to move the arm.

Less common mechanisms of injury include falling onto the elbow or twisting of the forearm. Radial head subluxation can also occur due to longitudinal traction when a child less than six months of age rolls over in bed onto their arm.
