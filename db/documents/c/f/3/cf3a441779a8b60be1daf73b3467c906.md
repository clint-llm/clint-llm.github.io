Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable oral antibiotic. Rifaximin has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. This antibiotic is used primarily for gastrointestinal and liver diseases since it is specific to the gastroenterology tract due to its nonabsorbable profile. Rifaximin was first approved in the United States in 2004 but has been in use since 1987, when it first received approval in Italy.
