The prostate consists of epithelial acini in a fibromuscular stroma. Almost all adult cases of prostate cancer are adenocarcinoma arising from the acinar epithelium. Rarer variants such as ductal adenocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous neoplasms, basal cell carcinomata, and neuroendocrine tumors (WHO classification 2016) do occur and generally have a worse prognosis. Rarely, non-epithelial malignant transformation results in lymphomas and sarcomas, more commonly following radiation exposure for previous, e.g., rectal cancer.
