Amlodipine is an oral dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Amlodipine works by blocking the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels, thereby inhibiting the initial influx of calcium. Compared to nifedipine and other medications in the dihydropyridine class, amlodipine has the longest half-life at 30 to 50 hours. The benefit of such a long half-life is the ability to have once-daily dosing. Amlodipine is available as amlodipine besylate, which was initially approved in 1987 by the FDA. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of amlodipine in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients who can benefit from amlodipine therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the uses and indications of amlodipine; both approved and off-label.
- Describe the mechanism of action of amlodipine.
- Summarize the adverse drug reactions of amlodipine.
- Outline inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the knowledge on amlodipine and improve outcomes.
