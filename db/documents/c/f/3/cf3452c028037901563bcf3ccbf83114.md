The management of acute and chronic pain is best done with an interprofessional team that includes pain management clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. Given the recent opiate misuse epidemic, the management of pain is undergoing a reassessment. No longer is it considered the standard of care to routinely prescribe opiates to patients for all types of pain. A pain consultation should be considered for chronic pain, and patient education is highly recommended. Ketamine provides a safe and effective alternative to opiate analgesia in a multitude of clinical situations and should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. A well-integrated interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists can safely administer ketamine for analgesia in patients and curb the need for opiate-dependent analgesia. [Level 5]
