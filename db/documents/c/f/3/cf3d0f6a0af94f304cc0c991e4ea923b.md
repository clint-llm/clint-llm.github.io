**Mixed Aortic Valve Disease: The prognosis**is generally good in patients with isolated severe aortic regurgitation (AR) who are asymptomatic and have a preserved LV function. Patients with moderate to severe AR have poor outcomes. Surgical intervention and aortic valve replacement (AVR) can improve the survival rate in symptomatic patients with LV dysfunction.

**Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM):**The mortality rate is very low for patients with HOCM.

**Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA):**PDA severity scores have been developed, which can be used to predict serious outcomes. Ductus closes spontaneously in most healthy newborns; only 3% of infants weighing more than 1,000 gms may require a PDA intervention.
