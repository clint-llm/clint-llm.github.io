Morgagni hernias are rare congenital diaphragmatic defects that can lead to bowel obstruction and incarceration if not repaired. Surgery can be performed through either an open incision or minimally invasive techniques through the chest or the abdomen. As most of these defects are not discovered until later in childhood or adulthood, the long-term prognosis is good, with a low recurrence rate. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Morgagni hernias and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Morgagni hernias.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a symptomatic Morgagni hernia.
- Review the surgical options for the repair of a Morgagni hernia.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by a Morgagni hernia.
