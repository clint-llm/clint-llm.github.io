Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia diagnosis should be explored initially with a laboratory evaluation consisting of a CBC, electrolyte and renal panel, LDH level. Additionally, imaging such as a chest x-ray for symptoms of shortness of breath may be obtained. If abdominal fullness, tendernessÂ or abdominal mass are symptoms, then a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be obtained. This can also help with staging of the disease.
