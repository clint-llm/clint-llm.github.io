Unlike other pre-excitation syndromes, there is no research currently available that explains well the pathophysiology underlying Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) syndrome. Previously, Lown-Ganong-Levine was thought to utilize the bundle of James, which is an accessory pathway connecting the atria to the distal segments of the AV nodes or the proximal bundle of His. However, studies have been unable to isolate a unique pathway in multiple individuals.

Other potential anatomic tracts by which the Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern may occur include Brechenmacher fibers or intranodal bypass tracts. Brechenmacher fibers are quite rare, reported in less than 0.03% of patients, and research has yet to establish a clinical link to the Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern. Regardless, these fibers are theorized to serve as bypass tracts that run from the atrium to the bundle of His and, as a result, are considered to represent a potential cause of LGL. Intranodal bypass tracts are anatomically located with the AV node but allow for rapid conduction through the AV node. As a result, there are also proposals for intranodal bypass tracts as a cause of the LGL pattern.
