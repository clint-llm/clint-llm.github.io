The majority of coronary artery anomalies will be occult on physical examination. Those that cause transient adverse blood flow will present with signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and rarely sudden cardiac death. High flow anomalies, such as coronary artery fistulas or anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), may also present with an audible continuous murmur.
