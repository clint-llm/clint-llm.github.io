The symptoms of PTX-associated keratoconjunctivitis are non-specific and include severe ocular pain, red eye, decreased visual acuity, metallic taste, photophobia, and a foreign body sensation.

A comprehensive ocular examination is also warranted for all patients with symptoms suspicious of toxic ocular exposure. Findings vary from case to case, but the most commonly seen manifestation has been reported as conjunctival injection, followed by a ring-shaped inflammatory infiltrate on initial examination and Descemet's membrane folds.

- Eyelid swelling and diffuse punctate epithelial erosions

- Corneal erosion

- Anterior chamber reactions

- Partially avascular conjunctiva

- Iritis

- Bullae rupture and epithelial defect

- Limbal stem cell failure with resultant conjunctival overgrowth and corneal melting

- Diffuse bilateral punctate epithelial erosions and corneal epithelial infiltrates with “crystalline-appearing” foreign bodies

- Anterior chamber inflammatory changes

- Whitish spots on the limbus

- Punctate bulbar and tarsal conjunctival hemorrhages

Due to the wide variety of presentation and general rarity of clinical presentation, a strong history, and clinical suspicion is needed for an accurate diagnosis.
