In most countries, an enhanced healthcare system is still unavailable. The interprofessional healthcare approach has always been highly appreciated and desired, which brings about a better outcome. Resource-rich countries are already working through multiple healthcare teams to make precise diagnoses and imply appropriate treatment. The need for different professionals depends upon the complexity of the disease process. Tubulointerstitial nephritis has a wide range of etiology, which needs clinicians from various specializations, such as nephrologists, urologists, infectious disease experts, ophthalmologists in cases of TIN with uveitis, and pulmonologists.

Diagnostic approaches can be made effective with the help of histopathologists, radiologists, lab technicians, and microbiologists. Skin rashes in drug-induced hypersensitivity can be managed with the help of dermatologists. Nursing care of patients is an inseparable entity in every hospitalized patient, and pharmacists provide drug education and review side effects. Surgeons have their role in biopsy and chronic kidney disease in renal transplantation with the aid of anesthetists. This way, the comprehensive interprofessional healthcare team drives better results with fewer adverse outcomes.
