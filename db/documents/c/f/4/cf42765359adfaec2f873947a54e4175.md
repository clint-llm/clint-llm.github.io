Despite the commonality of radius and ulnar shaft fractures, studies that define the epidemiology are scarce. It appears that there is bimodal age distribution with peaks before age 40 and after age 60. Men have similar rates of both bone fractures compared to women early in life. However, women experience a higher proportion of fractures after age 60.
