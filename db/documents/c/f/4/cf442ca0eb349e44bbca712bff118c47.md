Indications for ECV include a fetus with greater than 36 weeks of gestation with malpresentation, reassuring fetal status, and no contraindications to vaginal delivery. Most practitioners will proceed with ECV at 37 weeks to decrease the risk of preterm delivery. Factors that may increase success include multiparity, transverse or oblique presentation, complete breech, adequate amniotic fluid, and unengaged presenting part. Factors that are associated with decreased success include nulliparity, advanced dilation, estimated fetal weight of less than 2,500 grams, anterior, lateral or cornual placenta, decreased amniotic fluid or ruptured membranes, maternal obesity, frank breech, fetal spine in the posterior position, and low station with an engaged presenting part.

One alternative to ECV is expectant management with possible spontaneous version, although most fetuses that will spontaneously change presentations to vertex will do so before 36 weeks gestation and are noted more often in multiparous than nulliparous women. Other alternatives are expectant management with a vaginal or cesarean delivery of the breech fetus.
