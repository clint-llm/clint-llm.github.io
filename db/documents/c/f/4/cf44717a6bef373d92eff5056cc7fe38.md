The blood supply of the external nose and the nasal cavity is derived from anastomosing terminal branches of the internal and external carotid artery systems. The blood supply of the external nose is provided primarily by the facial artery, particularly along the lateral aspect and in the lower one-third, with the anterior lateral nasal artery supplying the majority of blood flow to the nasal tip.
