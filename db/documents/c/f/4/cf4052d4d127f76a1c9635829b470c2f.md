Percutaneous transcatheter mitral valve procedures are complex procedures requiring multiple specialties evaluation to determine the best procedural approach for the best outcome.

- The specialty-trained cardiology nurse should assist with patient and family education and patient monitoring throughout the procedure providing feedback to the clinician if untoward changes in vital signs or rhythms occur. They should also assist in providing follow-up care to the patient.
