Pitfalls: The possibility of vertebral fracture should always be considered in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), even after minor trauma. Patients with AS are at increased risk of vertebral fracture and subluxation, especially of the cervical spine. Therefore, these patients are more susceptible to neurologic compromise.

Prevention of disease morbidity can be achieved with exercise, physical therapy, tailored pharmacologic intervention, and regimented follow-up appointments with providers.
