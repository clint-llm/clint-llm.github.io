The pathophysiology of neck injury depends on the mechanism of injury. The neck contains many critical organ systems adjacent to one another. It is for this reason that even innocuous-appearing wounds have the potential to cause either immediate or delayed life-threatening injuries or complications. It is rare to have a cervical injury without a neurological deficit in patients with penetrating neck trauma.

With a low-risk National Emergency X-radiography Utilization Study I (NEXUS I) criteria, spinal cord injuries are unlikely to occur. These criteria obtain only if the patient is:

- Alert and awake

- Not intoxicated

- Has no signs or symptoms of neurologic injury

- Has no spinous process tenderness.

Zone 1 is a dangerous area and injuries in this region are potentially lethal. There is a potential for injury to the following important structures:

- Great vessels in the neck

- Mediastinum

- Cervical and thoracic esophagus

A high mortality rate accompanies zone 1 injuries. **Vascular injuries are the most common of cervical injuries and occur in up to 40% of patients with penetrating neck trauma.**A vascular injury should be suspected in the presence of the followinghard signs. (Hard signs suggest the presence of a serious injury that needs immediate attention or intervention).

Signs suggestive of vascular injury:

- Rapidly expanding or pulsatile hematoma

- Severe hemorrhage or difficult to control bleeding

- Shock refractory to fluid resuscitation

- Decreased or absent pulse

- Vascular bruit or thrill

- Neurologic deficit (On physical examination, this is suggestive of cerebral ischemia)

Signs suggestive of esophageal injury:

- Massive hemoptysis

- Significant hematemesis

- Respiratory distress

The soft signs of penetrating neck trauma include minor hemoptysis, hematemesis, dysphonia, dysphagia, subcutaneous, or mediastinal air, non-expanding hematoma. Beware that penetrating injuries involving zones 1 and 3 have a higher risk for occult vascular injury. Also, beware of the possibility of significant concurrent wounds in these zones to the head, chest, or abdomen. Suspect airway injury if dyspnea, hemoptysis, subcutaneous air, stridor, hoarseness, and dysphonia are present. Esophageal injuries may not be clinically apparent initially. In addition, beware that normal radiographs do not exclude esophageal injury.
