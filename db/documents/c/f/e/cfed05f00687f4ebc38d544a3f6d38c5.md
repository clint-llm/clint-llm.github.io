The exact cell of origin from which basal cell carcinoma proceeds is still a topic for debate. A popular hypothesis is that basal cell carcinoma arises from basal keratinocyte stem cells that lie between hair follicles of the dermal-epidermal junction and in the bulge of the hair follicle. It is hypothesized that unregulated cell growth among these stem cells leads to tumor formation. Mutations in the sonic hedgehog pathway are implicated in up to 80% to 90% of sporadic basal cell carcinoma and predisposing genetic syndromes, including basal cell nevus syndrome. Mutations in this pathway lead to unregulated cell growth due to dysregulation of the PTCH gene. PTCH works as a tumor suppressor with specific suppression of the smoothened protein.
