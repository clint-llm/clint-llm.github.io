Monoarticular arthritis is an inflammation of one joint that may later involve other joints of the body. The differential diagnosis and treatment of subclasses of monoarticular arthritis like infectious arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, gout, pseudogout, and septic arthritis are also discussed. This activity reviews different types of monoarticular arthritis concerning their clinical presentation and will help clinicians and other interprofessional team members to recognize early signs and symptoms of monoarticular arthritis, which prompt early interventions.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of various kinds of monoarticular arthritis.
- Review the risk factors associated with monoarticular arthritis.
- Describe the epidemiology of monoarticular arthritis.
- Outline the importance of communication and healthcare delivery between health practitioners in the evaluation, management, and treatment of monoarticular arthritis.
