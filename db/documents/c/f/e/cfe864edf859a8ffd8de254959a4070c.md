Complications of myelomeningocele classify as either surgical or non-surgical complications.

Surgical complications include infections at the site of the lesion, bleeding, delayed wound healing, re-tethering of the spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Non-surgical complications include:

- Neurological complications: Hydromyelia, Arnold-Chiari II malformation, hydrocephalus, seizures, paraplegia, motor, and sensory impairments, neurogenic bladder, and bowel dysfunction.

- Musculoskeletal complications: Vertebral anomalies such as scoliosis as well as muscle weakness.

- Physical complications: Immobility and delayed age of ambulation.

- Psychological and cognitive complications: Depression, suicide, and intellectual disability.

- Social complications: Educational problems, dependence, and unemployment.

- Sexual complications: Erectile dysfunction, impotence, and fertility problems.

- Others include obesity, renal failure, in addition to cardiac and respiratory diseases.

- Latex allergy: most patients with spina bifida have a sensitivity to rubber, which is a latex allergenic protein. Exposure to latex can lead to an allergic reaction due to the activation of IgE immunoglobulins. The immunological reaction can lead to a life-threatening condition known as anaphylaxis.
