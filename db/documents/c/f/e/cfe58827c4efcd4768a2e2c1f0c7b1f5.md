The function of the internal jugular vein is to collect blood from the skull, brain, superficial parts of the face, and theÂ majority of the neck. The tributaries of the internal jugular include the inferior petrosal sinus, facial, lingual, pharyngeal, superior and middle thyroid, and, occasionally, the occipital vein. The blood collected from these vessels then drains to the brachiocephalic vein and into the right atrium.
