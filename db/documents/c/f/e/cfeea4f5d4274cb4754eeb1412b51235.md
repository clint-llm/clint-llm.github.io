A multi-professional team is critical for achieving the best possible results of olfactory training. This team should include several members such as medical clerks, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physicians. Medical clerks are responsible for the coordination of patients' appointments and ordering and storing the materials needed for olfactory training. Nurses and nurse practitioners screen patients to determine candidacy for olfactory training. They also instruct patients to ensure the olfactory training protocol is followed correctly and thus facilitate the best possible outcome of the therapy—furthermore, they follow up with patients to ensure adherence to the protocol.

Physicians oversee and supervise medical clerks, nurses, and nurse practitioners. Additionally, regular conferences ensure that all team members are apprised of the patients' progress undergoing olfactory training, ensuring all patients' needs are addressed and problems resolved. It is also critical for the team to educate itself regarding current developments in the field of olfaction and olfactory training.
