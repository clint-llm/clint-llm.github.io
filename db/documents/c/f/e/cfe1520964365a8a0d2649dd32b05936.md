A chalazion isÂ a chronic sterile lipogranuloma. They are typically slowly enlarging and non-tender. A deep chalazion is caused by inflammation of a tarsal meibomian gland. A superficial chalazion is caused by inflammation of a Zeis gland. Chalazia are typically benign and self-limiting, though they can develop chronic complications.
