Ciliospinal reflex is characterized by rapid dilation of the ipsilateral pupil (by 1 to 2mm) with a painful or startling stimulus.

Other names of the reflex are

- Pupillary skin reflex

- Cutaneous pupillary reflex

- Pupillary reflex dilation

- Pupil dilation response

- Reflex pupillary dilation

- Cutaneous pupil reflex or

- Skin pupillary reflex.

The name denotes the involvement of the ciliary body and the spinal cord. As the mediation of this reflex is by the cervical sympathetic fibers, it is absent in Horner syndrome.
