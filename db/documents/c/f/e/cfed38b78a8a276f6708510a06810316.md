Within cells, CYP enzymes closely associate with the endoplasmic reticulum and inner mitochondrial membrane activity. The enzymes surrounding the endoplasmic reticulum further express their action to metabolize external substances such as drugs, whereas the mitochondrial enzymesÂ focus on internal substances such as steroid hormone metabolism and fatty acid regulation. Activation of these enzymes is prompted by transcription, as evidenced by varying degrees of expression in correspondence to mRNA levels.

The purpose of drug metabolism is to safely administer the active constituent(s) accordingly and transform an exogenous compound into a more hydrophilic substance. Once it is water-soluble, drugs and their metabolic byproducts travel to the kidneys, where they are then filtered and excreted from the body.
