The etiology behind myelomeningocele is often multifactorial and includes environmental, maternal, and genetic factors. Environmental factors include exposure to radiation, different types of pollution, pesticides, organic solvents, and teratogens. Maternal factors are numerous and include irregular maternal nutrition, low folic acid supplementation, caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking, the use of anticonvulsants, in addition to certain maternal illnesses such as diabetes, obesity, hyperthermia, and anxiety. However, most of the cases of myelomeningocele are sporadic in origin and occur in a non-genetic pattern. Though, some genetic factors might increase the risk of occurrence, for instance, the presence of chromosomal anomalies of trisomy 18 or 13 and patients with an affected twin or first-degree relative. Also, there are more than 40 genetic strains detected in animal models, specifically in mice, were associated with spina bifida aperta. In humans, in contrast, specific genetic mutations of amino-acid altering in the sequencing of coding regions such as planar cell polarity pathway genes and folate one-carbon metabolism encoding enzymes were reported in some patients with spina bifida.
