Histopathologic examination of the thyroid gland in cases with postpartum thyroiditis reveals prominent infiltration of lymphocyte, including associated germinal centers, and the collapse of thyroid follicles. Fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid gland shows thyroid follicular cells, lymphocytes, and accumulation of colloid. During the recovery phase, follicles are more normal, but some degree of fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltration could be seen.
