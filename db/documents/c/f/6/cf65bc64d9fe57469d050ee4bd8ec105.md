Following pneumonectomy, pulmonary functions decrease but are usually less than anticipated for removal of 50% of lung, especially for residual volume, and this may be explained by overexpansion of the remaining lung tissue. FEV1, FVC, DLCO, and lung compliance decrease. Airway resistance increases. Patients with no disease in the remaining lung usually do have normal SaO2, PO2, and PaCO2 at rest. A chest X-ray immediately following pneumonectomy usually show the trachea in the midline and the postpneumonectomy space to be filled with air. Later, that space becomes filled gradually with fluid at a rate of 1 to 2 intercostal spaces/day. The ipsilateral diaphragm becomes elevated, and the mediastinum is gradually shifted towards the operative side.

Resting heart rate typically increases, and stroke volume decreases, following pneumonectomy. Pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and central venous pressure usually do not change. Cardiac function in long-term survivors is usually compromised, and the altered position of the heart may explain this.

Following a pneumonectomy, most common complications include:

- Cardiac arrhythmias, one of the most common complications after pneumonectomy. Atrial fibrillation/flutter is the most common and usually occurs in the first three days following surgery.

- Postpneumonectomy cardiac herniation. It usually occurs within the first 24 hours after surgery, but it has been reported up to 6 months following pneumonectomy. The condition presents with an abrupt drop in blood pressure and hemodynamic collapse. It requires and an immediate reoperation.

- Pulmonary complications like pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure are also common. The incidence and severity of such complications increase with advanced age and may require reintubation and mechanical ventilation.

- About 1.5% to 4.5% of patients undergoing pneumonectomy will end up having a bronchopleural fistula. It is associated with a mortality of 29% to 79%. Risk factors include right-sided procedures, a large diameter bronchial stump, residual tumor, concurrent radiation or chemotherapy, age greater than 60 years, and prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation.

- Injury to the diaphragm, liver, spleen, or a major vessel is also known complications.

- Postpneumonectomy pulmonary edema. It occurs in 2% to 5% of cases and typically presents on postoperative days 2 to 3. It is associated with a significant increase in mortality by up to 50%. Patients usually present with dyspnea and poor oxygenation with an increased alveolar-arterial gradient. It is more common after right-sided pneumonectomy. Liberal IV fluid administration has been implicated; however, it may still occur in patients with restrictive fluid management. Proposed mechanisms include increased capillary permeability, lymphatic damage, and ventilator-induced lung injury. A single intraoperative dose of methylprednisolone just before pulmonary artery ligation may decrease the risk of pulmonary edema as well as ARDS after pneumonectomy.

- Other potential complications include multiorgan dysfunction, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), postoperative acute kidney injury.
