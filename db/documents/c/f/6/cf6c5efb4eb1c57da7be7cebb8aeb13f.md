Ultimately, PPIs function to decrease acid secretion in the stomach. The proximal small bowel absorbs these drugs, and once in circulation, affect the parietal cells of the stomach. The parietal cells contain the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme, the proton pump, that PPIs block. This enzyme serves as the final step of acid secretion into the stomach. Interestingly, PPIs are prodrugs activated only after undergoing an acid-catalyzed cleavage in the acidic secretory canaliculi of the parietal cells. Hepatic P450 enzymes degrade PPIs. While there are slight variations in the exact P450 enzymes that are dominant in the degradation of the variety of PPIs, most dominantly degrade by the action of CYP2C19. Understanding the metabolism of PPIs allows us to understand why some PPIs work better for some individuals than others. For example, those of Asian ethnicity tend to have increased bioavailability of PPIs and thus should be managed initially with lower dosages. Furthermore, as we age, the bioavailability of PPIs increases, and thus dosages in the elderly should also be closely monitored and adjusted accordingly. While other drugs can reduce acid secretion in the stomach, PPIs represent the most potent drugs for acid reduction.
