The primary mechanism of action of alpha-tocopherol is as a scavenger of free radicals. It binds to free radicals, protecting cellular components from oxidative damage. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the cell membrane from free radicals leads to cellular injury. Vitamin E plays a protective role. It also inhibits the aggregation of platelets, monocyte adhesion, and proliferation of cells.

Vitamin E is hepatically metabolizedÂ and is primarily excreted in the bile and feces but also the urine. It is also stored in the body's adipose tissues.
