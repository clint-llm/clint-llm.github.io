The brain, more specifically the hypothalamus, controls thermoregulation. If the hypothalamus senses internal temperatures growing too hot or too cold, it will automatically send signals to the skin, glands, muscles, and organs. For example, if the body is generating heat during high-level exercise or if the external ambient temperature is elevated enough to cause a rise in the core temperature, afferent signals to the hypothalamus result in efferent signals to the cells of the skin to produce sweat. Sweating is one mechanism the body can use to cool itself as heat is lost through the process of sweat evaporation. In contrast, when the body experiences a cold environment, a shivering reflex results in skeletal muscles contracting and generating heat; additionally, the arrector pili muscles (a type of smooth muscle) raise the bodily hair follicles to trap the heat generated.
