Ependymal tumors are rare, constituting 1.7% of all brain tumors, as reported in the most recent CBTRUS statistical report; this poses a challenge in defining the optimal management for these entities. Retrospective studies have described improved survival in patients undergoing resection with adjuvant radiation therapy. There is minimal and limited evidence supporting chemotherapy for adult ependymomas.

No established guidelines use the molecular subgroups to guide the treatment of ependymoma. The current consensus, however, recommends that patients with PF-EPN-A positive ependymoma, who are older than 12 months of age, undergo maximal safe micro-neurosurgical removal in addition to local radiotherapy.

For intracranial ependymomas, surgery is typically the mainstay treatment. Complete resection without residual disease has presented better clinical outcomes and overall survival than partial resection. As discussed previously, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of chemotherapy.
