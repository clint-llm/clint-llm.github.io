**CPET Parameters**

**Peak VO2: Maximal Oxygen Uptake**

Maximal VO2 is the measure of one’s aerobic capacity representing the amount of oxygen taken in by the skeletal muscle during exercise. There is a linear relationship between exercise intensity and oxygen uptake until the cardiovascular system can no longer meet the demands of the exercising muscle. This is known as an oxygen uptake plateau and is achieved following progressive exercise.

VO2 is derived using the Fick equation where maximal oxygen uptake equals cardiac output x the arteriovenous difference (VO2 = CO x (CaO2 – CvO2). Higher VO2 values represent greater aerobic fitness. Men have higher peak VO2 due to increased hemoglobin levels, increased stroke volume, and greater muscle mass.

Declines in VO2 happen with age; there is approximately a 10% decrease every ten years after 30 years of age.

- VO2 < 80% predicted value represents reduced aerobic capacity, suggestive of cardiopulmonary or metabolic impairments.

- A low VO2 despite normal cardiovascular, pulmonary, and metabolic parameters is suggestive of deconditioning.

**Oxygen Pulse**

O2 pulse is the amount of oxygen consumed by the tissues at any given heart rate (VO/HR). This value is used as a surrogate for stroke volume, and decreased O2 pulse often points to a cardiac limitation to exercise.

- <80% predicted is considered abnormal

**Heart Rate**

There is a physiologic max for heart rate based on age. The generally accepted equation is:

- HR = 220 - age

The normal heart rate response to progressive exercise is linear. Peak exercise HR that is 20 bpm below (<85%) age-predicted max for subjects limited by volitional fatigue is considered chronotropic incompetence.

- Exaggerated HR response to exercise may be secondary to deconditioning

- Heart rate recovery: A slowed HRR is associated with a poor prognosis

**Cardiac Output**

Exercise is a state of increased sympathetic tone that is overridden by local vaso-regulatory mechanisms—the metabolic byproducts produced by exercise all favor vaso-regulation, which lowers systemic vascular resistance. Blood shunting occurs when any nonworking muscles/organs remain in a vaso-constricted state to promote more blood flow to the working muscles. The initial phase of progressive exercise CO is mainly increased due to the increased LV stroke volume in response to blood filling (frank-starling). Around 50% of the VO2 max, further increases in CO are augmented due to increased heart rate.

- There is a linear relationship between CO and oxygen uptake

- CO can increase up to 5x more than resting measurements during high-intensity exercise.

**Ventilatory Anaerobic Threshold (VAT)**

VAT is the point in exercise where there is a supply /demand imbalance of oxygen being delivered to working muscles activating anaerobic metabolism. Minute ventilation increases disproportionately to the workload, where for any increases in VO2, VCO2 increases out of proportion. When a plot is drawn with VCO2 as X-axis and VO2 as Y-axis, the point at which the slope of VCO2/VO2 changes from less than 1 to more than 1 is the ventilatory threshold (V-slope method).

- Often occurs between 45-65% of VO2 max.

- <40% is considered abnormal

**Ventilatory Efficiency (VE/VCO2)**

The Ventilatory Efficiency slope is demonstrative of how hard a subject must breathe in order to eliminate CO2. It is the major link between the circulatory and ventilatory response to exercise. During exercise initiation, VE/VCO2 typically decreases due to improved ventilation-perfusion matching. Throughout the performance of exercise, both minute ventilation and CO2 increase in order to maintain acid-base status.

- Often measured at the VAT and can be used in submaximal tests

- AN increased slope represents less efficient CO2 elimination

- Normal VE/VCO2 <35

- It is often elevated in patients with heart failure, as their ventilation is higher for any given amount of CO2.

**Respiratory Exchange Ratio: RER**

It represents the metabolic exchange of gases in the tissues and is dependent on fuel utilization used for cellular metabolism. It is the ratio of CO2 elimination over O2 consumption. RER is mainly used as part of the criteria to measure a maximal effort.

- RER >1.1 indicates significant stress induced by exercise; however, not an indication to stop the test.

- If <1 in the absence of other hemodynamic abnormality or changes in the EKG, it either might be an indication for deconditioning with submaximal cardiovascular effort or severe COPD where the hyperinflation of lungs can interrupt the hyperventilation process needed to exhale the excess VCO2

**Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (OUES)**

This value is the slope of the logarithmic relationship between VO2 and minute ventilation during exercise for any given VO2. The OUES is fairly linear throughout progressive exercise.

- A steeper slope represents a more efficient oxygen uptake

- Known to be a significant predictor for mortality in adult heart failure patients

- Useful for submaximal testing

**Etiologic Categorization of CPET Parameters**

**Cardiac**

- Reduced VO2 max

- Reduced O2 pulse <80% predicted

- Evidence of chronotropic incompetence

- Evidence of ischemia

- Elevated VE/VCO2 slope

**Ventilatory**

- Decreased Oxyhemoglobin saturations, <88% with exercise is clinically significant

- Abnormal spirometry/flow volume loops

- Peak exercise respiratory rate >50 per minute

- Reduced breathing reserve (lower than 20%)

- Elevated VE/VCO2 slope

**Musculoskeletal**

- VAT achieved <40% of VO2 max

- Elevated lactate at any given level of submaximal work

- VE/VCO2 >50

**Deconditioning**

Subject deconditioning is apparent from the following responses:

- Low VO2 measured in ml/kg/min (relative), despite normal VO2 measured in L/min (absolute)

- Low VO2 with the absence of other abnormal responses

- Low VAT

- Exaggerated Heart rate response

**Obesity**

- Increased VO2/work slope

- indexed peak VO2 (mL/kg/min) less than predicted, absolute VO2 (L/min) normal or greater than predicted, oxygen indexed to lean body mass normal or greater than predicted
