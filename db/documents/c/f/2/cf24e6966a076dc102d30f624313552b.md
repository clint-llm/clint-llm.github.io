Here are some important facts:

- The hallmark ofÂ hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome is noted to be fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure.

- Hantavirus is transmitted through inhalation of aerosolized urine or feces of rodents.

- In a patient with a history of rodent exposure and flu-like symptoms consider a hantavirus infection even if it is not a common disease.

- Recent travel to an endemic country (China, Russia, Korea) is also important to consider

- HFRS pathophysiology is rather complicated, but studies note the hallmark of the disease to increase capillary permeability and excessive activation of the host immune system.

- Thrombocytopenia in HFRS is associated with disease severity and prompts ICU admission.

- Supportive care is the most helpful treatment and has been shown to decrease mortality.

- Prevention is achieved by decreasing rodent populations and minimizing contact.
