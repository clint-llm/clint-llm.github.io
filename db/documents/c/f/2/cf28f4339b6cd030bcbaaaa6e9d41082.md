Most cases are associated with epidemics in birds or horses. Patients may provide a history of mosquito exposure. The majority of cases are subclinical. There is no associated rash. When symptomatic, infected individuals present with nonspecific, prodromal symptoms of fever, chills, malaise, weakness, and myalgias, typical of many viral and mosquito-borne infections. Most symptomatic cases will still resolve spontaneously within a few days, without any sequelae. Patients may also complain of a headache, neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Progression to neuroinvasive disease is most common in the extremes of age and presents with vertigo, photophobia, confusion, agitation, somnolence, coma, spasticity, and seizures. Neurologic symptoms may develop more quickly in children than in adults. Young children are most likely to have a permanent neurologic disability, and the elderly are most likely to die from complications. Patients who do recover from the acute neurologic disease may complain of fatigue, headaches, and irritability for years.
