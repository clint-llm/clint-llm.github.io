The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommends that a sweat test be done at a CFF-accredited care center by a trained technician. The sweat test is typically performed on the patient’s arm or leg. The test involves iontophoresis of pilocarpine to stimulate sweat production by sweat glands. Collection modalities include gauze, filter paper, or macroduct coil.
