Treatment of respiratory failure should be directed towards the underlying cause while providing support with oxygenation and ventilation, if necessary. The treatment includes supportive measures and treatment of the underlying cause. However, the initial steps in managing patients with acute respiratory failure should start by assessing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC). Supportive measures depend on patent airways to maintain adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and correction of blood gas abnormalities.

**Correction of Hypoxemia**

The goal is to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation, generally achieved with an arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) of 60 mm Hg or arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), about 90%.

Uncontrolled oxygen supplementation can result in oxygen toxicity and CO2 (carbon dioxide) narcosis. So the inspired oxygen concentration should be adjusted at the lowest level (90-94%), which is sufficient for tissue oxygenation.

Oxygen can be delivered by several routes depending on the clinical situations in which we may use a nasal cannula, simple face mask, nonrebreathing mask, or high-flow nasal cannula.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be needed in refractory cases.

**Correction of Hypercapnia and Respiratory Acidosis**

This may be achieved by treating the underlying cause or providing ventilatory support.

**Ventilatory Support**

Patients with severe acute respiratory failure are usually intubated.****The goals of ventilatory support in respiratory failure are to

- Correct hypoxemia

- Correct acute respiratory acidosis

- Resting of ventilatory muscles

**Common Indications for Mechanical Ventilation Include the Following**

- Apnea with respiratory arrest

- Tachypnea with respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute

- Disturbed conscious level or coma

- Respiratory muscle fatigue

- Hemodynamic instability

- Failure of supplemental oxygen to increase PaO2 to 55 to 60 mmHg

- Hypercapnea with arterial pH less than 7.25

The choice of invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support depends on the clinical situation, whether the condition is acute or chronic, and how severe it is.
