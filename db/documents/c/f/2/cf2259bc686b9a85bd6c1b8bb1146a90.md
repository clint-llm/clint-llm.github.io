The pathophysiology of high-output cardiac failure is largely unique to the underlying etiology. However, they all are characterized by having a low systemic vascular resistance, decreased arterial-venous oxygen gradient, and an elevated cardiac output. The latter is somewhat confusing, but even in the setting of an elevated cardiac output, the output is not sufficient to the bodyâ€™s required demand, leading to clinical heart failure. The decreased supply of blood causes similar neurohormonal alterations seen in other causes of heart failure, with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), adrenergic nervous system, and an excess of antidiuretic hormone. These systems are in place to increase intravascular blood volume in acute and subacute settings. However, chronic activations cause a progressive decline in cardiac function. Simply, in an attempt to compensate for hemodynamic burdens, the heart undergoes hypertrophy and remodeling to maintain contractility and reduction of wall stress by dilatation. Over time, the dilatation exceeds and holds more volume of blood that can be effectively pumped, causing heart failure.

The goal of the adrenergic system is to increase cardiac output, which in high-output cardiac failure is already elevated, by increasing contractility (i.e., stroke volume) and heart rate while maintaining systemic blood pressure by causing vasoconstriction. Activated by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, a decrease in transmission by these receptors in response to low blood pressure causes an increase in sympathetic stimulation. This attributes to ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling.

The RAAS is activated by an increase in renin in response to decreased renal artery perfusion and the adrenergic nervous system. The release of renin leads to increased circulating angiotensin II, causing an increase in aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex and stimulating thirst in the hypothalamus. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption, causing increased water retention at the level of the kidneys in attempts to increase intravascular volume and thereby augmenting preload. An increase in preload allows for increased cardiac output via the Frank-Starling mechanism; however, in an already weak heart, this mechanism does not augment cardiac output as much as it causes excessive hypervolemia, leading to peripheral edema and pulmonary congestion seen in clinical heart failure.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is activated in response to angiotensin II and baroreceptors, causing an increase in water retention at the level of the kidneys. Additionally, the antidiuretic hormone can contribute to vasoconstriction as well.
