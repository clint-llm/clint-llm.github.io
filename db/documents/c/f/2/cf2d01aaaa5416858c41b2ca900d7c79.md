Concomitant urinary symptoms may be complicated by pelvic organ prolapse. Thus, when working up a patient for POP, it is essential to retract the bulge and assess for signs of urinary incontinence that have been masked by prolapse.

Although treatment with a pessary hasÂ an impressive success rate, there are a number of complications patients should be informed about prior to placement. If the patient presents to follow up with vaginal discharge, irritation, ulceration, bleeding pain and odor, vaginal wall ulceration, fistula formation, or bowel herniation, pessary complications should be suspected.

Many complications in the treatment of POP have been associated with mesh insertion. The use of transvaginal mesh and biological graft material in prolapse surgery is controversial and has led to a number of inquiries into their safety and efficacy. Recently, the FDA has abandoned the use of large mesh grafts in the vagina in the correction of pelvic organ prolapse, and vaginal repair is limited to the use of either native tissue or a biological graft.
