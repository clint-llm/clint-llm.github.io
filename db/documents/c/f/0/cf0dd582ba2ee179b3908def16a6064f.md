Neurologist consultation to perform a detailed neurologic examination and localize the lesion is the first step in evaluating bilateral arm weakness. Radiologist interpretation of brain and cervical spine imaging to identify the etiology of the causative lesion should be performed. A neurosurgeon may be consulted if the lesion is amenable to surgical intervention, such as a brain tumor or a compressive cervical spinal lesion. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physiatry collaborate to design and implement a rehabilitation plan to improve motor function.
