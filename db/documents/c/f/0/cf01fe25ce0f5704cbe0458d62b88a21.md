Although a patient may present with physical characteristics that may lead a clinician down the path to diagnosing hemolytic anemia, laboratory markers are key. Results that will help confirm hemolysis are an elevated reticulocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), elevated unconjugated bilirubin, and decreased Haptoglobin.

LDH is found intracellularly, therefore when RBCs rupture, this value increases. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin. Therefore as this protein is fully bound with what little hemoglobin is left, it results in decreased levels of overall Haptoglobin. Unconjugated bilirubin is elevated as the body is unable to eliminate it as quickly as it is produced with the destruction of RBCs.

Warm and cold agglutinins can further differentiate whether the cause is immune-mediated. A direct antiglobulin test (DAT) must be performed.

Hemoglobin concentration, or degree of anemia, can be used as an indicator of the extent of hemolysis that occurs in sickle cell disease (SCD). The inverse correlation of low hemoglobin concentration to a high degree of hemolysis has been supported by evidence of clinical measures such as LDH, reticulocyte count, and indirect bilirubin.
