The main pitfall of initial management is inadequate irrigation resulting in ongoing exposure to the chemical. Another pitfall in the immediate stage of the injury is not debriding particulate matter from the eye, particularly from the superior fornix. Residual particulate matter causes persistent inflammation. A valuable tool to help manage the initial hospital-based irrigation is a commercially available lens that can be applied to the eye and connected to intravenous line tubing to allow hands-free irrigation. If such a commercial lens is not available, adequate, timely irrigation will require an attendant present at the patientâ€™s side to thoroughly irrigate the ocular surface. Topical anesthesia is almost always necessary during irrigation and assessment.
