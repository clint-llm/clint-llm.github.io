Breast cancer staging is determined clinically by physical examination and imaging studies before treatment, and breast cancer stage is determined pathologically by pathologic examination of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes after definitive surgical treatment. Staging is performed to group patients into risk categories that define prognosis and guide treatment recommendations for patients with a similar prognosis. Breast cancer is classified with the TNM classification system, which groups patients into 4 stage groupings based on the primary tumor size (T),  the regional lymph nodes status (N), and if there is any distant metastasis (M). The most widely used system is that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer:

**Primary Tumor (T)**

**Tis: Carcinoma in-situ, Paget‘s with no tumor**

T1: Less than 2 cmT1a: 0.1 to 0.5 cmT1b: 0.5 to 1.0 cmT1c: 1.0 to 2.0 cm

T2: 2 to 5 cm

T3: Larger than 5 cm

T4T4a: Chest wall involvementT4b: Skin involvementT4c: Both 4a and 4bT4d: Inflammatory ca

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**

N1: Mobile ipsilateral axillary nodes

N2: Fixed/matted ipsilateral axillary nodes

N3N3a – Ipsilat infraclavicular nodesN3b – Ipsilat int mammary nodesN3c – Ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes

**Distant Metastases (M)**

M1: Distant metastases
