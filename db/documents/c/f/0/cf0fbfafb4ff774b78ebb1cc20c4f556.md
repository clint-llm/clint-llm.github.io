If left untreated,Â an Addisonian crisis can lead to complications such as:

- Cardiac arrhythmias from multiple electrolyte abnormalities

- Cardiac arrest

- Hypotension can lead to orthostatic hypotension and syncope, with progression to a shock state with hypoperfusion to the organs causing sequelae such as elevated transaminitis (shock liver), bradycardia, and myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, ileus, hypoxic brain injury.

- Hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic coma
