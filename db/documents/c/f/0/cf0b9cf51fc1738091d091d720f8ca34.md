Orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin) is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved anti-obesity medication. It is a saturated derivative of endogenous lipstatin isolated from Streptomyces toxytricini. The FDA-approved indications of orlistat include:

- Patients with obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of over 30 kg/m

- Patients with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m and the presence of risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemias

- Reduction of the risk for weight regains after prior weight loss**.**

The maximum benefit of orlistat occurs when used in conjunction with diet and exercise. The weight starts to decrease within two weeks of initiation of orlistat. Statistically, significant weight loss occurs when orlistat use is for greater than two months.
