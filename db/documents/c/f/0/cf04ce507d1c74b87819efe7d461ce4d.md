Leriche Syndrome occurs secondary to atherosclerotic induced arterial wall injury leading to two out of three factors involved in Virchow triad, endothelial damage, and thrombosis. Once endothelial damage occurs, a resultant inflammatory response leads to lipid accumulation in smooth muscle cells and macrophages, which eventually leads to the formation of a plaque in the arterial lumen.Â Eventually, aortoiliac segments become stenotic by more than 50%, the resultant oxygen debt during exercise causes claudication. Once PAD becomes extensive in the aortoiliac segment, the majority of men with Leriche Syndrome present with impotence and sexual dysfunction secondary to reduced penile arterial flow.
