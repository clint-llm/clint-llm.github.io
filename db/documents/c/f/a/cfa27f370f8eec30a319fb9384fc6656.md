Recognizing the remote effects of cancer is important as they may point towards an undiagnosed malignancy or even recurrence of a previously treated neoplasm. Cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare retinal paraneoplastic disorder associated with cancer that can cause blindness. Investigations helpful in identifying this condition include visual fields, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), electrophysiological tests, and antibody testing. This activity will highlight the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of cancer-associated retinopathy and the role of the interprofessional team in managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of cancer-associated retinopathy.
- Describe the findings and investigations required for the evaluation of cancer-associated retinopathy.
- Review the different options for the management of cancer-associated retinopathy.
- Summarize the importance of patient education and interprofessional team strategies to improve the outcomes.
