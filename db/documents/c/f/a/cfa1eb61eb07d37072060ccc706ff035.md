The etiology of PCNSL is unclear and is largely undefined, similar to other types of lymphoma.

Acquired causes like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, chronic immunosuppression, and organ transplant are other commonly known etiologies. PCNSL is an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining event and is associated with low CD-4 counts < 50 cells/microliter. AIDS-related PCNSL shares an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 100 percent of the time.
