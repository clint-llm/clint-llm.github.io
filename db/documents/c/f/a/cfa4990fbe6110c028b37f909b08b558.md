Calcium gluconate is a vesicant that can cause extravasation injury leading to tissue necrosis; see “Adverse Effects” above.

Systemic toxicity due to calcium gluconate is identical to the systemic effects of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia typically manifests as nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, anorexia, and polydipsia. Hypercalcemia causes ECG changes, including short QT interval, prolonged PR interval, widened QRS, T wave abnormalities, and variable degrees of heart block.
