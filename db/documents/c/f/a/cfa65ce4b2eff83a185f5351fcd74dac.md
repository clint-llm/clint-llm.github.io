Treatment of metastatic lung lesions is a combined interprofessional team effort. It requires collaboration between oncologists and other specialists such as pathologists, pulmonologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and interventional radiologists before a successful treatment plan can be outlined and carried out for the patient benefit. Oncology nurses and pharmacists are invaluable in providing ongoing care. Board-certified oncology pharmacists review medication for the dose and interactions and discuss various chemotherapy regimens with the oncologist. They provide education to patients and their families regarding how the drugs work and the adverse effects. Oncology nurses administer treatment, monitor patients for both effectiveness of therapy and adverse events, provide symptomatic care following chemotherapy, counsel the patients and their families, and inform the team of changes in patient status. This interprofessional collaboration will result in better patient outcomes for metastatic disease. [Level 5]
