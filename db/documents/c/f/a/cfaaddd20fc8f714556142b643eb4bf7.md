The mainstay of treatment for bullous pemphigoid is systemic corticosteroids, but treatment ultimately depends on comorbidities and the extent of the disease. For localized disease, less than 20% body surface area in an elderly patient, super-potent topical steroids such as clobetasol may be used.

For extensive disease, systemic prednisone at a dose of 0.5 to 1.0mg/kg per day is recommended. This dose of systemic corticosteroids controls the disease within approximately two weeks and can be slowly tapered over six to nine months or longer. This treatment regimen is limited by patient age, comorbidities, and side effects. Potent topical corticosteroids can control generalized BP with fewer systemic side effects.

Immunosuppressive therapy is used when steroids do not control the disease or if patients have contraindications for systemic corticosteroid treatments. Alternative agents include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, chlorambucil, and cyclophosphamide. If all other treatments fail, IVIG, anti-CD20 (rituximab), or omalizumab can be used for treatment-resistant cases.

Serum IgG autoantibodies levels to BP180 have been shown to correlate with disease severity in several ELISA-based studies. Also, a high BP180-NC16A ELISA score and positive direct immunofluorescence at the end of therapy show possible relapse.
