Uroporphyrinogens are cyclic tetrapyrroles (four pyrroles connected in a ring structure by methylene or methine bridges) with four propionic acid (P) groups and four acetic acid (A) groups. The various uroporphyrinogens differ by their arrangement of the side groups. The order of the side groups in uroporphyrinogen III is (in clockwise order) AP-AP-AP-PA, while the order in uroporphyrinogen I is AP-AP-AP-AP.
