- Cardiac syncope is a transient loss of consciousness due to a defect, either structural or electrical, which prevents the generation of enough cardiac output to perfuse the brain adequately.

- Cardiac syncope is more common in patients with preexisting cardiac abnormalities or family histories of cardiac defects or sudden death.

- When cardiac syncope is suspected, EKG and echocardiogram are very useful in making a definitive diagnosis. Long-term rhythm monitoring can be employed if these tools are unsuccessful.

- Pacemaker placement can prevent future syncopal events due to a high-grade block or defect in conduction at the SA node, AV Node, bundles, or fascicles.

- Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators can be used to prevent dangerous arrhythmias from precipitating a sudden cardiac death in patients with severe heart disease or symptomatic congenital channelopathies.
