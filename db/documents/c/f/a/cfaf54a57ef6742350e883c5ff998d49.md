Back pain is one of the most common chief complaints in the emergency department. It is also a leading cause of disability and high healthcare expenses globally as it affects patients of all ages and backgrounds. Mechanical back strain is a subtype of back pain where the etiology is the spine, intervertebral discs, or the surrounding soft tissues. While the majority of cases of mechanical back strains that present to the emergency department can be managed conservatively, healthcare providers must be aware of the common red flags that signal more emergent causes of back pain and that are associated with high morbidity and mortality when the diagnosis is delayed.
