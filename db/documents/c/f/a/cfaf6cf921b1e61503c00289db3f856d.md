Intravenous midazolam is used for the induction of anesthesia and also in the management of acute seizures. Because of its water-soluble nature, midazolam has a rapid onset of action and can be used to manage status epilepticus when intravenous administration of other medications is not feasible. Midazolam has a high rate of tolerance, and the dose can be increased to maintain the therapeutic effect. Because of its easy mode of administration through the buccal and intranasal routes, it is a viable option in children to manage seizures. For its use in anesthesia, the response to the induction dose is more variable compared to thiopental. Midazolam can be used for anxiolysis and hypnosis during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia and is also superior to thiopental in the maintenance of anesthesia because of the less need for adjunct medications. Midazolam is an adjunct medication to regional and local anesthesia for a wide range of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and has greater patient and physician acceptance.
