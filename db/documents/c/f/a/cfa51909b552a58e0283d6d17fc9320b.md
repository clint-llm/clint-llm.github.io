In diagnosing and treating myofascial syndrome, many professionals should interact to optimally address the patient's condition; doing so requires the intervention of an interprofessional healthcare team. The clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA) will make the diagnosis, and based on the etiology; the patient will be directed to specialists, for example, the physiotherapist, the osteopath, the chiropractor, the psychologist, and the nutritionist. It will be an interprofessional team that treats the patient because they need physical, psychological, and nutritional support. Pharmacists should be included as part of the team to assure accurate dosing and no drug-drug interactions from pain management pharmacotherapy. The clinician should not only examine painful areas but all aspects of the patient's health. Interprofessional care coordination and open communication regarding findings and patient progress will drive optimal patient outcomes for myofascial syndrome. [Level 5]
