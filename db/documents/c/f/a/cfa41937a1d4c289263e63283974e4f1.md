Like most diseases, medical management usually precedes surgery. Surgery for nasal polyps, although generally safe and well-tolerated, has multiple risks, including significant bleeding, epiphora, and rarely, damage to orbital or intracranial structures. Therefore, it is always important to start patients on intranasal corticosteroids and nasal saline irrigations, assess compliance, and follow their improvement.

Failure to respond to medical management or the presence of very severe symptoms might warrant surgery. Furthermore, patients should understand that although surgery will improve their quality of life significantly, it might not cure the disease. Patients should continue medical management to optimize surgical results. Close follow-up is indicated to ensure the patient’s quality of life is satisfactory. The 22-item sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22) is a valuable instrument to assess a patient’s burden of disease and track improvement throughout the treatment period.
