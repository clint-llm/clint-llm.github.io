There are indications for late preterm, early term, late-term, and post-term labor induction depending on a patient's obstetric and medical history. Obstetric indications encompass placental, uterine, and fetal conditions such as growth restriction and multiple gestations, oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, alloimmunization, and PPROM (preterm prelabour rupture of membranes). Maternal indications that warrant labor induction includes hypertensive disorders pregestational and gestational diabetes (GDM). This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and possible complications of labor induction. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of pregnant women undergoing induction of labor for various reasons.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for induction of labor (IOL).
- Review the contraindications for IOL.
- Summarize the complications of IOL.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for pregnant women undergoing IOL.
