There are many constituents in the aerosols and liquids of e-cigarette cartridges. The most common include glycerol, propylene glycol, and nicotine. Micro-constituents that have been found in smaller concentrations include acrolein, formaldehyde, acetone, acetaldehyde, heavy metals, and many more.

Due to the profound cardiovascular and respiratory harm induced by conventional cigarettes, it is crucial for further research to help reveal the short-term and long-term consequences of the new alternatives. Early studies suggest a short-term increase in vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate. Other studies have shown that e-cigarette vapors induce platelet activation in the endothelium of healthy na√Øve participants.

Furthermore, exposure to any form of nicotine has been shown to impair the development of neural circuits and to lead to a permanent impairment of neurochemical and behavioral functioning.

Much anecdotal evidence exists suggesting e-cigarettes have associations with the development of chronic respiratory symptoms.

In 2019, outbreaks of vaping associated lung injuries were reported in increasing numbers throughout the United States.
