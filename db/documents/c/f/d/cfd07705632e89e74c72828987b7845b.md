Following a hemorrhage, patients need education on what to expect in their recovery and how to avoid future recurrence. Studies have found that survivors often do not reach their rehabilitation goals and report a lack ofÂ accessibility to resources. Before discharge, patients should have discussions with the healthcare team on the goals for rehabilitation and how they can seek support during their recovery. Patients and their families also need education on what to realistically expect in the recovery process. Providing access to social and financial support can help manage the stressors that arise.
