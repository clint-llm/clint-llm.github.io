The clinical presentation may vary based on the birthweight and gestational age at birth. For example, the most common signs in neonates weighing over 2500 grams include fever, irritability, seizures, and bulging fontanelle. In contrast, apnea, jaundice, and abdominal distention are most common in those weighing less than 2500 grams.
