Classical diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells are large (15 to 45 micrometers), have abundant slightly basophilic or amphophilic cytoplasm and have at least two nuclear lobes or nuclei. Diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells must have at least two nucleoli in two separate nuclear lobes. The nuclei are large and often rounded in contour with a prominent, often irregular nuclear membrane, pale chromatin and usually one prominent eosinophilic nucleolus, with perinuclear clearing (halo), resembling a viral inclusion.

Mononuclear variants of Reed-Sternberg cells are Hodgkin cells. They are characterized by a single round or oblong nucleus with large inclusion-like nucleoli.

Some Reed-Sternberg cells may have condensed cytoplasm and pyknotic reddish nuclei. These variants are known as mummified cells.

Reed-Sternberg cells surrounded by formalin retraction artifact are termed ''lacunar cells''. The latter are characteristic for nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma subtype.
