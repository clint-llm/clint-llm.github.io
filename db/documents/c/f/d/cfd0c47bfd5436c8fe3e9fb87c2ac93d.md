Once infected with HIV-1, the development of AIDS can be delayed up to 10 to 20 years.

It is important to know the limitations of laboratory data when approaching a patient with newly diagnosed renal failure. Positivity of ANCA has been found secondary to HIV infection in up to 20% to 83% of cases, with a proposed mechanism being polyclonal activation of B cells. The sensitivity of c-ANCA for GPA is 64% with indirect immunofluorescence.

Renal disease in the setting of HIV manifests in several ways. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with interstitial inflammation and microcysts involving direct infiltration of renal tubular and glomerular cells by HIV.

Another form of renal disease in the setting of HIV is called HIV immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK). It is also usually seen in advanced HIV and black race. The prognosis is also poor with 32% of patients reaching ESRD status within two years.

Before starting ART in an antiretroviral naïve patient with impaired renal function, there are several considerations to keep in mind.  First, certain ART medications require renal adjustment or are contraindicated with impaired renal function.

Having HIV is no longer a contraindication for renal transplantation. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) strongly recommends the evaluation of HIV patients with ESRD or imminent ESRD for kidney transplantation after considering comorbidities, history of opportunistic infections, and virologic response with ART.
