Patient mobility is an important aspect of patient care, particularly in the setting of major surgery or severe chronic illnesses that require prolonged immobilization in bed. Deep venous thrombosis, pressure ulcers, muscular atrophy, pulmonary embolism, and bone demineralization are potential complications of inadequate immobilization, and active intervention is necessary to optimize patient outcomes.

Appropriate mobilization of patients is important to minimize physical complications, but also to improve the social and emotional well-being of patients. Therefore barriers to effective patient care must be identified and addressed.
