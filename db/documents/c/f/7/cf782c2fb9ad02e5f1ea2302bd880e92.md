Consultation with a urologist should be done once the diagnosis is established.  Nephrology can be consulted if there is renal failure. A consultation with a local healthcare expert on medical stone prevention testing and prophylactic treatment should be considered in all patients who have a history of stones and are interested in minimizing future stone production.  Depending on the community, this could be a urologist, nephrologist, endocrinologist, or internist; whichever individual healthcare practitioner has sufficient interest and experience in the medical treatment and prophylaxis of nephrolithiasis.
