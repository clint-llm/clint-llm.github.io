In rare instances, doxycycline has correlated with hepatic injury about 1 to 2 weeks after starting therapy. Hepatic injury can range from hepatocellular to cholestatic or mixed. There is often a quick onset with reported symptoms of DRESS syndrome, such as rash, fever, and eosinophilia.

Acute doxycycline hepatitis was noted in a patient receiving treatment of pulmonary actinomycosis after 1.5 months of 200 mg/daily dose of doxycycline. Liver function tests showed markedly elevated ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT. Liver biopsy demonstrated centrilobular necrosis, indicative of toxic hepatitis.
