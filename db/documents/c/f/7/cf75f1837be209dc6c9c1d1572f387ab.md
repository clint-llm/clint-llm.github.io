A saline infusion may be needed in the neonatal period. The target is to normalize potassium levels in serum which can be achieved with oral potassium supplementation such as KCL 25 to 100 mmol/day. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) help decrease elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone levels, limit proteinuria, and increase serum potassium in some cases. Other options include amiloride 5 to 40 mg/day, spironolactone, NSAID (indomethacin 1-3 mg/kg/24 hours) to antagonize increased urine PGE2 levels. Magnesium supplementation should be considered, as hypomagnesemia may aggravate potassium wasting.

Tubular abnormalities usually are resolved after kidney transplantation with no recurrence.
