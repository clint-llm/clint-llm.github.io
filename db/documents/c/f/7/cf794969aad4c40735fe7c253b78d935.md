Skin biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other closely mimicking diseases. Histologically A, B, or C subtypes can be identified. Once the diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis is confirmed, no complimentary assessments are needed. The blood count in the search for circulating atypical cells is useless. Complete blood count with biochemistry and lactate dehydrogenase are done as baseline tests. The potentially associated hematological diseases being, almost exclusively, cutaneous lymphomas, only attentive clinical examination of the skin is necessary. No imaging studies are indicated unless there is a concern for secondary lymphoma.
