Pseudomembranous colitis results most commonly from C. difficile infections; however, less common etiologies include ischemic colitis, collagenous colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cytomegalovirus-induced colitis, vasculitis, bacterial and parasitic organisms, Behcet’s Disease, chemotherapeutic medications, and toxins, such as heavy metal poisoning. Often considered as solely a nosocomial pathogen, C. difficile most commonly causes diarrheal illness in the elderly with histories of antimicrobial utilization or healthcare facility stays. Other C. difficile risk factors include the history of prior C. difficile infection, advanced age, use of gastric acid-suppressing medications, gastrointestinal surgery, feeding tubes, immunodeficiency, chemotherapy, chronic kidney disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. The absence of risk factors does not exclude the presence of C difficile infection.
