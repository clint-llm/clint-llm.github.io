For early cases, treatment is usually curative. However, treatment may be complicated due to late diagnosis, antibiotic treatment failure, and concomitant infection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and immune suppression.

Approximately 5% of patients will have lingering symptoms of fatigue, pain, or joint and muscle aches after treatment. These symptoms can last for 6 or more months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Chronic Lyme disease is generally managed similarly to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome. Whether chronic disorder exists remains debatable. The reason is that there are many non-validated testing systems on the market that are often falsely positive. In addition, there has been a public hysteria about chronic Lyme disease, with patients demanding treatment. In most cases of so-called chronic Lyme disease, the workup is usually negative. Further, there is no evidence that long-term antibiotic therapy helps. Most patients eventually recover without any residual sequelae.
