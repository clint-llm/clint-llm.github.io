The mechanism of endorphins can be viewed through two different lenses through activity in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the CNS. In the PNS, the perception of pain relief is produced beta-endorphins bind to opioid receptors. Opioid receptors are broken down into four primary classes of G protein-coupled receptors: mu-receptors, delta-receptors, kappa-receptors, and nociceptin receptors. The greatest binding potential exists between the beta-endorphins and the mu-receptors. Mu-receptors can be found throughout the nerves of the PNS. When this beta-endorphin to mu-receptor binding occurs on nerve terminals (happening pre-synaptically or post-synaptically), analgesic effects are realized. The effects are realized as the aforementioned binding results in triggering of chemical events preventing the release of substance P, amongst other tachykinins, which is an instrumental undecapeptide in the conveyance of pain. Just as beta-endorphin to mu-opioid binding occurs in the peripheral nervous system, it also occurs in the central nervous system. There is a difference, though, as the mechanism triggered by the binding opposes the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as opposed to substance P. With this suppression of GABA, the result is an increase in production and action of dopamine, the pleasure, and reward-associated neurotransmitter.
