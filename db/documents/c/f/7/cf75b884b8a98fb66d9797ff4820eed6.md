**Serum CA-125 Assay**

Serum CA-125 assay is a useful tool that helps to distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian masses. The combination of normal findings at serum CA-125 assay, imaging, and clinical findings exclude the possibility of ovarian cancer.

**Imaging Studies**

Several imaging techniques are useful for the diagnosis of ovarian cystadenomas. They include

- Pelvic ultrasonography (US)

- Computed tomography

- Magnetic resonance imaging

The features that are more suggestive of a benign cystic neoplasm include

- Unilocularity of cysts

- Minimal septations

- Thin walls

- and absence of papillary projections

The cell type of cystadenomas cannot be determined based on imaging findings.

Ultrasonography:

The initial imaging study recommended in the evaluation of adnexal masses is the pelvic US. The transabdominal US or the endo-vaginal US should is the study of choice to evaluate ovarian masses.

Computed tomography:

Although CT is a useful imaging technique in diagnosing adnexal masses, it is sometimes of limited value.

Magnetic resonance imaging:

Benign epithelial ovarian neoplasms are predominantly cystic, in contrast to malignant epithelial neoplasms which comprise both cystic and solid components. Cystic lesions containing simple fluid have prolonged T1 and T2 relaxation times and very high signal intensity on T2- weighted images.

**Histopathology**

The definitive diagnosis of ovarian cystadenomas is based on histopathological examination of the surgical specimen.
