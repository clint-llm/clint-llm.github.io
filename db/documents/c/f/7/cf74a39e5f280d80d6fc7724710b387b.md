The subthalamic nucleus plays a vital role in the modulation of movement. It helps to modulate movement through the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia with the other components of the basal ganglia.

Indirect Pathway:

The indirect pathway of the basal ganglia consists of the glutaminergic excitatory neurons from the cortex and substantia nigra to the striatum. The striatum then projects inhibitory GABAergic neurons to the external globus pallidus, which projects inhibitory GABAergic neurons to the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus projects excitatory glutaminergic neurons to the internal globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticularis. These structures then project inhibitory GABAergic neurons to the thalamus. The thalamus then sends excitatory glutaminergic neurons to the cortex.

Disruption of the neurons of the subthalamic nucleus results in the decreased firing of its glutaminergic neuronal outputs to the internal globus pallidus and substantia nigra reticularis. Decreased excitation of the GABAergic neurons of the globus pallidus internal results in reduced inhibition of the thalamic neurons. With no inhibition, the thalamic neurons fire excessively, resulting in hemiballismus.
