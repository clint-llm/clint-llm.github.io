After a thorough history and physical examination, the following imaging modalities are used for the diagnosis of fibroadenomas.

**Diagnostic Mammogram**

A mammogram uses x-rays to evaluate the suspicious masses in women above 35 years of age. Fibroadenoma on a mammogram appears as a distinct area from other breast tissue, with smooth round edges. See figure 1.

Mammographic features of fibroadenomas are variable from a well-circumscribed discrete oval mass hypodense or isodense of breast glandular tissue to a mass with macro lobulation or partially obscured margins. Involuting fibroadenomas in older, typically postmenopausal patients may contain calcification, often producing the classic, coarse popcorn calcification appearance.

**Breast Ultrasound**

Ultrasound (US) uses sound waves to detect the features of fibroadenomas in women younger than 35 years of age. US easily differentiates solid from the cystic masses. On US, a fibroadenoma is typically seen as a well-circumscribed, round to ovoid, or macrolobulated mass with generally uniform hypoechogenicity.

If necessary, a minimally invasive biopsy may be performed via a core needle biopsy****
