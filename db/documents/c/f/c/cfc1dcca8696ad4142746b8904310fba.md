While generally rare, injuries to the penis from zipper entrapment are actually the most common cause of penile trauma in adults, with roughly 2,000 reported cases yearly. When they occur, the individual often presents to the emergency department with the prepuce caught in the zipper after having unsuccessfully tried home management. It often presents with swelling, pain, bruising, and edema related to the injury. Adult patients are often extremely reluctant to come to the hospital for this type of problem due to extreme embarrassment, which can cause delays in presentation and treatment. The majority of affected patients are children.
