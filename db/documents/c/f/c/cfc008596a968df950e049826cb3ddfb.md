**Magnet Inhibition**

When a patient with a pacemaker requires surgery or a procedure where electrocautery or related devices will be used, this can interfere with the function of the device. Thus magnet inhibition is commonly done. Placing the magnet over the pacemaker temporarily reprograms the device into an asynchronous pacing mode but does not completely switch it off. After the procedure, the cardiologist has to reprogram the device.

In most cases, almost any pacemaker can be inhibited this way. Further, there are some pacers, in which the magnet function can be disabled.
