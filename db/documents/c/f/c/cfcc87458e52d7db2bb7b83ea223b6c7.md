It is essential to evaluate the patient with suspected adult acquired flatfoot during weight-bearing. There are specific hallmark findings of adult acquired flatfoot for which practitioners should look. While the patient is standing with the provider behind excessive abduction of the forefoot can be noted by the “too many toes” sign. This test is positive if the practitioner can see more than the fifth and part of the fourth toe. Inspection and palpation over the posterior tibial tendon at the area of the medial malleolus may demonstrate swelling or pain. On the lateral aspect of the foot pain may be elicited if there is impingement of ligamentous structures.
