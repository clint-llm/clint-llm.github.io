Rumination syndrome is considered an acquired habit and is therefore reversible. Diaphragmatic breathing proved in multiple studiesÂ to be of benefit by decreasing regurgitations.

Moreover, limited data suggest that symptoms in patients with rumination syndrome can recur. A 2018 study evaluating 47 adolescents with rumination syndrome over 12 months reported continued improvement in rumination symptoms over time with a cessation of rumination symptoms for at least six months in 20% of the patients.
