The notochord induces neurulation around week three of gestation. Noggin, chordin, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), and fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) are some of the genes involved. The neural tube forms from the ectoderm and closes by week six. The rostral end will be the lamina terminalis. The neural tube differentiates into three primary vesicles for the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, in addition to the spinal cord. The forebrain differentiates into the telencephalon and diencephalon, the midbrain continues to be the mesencephalon, and the hindbrain becomes the metencephalon and myelencephalon. These structures continue to differentiate into adult brain structures. The hypothalamus and posterior pituitary are derived from the diencephalon. Furthermore, the neural tube separates into the alar (sensory) and basal (motor) plates, which are separated by the sulcus limitans. The hypothalamus is derived from interneurons in the alar plate, making it a sensory and motor integration center.
