The pathophysiology that causes aniridic fibrosis syndrome is unknown. However, observations from published literature can give us clues into the underlying mechanisms. In reported cases, the fibrotic membrane appears to originate from the rudimentary iris and is first noticeable as a growth on the posterior chamber (PC) IOL. The membrane may pull the PCIOL anteriorly, and progressive growth in late-stage disease reportedly causes additional tilting of the PCIOL and eventual contact with the cornea.
