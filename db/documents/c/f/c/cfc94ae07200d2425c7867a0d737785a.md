Routine labs may reveal leukocytosis and other non-specific findings secondary to the viral infection. The diagnosis is via serologic detection of West Nile virus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the IgM antibody in blood or CSF samples. A plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) can distinguish serologic cross-reactions.

Hyponatremia may be seen when the CNS is involved.

Neuroinvasive West Nile virus will typically have findings consistent with viral meningitis on lumbar puncture. Analysis of CSF shows elevated protein and leucocyte levels, with a possible predominance of neutrophils early, transitioning to a lymphocytic predominance accompanied by normal glucose levels. For neuroinvasive disease, the CSF should also be tested using the ELISA test. In patients with a high suspicion of viral infection and an initial negative test, a repeat should be performed 10 days later as IgM levels may take time to elevate to the levels necessary to be detectable.

Imaging: CT of the brain will typically not show any acute findings of the disease. MRI may show abnormalities after several weeks of acute neuroinvasive disease.
