Laboratory values (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody) are often normal in DISH. Radiographic evaluation with AP and lateral spine imaging in patients with DISH demonstrate “flowing candle wax,” which describes the non-marginal syndesmophytes that project horizontally from the vertebrae and form extra-articular ankylosis, this is distinguishable from the vertical “bamboo spine” that forms intra-articular disc space ossification in ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Increased radiodensity, preservation of facet joints and disc spaces on spine imaging help further distinguish DISH from AS, which may present with osteopenia and degenerative changes.

Given that the thoracic spine is most commonly involved, the clinician should have a low threshold for obtaining thoracic spine or chest radiographs even in patients with primary neck or low back pain, stiffness, and diffuse extremity complaints.

Minor trauma in patients with DISH may result in fracture and instability. These may commonly result in missed injuries that lead to neurologic compromises and delayed treatment. Occult fractures in these patients must be aggressively evaluated using advanced imaging (CT, MRI, or CT myelogram).
