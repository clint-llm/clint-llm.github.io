The anatomy of the mouth differs from the skin. Due to the lack of histological landmarks analogous to the papillary, reticular dermis, and muscle bundles, a pathological leveling system, and description cannot be appropriately applied for mucosal melanomas. Therefore, Clarkâ€™s levels, commonly used in cutaneous melanoma, cannot be implemented. Many melanomas in the mouth have a histologic similarity with lentigo maligna melanoma in a radial growth phase.

Mucosal melanomas can show three principal patterns. An in situ melanoma is in the epithelium and does not cross the epithelial-connective tissue interface.

The characteristic histopathological features of mucosal melanomas include atypical melanocytes (hyperchromatism and nuclear pleomorphism) in the epithelium and connective tissue junction. This, combined with positive S-100 and HMB-45 markers, is confirmatory of mucosal melanoma.

Approximately 15% of cases of oral melanoma are in situ mucosal lesions, 30% of cases are invasive lesions, and 55% of cases have a combined pattern of invasive with in situ components. Most advanced lesions have a combination pattern of invasive melanoma with an in situ component.

**Immunohistochemistry**

Although not specific, S-100 and HMB-45 are helpful markers that are positive in almost all oral melanomas (94%).
