The clinical significance of MORs lies in their ability to provide pain relief to patients. However, it is also critical to remember the importance of managing patients who have overstimulated MORs and are experiencing an opioid overdose. If a patient presents with opioid overdose, antagonism of the MOR is made possible by various medications, one of the most common being naloxone.

Agonism of the MOR has proven incredibly helpful in the clinical management of individuals presenting with both chronic or acute pain. Still, it is essential to ensure that the administration of MORs agonists occurs in circumstances where appropriate and safe administration of the drug is available.
