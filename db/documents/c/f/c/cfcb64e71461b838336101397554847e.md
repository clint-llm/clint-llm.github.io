Noncontrast head computerized tomography (CT) imaging is quick and widely available so it is typically the first and most efficient method of evaluation for those patients who present with signs and symptoms of possible cerebellar hemorrhage. Most hemorrhages are readily identified as hyperdense lesions in the cerebellum. On occasion, dense calcification of the dentate nucleus can be confused with hemorrhage, but the absence of a mass effect, sharp margins, and bilateral presence should point more towards calcification over a hemorrhage. Contrast extravasation following an endovascular procedure will also appear dense like a cerebellar hemorrhage, but dual-energy CT can differentiate the two.
