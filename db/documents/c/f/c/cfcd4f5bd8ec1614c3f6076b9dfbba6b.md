In centers equipped for colonic stenting, a colonic stent can be inserted via a colonoscope under radiological guidance to decompress the bowel. This can be used in some patients to avoid an emergency operation and enable them to have a laparoscopic resection later. The patient should consent for stent complications such as migration and perforation, as well as the possibility that successful placement and decompression fails, in which case either a stoma or a resectional procedure are necessary.
