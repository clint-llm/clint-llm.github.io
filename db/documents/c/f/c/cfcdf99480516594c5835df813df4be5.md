In about half of individuals, the retroduodenal artery (i.e., the posterior superior and anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries) forms an arterial plexus that provides the primary blood supply to the region of the sphincter of Oddi. The remaining half receives blood supply to the sphincter of Oddi directly from one of the major branches of the retroduodenal artery, with the most likely branch being the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery.

The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch from the gastroduodenal artery, itself arising from the hepatic artery branch from the celiac trunk. The lymphatic drainage of the sphincter of Oddi follows the drainage of the encompassing ampulla of Vater, which drains into the posterior pancreatoduodenal lymph nodes, followed by the lymph nodes around the superior mesenteric artery, and finally into the para-aortic lymph nodes that follow their well-described path of drainage.
