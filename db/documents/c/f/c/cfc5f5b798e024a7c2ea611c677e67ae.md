Skin resurfacing with a chemical peel is a powerful tool that can restore a more youthful and rested appearance to the aging face. It is also used to manage other skin conditions with the aim of homogenizing pigmentation and reducing textural unevenness. Skin resurfacing with chemical peels ultimately aims to enhance a patient's appearance and thus, self-esteem.
