TLE is distinguished by abundant dermal mucin deposition and a superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate. Edema in the papillary dermis is noted. There is no involvement of the epidermis or dermo-epidermal junction. Lack of atrophy, scarring, follicular plugging, and dyspigmentation are the salient features of TLE. Direct immunofluorescence studies are usually negative. It is important to note that reticular erythematous mucinosis (REM), and Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate are indistinguishable histologically from TLE.
