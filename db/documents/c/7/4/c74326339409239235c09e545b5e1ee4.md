The annual incidence of new-onset ON has been reported between 0.56 and 5.1 cases per 100,000

Risk factors for ON include age (20 to 40 years), sex (female:male = 2:1), and race (Caucasian).

Children infrequently develop bilateral ON but childhood disease is not believed to foreshadow the development of multiple sclerosis

An increased incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS) in temperate climates has been proposed

Studies have identified that the northern United States and western Europe have more cases relative to equatorial regions
