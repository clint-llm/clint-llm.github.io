Prognosis of SAD involves using quite a range of interventions, including antidepressants, light therapy, CBT, and vitamin D. Nearly 70% of patients experience recurring conditions of this SAD. Early diagnosis and treatment and proper education of the community on SAD are crucial in managing the condition and alleviating SAD symptoms. Close monitoring of SAD patients is also essential in managing an extreme SAD case, such as hypomania.

The cause of chorionic SAD can be either disabling or chronic, depending on the severity. Therefore, patients should first be investigated to determine the severity of the symptoms entailing the possibility of manic and hypomanic symptoms as linked to an increase in exposure to light. Patients are advised to remain compliant with their medications to avoid recurrence of the symptoms during the small window of change. Symptomatic relapse may prove more severe than the initial symptoms.
