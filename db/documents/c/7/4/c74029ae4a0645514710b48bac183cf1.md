V-series nerve agents inhibit acetylcholinesterase. The phosphorus moeity binds to the phosphoryl group in the esteratic subsite. The role of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme is to break down acetylcholine in the synapse into acetate and choline, and the enzyme can degrade approximately 25,000 molecules of acetylcholine per second. When the acetylcholinesterase enzyme is inhibited, it causes acetylcholine to accumulate in the synapse and thus continue to stimulate the acetylcholine receptors. Salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, and vomiting are caused by the stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the parasympathetic nervous systems. Skeletal muscle symptoms of fasiculation and paralysis are caused by the stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Nerve agents have also demonstrated the ability to inhibit other enzymes, including neurotoxic esterase (NTE).
