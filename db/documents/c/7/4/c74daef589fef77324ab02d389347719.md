Rh incompatibility is dependent on the prevalence of Rh-negative blood types, which varies among different populations. ResearchersÂ estimate that the frequency of the Rh-negativity occurs more frequently among those of Caucasian (North American and European) descent (15% to 17%) compared to those of African (4% to 8%) or Asian descent (0.1% to 0.3%). Worldwide, the prevalence of Rh disease is estimated to be 276 per 100,000 live births, which is significant considering that an estimated 50% of untreated cases of HDN will either die or develop brain damage due to the disease. In comparison, the prevalence of Rh disease in developed countries has been reduced to 2.5 per 100,000 live births, which can be attributed to higher-quality perinatal-neonatal care.
