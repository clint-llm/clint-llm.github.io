Stercoral colitis occurs when a patient has chronic constipation leading to stagnation of fecal matter. This leads to an increase in volume, impaction, and eventual deformation of the colon. Fecaloma consists of hardened fecal material form, which becomes lodged in certain colonic areas. Focal compression on the colonic wall and vasculature by fecalomas can lead to decreased blood flow to the area. When blood supply does not meet cellular metabolic demand, ulceration, and pressure necrosis of the bowel wall will develop.

Typically, ulceration occurs in areas adjacent to the fecaloma. These ulcerations typically occur on the antimesenteric side of the bowel, likely because the blood supply arises from the mesentery, making the antimesenteric side more vulnerable to ischemia.

Seventy-seven percent of the stercoral ulcerations are found in the sigmoid colon or the rectum. This is because stool in the rectosigmoid colon has decreased water content and is present in the narrowest portion of the colon. Less commonly, bowel dilation can compress the vasculature of an entire segment of the affected bowel. This can lead to diffuse compression of veins and decrease outward blood flow, eventually leading to intramural edema, arterial compromise, and ischemic colitis. Colon involvement of more than 40 cm and intestinal perforation are the biggest predictors of mortality.
