The hip joint is a di-arthrodial articulation that connects the femur and the pelvis. This anatomical configuration provides mechanical stability and multidimensional motion. The joint capsule itself is responsible for a majority of the pain experienced in the hip. Furthermore, the joint is largely supplied by the femoral, sciatic, and obturator nerves. The joint capsule itself is a complex arrangement of articular branches receiving contributions from the aforementioned nerves.  Sakamoto and colleagues identified two articular branches to the hip joint derived from the femoral nerve, namely from the pectineus and iliopsoas muscles.

Although less studied, the posteromedial portion of the joint capsule also likely has contributions from the nerve to the quadratus femoris and sciatic nerves.
