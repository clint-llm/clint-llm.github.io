Tacrolimus toxicity commonly presents as acute renal failure. Close monitoring of serum creatinine, GFR, and urine output is necessary for patients on tacrolimus.

Toxicity may also present as the development of adverse effects such as tremors, electrolyte disturbances, headaches, and increased SCr.

No antidote exists currently to counter toxicity. Hemodialysis does not remove tacrolimus.
