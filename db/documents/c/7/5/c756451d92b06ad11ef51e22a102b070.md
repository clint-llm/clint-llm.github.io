When there is a restriction to the normal flow of urine through the urinary tract, there will be a back pressure of urine into the collecting system of the kidneys. In time, this may produce dilatation within the tract, and as the kidneys filtration system becomes affected, it becomes the primary reason for the development of obstructive nephropathy. The mechanism of nephropathy, in this case, involves many factors, including local ischemia due to distention and increased intratubular pressures.  In a partial obstruction, angiotensin and AT1-receptor appear to be upregulated, increasing ureteral peristalsis to help relieve the obstruction.

While peristaltic function may be of benefit in a partial obstruction, it is likely to cause increased distention and intraluminal pressures when the obstruction is complete. Rat models have also demonstrated influence from the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and TGF-beta1 expression was markedly increased in hydronephrotic kidneys, which may occur in humans as well, but further studies are needed.
