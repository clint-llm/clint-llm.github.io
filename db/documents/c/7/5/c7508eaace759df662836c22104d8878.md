Historically, tibial eminence fractures most commonly occurred in pediatric patients that fell off of a bike. As athletic participation has become more common, sports-related injuries have become another common causeÂ of injury as the mechanism of injury is similar to that of a mid-substance ACL tear in young adult athletes. Other possible causes include motor vehicle accidents or from low impact injuries where the knee is flexed, and an internal rotation moment occurs through the tibia.
