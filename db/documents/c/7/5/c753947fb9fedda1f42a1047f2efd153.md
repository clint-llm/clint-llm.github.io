All newborn infants should be assessed with a high index of suspicion for jaundice. Evaluation of a patient presenting with hyperbilirubinemia suspicious for breast milk jaundice must include methods to rule out other pathologic causes of hyperbilirubinemia. First, both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin levels must be measured. Conjugated bilirubin levels less than 1 mg/dL or 20% of the total bilirubin level are considered normal. Conjugated bilirubin levels in excess of this indicate other disorders such as biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, and disorders of bilirubin excretion. Both breast milk jaundice and hemolytic anemias cause elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic causes for hyperbilirubinemia, such as ABO incompatibility, G6PD deficiency, and hereditary spherocytosis, must be ruled out. Assessment should include direct Coombs’ testing, measurement of hemoglobin, hematocrit and reticulocyte count, a peripheral blood smear, and genetic testing.

The clinician will investigate other possible causes of hyperbilirubinemia if jaundice does not resolve by 12 weeks of age. Galactosemia and hypothyroidism have also been identified as causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and should be ruled out via standard newborn screening tests.
