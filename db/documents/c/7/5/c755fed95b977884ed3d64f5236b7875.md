Hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy)' refers to the overproduction of more than one class of immunoglobulins by plasma cells. It is most commonly associated with liver disease, acute or chronic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and some malignancies. Hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) is generally considered a benign condition that does not progress to overt malignancy, contrary to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). This activity outlines the evaluation and management of 'hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy)' and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy).
- Review the appropriate steps in evaluating a patient suspected of having hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy).
- Identify the management considerations for patients with hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy).
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of hypergammaglobulinemia (polyclonal gammopathy) and improve outcomes.
