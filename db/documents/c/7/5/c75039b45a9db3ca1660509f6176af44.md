An interprofessional team educates and manages the patient with acute rejection. Health care providers should advise the patient about treatment options and offer psychological support. Acute rejection is very common but if the diagnosis is made early, the graft can be preserved with treatment. However, constant monitoring is required to assess the function of the graft and to prevent further graft rejections.
