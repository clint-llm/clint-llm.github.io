The differential diagnosis of pseudohyponatremia should include the entire spectrum of disease associated with hyponatremia. Likewise, it is essential to note that the diagnosis of pseudohyponatremia does not exclude the possibility of additional disorders of sodium homeostasis that may be masked by laboratory error.

Disorders to consider in the differential of a low sodium level include the following:

- Hypertonic or isotonic hyponatremia due to exogenous infusion: mannitol, glucose, glycine, sorbitol, or ethanol

- Hypertonic hyponatremia due to hyperglycemia

- Hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia due to gastrointestinal, renal injury, or skin loss of free water

- Hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia due to adrenal insufficiency

- Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia due to psychogenic polydipsia, renal injury, chronic urinary obstruction, hypothyroidism, beer potomania, excess pain, or syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone release (SIADH)

- Hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia due to chronic renal injury, heart failure, or liver disease

- Congenital or acquired metabolic derangements of sodium, such as renal tubular acidosis, Liddle syndrome, Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, pseudohypoaldosteronism, etc.

Following the exclusion of other causes of hyponatremia are excluded, the differential diagnosis of pseudohyponatremia may include the following:

- Hypercholesterolemia

- Hyperproteinemia

- Hypergammaglobulinemia

- Cholestasis (resulting in accumulation of lipoprotein X)
