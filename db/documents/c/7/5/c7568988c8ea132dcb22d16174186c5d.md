Ranolazine is a relatively new drug for angina. While cardiologists chiefly prescribe the medication, it can be prescribed by primary care providers, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners. It is crucial for all interprofessional healthcare team members who prescribe this agent or manage patients who have had it prescribed to know that high doses of ranolazine cause dose-dependent increases in dizziness, tremor, dysphagia, hallucinations, unsteady gait, nausea, and vomiting. This interprofessional team includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists. Supportive therapy should be given in cases of overdose. ECG monitoring may be necessary if a ranolazine overdose occurs. Ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, so hemodialysis will not effectively clear it in case of an overdose. In addition, the patient's renal function needs to be monitored. Before starting the drug, a baseline ECG is recommended as the drug is known to prolong the QT syndrome. With an interprofessional approach to ranolazine therapy, better patient outcomes are achievable while limiting potential adverse events. [Level 5]

Researchers are examining the potential role of ranolazine in atrial fibrillation, but it has not yet received FDA approval for that purpose.
