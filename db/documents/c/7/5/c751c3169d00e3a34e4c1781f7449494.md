The nasoseptal flap has been widely embraced by the skull base surgical community as it has broad indications, high success rates, and low complication rates. Early concerns about its use in children have been assuaged. It has been identified as a safe option for skull base reconstruction with no evidence of adverse effects on craniofacial development.

In general, very few complications of the nasoseptal flap have been described. In their 44 patients Drs. Hadad and Bassagasteguy described no consistently observed complications with one episode of CSF leak, one episode of epistaxis requiring cautery, and a few cases of asymptomatic synechiae.Â The CSF leak was resolved in all cases, the flap was preserved and successful, and the septum was re-mucosalized without perforation.

An Australian prospective cohort study sought to identify changes in quality of life after utilizing the nasoseptal flap for skull base reconstruction.
