Parry Romberg syndrome (PRS) or progressive hemifacial atrophy is a progressive idiopathic disorder, presenting in early childhood, with a spontaneous halt and remission in the teenage years. Therefore, the management of cosmetic disfigurement, neurological, psychological, and ophthalmological manifestations poses a significant challenge. This activity outlines the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of PRS and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in providing better care and rehabilitation of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical manifestations of Parry Romberg syndrome (PRS).
- Review the diagnostic approach and summarise the systemic treatment options for PRS.
- Explain the management guidelines for the ocular manifestations of PRS.
- Outline the modalities of cosmetic rehabilitation of the patients of PRS.
