In healthy bone, the bony tissues undergo constant remodeling. Two processes occur simultaneously: resorption of the bone executed by osteoclasts and production of new bone mediated by osteoblasts. Maintaining a healthy balance between these two processes is key in maintaining bone homeostasis.

Bisphosphonates and calcium pyrophosphates are similar in structure. In healthy bone, calcium pyrophosphates bind to calcium, forming a strong bond.

Bisphosphonate toxicity can be seen at both therapeutic dosing and overdoses. It is also independent of the renal or hepatic function of the patient. Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake before, during, and after bisphosphonate therapy limits some of the adverse effects, especially hypocalcemia.
