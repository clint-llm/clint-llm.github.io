Aflibercept is a medication used to treat and manage neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, myopic choroidal neovascularization, macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion, and diabetic retinopathy. It is in the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF) antagonist class of medications. Aflibercept acts as a soluble protein decoy for VEGF receptors to inhibit the predominant signaling pathway responsible for angiogenesis and vascular leakage. Aflibercept and other anti-VEGF inhibitors have become the gold standard in controlling neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in managing patients with exudative retinal diseases.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved indications of aflibercept.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of aflibercept.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving the use of aflibercept.
- Review the most common adverse events associated with aflibercept therapy.
