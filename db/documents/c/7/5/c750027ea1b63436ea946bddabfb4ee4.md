Axillary nerve injury typically presents with other brachial plexopathies. Axillary neuropathies are due to traumatic injuries, traction injuries, quadrilateral space syndrome, and brachial neuritis (also called neuralgic amyotrophy or Parsonage-Turner syndrome).

An anterior dislocation and forced abduction of the shoulder joint appear to be common causes of axillary nerve injury in young people.
