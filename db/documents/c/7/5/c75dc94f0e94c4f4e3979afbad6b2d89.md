The development of the radius occurs through endochondral ossification and begins with lateral plate mesoderm - the origin of all long bones. Endochondral ossification is the replacement of hyaline cartilage with bone. Mesoderm-derived mesenchymal cells become chondrocytes, which proliferate rapidly and form a bone template.

Chondrocytes near the center of the model begin laying down collagen and fibronectin to the matrix which allows for calcification. Around week six of gestation, the calcification prevents nutrients from reaching the chondrocytes. The chondrocytes eventually undergo apoptosis. Blood vessels proliferate through the spaces vacated by the chondrocytes and eventually form the medullary cavity. Around the 12th week of gestation, osteoblasts create a thick area of compact bone in the diaphysis called the periosteal collar which becomes the site of primary ossification. Epiphyseal plates (growth plates) at either end of the bone contain proliferating chondrocytes, that continue to elongate the bone, until puberty. During puberty, sex hormones cause secondary ossification centers to form, and the epiphyseal plates ossify in a congruent fashion as the diaphysis.
