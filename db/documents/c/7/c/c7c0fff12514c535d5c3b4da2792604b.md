A patient presenting with stress-induced gastritis usually has undergone a recent stressful physiologic event, such as severe polytrauma from a significant motor vehicle collision or a fall resulting in multiple broken bones. Stress-induced gastritis also can be elicited by severe illness, like ventilator-dependent pneumonia or a massive myocardial infarction. Finally, patients may present with stress gastritis after major surgery. It is pertinent to mention that some forms of psychiatric stressors such as major, untreated depression can result in stress gastritis.

The physical exam may demonstrate stable or unstable vitals, depending on the eliciting insult. If a patient has undergone major surgery, the vitals may be stable; however, the insult to the body may still be great. In a patient who experienced a massive myocardial infarction, one would expect more labile vitals. Lastly, a patient with polytrauma and hemodynamic instability would be expected to have very unstable vitals until resuscitated.The following signs and symptoms are present in typical cases.

- Coffee ground vomitus

- Hematemesis

- Melena

- Abdominal pain

- Nausea

- Orthostasis in severe cases
