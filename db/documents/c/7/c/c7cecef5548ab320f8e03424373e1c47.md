There are few contraindications to videostroboscopy. The procedure is minimally invasive to the patient and requires the passage of a flexible laryngoscope through the oral or nasal airway or a rigid endoscopy into the mouth. The procedure is usually well tolerated with appropriate patient preparation and coaching by the examiner. As the "slow-motion" effect can only be produced with prolonged phonation that creates periodic vocal cord vibration, cooperation from the patient is essential. The effectiveness of the examination may be limited by anxiety and discomfort, however, as not all patients are able to comply with instructions calmly during the process. Patients with strong gag reflexes, histories of vasovagal episodes, anxiety regarding medical procedures, or airborne communicable infections may not be the best candidates for videostroboscopy or nasolaryngoscopy. Bleeding disorders and anticoagulation are relative contradictions because the passage of the scope through the nasal cavity may cause mucosal damage and epistaxis; in clinical practice, though, bleeding is rare and tends to resolve spontaneously.
