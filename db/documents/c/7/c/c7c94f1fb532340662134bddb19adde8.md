The nerve pathway is traceable as a line between the axilla and the medial condyle of the humerus. The nerve touches the coracobrachialis muscle and the medial area of the brachial biceps. The nerve may have functional abnormalities in the absence of direct trauma, if anatomical abnormalities are present, such as accessory coracobrachialis muscle or biceps brachialis.
