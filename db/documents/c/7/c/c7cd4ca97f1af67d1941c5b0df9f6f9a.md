**Assessment: Hornblower’s sign**

Hornblower’s sign can be used to assess the teres minor for injury, particularly a tear. The patient’s arm should be placed at 90 degrees in the scapular plane with the elbow flexed to 90 degrees. The patient will then externally rotate against resistance, trying to make a “field goal” sign. The test is positive if the patient cannot rotate the shoulder externally, indicating minor pathology.

**Quadrangular Space Syndrome**

Quadrangular space syndrome produces excessive or chronic compression on structures that pass through the quadrangular space, including the axillary nerve and posterior humeral circumflex artery. The syndrome can be caused by overuse of the arm, particularly in overhead activity, or traumatic injury, like a shoulder dislocation. The teres minor is innervated by the axillary nerve and supplied, in part, by the posterior humeral circumflex artery. Therefore, quadrangular space syndrome can result in selective atrophy of the teres minor, vague shoulder pain, and paresthesia.

**Tendinitis**

The rotator cuff muscle tendons, including the teres minor tendon, can be inflamed or irritated in a condition called tendinitis. In general, tendinitis is usually an exertional injury caused by repetitive use; rotator cuff tendinitis is caused by repetitive use of the arm, often in overhead activities. The patient will present with pain or clicking when raising the arm above the head. Treatment is conservative, including rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications. Stretching and strengthening exercises help to reduce the load through the tendon. Cortisone injections can be used for refractory pain.

**Shoulder Impingement Syndrome**

Shoulder impingement syndrome is defined as compression or impingement of the rotator cuff tendons, including the teres minor, by the overhanging bone of the scapula called the acromion. Impingement is caused by narrowing of the space between the acromion and the rotator cuff, often due to repeated overhead activity of the arm that inflames the rotator cuff tendons. Patients can present with shoulder pain, particularly when trying to lift an arm overhead or in conjunction with shoulder weakness. Treatment is conservative, including rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medications. Physical therapy can help rebuild strength and range of motion in the shoulder.

**Tear**

Any of the rotator cuff muscles, including the teres minor, can tear. Tears can either be acute or chronic. An acute tear usually results from falling on an outstretched arm or an attempt to lift something heavy. A chronic tear occurs over time and is typically secondary to tendinitis or shoulder impingement syndrome wearing away at the muscle. A rotator cuff tear will not heal without surgery; however, good function of the affected shoulder can often be gained non-surgically.
