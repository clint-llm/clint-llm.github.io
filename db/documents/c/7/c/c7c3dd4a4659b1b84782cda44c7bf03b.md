The true incidence of branchial cleft anomalies in the United States is unknown despite their relative frequency. This is likely due to the variety of both the anomalies and their presentations complicating accurate reporting. There is no ethnic or genderÂ predilection. Most branchial cleft anomalies arise from the second pouch, while the first, third, and fourth pouches are rare, and 10% of branchial cleft anomalies are bilateral. These typically present in the first decade of life, but if no external communication is present, the presentation may be delayed into adulthood.
