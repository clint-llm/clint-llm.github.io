Human infection due to Rhodococcus equi was first reported in 1967 by a young man on immunosuppressant agents who was working in a stockyard. As the name implies, the infection is closely linked to animals, horses and foal are considered as the natural host. Other species of Rhodococcus similarly described as human pathogens include Rhodococcus fascians, Rhodococcus rhodochrous, and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Rhodococcus belongs to the Nocardiaceae family which also comprises Nocardia, Mycobacterium, Corynebacterium, and Gordonia with some similarities among the group.

Immunosuppression, especially defects in cell-mediated immunity, plays a major role in disease and is present in most reported cases even though infection has also been described less commonly in immunocompetent hosts. Common immunocompromised conditions where infection had been described include HIV, solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, and following chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, or prolonged steroid use.
