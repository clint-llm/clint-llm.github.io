Lambl excrescences are slender filamentous processes that are neither sessile nor pedunculated. They occur on the endocardial surface where valvular cusps make contact with one another. Histologically, these are acellular, composed of a core made of fibro-elastic tissue covered by stroma, both densely hyalinized. This, in turn, is covered by a single layer of endothelium. They lack vasculature, hence are devoid of granulation tissue. Lambl excrescences are almost always found on either native or even prosthetic heart valves. Very rarely, strands may also be seen on sites other than heart valves, for example, papillary muscles, atrial septum, and chordae tendineae.

Lambl excrescences can appear as a single strand or in a cluster. They are approximately 1 mm in diameter and can reach up to a length of 10 mm. The length is stunted due to their strategic location on the valvular cusps which exposes them to high stress, especially, when located on the aortic valve which is subjected to relatively higher pressures compared to other valves. Sometimes multiple adjacent excrescences adhere to each other forming “giant Lambl excrescences” which can grow up to a length of 2 cm. Despite some case reports of giant Lambl excrescences being associated with ischemic stroke, no clear evidence in medical literature shows a correlation between the size of the strand and the risk of the embolic event.
