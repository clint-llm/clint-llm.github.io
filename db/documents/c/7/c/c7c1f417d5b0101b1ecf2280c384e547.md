Worldwide, most HIV infections are caused by HIV-1, and in 2018 an estimated 38 million people were infected globally.

Of the new cases identified, 55% were diagnosed in the Northeast, with an additional 30% being diagnosed in the Southern United States.

Several studies have demonstrated that the demographics of HIV-2 are shifting.

Phylogenetic and modeling studies have attributed up to 30% of the decline in HIV-2 prevalence to competitive exclusion, with the remaining 70% attributable to population-level socio-behavioral interventions.
