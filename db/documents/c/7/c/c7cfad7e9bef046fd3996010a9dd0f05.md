Coordinating care between healthcare professionals is an essential aspect of patient care, especially when modulating a patient's pharmacological therapy. Whether a woman's menstrual headaches are being managed by a neurologist or in the emergency setting, it is important to coordinate with all clinicians. Patients should see the same clinician or, at the very least, a provider in the same health network where other specialists can easily access the electronic medical record. Having old records is an invaluable tool to see if there are any medication regimen changes, history differences, or physical exam findings.

Whether it is a neurologist, an emergency clinician, or another specialist currently treating the patient, improving care coordination with the primary careÂ clinician would minimize adverse effects from new interventions. For example, if a woman with an acute migraine presents, and she does not know that she has an underlying cardiac problem, and she is given triptan therapy, this can lead to fatal coronary vasospasm. Coordinating medication regimens with input from a pharmacist can be a very helpful interprofessional strategy.

Monitoring a patient's headache calendar and coordinating the dates with the patient's menstrual cycle is key to targeting treatment. If there are clear differences in the pattern of quality, location, and timing in the patient's previous recorded headaches, it can suggest an alternate diagnosis. Collaborating care can ultimately change patient management and help identify if the patient needs outpatient therapy versus emergent treatment. Nursing also provides crucial care, coordinating actions between various disciplines and providing necessary patient counseling.

The importance of communication between the interprofessional team cannot be undervalued as patients started on combined hormonal contraception can have serious adverse effects. Patients being treated for acute migraines that have worsened may need to change their long-term treatment regimen but not before clinicians, and other associated healthcare providers coordinate therapies.
