Occlusal contact relations are between the maxillary and mandibular dental arches. The quality of these contacts allows for efficient mastication. Nutritional status is dependent on the dental status of a patient, as prior literature has shown.

There are many ways to examine the quality of occlusion, and this is exemplified when considering dental implants or denture design. In maxillofacial trauma, occlusion can be altered from the trauma itself or suboptimal management of fractures. Keeping the dental occlusion as the foundation for these repairs prevents long-term malocclusion.
