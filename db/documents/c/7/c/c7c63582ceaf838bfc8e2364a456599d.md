Electrical alternans is usually associated with pericardial effusion which is associated with many disease states including infection, inflammatory syndromes, trauma, malignancy, and idiopathic to name a few. Although the majority of effusions have an underlying cause, as much as 20% are from unknown causes, making approach and eventual treatment challenging. Incidence of pericardial effusion overall is low in symptomatic patients presenting with ECG findings of alternans. Despite this, effusion should remain on the differential as this is a potentially fatal complication if it remains unrecognized.
