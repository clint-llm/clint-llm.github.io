Airway assessment tools can help predict the difficulty or ease of intubation.

The multidimensional nature of airway assessment requires an individualized approach for each patient. Factors such as patient position, situational urgency, available resources, and skills and experience of the healthcare practitioner all contribute to selecting the most suitable assessment technique.

In conclusion, airway assessment requires clinical judgment, physical examination, and innovative technology. While traditional methods play a vital role, newer techniques such as ultrasound and video laryngoscopy, alongside AI-driven methods, may offer improved accuracy and efficiency. Embracing these advancements while acknowledging their current limitations will be vital to enhancing patient safety and outcomes in the future.
