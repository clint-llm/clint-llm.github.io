The internal thoracic artery, superior epigastric artery, inferior epigastric artery, left subclavian artery, right subclavian, and right brachiocephalic artery anastomose to form collateral vessels to the thoracic and abdominal aorta. It is mportant to note that over time, in severe distal artery or aortic sclerosis, or coarctation of the aorta, significant enlargement of these vessels occurs to provide blood supply to lower limbs.

The course of epigastric arteries on the abdominal wall slightly varies among different individuals. The SEA is found 3 to 8.5 cm lateral to the midline of abdomen bilaterally. The IEA can be 4 to 8 cm from midline regardless of body fat habitus or levels.
