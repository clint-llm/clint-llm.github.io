Histologically, the bile duct injury may be inconspicuous, consisting of reactive and focal degenerative changes in bile duct epithelium. These cells become ballooned and vacuolated. The pathologist may note pyknotic nuclei and mitotic figures.

In the most advanced stage, there is often portal edema with polymorphic inflammatory cells containing neutrophils. Frank cholestasis may present with the presence of bile pigment within Kupffer cells and hepatocytes and bile duct proliferation with canalicular bile plugs.

At late stages, portal tract fibrosis may be prominent, and appropriate treatment must precede this irreversible stage.
