Among the genitourinary cancers, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the seventh most common cancer in men and has a high mortality rate. The prognosis of metastatic RCC is poor, with a median survival of about 13 months and 5-year survival under 10%. However, with newer therapies, overall survival has improved. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
- Review the evaluation of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
- Outline the treatment options for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
- Summarize the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing the management of clear cell renal cell carcinoma to improve outcomes.
