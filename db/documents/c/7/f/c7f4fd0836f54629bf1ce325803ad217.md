Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) refers to a group of CD30-positive T-cell lymphomas that have overlapping morphologies and immunophenotypes but have different genetics and clinical behavior. The 2017 World Health Organization Classification (WHO) characterizes ALCL into three distinct subsets: ALK-positive ALCL, ALK-negative ALCL (ALK(-) ALCL), and breast implant-associated ALCL. ALK-positive refers to the presence of chromosomal rearrangements of the ALK gene at 2p23 with varied gene partners. These tumors typically have a favorable prognosis. In contrast, ALK(-) ALCL lacks ALK gene rearrangements and generally have poorer outcomes than ALK-positive ALCLs with more variable genetic and clinical features

In most studies, about 40% to 50% of systemic ALCLs are ALK-negative
