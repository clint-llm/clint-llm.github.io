The vertebral column supports our bodyâ€™s physical structure and nervous system, enabling movement and sensation. Pathology of the spine can lead to debilitating outcomes on quality of life. The vertebral column (spine) defines the animal subphylum Vertebra, or vertebrates, of the phylum Chordata. In humans, it is composed of 33 individual vertebrae grouped into the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal regions. There are 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, and 4 coccygeal vertebrae. Along with the skull, ribs, and sternum, these vertebrae make up the axial skeletal system.
