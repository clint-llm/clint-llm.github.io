In patients presenting with unstable SVT, vagal maneuvers are contraindicated, and healthcare personnel should perform emergent synchronized cardioversion.

Carotid Sinus Massage – Avoid carotid sinus massage (CSM) in patients with carotid bruits and patients with a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Also, avoid it in patients who have experienced ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or myocardial infarction in the past three months.

Valsalva Maneuver
– No absolute contraindications. The patient must be capable of following commands. Tachypnea and dyspnea are relative contraindications due to the unlikeliness of success.

Diving Reflex – The adult or adolescent patient must be able to submerge their face in a basin of ice water without risk of aspiration. The safest and most commonly used alternative employs filling a plastic bag with ice water, which prevents aspiration and airway obstruction in the higher risk pediatric and elderly populations.
