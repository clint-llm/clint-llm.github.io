The immunologically mediated process associated with inflammatory back pain also correlates with a cycle of unbalanced bone remodeling, which leads to osteoporosis that is notable within the first 10 years of diagnosis. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are twice as likely to experience vertebral fracture as the general population, most commonly with extension in the cervical region. Spinal cord injury is 11 times more common in AS, and patients with long-standing disease are at increased risk of cauda equine syndrome. Further, patients with axial spondyloarthropathy may be at higher risk of renal disease with an 8% increase in abnormal urinalysis compared to the general population.

Chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with inflammatory back pain carries associations with a variety of possible complications. NSAIDs have links with exacerbation of peptic ulcer disease, increased risk of cardiovascular events in at-risk populations, incitement of renal injury or failure, and exacerbation of existing reactive airway disease. Administration of NSAIDs should commence in consideration for patientsâ€™ underlying disease process associated with inflammatory back pain, other comorbid illness, and other medications they are taking, particularly glucocorticoids, anticoagulants, diuretics, and SSRIs.
