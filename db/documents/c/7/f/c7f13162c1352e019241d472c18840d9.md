Because lead is not biodegradable, it demonstrates remarkable environmental persistence.

Another ubiquitous potential source of lead is tap water, typically secondary to the presence of lead in plumbing. Though the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned the use of lead in pipes and solder used for plumbing in 1986, up to 10 million homes are still thought to be served by lead service lines.

A variety of occupations and hobbies may expose adults to lead, and working parents may inadvertently bring lead home where they can expose their children second-hand. Some of the highest risk occupations and hobbies include metal welding, battery manufacturing, and recycling, shipbuilding and shipbreaking, firing range use or instruction as well as bullet salvaging, lead smelting and refining, painting and construction work, and pipefitting and plumbing.
