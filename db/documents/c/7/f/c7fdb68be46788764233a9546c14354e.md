Several risk factors can lead to the development of bronchiolitis obliterans. It is one of the most common noninfectious complications after lung transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Other etiologies of bronchiolitis obliterans include exposure to inhaled toxins and gases, including sulfur mustard gas, nitrogen oxides, diacetyl (used as popcorn flavoring), fly ash, and fiberglass. Bronchiolitis obliterans is also associated with autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and less commonly with inflammatory bowel disease. It is also known to occur after a respiratory viral infection (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus), especially in children. Other infections associated with bronchiolitis obliterans are HIV, Postinfectious (mycoplasma, bacteria, fungi), and Human Herpes Virus (HHV) 8. Rare conditions like Castleman disease and paraneoplastic pemphigus have also been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans. Other associations include microcarcinoid tumorlets and Cryptogenic constrictive bronchiolitis.
