Ankle sprains remain one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries that present to the emergency department. Ankle sprain is frequently seen in certain sports and is best managed by an interprofessional team approach. The key to ankle sprain is to prevent them in the first place and this requires patient education. Healthcare workers including nurses should emphasize the importance of stretching and conditioning to minimize the severity of ankle sprain. A brief period of warm is essential. In addition, the athlete should be encouraged to wear proper shoes and use braces or even taps to further protect the ankle. Finally, patients with ankle sprain should enter physical therapy before returning to their sporting activity.
