The complications that can arise from malabsorption and maldigestion are as numerous as the points at which these processes can be interrupted, delayed, or absent. When a malabsorption syndrome is severe enough, poorly controlled, or of long enough duration, complications can include (not a comprehensive list):

- Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., chronic diarrhea, bloating, flatulence)

- Malnutrition

- Weight loss/poor weight gain

- Vitamin, mineral, trace element deficiencies (e.g., vitamin D, B12, iron, folate)

- Osteomalacia/rickets disease, coagulopathy, visual impairment, skin changes

- Hematologic disorders

- Anemia
- Coagulopathy

- Visual impairment

- Dermatologic manifestations

- Musculoskeletal dysfunction:

- Growth delay (in children)
- Skeletal deformities (e.g., rickets)
- Bone mineral density abnormalities (e.g., osteoporosis)
- Cachexia

- Electrolyte disturbances

- Cardiovascular disease:

- Cardiac arrhythmias

- Neurologic dysfunction:

- Peripheral neuropathy
- Ataxia

- Endocrine dysfunction:

- Parathyroid dysfunction
- Chronic fatigue
