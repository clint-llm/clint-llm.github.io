The plain film is critical for the initial evaluation of any musculoskeletal complaint, especially in a patient with suspected or known amyloidosis. Plain film appearances of musculoskeletal amyloidosis include osseous erosions, osteopenia, well-defined lytic lesions, bone marrow infiltration, and pathologic fracture, as seen in the plain film images for patients 2 and 3. Affected joints may display subchondral cysts and calcification of adjacent soft tissues, highlighted in the plain film images for patients 3 through 5.
