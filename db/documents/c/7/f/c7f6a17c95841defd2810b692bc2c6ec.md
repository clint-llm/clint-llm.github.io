Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the third most common non-skin cancer in the United States after lung cancer in both men and women, with an annual incidence of 42.9 per 100,000 people. It accounts for 8% of cancer-related deaths in the US alone.

Its prevalence and incidence vary worldwide, with Australia and New Zealand having the highest incidence, followed by North America and Europe. Africa and South-Central Asia have the lowest incidence.

Such a pattern only extrapolates that CRC incidence is attributed to dietary factors along with genetic and environmental factors. It also displays a strong correlation with increased age, the maximum rate at the age above 75 years, and the lowest below 40 years. Males are affected more than females. African Americans have the highest incidence, and Asian Pacific Islanders have the lowest.

Screening is the process of looking for cancer in patients that have no symptoms. Several tests are available to screen for colorectal cancer. These tests can be divided into stool-based tests and visual exams. Any abnormal test result should be followed up with a colonoscopy. If cancer of the colon is caught early, the patient usually has a better outcome.
