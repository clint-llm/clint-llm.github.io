Induction of HbF is a heavily regulated process that depends on various gene expressions. Three genetic loci that influence HbF levels include a region in chromosome 2 within the BCL11A gene, an area that is intergenic between HBSIL, MYB genes located on chromosome 6, and also variants that are within the beta-globin locus on chromosome 11.
