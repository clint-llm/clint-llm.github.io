Detection of thiamine deficiency relies on relevant history and physical exam findings and follow-up with laboratory testing for confirmation.**Laboratory Studies**

- Functional enzymatic assay of transketolase activity - transketolase activity is measured before and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate; greater than 25% stimulation response is abnormal.

- Measurement of thiamine or the phosphorylated esters of thiamine in serum or blood using high-performance liquid chromatography

- Urine studies exist but are not a reliable test for the evaluation of total body thiamine.

- Metabolic acidosis can occur with thiamine deficiency due to the accumulation of lactate.

Consider other diagnostic studies based on presentation and comorbid conditions (transthoracic echo or TSH measurements in new heart failure, for example).

**Radiographic Studies**

MR: most common abnormalities seen with WE are symmetric changes in the thalamus, mamillary bodies, periaqueductal area, and tectal plate.
