Blunt force trauma is the primary etiology of aortic transection. Penetrating trauma to the chest may result in aortic injury, though less commonly. In blunt thoracic injury, the rapid deceleration of the torso upon the impact of the encountered object causes shearing stress on the aortic wall. The aorta is fixed to the mediastinum at the ligamentum arteriosum or isthmus. Distal to this, which is just beyond the take-off of the left subclavian artery, the aorta is more mobile. This anatomy creates a focus of shear stress during the deceleration mechanism, resulting in varying degrees of wall disruption. A mild disruption may cause a tear in the intima, while more severe mechanisms may cause a complete transection of the aortic wall.
