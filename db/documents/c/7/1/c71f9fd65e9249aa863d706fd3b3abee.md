Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) allows the characterization of the enamel surface.

The first type is a shallow prism, with a round and uniform shape with sharp outlines, located at the same level of the tooth surface. The second type is a well-defined prism with an open concave center and well-defined peripheral outlines at the same surface level as the type 1 prisms. The third type of prisms are ill-defined, irregular shapes and irregular borders, defined as microporosity. The surface enamel of deciduous teeth has a so-called prismless structure with parallel crystallites and no prism boundaries, based on SEM studies.
