The majority of middle ear surgery involving the TM is classically performed using a postauricular approach; endaural (through the ear canal) and transcanal approaches are also used. Each technique has advantages as well as limitations and factors that are considered when deciding which approach to use, including the size of the TM perforation, the size of the ear canal, and the preference of the surgeon. As in other surgical fields, a trend towards more minimally invasive techniques has made trans-canal or endoscopic ear surgery increasingly popular.

Standard theatre preparations are undertaken regardless of the tympanoplasty technique used. Prophylactic antibiotics are commonly administered (although less so during endoscopic surgery). The patient lies supine on the operating table; a head ring is used to provide stability. If required, the patientâ€™s hair will be shaved in the postauricular region. Local infiltration (lidocaine with adrenaline) is administered, and local hemostasis must be achieved.

**Grafts**

Autologous material for grafting is readily available, biocompatible, and inexpensive; hence there is limited rationale for utilizing artificial alternatives. Autologous grafts are usually made from temporal fascia or tragal/conchal perichondrium; however, studies have also reported using fascia lata, canal skin, and periosteum.

Most surgeons use the temporalis fascia more commonly used in practice than cartilage, and success rates of using this graft in tympanoplasty range between 93% to 97%. However, in situations calling for increased stability, such as multiply-recurrent perforations or high-risk patients, cartilage and perichondrium can be harvested by making an incision through the medial side of the tragal skin, perichondrium, and cartilage.

**Microscopic Approach**

When using a microscope, the postauricular and trans-canal approaches are frequently used for tympanoplasty. The Lempert endaural approach is far less commonly used in modern tympanoplasty but remains a viable option. The procedure starts with the surgeon making a semicircular incision roughly 1cm posterior to the auricle skin fold; the ear is folded anteriorly. This incision is carried down through the musculoperiosteum creating a musculoperiosteal flap, which is elevated towards the membranous ear canal, thereby entering the bony ear canal. The skin along the posterior aspect of the bony canal is elevated until the surgeon reaches the tympanomeatal flap incisions. The tympanomeatal flap can then be raised, and the middle ear can be entered.

At this stage, if required, the ossicular chain can be repaired by performing an ossiculoplasty.

**Endoscopic Approach**

Endoscopic repair of TM perforations is less invasive than traditional postauricular and endaural approaches. It can provide a wider view of the middle ear anatomy without making external incisions, reducing operative and recovery time.

Endoscopic tympanoplasty is performed using a transcanal approach. As before, the edges of the perforation are de-epithelized as necessary. An incision is made in the ear canal (endaural, lateral circumferential, or swing door), allowing the tympanomeatal flap and annulus to be elevated, creating access to the middle ear. The malleus is peeled off the TM, and at this stage, the ossicular chain is repaired (ossiculoplasty) if required. The prepared graft is placed medially to the TM remnant and lateral to the malleus. Gel foam sponges are inserted into the middle and outer ear canals.
