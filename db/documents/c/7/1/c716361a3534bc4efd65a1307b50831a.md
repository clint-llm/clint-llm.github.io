The prognosis is variable and depends on the type of cardiac amyloidosis. The average survival time in untreated patients is as follows: AL (primary) 9 to 24 months, ATTR familial 7 to 10 years, senile amyloidosis 5 to 7 years, AA (secondary) amyloidosis more than ten years.

Overall, ATTR amyloidosis has a better prognosis than AL amyloidosis. ATTR amyloidosis progresses slowly and has a late presentation (average decade of presentation of 7). The 4-year survival of AL amyloidosis in patients treated with stem-cell transplantation is more than 90%. Patients with cardiac involvement undergoing stem cell transplants have a median survival of more than 10-year. The median survival in AL amyloidosis is 10-years, except for those with advanced-stage diseases, who carry a 50% one-year survival.

Mutant ATTR has an overall four-year survival of 16%. The survival of mutant ATTR depends on the type of mutation. The Val30Met is the most common mutation in mutant ATTR with an overall prognosis of 79%, whereas the Val122Ile mutation carries a four-year prognosis of 40%.
