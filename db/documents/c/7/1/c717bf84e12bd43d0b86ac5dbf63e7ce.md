Six extrinsic eye muscles that move each eye: (1) superior rectus, (2) inferior rectus, (3) lateral rectus, (4) medial rectus, (5) superior oblique, and (6) inferior oblique. Lateral rectus is innervated by trochlear and superior oblique is innervated by abducens nerve; The oculomotor nerve innervates the remaining four muscles. The motor units in these muscles tend to be small with neurons serving only two or three muscle fibersÂ at times. Such small motor units allow precise and rapid eye movement. Portions of the brainstem and cerebellum coordinate eye movements.
