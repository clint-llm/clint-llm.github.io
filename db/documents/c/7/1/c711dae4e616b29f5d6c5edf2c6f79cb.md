Osteoma cutis can be either primary or secondary. Osteoma cutis is classified as primary when there is no preexisting lesion. Primary osteoma cutis can occur in isolation or in association with metabolic syndrome.

Osteoma cutis is secondary when it is associated with inflammatory processes, scars, dysembryoplasia, or neoplasia.

Some authors have found a correlation between osteoma cutis and chronic acne.

Recently, some authors have demonstrated a relationship of osteoma cutis to GNAS1 gene mutations, which is a key regulatory gene in progressive osseous heteroplasia and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
