The vitality of the organs, vessels, and nerves located within the thoracic cavity predispose it to be a location of high clinical significance.

- The sternum is a commonly used site for bone marrow aspiration because it possesses hematopoietic marrow throughout life. However, the surgeon needs to exercise great care because if the sternal puncture is improperly executed, the needle can pierce the structures related to the posterior surface of the manubrium such as the left brachiocephalic vein in the upper part and aortic arch in the lower part.

- Thoracentesis is a diagnostic procedure that is performed by the surgeon to remove excess fluid from the thoracic cavity for both diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. This procedure can be performed in two positions depending on the comfort of the patient. If the patient is lying supine, the needle placement is typically in the midaxillary line between the 6th- 8th ribs, and if the patient is in an upright or seated position, then the needle is placed between the 9th- 10th rib posteriorly in the midscapular line.

- Pericardiocentesis is also a necessary procedure as it can be life-saving in a patient with cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis may be guided using surface landmarks (“blindly”) in emergencies or electrocardiogram/echocardiography may be used to advance the needle to avoid complications. The needle is inserted 1-2cm lateral to the apex beat within the fifth, sixth or seventh intercostal space to remove excess fluid from the pericardial sac. The needle is advanced over the superior border of the rib to avoid intercostal nerves and vessels. If this performed improperly, the needle can puncture left ventricle or causes pneumothorax.

- In patients with the thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), there is compression of the neurovascular structures in the thoracic outlet, resulting in pain, numbness, weakness, muscle wasting, fatigue in the upper limbs as well as ischemia. The brachial plexuses of nerves (C5, C6, C7, C8, and T1) and subclavian vessels (artery and vein) are closely related to the first rib as well as the clavicle as they enter the upper limb. These structures may undergo compression between the scalene muscles and the first rib. Pancoast tumors, as well as the presence of a rudimentary cervical rib, are among the potential causes of TOS.
