Like most general anesthetic agents, the mechanism of action for propofol is poorly understood but thought to be related to the effects on GABA-mediated chloride channels in the brain. Propofol may work by decreasing the dissociation of GABA from GABA receptors in the brain and potentiating the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter. This, in turn, keeps the channel activated for a longer duration resulting in an increase in chloride conductance across the neuron, causing a hyper-polarization of the cell membrane, making it harder for a successful action potential to fire.
