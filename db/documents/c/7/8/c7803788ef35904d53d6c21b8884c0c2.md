The omentum is made up of cells that are mesothelial in origin. The omentum exhibits angiogenic, fibrotic, stem cells, and immune activities responsible for promoting vascularization, accelerated healing, and limiting infection in the abdominal cavity. These activities can also lead to pathological changes like omental tumor formation. This article describes the epidemiology, presentation, histopathology, investigations, and treatment of the primary omental tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of omentum tumors and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and improving care for patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of primary omental tumors.
- Describe the evaluation of primary omental tumors.
- Explain the management options available for primary omental tumors.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of primary omental tumors and improve outcomes.
