The evaluation of well-appearing patients with suspected serum sickness can be limited to urinalysis to determine the presence of renal involvement, which would require close follow-up. However, if the patient is ill-appearing or if there is any degree of diagnostic uncertainty based on the history or physical exam, further testing should be performed. The clinician should consider the following laboratory tests to evaluate for other etiologies and multi-organ system involvement: complete blood count with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total hemolytic complement (CH50), C3, C4, basic metabolic panel, liver transaminases, antinuclear antibody, and rheumatoid factor.

Laboratory results in serum sickness may be widely variable. The complete blood count can show leukopenia or mild leukocytosis. Serum creatinine may be elevated, but typically returns to baseline within days-weeks of discontinuing the offending agent. Inflammatory markers will be elevated in serum sickness. Complement levels including CH50, C3, and C4, will be decreased, reflecting activation and consumption of complement.

Recall that patients with serum sickness-like reaction will generally not manifest with additional multi-organ system symptoms as outlined above. Also, the labÂ results in a serum sickness-like reaction will not show hypocomplementemia or renal dysfunction.
