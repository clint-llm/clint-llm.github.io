Neuraxial anesthesia or analgesia is the injection of the local anesthetic in the areas surrounding nerve roots from the central nervous system (CNS). Spinal anesthesia involves the injection of the local anesthetic in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flowing in the subarachnoid space while epidural anesthesia or analgesia the local anesthetic (LA) is infiltrated in the fat tissue that surrounds the spinal nerve roots in the epidural space using a catheter inserted in the space through an epidural needle.

As a result, blockage of motor, sensory, or sympathetic impulse can occur in different combinations and degrees depending on variables such as dose, concentration, or volume of the LA. Epidural anesthesia can be performed at any level of the vertebral column, and the choice of placement depends on the desired anesthetic level. In contrast, spinal anesthesia is usually performed below L2 to avoid injury of the spinal cord.
