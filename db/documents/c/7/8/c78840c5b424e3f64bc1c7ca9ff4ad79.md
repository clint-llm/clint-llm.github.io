Labyrinthine fistulas can be a consequence of a congenital otologic disorder, acquired by physical injury or from an iatrogenic cause. The most common causes are head injuriesÂ from trauma, labor, coughing, sneezing, pathologies that lead to increased intracranial pressure, blast injuries, diving, and flying barotrauma. Unique causes that have been reported included lightning strikes, airbag trauma, and acoustic trauma from the sirens of fire engines and other loud modalities.

Cholesteatomas caused by chronic otitis media are another cause of perilymphatic fistulas. The reported incidence of cholesteatoma-induced perilymphatic fistula varies from 4% to 15%.
