Acute angle-closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency that results from a rapid increase in intraocular pressure due to outflow obstruction of aqueous humor. Several factors lead to the obstruction in acute angle-closure glaucoma, but the major predisposing factor is the structural anatomy of the anterior chamber, leading to a shallower angle between the iris and the cornea. Acute angle-closure glaucoma presents as a sudden onset of severe unilateral eye pain or a headache associated with blurred vision, rainbow-colored halos around bright lights, nausea, and vomiting. The physical exam will reveal a fixed midpoint pupil and a hazy or cloudy cornea with marked conjunctival injection. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of acute angle-closure glaucoma.
- Summarize how a patient with acute angle-closure glaucoma is likely to present.
- Identify the critical immediate steps to take when managing a patient with acute angle-closure glaucoma.
- Outline the role of a collaborative interprofessional team in providing well-coordinated care to patients presenting with acute angle-closure glaucoma.
