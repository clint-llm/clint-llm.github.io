An interprofessional team approach, comprised of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, is most appropriate when administering hypertonic fluids â€” extra care is necessary to monitor circulatory and renal function as well as serum electrolyte concentrations. Fluid ins and outs must be carefully monitored by nursing staff, particularly with mannitol, reporting abnormalities right away. Hypertonic fluids should be stopped if significant abnormalities in electrolytes or fluid volumes develop. It is noteworthy that there is a lack of research regarding hypertonic fluids. More work remains to determine the value of hypertonic fluids not only in the management of critically ill patients but in the pre-hospital setting for cases of hypovolemia and shock.

In summary, administration of hypertonic saline and/or mannitol requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
