Dermatomyositis is a rare autoimmune inflammatory myositis of unknown etiology affecting both children and adults. It involves striated muscles and skin. The juvenile formÂ is associated with multisystemic vasculitis and a high frequency of calcinosis, Gottron papules, symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, and a heliotrope rash. However, unlike the adult form, it does not have an increased risk of malignancy.
