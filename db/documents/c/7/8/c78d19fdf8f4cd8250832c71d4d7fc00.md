Weakness of the levator labii superioris muscle is most often unilateral, but can also present bilaterally, and severity ranges from mild paresis to full paralysis. Most commonly, it results from damage to the main trunk of the facial nerve or the zygomatic/buccal branch of the facial nerve due to trauma or inflammation, such as Bell's palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, or Lyme disease. Other causes of facial paralysis include multiple sclerosis, poliomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, among many others. Iatrogenic damage to the facial nerve can also lead to weakness of the levator labii superioris muscle.

As an interesting side note, levator labii superioris muscle transposition has been described as a treatment for chronic oral maxillary sinus fistulas in horses.
