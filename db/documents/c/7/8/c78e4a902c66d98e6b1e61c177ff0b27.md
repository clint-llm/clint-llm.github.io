To sum up, primary congenital glaucoma is a vision-threatening ocular pathology in the pediatric age group. Children are highly vulnerable due to lack of communication, difficulty performing an examination, compliance to treatment, and regular follow-up. Any pediatric patient presenting to the outpatient department with lacrimation, photophobia, blepharospasm, buphthalmos, and corneal clouding should undergo a detailed clinical evaluation to diagnose the condition.

While managing these children, all the other differentials must be carefully ruled out for targeted treatment and solving the eye with good visual outcomes. The parents should be counseled regarding the importance of genetic and family screening in these cases. Angle and filtration surgery are the treatment of choice for good anatomical and visual outcomes.
