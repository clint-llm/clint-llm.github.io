Livedoid vasculopathy is a rare vasculopathy that is typically characterized by bilateral lower limb lesions. Increased thrombotic activity and decreased fibrinolytic activity along with endothelial damage are believed to be the cause of thrombus formation in the capillary vasculature. It is 3 times more common in females than in males, especially in patients between the ages of 15 to 50 years. This activity Illustrates and describes the evaluation and treatment of livedoid vasculopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of livedoid vasculopathy.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of livedoid vasculopathy.
- List the treatment and management options available for livedoid vasculopathy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of livedoid vasculopathy and improve outcomes.
