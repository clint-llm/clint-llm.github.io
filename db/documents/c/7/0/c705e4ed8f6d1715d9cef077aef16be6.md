The clinical presentation of tuberculous meningitis is similar to other forms of chronic meningitis, making the diagnosis difficult and the differential broad. The clinical presentation is associated with fever, headache, altered sensorium, and focal neurologic deficits. Typical neurologic deficits include facial palsy.

Three distinct phases of clinical presentation are usually found:

- The early prodromal phase is characterized by the insidious onset of low-grade fever, malaise, headache, and personality change. It usually lasts for one to three weeks.

- It is followed by the meningitic phase, characterized by prominent neurologic features, such as protracted headache, vomiting, meningismus, lethargy, confusion, and varying presentation of cranial nerve and long-tract signs.

- Confusion gives way to stupor, seizures, coma, and often hemiparesis in the paralytic phase. Death frequently ensues within five to eight weeks of the onset of untreated illness.

Atypical manifestationsÂ include rapidly progressive meningitic syndrome suggesting pyogenic meningitis, slowly progressive dementia over months, personality change, social withdrawal, memory deficits, and loss of libido. Patients may sometimes also present with an encephalitic course characterized by convulsions, stupor, and coma without overt signs of meningitis.
