Early diagnosis of HHT is based on clinical findings. Genetic testing helps confirm the diagnosis but is not required for an index case unless 1) they are children who have not developed all the clinical features or 2) to test at-risk family members and identify a family-specific mutation. Screening and treatment of visceral AVMs depend on the potential for high-risk complications. For instance, proactive screening and treatment of asymptomatic pulmonary AVMs are encouraged compared to asymptomatic hepatic or cerebral AVMs.
