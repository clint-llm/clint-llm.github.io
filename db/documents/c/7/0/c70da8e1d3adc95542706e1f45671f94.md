The obturator foramen is an opening in the pelvis created by the ischium and pubis bones. The foramen itself is covered by a quadrella musculoaponeurotic membrane â€“ the obturator membrane. The neurovascular bundle (obturator artery, vein, and nerve) pierces this membrane anterosuperiorly, then passes through the obturator canal. The obturator canal starts as the obturator groove, becoming the obturator canal by a ligamentous band attaching to the posterior and anterior obturator tubercle. This canal connects the pelvis to the medial compartment of the thigh. The obturator canal is about 0.2 to 0.5 cm wide, and 2to 3cm long.

The obturator membrane is covered on either side by the obturator muscles. As such, any hernia that forms will pass through obturator internus, the obturator membrane, and obturator externus in that order. The natural location for the hernial sac to lie after its passage through these structures is deep and inferior to the pectineus muscle, superficial to obturator externus. However, the hernia could protrude through the obturator externus muscle, taking with it the posterior obturator nerve. In this position, the hernial sac lies posterior to the adductor brevis. Very rarely, the hernial sac can be found between the obturator internus and externus muscles.

The obturator foramen has a different shape according to the sex of the individual. Women tend to have triangular, wider foramina, while men tend to have more oval ones.
