A funnel-shaped pelvic diaphragm forms the pelvic floor. This diaphragm is consists of the coccygeus and levator ani muscles. This diaphragm divides the pelvic cavity from the perineum. The coccygeus muscle comes from the inferior sacrum and coccyx and attaches to the sacrospinous ligament.

The levator ani is a muscular sheet that attaches to the pubic bones anteriorly and ischial spines posteriorly. The levator ani consists of three muscles that are not distinct but are designated according to attachments. These muscles are the puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus. The levator ani provides support to the abdominopelvic viscera. It also functions to assist in maintaining urinary and fecal continence.

The abdominal wall is made up of five paired muscles. These include the three flat muscles, namely external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis. The other two muscles, the rectus abdominis, and pyramidalis, are vertically oriented and are housed within the rectus sheath. In males, an additional paired muscles called the cremaster muscles from the lower abdomen enter into the scrotum and are responsible for cremasteric reflex on stroking the medial side of the thigh.
