Prognosis will vary depending on intensity, duration, and frequency of exposure to nitrogen dioxides. However, most patients can expect to make a full recovery after an initial acute nitrogen dioxide exposure, provided adequate supportive care is available. Extensive critical care support with mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be required to bridge the patient through acute toxicity and allow time for healing and recovery.
