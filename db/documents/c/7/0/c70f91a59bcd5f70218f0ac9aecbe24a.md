Sciatica has some unique epidemiologic characteristics:

- There appears to be no gender predominance

- Peak incidence occurs in patients in their fourth decade

- Lifetime incidence reported between 10% to 40%

- An annual incidence of 1 to 5%

- No association with body height has been established except in the age 50 to 60 group.

- It rarely occurs before age 20 unless secondary to trauma

- Some studies do suggest a genetic predisposition.

- Physical activity increases incidence in those with prior sciatic symptoms and decreases in those with no prior symptoms.

- Occupational predisposition has been shown in machine operators, truck drivers, and jobs where workers are subject to physically awkward positions.
