As with most drug and medication-related toxicities, evaluation often includes a qualitative assessment of the amount of drug taken with a plasma or urine screening test. Plasma barbiturate concentration and ingested dose have been implicated as the most important correlates of toxicity. Immunoassays (EIA) can provide a cost-effective and sensitive method to detect barbiturates and other substances in the body. Another method often used is gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which can further identify and confirm the presence ofÂ a particular barbiturate.
