A goniometer is a device that measures an angle or permits the rotation of an object to a definite position. In orthopedics, the former description applies more. The art and science of measuring the joint ranges in each plane of the joint are called goniometry. The term ‘goniometry’ has its origin from two Greek words, gonia, which means angle, and metron, which means to measure. The first known use of a primitive version of the modern-day goniometer was by a Dutch physician and mathematician named Gemma Frisius, who used it to calculate and record the position of celestial bodies with respect to Earth.
