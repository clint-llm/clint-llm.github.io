**Patent foramen ovale**(PFO) is a left to right shunt that occurs between the septum primum and septum secundum.  The magnitude of the right to left shunt may be associated with an increased risk of cryptogenic stroke.

**Atrial septal defects**(ASD) are congenital defects that vary in size and location, with clinical manifestations that range from atrial tachyarrhythmias to dyspnea. ASDs lead to a left to right shunt as well as a fixed split S2 on cardiac exam.  A transient reversal of blood flow can reverse the shunt. ASDs are associated with a paradoxical embolism in up to 14% of patients

**Ventricular septal defects**commonly result in left to right shunts, however certain conditions that increase right atrial pressure like Eisenmenger syndrome can reverse the shunt, allowing for paradoxical embolism.

**Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations**are usually hereditary and are a pathological connection between the pulmonary arteries to the pulmonary veins returning to the left atrium. This leads to a permanent right to left shunt. Patients with a history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia are at increased risk for PAVM and subsequent paradoxical embolism
