Patients with open fractures require definitive operative intervention after emergency stabilization and treatment. In the case that there are other concomitant traumatic injuries, the patients will need to be admitted to a trauma center by a trauma service equipped to manage their condition. Depending on the institutional practice and mechanism of injury, patients with isolated open fractures may be admitted by orthopedic services.
