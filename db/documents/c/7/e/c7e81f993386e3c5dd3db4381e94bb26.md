A double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is rarely an isolated pathology as it is usually associated with other cardiac congenital anomalies such as coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, or even a bicuspid aortic valve suggesting that a defect in the endocardial cushion may be the underlying etiology.

Based on echocardiographic features, there are three morphological types of congenital DOMV described in the literature; eccentric type, central type, or duplicate mitral valve type.
