Complications can include both gastrointestinal problems as well as hepatic and renal damage.

Gastrointestinal blood loss following ibuprofen intake is dose-related. The more serious gastrointestinal effects are not common and include occult blood loss, GI hemorrhage, ulcer, and pancreatitis. While some patients experience increases in liver enzymes, hepatic side effects, including cholestasis, jaundice, hepatitis, and hepatic failure, are rare. Renal complications include urinary retention/insufficiency, acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and acute tubular necrosis. These are more likely in patients with impaired renal function.

Other very rare complications include cardiovascular effects (e.g., elevated blood pressure), nervous system complications (dizziness, drowsiness), and hematological issues such as platelet dysfunction.
