An interprofessional team that provides an integrated approach in identifying that the patient is in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and whether the patient is hemodynamically stable or not is integral towards managing patients with this arrhythmia. Upon establishing that the patient is hemodynamically stable, management decisions are possible through prompt communication between the physician, pharmacist, and nursing staff, which can significantly enhance healthcare team outcomes in patients with AVNRT. The clinician can consult with a board-certified cardiology pharmacist in selecting the most appropriate agent, verifying dosing parameters, and checking for interactions. Nursing will have a significant role as they will administer the drug chosen, and need to be aware of potential adverse event signs as well as assessing for therapeutic effectiveness. Once treated, if available, patient education is necessary, using resources familiar to the patient, including online resources and pamphlets. This interprofessional approach optimizes patient outcomes through open communication and collaborative effort.
