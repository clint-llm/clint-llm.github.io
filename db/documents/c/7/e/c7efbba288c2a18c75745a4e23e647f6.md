This activity describes the indications, actions and, contraindications for these drugs as a valuable agent in the prophylaxis and acute management of migraine and cluster headaches. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, monitoring, adverse events, relevant interactions, and other key elements in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with migraines.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the role of RAMP1 in the formation of the CGRP receptor.

- Outline the currently FDA approved drugs acting on CGRP or its receptor.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with CGRP receptor antagonists.
- Review the importance of proper monitoring and coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by migraine.
