Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. It presents as a pulmonary infection after the inhalation of spores, and it may be either asymptomatic or have severe life-threatening complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of blastomycosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify Blastomyces dermatitidis as the causal agent in the etiology of blastomycosis.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of blastomycosis.
- Review the most common adverse effects of amphotericin in the treatment of patients with blastomycosis.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by blastomycosis.
