Given the lack of literature and guidelines on how to manage kinkajou bites and subsequent development of cellulitis, the following is a proposed protocol based on the reported case and current animal bite treatment and management guidelines.

- Wound management as per current wound-care guidelines for animal bites including irrigation, exploration, and debridement of the wounds

- Proper imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, CT, or MRI) are necessary imaging modalities for the assessment of deeper structure involvement.

- AssessÂ for any need for surgical exploration at the wound site.

- Based on the type of wound, if the risk of infection is high at the kinkajou bite site patient should be admitted to the hospital.

- Obtain wound and blood cultures before the start of any antibiotics.

- The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative infections.

- Administer tetanus toxoid, DTaP, or Td as indicated.

- Kinkajou bite patients should get rabies vaccine series, which consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin at patient presentation and four doses of the rabies vaccine over 14 days.
