The posterior tibial artery descends around the medial malleolus adjacent to the posterior tibial nerve and continues to track with the medial plantar nerve branch on the medial side of the foot. The artery runs just posterior to the flexor digitorum longus tendon in the lower leg near the ankle. Clinically, a common place to assess blood flow to the foot is through palpation of the posterior tibial artery posterior to the medial malleolus. Dividing into superficial and deep, the lymphatics of the lower extremity parallel the venous distribution. The inguinal lymph nodes receive drainage from the great saphenous vein while the popliteal nodes receive lymphatic drainage from the lesser saphenous vein.
