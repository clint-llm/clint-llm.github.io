Anatomical features of the internal carotid artery and its origin from the carotid bifurcation are of particular surgical importance. Characteristics such as the height of the carotid bifurcation, morphometric values of the internal carotid artery, aberrant or torturous courses, and detailed anatomy of the carotid sinus require consideration.

These characteristics can be analyzed pre-operatively using diagnostic modalities such as computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasound. Deciding upon which modality to use can depend upon applicability to a specific disease, availability, and patient characteristics such as metal implants, renal function, and allergy to contrast. However, the gold standard modality is currently the three-dimensional CTA.

The carotid bifurcation is an anatomically and surgically important landmark as it involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. The height of the carotid bifurcation is highly variable, and extreme variations are important in determining appropriate surgical techniques such as the decision for carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting. Additionally, the geometry of the carotid bifurcation is an important factor in blood hemodynamics and wall shear stress, which can commence or promote atherogenesis.
