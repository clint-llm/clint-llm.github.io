Pellagra is a condition that requires differentiation from generalized dermatitides, such as skin lesions due to sun exposure. Also, niacin deficiency should be distinguished from malnourishment, such as anorexia nervosa and kwashiorkor, or severe protein malnutrition typically characterized by an enlarged liver and edema seen during a famine.

The following is the list of differentials one must consider when dealing with a patient with features indicative of niacin deficiency:

- Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

- Crohn disease

- Discoid lupus erythematosus

- Drug eruptions

- Drug-induced lupus erythematosus

- Drug-induced photosensitivity

- Drug-induced pemphigus

- Porphyria cutanea tarda

- Ulcerative colitis
