The mainstay of prevention and treatment of HAND spectrum disorders is adherence to ART. Appropriate treatment of HIV infection shows improvement in cognitive function in patients diagnosed with severe deficits. The incidence of HAD has also decreased over time with the widespread use of ART in observational studies. ART should be initiated for any untreated patient with HIV infection who is beginning to experience cognitive decline. The selection of a specific ART regimen should follow standard protocols based on viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) load, genotype, drug interactions and presence of comorbidities.

The effectiveness of ART to prevent the milder forms MND and ANI is less clear as these conditions are subtle and likely underdiagnosed. It is unclear if specific ART regimens are more effective at preventing progression of cognitive decline. The antiretroviral efavirenz should be avoided in patients undergoing evaluation for HAD due to its adverse effect profile that may interfere with neuropsychological testing. In patients on appropriate therapy with low viral counts and high CD4 levels, progressive neurocognitive deficits are more likely to be due to another etiology. Appropriate evaluation should be done to rule out these conditions.

Psychiatric comorbidities may be present and treatment should be initiated following a psychiatric evaluation.
