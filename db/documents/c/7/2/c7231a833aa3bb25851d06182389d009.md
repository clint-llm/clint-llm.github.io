Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for benign salivary tumors. Enucleation is not advised due to the higher rates of local recurrence.

Lesions of the superficial lobe of the parotid gland can be excised with a superficial parotidectomy. Total parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation is performed for large superficial tumors, deep parotid tumors, or cases of metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma.

The disadvantages of superficial parotidectomy include excessive resection of parotid tissue leading to loss of parotid function, disruption of Stensonâ€™s duct, facial contour defects, and facial nerve paralysis. Gland-preserving surgery has been recommended for benign tumors with a reduction in surgical complications and improvement in patient quality of life.

Extracapsular dissection (ECD) is the most conservative approach and involves removing the tumor with only the immediate pseudocapsule without identifying nor dissecting the facial nerve branches. George et al showed that complications such as facial nerve damage, sialocele, and Frey syndrome were rare during ECD. In studies comparing ECD with superficial parotidectomy for benign tumors, superficial parotidectomy showed a higher rate of facial nerve complications.

Extirpation of the entire submandibular gland is the treatment of choice for benign submandibular tumors.

For benign minor salivary gland tumors of the palate, a wide local excision within the palatal mucosa is recommended with 5 to 10 mm margins and preservation of the pseudocapsule. The exposed palatine bone is left to heal by secondary intention or resected and reconstructed with soft tissue flap.
