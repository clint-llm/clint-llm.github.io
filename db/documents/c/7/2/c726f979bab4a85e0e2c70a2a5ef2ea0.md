A minimally invasive surgical approach to mitral valve repair is the preferred option for mitral valve surgery in surgically acceptable candidates and has provided essential treatment options in the higher risk surgical patients. Available data suggest that procedural and long-term outcomes and the safety of the minimally invasive approach are comparable to conventional mitral valve surgery. In patients requiring surgery for primary MR, a minimally invasive approach should always be considered.

The percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair procedure may be considered in patients with symptomatic severe primary MR who fulfill the echocardiographic criteria of eligibility and are judged inoperable or at high surgical risk by the Heart Team. For secondary MR, surgical repair is not typically recommended. As transcatheter aortic valve replacement becomes more popular, devices for transcatheter mitral valve replacement are being developed as future therapeutic options. Future research should study the best approach for minimally invasive surgery and provide comparative data with transcatheter and open surgical options, with regards to safety and efficacy for both primary and secondary MR.
