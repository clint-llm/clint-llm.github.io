The diagnosis of heart failure is clinical. However, several tests are available for further evaluation:

- Laboratory tests: brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NT-proBNP may be the most helpful as it can differentiate acute heart failure from other causes of shortness of breath. However, this test lacks specificity, and a high level of this hormone is not diagnostic of acute heart failure.

- Electrocardiography can show nonspecific findings, like ischemic changes, left ventricular hypertrophy, or arrhythmias.

- Echocardiography can help distinguish HFrEF from HFpEF by determining the ejection fraction, and diastolic left ventricular function can evaluate associated regional wall motion abnormalities that may be suggestive of an ischemic component, as well as valvular and pericardial pathologies.

- Coronary angiography is indicated in patients with anginal symptoms and may also be indicated in patients with worsening heart failure symptoms.
