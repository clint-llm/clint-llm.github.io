The approach for evaluation of a patient presenting with lesions suspicious of livedoid vasculopathy should focus upon confirming the diagnosis, ruling out close differentials, and a workup for associated conditions.

A skin biopsy, preferably a 3-4 mm punch biopsy from the margin of the ulcer or the surrounding livedo, is a must for confirming the diagnosis.

Ankle-brachial pressure index and lower limb venous doppler should be done to rule out chronic venous insufficiency.

Laboratory investigations should focus on ruling out the following:

- Hypercoagulable states (e.g., factor 5 Leiden mutation, platelet plug disorders, hyperhomocysteinemia, etc.)

- Fibrinolytic disorders. (e.g., protein C and protein S deficiency)

- Collagen vascular diseases. (e.g., SLE, scleroderma, APLA)

- Paraprotenemia
