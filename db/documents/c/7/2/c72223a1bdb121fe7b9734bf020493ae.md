During embryological development of the gut, the duodenum is manifested in close association with other intestinal organogenesis processes. Craniocaudal and lateral folding cause the opening of the gut tube to the yolk sac to draw closed forming a pocket toward the superior end of the embryo, which will ultimately become the foregut. The duodenum arises from the caudal-most part of the foregut. However, it is hypothesized that the duodenum does not undergo any rotation but instead takes on its C-shape appearance due to the extension of the stomach toward the left and the relative fixation by the growing liver and pancreas. It is due to this process that the inferior portion of the duodenum becomes situated underneath the superior mesenteric artery. At the end of development, the duodenum loop lies to the right of the abdominal wall, and its peritoneal layers become incorporated into the peritoneal layer that lines the abdominal cavity. This process is the reason whyÂ the duodenum is sometimes described as being secondarily retroperitoneal.
