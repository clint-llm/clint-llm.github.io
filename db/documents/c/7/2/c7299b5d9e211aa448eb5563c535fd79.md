Sweet syndrome is one of the great mimickers in dermatology. The key to diagnosing this syndrome is to have a high index of suspicion. Prompt referral to a dermatologist for tender erythematous papulonodular lesions with fever, which show an inadequate therapeutic response to analgesics and antibiotics, is necessary. More importantly, primary clinicians should obtain routine investigations such as a complete blood count, ESR, and CRP in suspected cases. Sweet syndrome heralds underlying infectious, immunological, or malignant disease hence, prompt diagnosis and a thorough evaluation by an interprofessional team are necessary for ruling out underlying systemic illnesses.
