The risk factors for subclavian artery thrombosis are the same as thrombosis in any other body site. The main risk factors are obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and metabolic syndrome. Like other artery thromboses, subclavian artery thrombosis also involves an area subjected to increased shear stress leading to endothelial injury and subsequent platelet aggregation and release of platelet-derived growth factor. This sequence triggers the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial intima and forms the locus of the atherosclerotic plaque.
