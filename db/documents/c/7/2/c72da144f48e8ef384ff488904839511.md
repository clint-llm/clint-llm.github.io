EED is rare, with descriptions of only several hundred cases in the literature. The disease can develop at any age but is more common in the fourth and sixth decades. An earlier onset occurs more often in the setting of HIV infection. The male-to-female ratio is approximately equal, and no racial predilection has been observed.
