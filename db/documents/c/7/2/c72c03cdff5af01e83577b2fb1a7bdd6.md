Enhancing healthcare outcomes for patients who undergo submandibular gland excision is multifaceted and involves all healthcare team members. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals must consider implications on healthcare outcomes that may come into effect when treating patients with infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disorders of the submandibular gland because the complications of submandibular disease or associated diseases or syndromes are many and may affect patient outcomes if not addressed appropriately.
