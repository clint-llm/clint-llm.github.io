Caustic ingestions can cause functional and histological damage to any surface in which they come in contact.Â  Any alkaline agent with a pH greater than 7.0 is considered caustic. Some household cleaning compounds contain strong alkalis. Alkali substances can cause liquefactive necrosis and can be especially corrosive at high pH values as the necrosis continues until the alkali becomes neutralized.

There are many products, both household and industrial, that contain chemicals with caustic potential. Bleach is the most common household alkali, which has a pH of 11 and is 3% to 6% sodium hypochlorite solution. Household caustics are usually less concentrated; therefore, they are usually benign. On the other hand, industrial strength bleach has a greater concentration of sodium hypochlorite, thus may cause more extensive damage, including gastric and esophageal necrosis.
