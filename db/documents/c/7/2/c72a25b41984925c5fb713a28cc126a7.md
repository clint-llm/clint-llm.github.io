Myogenic or neurogenic problems with the levator palpebrae superioris may occur, resulting in ptosis (drooping of the eyelid).

Myogenic ptosis may occur due to a failure of differentiation between the levator palpebrae superioris from the superior rectus muscle. During surgical correction, a thickened fibrous tissue is often identified instead of two differentiated muscles.

Neurogenic ptosis due to inadequate levator palpebrae superioris innervation may occur from an oculomotor (cranial nerve III) nerve palsy, trauma, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

Congenital ptosis may occur with dystrophy of the muscular component of the levator muscle, which shows fatty infiltration with poor levator function.
