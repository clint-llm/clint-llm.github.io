The calf (Latin: sura) refers to the posterior portion of the lower leg. The two largest muscles in this region include the gastrocnemius and the soleus. The gastrocnemius is the most superficial of the muscles and has two heads, medial and lateral. The two heads of the gastrocnemius converge and form a confluent muscle belly. The lateral head originates from the lateral surface of the lateral femoral condyle and the medial head from the posterior, non-articular aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The muscle belly of the gastrocnemius joins the soleus muscle distally to form the calcaneal tendon (i.e. the achilles tendon), which inserts onto the posterior calcaneus.

The calf muscle plantarflexes the ankle joint and is innervated by the tibial nerve. The soleus is a large, flat muscle located deep to the gastrocnemius. The plantaris is a relatively small muscle with an appreciably long tendonous portion.  The tendinous portion can easily be mistaken for a nerve.  The plantaris muscle arises from the lateral supracondylar line of the femur and is completely absent in up to 10% of the population. The muscle descends medially, eventually forming into a tendon that runs down the leg, between the gastrocnemius and soleus. This tendon blends with the calcaneal tendon.
