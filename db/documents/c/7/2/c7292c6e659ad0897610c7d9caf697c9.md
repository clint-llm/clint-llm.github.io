Previous anaphylaxis with prazosin is an absolute contraindication. Otherwise, there are no absolute contraindications of this medication, and there are no black box warnings. As with all medications, the clinician should avoid prescribing prazosin if there is a hypersensitivity or prior adverse effect with other medications in this class (including terazosin, tamsulosin, doxazosin). Caution should be used in patients with hypotension due to the potential adverse effect of orthostatic hypotension, especially considering the first-dose phenomenon associated with the initiation of therapy with prazosin. Caution is also advisable in the setting of cataracts as antagonism of the alpha-1 receptors on the iris dilator muscle can contribute to floppy iris syndrome.

This medication is a Category C medication in pregnancy, suggesting insufficient data to support its use in humans. Other antihypertensive drugs with better safety profiles should be used first in pregnancy.
