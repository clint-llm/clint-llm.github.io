During the fifth week of development, the lower limb bud appears. It originates laterally from the L2 through S2 spinal segments and contains all primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. The musculature of the rectus femoris derives from the myotomic portions of somites (part of the mesoderm), while the skeletal elements supporting the lower limb come from the lateral plate somatic mesoderm. During embryogenesis, the lower limb rotates 90 degrees medially about the longitudinal axis, bringing the knee to the anterior aspect of the fetus.
