There are no absolute contraindications to an oophorectomy; however, since the ovaries provide beneficial hormones and fertility to a patient, oophorectomy (especially bilateral) risks versus benefits should be thoroughly discussed with the patient first. The effects of estrogens are complex, broad, and still being elucidated but seem to play a prominent role in cardiovascular, bone, and psychosocial health.

According to the Nursesâ€™ Health Study, BSO compared to ovarian conservation at the time of hysterectomy for benign pathology carries a decreased risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but it incurs an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

Specifically, in the pediatric and adolescent patient population with benign ovarian lesions, efforts should be made for ovarian sparing surgery.
