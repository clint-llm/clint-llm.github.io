Chickenpox is usually acquired after inhalation of aerosolized droplets from an infected individual. The majority of cases occurring in children less than 10. The key to lowering the morbidity of chickenpox is via education. Besides the primary caregiver, the nurse practitioner and pharmacist play a vital role in patient education. The parents of infected children should be told to trim the child's fingernails to avoid or minimize skin damage and the associated bacterial infections. Further, parents should be told not to give aspirin to young children to control fever, because of the risk of developing Reye syndrome. Finally, the parents should be told to apply cold compresses and keep the skin moisturized to prevent the itching and dryness.

**Outcomes**

For most children who develop chickenpox, the outcome is excellent. However, in immunocompromised individuals, there is increased morbidity and mortality.
