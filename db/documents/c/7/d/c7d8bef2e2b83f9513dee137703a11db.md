The basis of autonomic pharmacology reflects the physiology of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) to regulate involuntary reactions to stresses on multiorgan systems within the body. When a pathologic process is present that affects the homeostasis achieved between the SNS and PSNS in this process, either of these branches can become overactive while the other is excessively inhibited.

Within autonomic pharmacology, there are four specific categories of drugs based on how they affect the ANS:

- Cholinomimetics/cholinesterase antagonists

- Anticholinergics

- Adrenoreceptor agonists/sympathomimetics

- Adrenoreceptor antagonists

The clinical indications of medications from each of the four categories are listed below. Important to note is that this is not a complete list due to the vastness of this topic; the drugs included are representative of each category.

**FDA-labeled indications:**

Cholinomimetics/Cholinesterase antagonists

- Bethanechol - postoperative and neurogenic ileus and urinary retention

- Pilocarpine - glaucoma and alleviating the symptoms of Sjogren’s syndrome

- Nicotine - found in smoking cessation regimens

- Cholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine, edrophonium, pyridostigmine, physostigmine) - the diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis, maintenance treatment of Alzheimer disease, and specifically neostigmine used commonly with glycopyrrolate to reverse neuromuscular blockade in postoperative anesthesia practice

Anticholinergics

- Atropine - used in ACLS guidelines to correct bradyarrhythmias and in ophthalmic surgery as a retinal dilator

- Ipratropium and tiotropium - correct acute exacerbations of bronchospasm (asthma, COPD), as well as exacerbation prophylaxis for those conditions

- Scopolamine - prevents motion sickness and postoperative nausea/vomiting

- Oxybutynin - urge incontinence and postoperative bladder spasm

- Dicyclomine, glycopyrrolate - can be used for reducing diarrhea output in irritable bowel syndrome; glycopyrrolate can also be added to cholinesterase reversal of neuromuscular blockades in postoperative anesthesia care to prevent bronchospasm and is currently undergoing investigation as an adjunct treatment in COPD

Adrenoreceptor agonists/Sympathomimetics

- Clonidine - used as an antihypertensive

- Dobutamine, phenylephrine, epinephrine - used to correct severe hypotension in cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure exacerbation; epinephrine specifically also used in ACLS guidelines for non-shockable heart rhythms in cardiac arrest and rapid reversal of fatal anaphylactic reactions

- Albuterol - fast-acting bronchodilator used in acute asthma exacerbations

- Fenoldopam - corrects hypertension

- Bromocriptine - involved in the maintenance of Parkinson disease and conditions involving prolactinoma

Adrenoreceptor antagonists

- Phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine - used to correct high catecholamine states

- Prazosin, doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin - indicated to correct urinary retention in benign prostatic hyperplasia

- Beta-blockers (propranolol, metoprolol, labetalol, etc.) - indicated for many cardiovascular conditions since they are in the classification of class II antiarrhythmics; these agents are used to manage tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, angina, heart failure, and migraine prophylaxis
