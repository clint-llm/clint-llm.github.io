Viloxazine is a relatively safe drug. One case study showed that overdoses of viloxazine from 100 mg to 4 g showed less severe adverse effects compared to arrhythmias and QT prolongations normally seen in tricyclic antidepressants or Monoamine oxidase inhibitors overdose. The most severe adverse effect of viloxazine overdose was convulsing seizures, one seizure with extrapyramidal symptoms, loss of consciousness, and CNS depression.

In a 5-week double-blind study, 50 mg of viloxazine sustained-release three times daily compared to imipramine 50 mg single dose was given to patients suffering from depression. Both groups reported significant improvement in depressive symptoms using the Beck and Hamilton rating scores with no significant statistical difference. After the first week, doses of the drug were doubled, and patients were followed up for four weeks. Modest to major drug intolerance was seen with viloxazine but not imipramine. Of note, weight loss was noted with the group given viloxazine, but weight gain was seen with those on imipramine.
