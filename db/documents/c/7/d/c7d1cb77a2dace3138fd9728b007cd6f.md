The term laparotomy implies a potentially major operation in most surgical circles, however, does not stipulate in the name what operation the patient will have after the major open incision is performed. With advances in minimally invasive surgery and robotics, an open cut is being utilized less often unless clinically indicated, such as in an emergency situation where access into the abdomen needs to be fairly rapid or where the intra-abdominal environment is not amenable to other techniques.
