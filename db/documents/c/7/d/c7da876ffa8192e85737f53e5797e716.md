From pre-operative risk stratification to determine a specific disease process, the use of information garnered from CPET is abundant. While symptoms that may prompt the ordering of the exam are subjective (dyspnea, for example), the data collected are objective and can be used to determine the presence of disease. One crucial aspect of conducting and interpreting CPET is determining if a patient reaches his or her ventilatory threshold. This ventilatory threshold (VT) is defined as the point during exercise at which an individualâ€™s perfusion to active musculature no longer meets metabolic demand. Alternatively, this point is known as the lactate threshold or anaerobic threshold and often begins at 50% to 60% of maximal oxygen consumption.
