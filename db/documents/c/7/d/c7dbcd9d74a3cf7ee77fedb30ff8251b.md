# Introduction

Amniotic fluid surrounds the embryo and fetus during development and has a myriad of functions. Physically, it protects the fetus in the event the maternal abdomen is the object of trauma. Furthermore, it protects the umbilical cord by providing a cushion between the fetus and the umbilical cord, thus reducing the risk of compression between the fetus and the uterine wall.

# Development

The development of amniotic fluid organizes into early gestation and late gestation. Early gestation is the embryonic period which is from the start of fertilization to 8 weeks, and late gestation, which encompasses the fetal period 8 weeks to birth.  The composition of amniotic fluid changes from early gestation to late gestation. During the embryonic period, amniotic fluid derives from both fetal and maternal factors such as water from maternal serum, coelomic fluid, and fluid from the amniotic cavity; however, during late gestation, amniotic fluid is largely produced by fetal urine and lung secretions.

**Early Gestation**

In early gestation, two fluid-filled sacs surround the embryo: the exocoelomic cavity and the amniotic cavity. The formation of the coelomic cavity begins during the fourth week of gestation when the exocoelomic cavity splits the extraembryonic mesoderm into the splanchnic mesoderm lining and the somatic mesoderm. The coelomic fluid within the coelomic cavity stays in direct contact with the mesenchyme of the developing placenta villi during the first trimester. Before it disappears, the coelomic cavity acts as a transfer area as well as a reservoir of nutrients for the growing embryo. The exocoelomic cavity forms inside the extraembryonic mesoderm alongside the placental chorionic plate and is now believed to be an essential transfer interface and reservoir of nutrients for the embryo because coelomic fluid has shown to have ultrafiltrate of maternal serum as well as products derived from the placenta and secondary yolk sac. This arrangement suggests that the coelomic fluid is essentially an extension of the placenta, providing the embryo with nutrients until the amniotic cavity becomes large enough to take over later in development.

**Late Gestation**

Once the coelomic fluid begins to disappear, the amniotic cavity takes over. In the early stages of gestation, the water in amniotic fluid is derived mostly from maternal serum; however, at 10 weeks, the fetus begins to produce urine which is secreted into the amniotic sac. During late gestation (the second and third trimesters), as the amniotic fluid expands, fetal urine becomes the largest source of the amniotic fluid.

# Pathophysiology

Homeostasis of body fluids is important in the growing fetus. In addition to the constant circulation of amniotic fluid through inhalation and exhalation, there must be a balance between fluid formation and elimination.

# Clinical Significance

Abnormally high or low amniotic fluid volumes have been shown to predict poor fetal outcomes; therefore, a normal amount of amniotic fluid volume is crucial to the healthy development of the fetus or embryo. Amniotic fluid has proven to be a major diagnostic tool when monitoring the progression and health of a pregnancy. Clinicians can use the amniotic fluid index (AFI) or single deepest pocket (SDP).
