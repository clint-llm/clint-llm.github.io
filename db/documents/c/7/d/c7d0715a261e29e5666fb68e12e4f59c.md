Miliary tuberculosis is a potentially fatal form of disseminated disease due to the hematogenous spread of tubercle bacilli to the lungs and other organs. It results in the formation of millet seed-sized (1Â to 2 mm) tuberculous foci. The term miliary tuberculosis was first coined by John Jacobus Manget in 1700 while describing a pathological specimen having tiny tubercles similar to millet seeds in appearance. It originated from the Latin word miliarius, related to millet seed. Disseminated tuberculosis is defined as the simultaneous involvement of at least two non-contiguous organ sites of the body or infection of the blood, bone marrow, or liver. Miliary mottling on a chest radiograph is the classical hallmark that supports the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis. Miliary tuberculosis is classified as both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
