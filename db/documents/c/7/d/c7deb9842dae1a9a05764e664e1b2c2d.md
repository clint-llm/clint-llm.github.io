Catheter ablation is now the mainstay treatment of most arrhythmia, it can offer a better choice for those suffering recurrent arrhythmias,  and is a permanent treatment with a greater than 90% success rate of AVRT and AVNRT ablation. While catheter ablation is usually done by a cardiologist, the monitoring and follow-up of the patients are done by the primary care provider, internist, and nurse practitioner. Even though the success of catheter ablation is high for many atrial arrhythmias, the procedure is also associated with a fair number of serious complications that include death, pulmonary vein stenosis, esophageal perforation, heart block requiring a pacemaker, stroke, phrenic nerve injury, and vascular access complications. It is important to educate the patient on the potential complications before the procedure.
