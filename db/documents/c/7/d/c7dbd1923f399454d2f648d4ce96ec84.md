Fetal echocardiography is a helpful tool for the assessment of the heart structure, rhythm, and function. Commonly after the 18 weeks of pregnancy arrhythmias can be diagnosed, but there have been few cases reported at 16 to 17 weeks. Thus serial screening is advised at 16 weeks of gestation in women who tested positive for autoantibodies to Sjogren syndrome auto-antigens types A or B or with a previous history of an infant with neonatal lupus erythematosus. Less than 20% of cases are detected after 26 weeks of gestation; thus if there is no diagnosis of atrioventricular block, echocardiography screening frequency can be reduced after 26 weeks of gestation. Two percent of AV block cases are detected postnatally in the neonate period, the reason why observing newborns at risk for the first month of life should be done. However, after 28 days of life heart monitoring screening is not advised, unless already diagnosed with a heart abnormality. A pediatric cardiologist must closely monitor first- and second-degree AV block identified after birth. ECG and echocardiogram should be obtained at 1 year of age if there is a history of transient first-degree AV block in utero and within the first 3 months of life with a history of a transient second-degree block that reverted to normal sinus rhythm at birth.

Mothers with affected offspring and that tested positive for autoantibodies to Sjogren syndrome auto-antigens types A or B, should be assessed for an underlying autoimmune disease. Mothers should be counsel about the 2% risk of having an affected newborn, and if there is a history of aÂ previous offspring with neonatal lupus, the risk increases to 20% with the subsequent pregnancies. The risk of AV block is higher if there is a history of previous infants with cardiac manifestations.
