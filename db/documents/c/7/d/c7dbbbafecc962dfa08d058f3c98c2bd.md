The levator palpebrae superioris is often the directed target for correcting various causes of ptosis.

In the posterior approach, the levator palpebrae superioris may similarly be advanced after making an incision at the top of the tarsal plate, or a Müllerectomy procedure may be carried out, in which conjunctiva and the Müller muscle are resected: histopathology has shown that this technique also removes some levator aponeurosis.

Weights (commonly gold and platinum) may also be surgically attached to upper eyelids to increase the weight of an upper eyelid and counter the action of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. This surgery is useful in correcting excessive upper eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos (inability to close eyelids).
