The initial pathology behind NBTE is unclear and needs further study. However, it appears to be due to an endothelial injury from circulating cytokines such as TNF (tumor necrosis factor) or interleukins in a hypercoagulable state patient, which results in the deposition in platelets thrombi and inflammatory molecules in the affected valves. The vegetations consist mainly of immune complexes, mononuclear cells, fibrin, and platelet thrombi. These vegetations are most often small-to-moderate in size (<10mm), but may sometimes be large and exuberant (>10mm).

Histopathology of Libman-Sacks endocarditis has been described in different stages as follows :

- Active verrucae - Consist of clumps of fibrin, which is focally necrotic, with plasma cells and lymphocytes.

- Combined active and healed lesions: which is intermediate, has characteristics of active (necrotic) and healed (fibrous) tissues.

- Healed lesions - Consist of vascularized, dense fibrous, and scar tissue.
