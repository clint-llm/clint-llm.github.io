Lead became a common occupational toxin with the birth of the Industrial Revolution, by the end of the 19-century childhood lead poisoning secondary to exposure to lead-based paints was beginning to be recognized. As the 20 century progressed, so did the appreciation for increasingly subtle and even subclinical manifestations of lead toxicity. Today, healthcare providers and public health officials must grapple with the mounting evidence implicating lead as a potent neurotoxin with measurable negative effects on cognition at vanishingly low blood lead concentrations in the face of the difficulties surrounding the feasibility of completely eliminating lead from childrenâ€™s environment. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of lead toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the toxicokinetics and pathophysiology of lead toxicity, including the effects of long-term exposure.
- Review the components of a good history and examination for suspected lead toxicity.
- Summarize the strategies for the treatment and management of lead toxicity, including prevention strategies.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with lead toxicity.
