Maltreatment of children varies by country and definition. Despite these limitations, studies have found a quarter of all adults report enduring physical abuse as children. One in five females and one in 13 males report experiencing childhood sexual abuse. Emotional abuse and neglect are common. Females are especially vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation, and abuse.

In the United States, Child Protective Services estimated that nine out of 1000 children are victims of child maltreatment. Most were victims of neglect. Physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other types of maltreatment are less common, making up 18%, 9%, and 11% of cases, respectively.
