Pulmonary artery hypertension has proven to cause significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. The first-line treatment option for pulmonary artery hypertension has been an endothelin 1 antagonist, such as bosentan. Bosentan is a medication used in the management and treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, off-label use, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring pertinent for members of the interprofessional team to treat patients with pulmonary artery hypertension.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of bosentan.
- Describe the potential drug-drug interactions of bosentan.
- Outline appropriate monitoring for patients using bosentan.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension and improve outcomes when using bosentan.
