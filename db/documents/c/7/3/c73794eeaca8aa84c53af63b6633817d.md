Millipedes species are widely distributed throughout the world and often confused with centipedes. They can be distinguished by the absence of fangs to inject venom and instead employ a defensive mechanism of secreting chemicals from their sides. These chemicals often only cause local skin discoloration or irritation that is self-limited and treated by washing the affected area with soap and water. Eye exposure can be more severe and should be followed closely by ophthalmology. Most patients can be discharged home with instructions to prevent reexposure. Care should be taken not to mistake exposure with more common causes of the noted skin changes.
