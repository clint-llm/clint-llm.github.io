Ketamine (ketamine hydrochloride) has been approved for general anesthesia either alone or in combination with other medications. It is a superb drug for use in short-term medical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation, and it has approval for the induction of general anesthesia as a pre-anesthetic to other general anesthetic agents. This activity covers ketamine, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of ketamine anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of ketamine.
- Identify the indications for initiating therapy with ketamine.
- Outline the adverse event profile of ketamine, along with any possible contraindications to its use.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and efficacy for patients receiving ketamine as an anesthetic agent.
