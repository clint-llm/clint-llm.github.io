By 2025, the US Department of Health and Human Services projects that there will be a population of approximately 45,000 to 90,000 providers with poor working conditions and high levels of stress. Stress is a reason for deterring people from entering the profession. One of the steps to be taken to improve this shortfall is vigilance among the instructors and institutions training doctors and nurses. Healthcare leaders have a very critical role to play in addressing this issue. There is clear evidence to support that those providers who are spending 20% of their professional time in the area of work they found meaningful tend to experience symptoms of burnout at a significantly lower rate with a ceiling effect at 20%.
