Anasarca is a medical condition in which there is a severe generalized accumulation of fluid or edema in the interstitial space. This accumulation of fluid occurs when capillary filtration exceeds the amount of fluid removed via lymphatic drainage or a change in the oncotic pressure from low protein states. It is caused by a variety of clinical conditions including heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, or conditions involving the lymphatic system. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, presentation of anasarca and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anasarca.
- Review the presentation of a patient with anasarca.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for anasarca
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with anasarca.
