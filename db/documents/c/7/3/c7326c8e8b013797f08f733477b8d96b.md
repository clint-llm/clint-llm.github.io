The patient should be explained and counseled about all the treatment options available along with prognosis at the time of diagnosis, depending on the stage of presentation. Counseling for genetic testing should also be done, which does have an impact on treatment at times. The palliative care team and other related consultants' involvement should be sought timely regardless of cancer stage to enable comprehensive care, anticipate the disease course, and make a great impact on the quality of life of the patients. Patients should also be explained about the recent ongoing clinical trials if pertinent to their particular case.
