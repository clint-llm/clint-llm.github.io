Due to reports of hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure, patients require close monitoring. The recommendation is to discontinue erlotinib if there is an increase of total bilirubin to levels three times higher than the patient’s baseline or if transaminase levels increase to five times higher than the patient’s baseline. While all patients require monitoring, it is important to note that patients with baseline hepatic impairment are at increased risk for hepatoxicity when taking erlotinib.

It is important to note that tumors may develop resistance to EGFR-TKIs, which can necessitate altering the treatment regimen. The most common mode of resistance comes through a secondary mutation in EGFR known as T790M mutation, which occurs in exon 20 of EGFR. Research has found the T790M mutation in up to half of the patients treated with erlotinib or gefitinib. Other mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance are the upregulation of MET, insulin-like growth factor 1, as well as hepatocyte growth factor.
