The diagnosis of Eustachian tube dysfunction is poorly defined, with no existing comprehensive guidelines. Diagnosis is based on a clinical exam and symptoms specific to Eustachian tube dysfunction. Ideally, a full clinical assessment should include the use of an otoscope, Rinne and Weber tuning forks or pure tone audiometry, and nasopharyngoscopy.

In addition, various imaging studies can aid clinical examination in diagnosing dysfunction. One study, using real-time MRI, was able to visualize the Eustachian tube opening with the Valsalva maneuver in patients with documented dysfunction. Cases of unilateral dysfunction demonstrated normal opening on the unaffected side and failure to open on the affected side. Studies using CT imaging show a reduced cross-sectional area of the osseous portion of the Eustachian tube in patients with documented dysfunction. Another imaging study that shows promising results in diagnosing Eustachian tube dysfunction is scintigraphy, which uses radiolabeled albumin tracers introduced through the tympanic membrane to visualize the patency of drainage from the middle ear.

Tympanogram is another test related to middle ear function that measures tympanic membrane compliance, with an abnormal tympanogram finding indicating increased pressure within the middle ear. Tympanogram is also used to measure the improvement of middle ear function following interventions for Eustachian tube dysfunction.
