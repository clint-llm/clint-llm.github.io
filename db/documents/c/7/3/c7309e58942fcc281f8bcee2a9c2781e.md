One of the most notorious and severe complications of any pituitary tumor is blindness. The encroachment of the tumor on the chiasm or nerves can cause partial or complete blindness. Some tumors that do not present with visual defects can progress rapidly to cause vision loss.

Diabetes insipidus can occur in macroadenomas, which causes vasopressin deficiency and can, in turn, cause increased thirst and polyuria.

Pituitary apoplexy, or hemorrhage of the pituitary gland, requires emergent attention and can cause a severe headache, ophthalmoplegia, and visual disturbances immediately at onset.

Due in part because of need for repeat surgery, as well as the severity of the underlying disease, an increased number of surgical complications, including hydrocephalus requiring placement of a ventricular shunt, is observed.

Additional peri-operative complications which may occur include infection (meningitis or pituitary abscess), CSF leak, entry into the cavernous sinus with possible injury to structures contained within the sinus, and rarely internal carotid artery rupture, which may occur intraoperatively or in a delayed fashion due to a pseudoaneurysm created during surgery.
