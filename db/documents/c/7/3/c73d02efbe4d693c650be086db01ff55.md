There are two standard views in screening mammography, named for the direction of the x-ray beam from the source to detector: craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO).

For the CC view, the patient's breast is positioned on the image detector with the paddle compressing the breast in the superior-inferior direction. There should be at least some of the inframammary tissues present on the detector, and the image should ideally include the cleavage area and some of the pectoralis major muscle (seen in approximately 30%). These landmarks help to ensure that adequate tissue is imaged, as not to exclude a portion of breast tissue that may harbor a malignant lesion. Compression is adjusted, taking into account multiple factors, including breast size and patient tolerance. Without adequate compression, there may be an inadequate separation of the parenchymal tissues, nonuniform exposure throughout the breast, increased dose, and a greater likelihood for motion. No portion of the breast should be cut off or excluded from the field of view.

For the MLO view, the machine is angled generally 40 to 60 degrees. In routine screening, this is preferred over a true lateral because the axillary tail and axilla are included. The breast is similarly applied to the image detector, again covering as much of the breast tissues as possible, including the inframammary fold and as much posterior tissue as possible. A line drawn from the nipple to the chest wall should be within 1cm of the same line drawn on the CC view to ensuring the comparability of the different images. It is essential to try and include as much of the breast tissue that is within the axillary tail, as breast cancers may develop in this region.

If diagnostic mammographic images are necessary, focal compression or magnification paddles may be needed to further assess masses/asymmetries or calcifications. The focal compression paddle is placed by estimating the location of the lesion based on the screening mammogram images. Magnification views may be performed by lifting the breast away from the image detector, allowing for geometric magnification. Findings are described by location using a clock-face and distance from the nipple (in centimeters).
