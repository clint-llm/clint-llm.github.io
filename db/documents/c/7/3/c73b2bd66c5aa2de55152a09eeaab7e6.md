The primary function of TBG is to help maintain the constant pool of thyroid hormone in the serum.  Research estimates that in the absence of new thyroid hormone production, the amount already present in the serum would be used within just a few hours.  However, in the presence of TBG, there would be only a 10% drop in T4 and a 40% drop in T3. As such, TBG can also be noted to play a role in preventing thyroid hormone fluctuations.

When there is a decrease in TBG, the levels of free T4 increase and negatively inhibit TSH, resulting in a reduction of the total T4 produced. Thus, the total T4 decreases and the free T4 in serum returns to normal levels.
