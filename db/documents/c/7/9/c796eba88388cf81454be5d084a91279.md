A chin implant is often reserved for those patients looking to correct their convex facial profile and/or narrow chin usually caused by:

- Horizontal (anterior-posterior) chin deficiency, also known as microgenia

- Soft tissue deficiency (e.g., muscular atrophy)

- Pre-jowl volume loss

Chin implantation is most often employed in conjunction with rhinoplasty to create a harmonious nose-chin relationship and aesthetically pleasing profile, and may be indicated in up to 25% of patients presenting for cosmetic rhinoplasty. Chin augmentation can significantly improve the results of a facelift by lengthening the jawline and providing a better framework over which to reposition the soft tissues of the face.
