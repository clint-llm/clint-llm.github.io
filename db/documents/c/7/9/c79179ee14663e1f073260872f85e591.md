A recommended treatment for cholecystitis with hydrops is laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of its low morbidity and mortality rates with quick recovery. ThisÂ procedure can also be done with an open technique in cases where the patient is not a good laparoscopic candidate. If the patient is acutely ill and considered a poor surgical candidate, consider treating with temporizing percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder.
