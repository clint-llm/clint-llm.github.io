Not much is known about the etiology of brain AVMs. The cause of brain AVMs is yet unknown, however, it is possibly multifactorial; apparently both genetic mutation and angiogenic stimulation (the physiological process of formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels) playing roles in AVM development. Some believe that AVMs develop in utero. While others advocate an angiopathic reaction, following either a cerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic event (subtypes of stroke) as a primary factor in their development.
