OA affects about 3.3 to 3.6% of the population globally. It causes moderate to severe disability in 43 million people, making it the 11th most debilitating disease worldwide. In the United States, it is estimated that 80% of the population over 65 years old has radiographic evidence of OA, although only 60% of this subset has symptoms. This is because radiographic OA is at least twice as common as symptomatic OA. Therefore, radiographic changes do not prove that OA is the cause of the patientâ€™s joint pain. In 2011, there were almost 1 million hospitalizations for OA, with an aggregate cost of nearly $15 billion, making it the second most expensive disease seen in the United States.
