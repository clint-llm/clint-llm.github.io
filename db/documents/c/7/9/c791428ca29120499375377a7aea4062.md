Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless liquid found in the subarachnoid space (SAS) that fills the neuroaxis cavities and surrounds the central nervous system (CNS). It consists predominantly of 99% water, and 1% accounts for electrolytes, proteins, neurotransmitters, and glucose.

The volume of CSF is estimated at 125 mL to 150 mL in the SAS and 25 mL in the ventricular system. This volume is defined by equal production and reabsorption rates of approximately 420 to 530 mL/day in adults.

The CSF leak occurs when there is a tear or hole in the dura mater, the outermost layer of the meninges that protect the central nervous system, communicating the subarachnoid space with the epidural space and, sometimes, with the skin establishing a connexion between the CNS and the external environment.
