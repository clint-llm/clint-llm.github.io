Adenovirus is an icosahedral capsid double-stranded DNA virus 70 to 90 nm in size. The spot of entry usually dictatesÂ the place of infection; gastrointestinal tract infection results from the fecal-oral transmission, whereas respiratory tract infection infections outcome from droplet inhalation. After exposure to adenovirus infection, different relations with the cells may occur, as discussed.

- Lytic infection occurs when an adenovirus enters human epithelial cells and lasts until the entire replication cycle, which further leads to cytokine production, cytolysis, and initiation of the host inflammatory response.

- Chronic or latent infection, the exact process is unknown, which often involves asymptomatic infection of lymphoid tissue.

- The oncogenic transformation has been detected in rats, adenovirus gives rise to potent E1A proteins that exalt main rodent cells by changing cellular transcription, eventually causing malignant transformation and deregulation of apoptosis. After getting inside the nucleus, E1A triggers the expression of other viral genes essential for viral replication by interacting with other regulatory proteins, which are necessary for gene transcription and cellular transcription factors.
