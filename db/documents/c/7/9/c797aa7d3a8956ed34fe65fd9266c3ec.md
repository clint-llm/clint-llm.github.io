For a definitive diagnosis of lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma, an excisional lymph node biopsy is generally preferred over a core-needle biopsy.

Proper staging is important to assess the extent of the disease and to guide therapy. Positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) scans are routinely done for staging evaluation in Hodgkin lymphoma, but contrast-enhancedÂ CT scans can also be used.

- Stage I: A single lymph node, a group of adjacent lymph nodes, or single extranodal lesions without nodal involvement

- Stage II: Two or more lymph node groups on the same side of the diaphragm or limited contiguous extranodal involvement

- Stage II bulky: Stage II as above with a bulky feature defined as a single nodal mass of 10 centimeters or greater than a third of the transthoracic diameter

- Stage III: Nodes on both sides of diaphragm or nodes above diaphragm with spleen involvement

- Stage IV: Additional noncontiguous extra lymphatic involvement
