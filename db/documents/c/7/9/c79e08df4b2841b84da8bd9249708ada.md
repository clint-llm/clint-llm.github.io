Any case of PBK presenting to the OPD must be evaluated carefully. A detailed history and meticulous slit lamp evaluation are mandated by a cornea expert to guide the management. The nursing team and the paramedical staff have a huge role in preoperative workup and counseling, assistance during corneal transplantation, intraoperative and postoperative patient management. A patient-centered approach definitely improves outcomes in these cases. In addition, the nursing team and pharmacists must also counsel the patient regarding the complications of surgery and side effects of irregular use of drugs to ensure safety and excellent outcome in these cases.
