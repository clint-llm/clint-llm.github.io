Once chemotherapy has been initiated, anagen effluvium presents within days to a few weeks. The severity of hair loss differs between patients, but it is not unusual for a patient to have complete hair loss within 2 to 3 months of beginning chemotherapy. On physical exam, the patientâ€™s scalp will not display signs of cicatricial alopecia (anagen effluvium is non-cicatricial, and therefore the physician should not be able to appreciate any signs suggestive of an active inflammatory scarring process such as erythema, scaling, or pigmentation). It should be noted that there may be an overlap syndrome of telogen effluvium and anagen effluvium, as the onset of chemotherapy is a significant stressor on the patient.

The hallmark physical exam finding in anagen effluvium is a tapered fracture of the hair shaft. It is possible to identify anagen and telogen hairs with the naked eye alone. However, it can be helpful to observe hair microscopically. Anagen hairs will demonstrate full pigment with roots covered with inner and outer root sheaths, as opposed to telogen hairs that possess club-shaped roots, no inner or outer root sheaths, and depigmentation of the proximal part of the shaft.
