Dizziness, with its myriad of etiologies, often requires interprofessional care. With the numerous possible causes of dizziness, interprofessional communication is vital to proper patient care and good outcomes. Whether in the ER or office setting, the entire healthcare team plays an essential role in helping to differentiate the cause of dizziness. From the nurses or other staff taking vital signs and completing triage to the clinician evaluating the patient to the staff involved in completing testing to the discussion with consulting specialists, all information is critical in the care of the dizzy patient. Interprofessional communication is vital when evaluating a patient with a complaint as broad as dizziness to ensure that all possible diagnoses have been assessed.
