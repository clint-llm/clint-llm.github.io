It is challenging to clinically diagnose septic versus aseptic nonunion

**Imaging:**plain radiographs, including AP, lateral, oblique, and weight-bearing films. It is important to look for signs (e.g., gaps or callus formation) or absence of healing, bone quality, signs of infection, associated deformities or length discrepancies, as well as the characteristics of the two fragments (i.e., contact, stability, and bone loss). Once this has been done, the nonunion can be adequately categorized as atrophic, hypertrophic, or oligotrophic. If possible, a comparison with original and postoperative follow-up films should be done to create a timeline and a better understanding of the nonunion process

**Laboratory analysis:**

- Basic workup such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be helpful in ruling out an infection, although the borderline elevation in inflammatory markers is often nonspecific

- Evaluation for any associated metabolic diseases and full endocrine profile (i.e., Vitamin D, calcium levels) can guide towards the etiology of the nonunion

The definitive diagnosis of septic nonunion requires isolation of microorganisms from an open tissue biopsy

Depending on its cause, nonunion classifications are as follows:

- Septic (infected) or aseptic: Septic tibial non-union can be a spot diagnosis with evidence of discharging sinus, bone exposure, or implant loosening.

- Pseudarthrosis

- Hypertrophic - characterized by inadequate immobilization, but adequate blood supply persists

- Atrophic - characterized by inadequate immobilization and inadequate blood supply in the early stages of fracture healing

- Oligotrophic - characterized by inadequate reduction with the persistence of fracture diastasis; no callus can form
