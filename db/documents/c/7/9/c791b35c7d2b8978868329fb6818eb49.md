Cleft lip deformity is one of the most common congenital deformities, and management requires an interprofessional approach to address the physical cleft deformity along with resulting issues in speech and swallowing. Many types of cleft lip deformity can occur, often simultaneously with a cleft palate. A microform or occult cleft occurs when the patient has incomplete separation of the lip with distortion but not separation of the white roll/vermillion border. An incomplete cleft lip has lip separation through the white roll/vermillion border and often a downward displacement of the ala but an intact nasal sill with a fibrous band called a Simonart band. A complete cleft lip has complete separation of lip and nasal sill. Patients also can have either unilateral or bilateral cleft lips. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the developmental pathophysiology that leads to cleft lip.
- Describe the history, physical, and evaluation necessary in a patient presenting with cleft lip.
- Review the treatment and management options for cleft lip patients.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of cleft lip and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
