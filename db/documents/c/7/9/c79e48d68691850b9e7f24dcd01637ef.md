A thoracotomy is a procedure in which the thorax is opened surgically to gain access to the internal structures such as the lungs, pulmonary vasculature, heart, or aorta. This procedure is sometimes necessary to emergently evacuate a pericardial tamponade, control thoracic hemorrhage, internal cardiac massage or cross-clamp the descending thoracic aorta. Â Access through the triangle of auscultation provides the patient with less perioperative morbidity as it spares incision through the latissimus dorsi.
