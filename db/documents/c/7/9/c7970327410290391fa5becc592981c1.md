Adequate pain medication is necessary, as patients often report mild peri-incisional pain for three to four days postoperatively. To minimize edema and ecchymosis, the patient should wear the facelift dressing continuously for the first 24 hours, sleep with the head elevated for one week, and avoid rigorous activity for two weeks. The patient may be given a low-dose corticosteroid taper, Arnica montana, or bromelain to help lessen bruising and swelling as well, though definitive data on the efficacy of these measures is lacking.
