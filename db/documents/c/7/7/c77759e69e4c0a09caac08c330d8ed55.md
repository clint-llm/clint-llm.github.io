It is essential for the health care practitioners involved in managing patients with shoulder disease to be familiar with the RTSA procedures. Understanding the indications and biomechanics for RTSA is necessary to select suitable patients for this type of treatment.Â Arthroplasty nurses and physicians should provide clear postoperative counseling about arm usage after the surgery. Patient education about safe arm use after RTSA reduces the risk of prosthesis dislocation. Post-operative proper pain management and physiotherapy lead rehabilitation are essential to achieve enhanced recovery and reduce the length of hospital stay. Regular follow-up consultations after the surgery with serial postoperative X-rays and clinical assessment are required to identify any postoperative complication.
