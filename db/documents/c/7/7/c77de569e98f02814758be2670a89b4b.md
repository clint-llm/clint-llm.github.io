The central question in the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism is when to initiate levothyroxine therapy. Factors which need to be taken into account to decide on levothyroxine therapy are age, extent of the elevation of TSH, associated cardiovascular risk factors, clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism and presence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

Both the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) recommend starting levothyroxine therapy under the following scenarios:

- TSH is >10 mIU/lÂ or;

- Presence of hypothyroid symptoms or;

- Presence of cardiovascular risk factors or;

- Positive TPO antibody.

The goal of levothyroxine therapy is to normalize TSH. The starting of levothyroxine is 1.6 mcg/kg in the absence of cardiovascular disease. In patients with cardiovascular disease, the starting dose of levothyroxine is 25 mcg and is up-titrated as needed.
