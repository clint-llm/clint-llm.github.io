Patients should be encouraged to openly communicate with providers if they have any symptoms of dry mouth or halitosis. Patients should be encouraged to try preventative measures, which include and are not limited to:

- Sipping water

- Chewing gum (preferably sugar-free)

- Using a mouth humidifier

- Reducing the consumption of alcohol, coffee, tobacco, sugary drinks,Â and candy

- Keeping cracked mucosal areas moist

Patients should also be encouraged to regularly follow up with their dentist, incorporate flossing, and use fluoride toothpaste. Providing appropriate therapy in time will help patients with their mental health, decrease anxiety and depression, and maintain a better quality of life.
