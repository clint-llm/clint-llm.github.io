A standard orthopedic operative set is essential. Also valuable to this operation is a tourniquet, fluoroscopy, large amputation blade, oscillating bone saw or manual saw, drill and bit set for performing myodesis of muscle to bone ends, silk hand ties, rongeur, and a suction drain.

The patient should be prepped and draped supine, with a bump placed under the ipsilateral hip to internally rotate the operative extremity such that the knee and ankle are vertically oriented. A thigh tourniquet may be placed in a nonsterile fashion as high as possibleÂ above the knee to prep and expose as much of the extremity as possible, or a sterile tourniquet may be applied after the patient is draped.
