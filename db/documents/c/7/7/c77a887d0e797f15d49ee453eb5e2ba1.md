Extubation is removing an endotracheal tube (ETT), which is the last step in liberating a patient from the mechanical ventilator. Other terms related to extubation are 'weaning' and 'liberation.' To discuss the actual procedure of extubation, one also needs to review how to assess readiness for weaning and management before and after extubation. This activity reviews the overall process of extubation with a special focus on the assessment of readiness, spontaneous breathing trial, and a few complications related to the process. The activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, in managing and improving care for all patients who undergo liberation from mechanical ventilation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify clinical conditions which present a relative contraindication to the extubation. 
- Describe methods to assess readiness to initiate a spontaneous breathing trial. 
- Review the criteria for successfully passing a spontaneous breathing trial. 
- Summarize some common complications and their management related to extubation that the interprofessional team may encounter and how collaboration will improve care.
