Antibodies are naturally produced by plasma cells within the human body to mediate an adaptive immune response against invading pathogens. There are five predominant antibodies produced, each specialized to execute certain functions. Antibodies gain the ability to identify a diverse range of antigens by genetic recombination of different elements of its structure and while the affinity for a specific antigen derives from affinity maturation and somatic recombination processes. Antibodies have a plethora of clinical applications, the most important being their use in combating autoimmune conditions and cancer, conferring passive immunity, and their diagnostic applications.
