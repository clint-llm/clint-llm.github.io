GLP-1 analogs are principally renally eliminated. Dosing adjustments of GLP-1 agonists are not necessary due to hepatic or mild renal impairment. Moderate renally impaired patients, on the other hand, should avoid weekly exenatide, and dosing escalations should be considered carefully in patients on twice-daily exenatide. Likewise, lixisenatide use requires caution in this patient population. Dosing increases of twice-daily exenatideÂ for patients 70 years and older merit evaluation of the potential risks and benefits.

Patients with severe renal dysfunction should not take GLP-1 agonists. If a GLP-1 agonist is added to a regimen already consisting of a sulfonylurea or long-acting insulin, patients require monitoring for hypoglycemia. A decrease in the insulin dose may even become necessary, depending on the GLP-1 analog selected. Patients taking GLP-1 analogs should periodically have their hemoglobin A1c measured and have their glycemic patterns examined. The clinician should follow the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients prescribed warfarin, as a GLP-1 agonist may alter the absorption of this medication by delaying gastric emptying. Healthcare providers should also monitor patients taking GLP-1 agonists for signs and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis. The FDA currently has recommended against routinely monitoring calcitonin levels for medullary thyroid cancer.
