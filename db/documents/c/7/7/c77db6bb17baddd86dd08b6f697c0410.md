Normal platelet count in humans ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 cells/microliter. Platelet transfusion is mainly indicated to treat or prevent bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet function disorder.

**Platelet transfusion Threshold in Bleeding Patients**

- <50,000 cells/microliter in severe bleeding, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

- <30,000 cells/microliter when bleeding, not life-threatening, or considered not severe

- <100,000 cells/microliter for bleeding in multiple trauma patients or patients with intracranial bleeding.

**Prophylactic Transfusion Threshold**

Prophylactic platelet transfusion is indicated below a specific threshold and is indicated before specific procedures or to prevent spontaneous bleeding. These include the following:

- To prevent spontaneous bleeding - transfuse at less than 10,000 cells/microliter; some recommend less than 5,000 cells/microliter

- Before neurosurgery or ocular surgery - less than 100,000 cells/microliter

- Before major surgery - less than 50,000 cells/microliter

- In DIC - less than 50,000 cells/microliter

- Before central line placement - less than 20,000 cells/microliter

- Before epidural anesthesia - less than 80,000 cells/microliter

- Before bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) – 20,000 to 30,000 cells/microliter

- Before endoscopic procedures - less than 50,000 cells/microliter for therapeutic procedures; <20,000 cells/microliter for low-risk diagnostic procedures

- Vaginal delivery platelet transfusion is considered at less than 30,000 cells/microliter, and when traumatic delivery, then less than 50,000 cells/microliter.

- Before lumbar puncture - less than 20,000 cells/microliter in patients with hematologic malignancies and 40,000 to 50,000 cells/microliter in patients without hematologic malignancies

- Platelet transfusion is not routinely indicated prior to bone marrow biopsy, peripheral or central catheter insertion, traction removal of tunneled central venous catheters, and cataract removal.

**Platelet Transfusion in Specific Settings**

- Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) - transfusion is avoided unless severe bleeding is present.

- Malignancy and chemotherapy - In most cancers, platelet transfusion thresholds are as indicated above, except in acute promyelocytic leukemia, in which there is increased bleeding risk. Hence transfusion is indicated at counts less than 30,000 cells/microliter. chemotherapy is carried out at counts less than 20,000 cells/microliter.

- Cardiac surgery - Patients undergoing cardiac surgery get exposed to a blood-pumping circuit, which activates platelets that get destroyed once back in circulation; hence even at normal counts, platelet transfusion is indicated during cardiac surgery.

- Inherited and acquired platelet disorders like Glanzmann thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome, and other congenital platelet defects, acquired platelet disorders like patients with uremia or drug-induced platelet dysfunction. In these situations, platelet transfusion is indicated only when bleeding Is present.

- For pediatric patients, transfusion indications are otherwise similar in older infants and children compared to adults, as demonstrated by the PLADO study, except in the following situation. We transfuse platelets when the platelet count is:
- <30,000 cells/microliter in neonates without any bleeding or symptom and failure to produce platelet.
- <50,000 cells/microliter in an infant with active bleeding or undergoing an invasive procedure. For the same situation in a premature infant, we transfuse at less than 100,000 cells/microliter.
- Patient undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and platelets <100,000 cells/microliter
