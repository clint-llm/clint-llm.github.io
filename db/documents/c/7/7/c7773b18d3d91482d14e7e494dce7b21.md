In patients with meconium ileus, bowel lumen obstruction by thick, adhesive, and desiccated meconium is present. It presents in two forms, simple or complex MI. In simple MI, the viscid meconium obstructs the terminal ileum, and the small intestine proximal to the obstruction site dilates with meconium, gas, and fluid. In complex MI, the meconium-distended segments of the small intestine may give rise to complications like prenatal volvulus, ischemic necrosis, intestinal atresia, or perforation and extrusion of the meconium into the peritoneum.
