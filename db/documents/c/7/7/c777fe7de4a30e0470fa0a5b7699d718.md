Vessel diameter is the determining factor for balloon sizing for the procedure; a traditional balloon is usually necessary to be advanced to calculate vessel width. Subsequently, a 1 to 1 ratio is used to find appropriate balloon sizing. Although typically a 6 French (Fr) system is used for IVL insertion, a 5 Fr catheter could also be an option in cases where the native radial artery has a small diameter.  Intravascular imaging plays an invaluable role in the accurate balloon size selection and evaluation of calcium morphology.
