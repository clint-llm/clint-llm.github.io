Gastrointestinal bleeding can fall into two broad categories: upper and lower sources of bleeding. The anatomic landmark that separates upper and lower bleeds is the ligament of Treitz, also known as the suspensory ligament of the duodenum. This peritoneal structure suspends the duodenojejunal flexure from the retroperitoneum. Bleeding that originates above the ligament of Treitz usually presents either as hematemesis or melena whereas bleeding that originates below most commonly presents as hematochezia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of gastrointestinal bleeding and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Describe the workup of a patient with upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Summarize the risk stratification tools to assess gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding.
