Oligohydramnios is a disorder of amniotic fluid resulting in decreased amniotic fluid volume for gestational age. Low amniotic fluid volumes can be the result of numerous maternal, fetal, or placental complications and can lead to poor fetal outcomes. This activity will highlight the pathophysiology, etiology, evaluation, and treatment of oligohydramnios, and also review the role of healthcare teams in the assessment and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the diagnostic workup for oligohydramnios.
- Review the pathophysiology of amniotic fluid production resulting in disorders of amniotic fluid.
- Outline the differential diagnosis for both maternal and fetal causes of oligohydramnios.
- Summarize the etiology-specific management of oligohydramnios.
