**The initial evaluation in the Emergency room**

A specific drug and family history is needed along with screening blood work for C4 for hereditary angioedema and tryptase for angioedema with anaphylaxis. These labs when drawn during acute attacks are useful during follow-ups. In the case of anaphylaxis, (tryptase is normal in hereditary angioedema one and two but will be elevated in cases of anaphylaxis and other mast cell disorders associated with angioedema)

Clear differentiation between histamine-induced vs. bradykinin-inducedÂ angioedema can be life-saving.

**Hereditary angioedema type 1:**C1 inhibitor function low, C1-Inhibitor level low, and C4 level low

**Hereditary angioedema type 2**: C1 inhibitor function and C4 level will be low, but the C1 inhibitor level will be normal or high.

Confirm them by repeating the blood test.

**Acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency**: Low C1-inhibitor antigen and function and low C1q.
