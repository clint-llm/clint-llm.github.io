The most common mutation is delta F508, which is found in 70% of American white patients with CF and two-thirds of all cases worldwide. This mutation is a classÂ 2 mutation of abnormal folding of the CFTR protein, leading to premature destruction within the Golgi apparatus. The delta F508 mutation commonly leads to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and a higher likelihood of meconium ileus.
