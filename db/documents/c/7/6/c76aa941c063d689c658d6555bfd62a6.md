Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2 (PAS-2) is an autoimmune syndrome which leads to lymphocytic infiltration causing organ-specific damage. PAS-2 is diagnosed when at least 2 out of 3 of the following are present: primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), autoimmune thyroid disease-causing Grave's disease or hypothyroidism, and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Carpenter syndrome is a type of PAS-2 that includes the triad of Addison disease, autoimmune thyroid disease, and T1DM. This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of the Carpenter syndrome variant of PAS-2 and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the early detection and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Distinguish Carpenter's syndrome from other types of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2.
- Explain signs and symptoms that should prompt consideration of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2.
- Describe the management of Carpenter's syndrome. 
- Explain how coordination of interprofessional teams can lead to earlier diagnosis of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2, allowing for treatment aimed at minimizing comorbidities, leading to better patient outcomes.
