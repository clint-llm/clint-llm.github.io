Patient education cannot be emphasized enough in the setting of Tourette syndrome. Tics can be dentrimental to appropriate psychosocial development and thus parents and teachers must be cognizant and supportive. Current guidelines recommend habit reversal training with CBIT before initiating pharmacotherapy. In the event that CBIT is inaccessible or ineffective, medications may be necessary; these include tetrabenazine, risperidone, fluphenazine, or clonidine. Addressing comorbid psychiatric disorders will also help to alleviate the overall morbidity.
