Maternal blood acts as the medium, which enables provision to the developing fetus of nutrients, gaseous exchange, and waste disposal. The placenta here serves as the gatekeeper of this exchange. Maternal blood floods the intervillous spaces, which is where the transfer takes place via both active and passive transport. Carbon dioxide, urea, uric acid, and creatinine are disposed into the maternal blood from the fetal circulation. Maternal blood contains IgG antibodies which diffuse through the placenta and provide naturally acquired passive immunity to the infant during the crucial first few months of life.
