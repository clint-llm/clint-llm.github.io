The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Peripheral Nerve Program (WRNMMCPNP) was established to address PNIs and their associated complications. The team consists of mental health providers, pain physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, neurologists/clinical neurophysiologists, neurosurgeons, physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, plastic surgeons, and orthopedic hand surgeons.

The purpose is to maximize efficiency and eliminate fragmented care by providing a tumor board-like review of patient cases and a monthly comprehensive clinic during which providers from the aforementioned disciplines are available. This program has enabled the institution to serve a large volume of patients, maintain dynamic training programs, and produce PNI-related research.

The major concerns of this organization are mismanaged patients and delays in the intervention for PNIs. It is well-documented that delays relate to worse functional outcomes for patients. Therefore, WRNMMCPNP offers a telemedicine option to their patients to provide a direct route to PNI providers. Additionally, consolidation of PNI resources facilitates a faster response to injuries and rapid communication amongst involved healthcare providers, thereby prioritizing patient safety and outcomes.
