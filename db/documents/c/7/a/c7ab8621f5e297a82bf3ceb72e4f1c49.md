Although vascular Doppler color flow imaging is generally a noninvasive imaging modality, an interdisciplinary team should share the responsibility of minimizing risks of infection, not only to the patient but also to other staff members. The ultrasound probes and machines used in color flow imaging should be sanitized and cleaned after every use to minimize this risk. Modern ultrasound technologies have allowed operators to introduce the probes into the body for tests such as transesophageal echocardiography. The ultrasound probe is introduced into the esophagus and is oriented toward the heart to obtain a closer and more accurate image. While this technique offers a better view of the heart and its internal structures, it is associated with risks that include esophageal damage, oxygen desaturation, and induction of tachyarrhythmias.
