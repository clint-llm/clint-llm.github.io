Preparation for insertion of an NPA involves 2 steps. First, the healthcare provider obtains the correct size NPA, and second, the provider coats the NPA with lubricant, anesthetic jelly, or any water-soluble lubricant.

In the ideal setting preparation for NT intubation can include all of the below-mentioned steps, but if the procedure is needed to be done emergently, the healthcare provider may be unable to prepare anything and may have to blindly insert the NT tube when that is the indicated route of securing the airway.

Preparatory steps, not necessarily in the below order, include:

- Positioning the patient in the sniffing position, attaching the patient to the monitor, pulse oximetry, blood pressure monitor and cardiac monitor. If available, set up end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor (capnography)

- Placing 2 peripheral intravenous (IV) accesses and starting 1 liter of crystalloid fluid (if the patient is not fluid overloaded or at risk of overload)

- Preoxygenation via nasal cannula, non-rebreather, BVM, BIPAP, in order to increase the oxygen reserve and the time to desaturation after a sedative and/or paralytic medication has been given.

- Having a BVM ready bedside

- Turning on wall suction, setting up the suction tubing and a yanker

- Having a respiratory therapist or other personnel prepared with a ventilator

- Preparing sedative and paralytic medications if plan on sedating and/or paralyzing

- Having a CO2 detector, EtCO2

- Setting up the backup airway

- Setting aside 6 to 7.5 cm NT tubes and checking the cuff of the tubes for an air leak

- If using flexible bronchoscopy, having the bronchoscope turned on and placed at bedside

- Placing the NT tube in warm sterile saline to allow the tube to soften and allow for a smoother insertion; this can decrease the risk for trauma to the nasal passageways.

- Assessing for the more patent nostril, which can be done by asking the patient to hold one nostril and take in a deep breath, identifying which naris allows for more air movement. It can also be assessed by placing an NPA and judging which naris allows for easier insertion. If the provider will be utilizing a flexible bronchoscopy, then the scope can be used to visualize which nostril is more patent.

- Lubricating the tube and bronchoscope with lubricant or lidocaine jelly/ointment. Care should be used to avoid smudging the camera of the bronchoscope.

- Spraying a topical vasoconstrictor in bilateral nares to reduce bleeding risk

- Placing an NPA coated with lidocaine jelly/ointment to provide anesthesia and lubrication

- Spraying aerosolized lidocaine in the oropharynx

- Performing serial dilations of the bilateral nares or more patent nares with increasing larger diameter NPAs coated with lidocaine or lubricant
