- A thorough history and physical exam is vital to diagnosis and treatment

- The triad of anticonvulsants toxicity is central nervous system depression, nystagmus, and ataxia.

- Many agents are fairly benign in the setting of toxicity, but severe toxicity may be associated with seizure, coma & death.

- Benzodiazepines are the primary treatment for seizures in the setting of antiepileptic toxicity.

- Some anticonvulsants can cause seizures and dysrhythmias in overdose, including carbamazepine and lamotrigine, and serial ECGs are indicated to monitor for associated QRS prolongation, and sodium bicarbonate should be administered for QRS greater than 100 ms.

- It is essential to consider the metabolic profile of antiepileptic agents and how they interact with other medications.

- Activated charcoal is sometimes an effective therapy for an acute overdose on anticonvulsants

- L-carnitine is recommended for valproic acid toxicity associated with encephalopathy, hyperammonemia or hepatotoxicity.

- Hemodialysis is recommended in valproic acid toxicity at a serum concentration of greater than 850 mg/L
