Auditory brainstem response helps diagnose suspected neurologic abnormalities of the 8th cranial nerve as well as the associated auditory pathways and the estimation of hearing sensitivity for those who are not able to accurately provide behavioral hearing evaluation information. It is essential in the diagnosis of hearing loss, acoustic tumors, and cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumors. This activity reviews the evaluation of hearing loss in patients who cannot undergo conventional audiometry and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of auditory brainstem response testing.
- Describe the technique of auditory brainstem response testing.
- Review the potential complications of auditory brainstem response testing.
