Historically, DWM was believed to be caused by atresia of the Luschka and Magendie foramina, leading to enlargement of the fourth ventricle and vermian hypoplasia. However, recent evidence suggests that DWM results from developmental abnormalities affecting the roof of the rhombencephalon, leading to variable degrees of vermian hypoplasia and cystic enlargement. This complex malformation may initiate by two different pathophysiological mechanisms: the arrest of vermian development, and failure of fourth ventricle foramina fenestration leading to an enlarged Blake’s pouch and causing compression of the vermis.

DWM may be isolated or associated with chromosomal abnormalities, Mendelian disorders, syndromic malformations, congenital infections, and various other comorbidities.

Rare mutations have been described in some genes including FOXC1, FGF17, LAMC1, NID1, ZIC1, and ZIC4.
