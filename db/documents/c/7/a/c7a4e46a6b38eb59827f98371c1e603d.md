Prevention and immediate treatment prevent mortality and reduce morbidity from OTC deficiency. The diagnosing physician should refer an OTCD patient and his/her family to a biochemical geneticist as they will need genetic counseling. OTCD patients should reduce their dietary protein and maintain adequate hydration. Certain medications should be avoided, such as steroids that increase protein breakdown into nitrogenous waste. OTCD patients should not take valproic acid even if they have seizures since valproic acid inhibits the urea cycle. These considerations will prevent the buildup of ammonia and reduce OTCD complications.
