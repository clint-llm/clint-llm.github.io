The pectoral nerves may be injured by direct trauma, muscle compression, and iatrogenic scenarios such as breast surgery and axillary node dissection. The nerve can also be injured in pectoralis major muscle transfers, but surgical recovery is possible through nerve transfers. The surgical approach to the medial pectoral nerve is from either the supraclavicular or the infraclavicular route at the level of the medial cord. Its surgical accessibility, expandability, and a high number of motor fibers make it an attractive donor nerve for upper plexus injuries.

As mentioned previously, the medial pectoral nerve mostly courses through the pectoralis minor muscle, whereas other times, it exits around the lateral aspect of this muscle. If a surgeon dissects between the pectoralis major and minor muscles, a portion of the innervation to the pectoralis major muscle is at risk of disruption.
