**Postoperative complications include:**

- Distention fluid overload

- Infection

- Uterine trauma: includingÂ lacerations to the cervix, perforation of the uterus. With uterine perforation, there is the risk of injury to surrounding organs/structures or rarely fistualization

- Lower tract thermal injury: burns of the cervix, vagina, and vulva

- Pregnancy-related complications including premature birth, abnormal placentation, intrauterine growth restriction, malpresentation, and perinatal mortality

- Obstructed hematometra leading to cyclic pain due to residual endometrium

- Post ablation tubal sterilization syndrome is seen in patients who had a prior bilateral tubal ligation and endometrial ablation. This syndrome is cyclic pelvic pain due to endometrial regrowth and distension of the uterine cornua with blocked fallopian tubes.

- Patient dissatisfaction with resulting menstrual bleeding

- Subsequent difficulty evaluating the endometrium due to scarring and changes seen on imaging after ablation can lead to missed or delayed diagnosis of uterine carcinoma.

- Reoperation with definitive hysterectomy within 5 years due to bleeding and/or pain
