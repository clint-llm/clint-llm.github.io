There are several ways to perform a BKA, one of the most significant differences being guillotine versus completed amputation. Moreover, several designs for skin flaps have been introduced to cover the amputation stump. A long posterior skin flap and unequal (skewed) anterior and posterior muscle and skin (myocutaneous) flaps have been widely used.

**Guillotine amputation**is performed quickly to control infection or blood loss or when completing a near-total amputation of a mangled extremity at the bedside. This can be effective when tissue planes must demarcate over hours or days, with serial debridements taking place before closure can be performed. In contrast, where time and tissue allow, a completed amputation involves all steps outlined below, resulting in a closed, sutured stump ready to apply a stump shrinker and prosthesis planning.

Once the patient is prepped and draped, the tibial tubercle and joint line are marked, with the BKA incision marked distally, typically 10 to 15 cm from the tibial tubercle. An anterior skin flap is drawn to include the anterior two-thirds of the leg, while the posterior flap is drawn 150% longer than the anterior flap to allow ample soft tissue for closure. The tourniquet is inflated. A skin incision is made down to the fascia circumferentially. The fascia is incised, and the muscles are carefully divided into the tibia and fibula.

The tibial and deep and superficial peroneal nerves are identified within their respective neurovascular bundles. Each nerve is injected with 1% lidocaine (optional), placed under gentle traction, and sharply divided with a fresh scalpel blade. This allows for nerve retraction, avoiding the development of a painful neuroma distally at the BKA stump. Each major artery, including the anterior and posterior tibial, is identified and ligated with a silk tie.

The tibial and fibular shafts are cut with an oscillating saw, and the corners are beveled with a rongeur or saw. A small hole is placed with a drill in the distal tibial shaft; the gastrocnemius aponeurosis is secured via a nonabsorbable suture.

In the**"Ertl" technique**, a subperiosteal exposure of the bony portion of the tibia and fibula should be performed, with the canal opened to ensure continuity of the medullary canal. The periosteal sleeve with chips of attached cortical bones should be fashioned to enclose the distal bone ends and filled with bone graft. Synostosis is created between the distal tibia and fibula to create a solid weight-bearing surface for improved prosthetic function. The tibiofibular bone bridge provides a degree of weight bearing.

The tourniquet is released, and adequate hemostasis is obtained through a cautery or ligation of major bleeding vessels. A drain is placed in the wound, and the fascia is approximated, followed by the subcutaneous tissue and, finally, the skin. This may be sutured or stapled based on surgeon preference.

The stump is dressed with a sterile dressing and placed into a well-padded splint or knee immobilizer. This will protect healing soft tissue and prevent the development of early flexion contracture at the knee, limiting postoperative mobility with a prosthesis.

In the immediate postoperative setting, the limb stump should be serially examined every 24 to 48 hours for necrosis of the skin edges, bleeding, and signs of infection. Any drains should be removed once there is sufficiently minimal drainage according to surgeon preference. Once the wound is healing well, a stump shrinker may be placed, providing circumferential compression around the stump and distal extremity. A prosthetics company should be contacted with a formal patient evaluation, and the provisional prosthetic should be chosen. Ultimately, there are many forms of prosthetics for lower limbs, and patient preference, condition, and insurance, among other factors, will dictate which prosthetic is the best long-term option.
