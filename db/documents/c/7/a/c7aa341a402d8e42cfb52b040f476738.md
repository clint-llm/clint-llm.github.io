The classic clinical presentation of a patient with vesicovaginal fistula is continuous urinary incontinence after recent pelvic surgery. The severity of symptomology and timing of presentation is variable. Postoperative patients with a vesicovaginal fistula are usually easily diagnosed by the complaint of urine leaking through the vagina 7 to 12 days after gynecological or pelvic surgery. The diagnosis of a vesicovaginal fistula can be made in an outpatient clinical setting. Once the diagnosis of vesicovaginal fistula has been established, a comprehensive diagnostic workup should be pursued as to not overlook a concomitant ureteral injury or other fistulae.

While a pelvic surgeon (gynecologist, urologist, or urogynecologist) is almost always involved in caring for a patient with a vesicovaginal fistula, an entire interprofessional team of specialists is required for a successful repair. This team often includes nurses, obstetricians, pharmacists, radiologists, and anesthesiologists.

Despite an optimistic prognosis for patients receiving proper treatment, efforts should be focused on the prevention of vesicovaginal formation. This includes prioritizing women’s reproductive health, emergency obstetric services, and properly trained pelvic surgeons in the global medical community. An effort should also be made to educate the general public on the prevalence and prevention of this devastating problem.
