Meckel's Diverticula can present with signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction. But can also present as painless rectal bleeding, or rectal bleeding with peritonitis. Commonly presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, fever, and bloody stools.

Multiple imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of Meckel's diverticula like an abdominal ultrasound, abdominal X-ray, abdominal angiography, abdominopelvic CT, and magnetic resonance imaging,Â have lower sensitivity and specificity when compared with the Meckel's Scan.

Meckel's Scan with 99mTc-pertechnetate can detect the Meckel's Diverticula, by the physiological advantages of the secretion of the radiopharmaceutical by the gastric tissues like the ectopic gastric tissues found in Meckel's diverticula, when used correctly, is an effective method for the detection of Meckel diverticulum with an approximately 100% sensitivity and specificity.

Symptomatic Meckel's treatment is resection, either laparoscopically or by open surgery.

Complications following resection can occur, with wound infections being the most common complication, followed by postoperative ileus.
