The diagnosis of mesenteric venous ischemia is not simple, and thus it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes ICU nurses. Once the diagnosis is made by imaging studies, the treatment today in patients without peritoneal signs is anticoagulation. Some experts advocate thrombolysis and angioplasty. However, if the patient has an acute abdomen with peritoneal signs, then there should be no delay in exploration.

The outcomes for these patients are guarded as many are old and have numerous other co-morbidities.
