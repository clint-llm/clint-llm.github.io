The abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis receive their blood supply from the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. This artery branches from the radial artery immediately proximal to the flexor retinaculum. It then runs superficial to the flexor retinaculum as it travels distally to supply the thenar eminence. Later, it anastomoses with the superficial palmar arch, the terminal branch of the ulnar artery.
