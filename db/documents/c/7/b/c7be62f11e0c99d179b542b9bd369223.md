Dopamine agonists (DA) are drugs used in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders. The ergoline (e.g., bromocriptine) and non-ergoline dopamine agonist (ropinirole) are very useful in treating Parkinson disease. Ropinirole is one of the US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications indicated for treating restless legs syndrome (RLS) and Parkinson's disease. Pharmacologically, it acts by selectively binding to the D2 receptors. It effectively treats both early and advanced-stage Parkinson disease and can improve the "on" time and minimize the "off" time of the disease. It is also helpful in the management of sleep disturbances and nocturnal psychosis associated with Parkinson disease.

**Parkinson Disease (PD)**

Parkinson's disease is a condition characterized by the loss of dopamine receptors in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to both cognitive and motor decline. The slow movement, stiff joints, and tremors are characteristic features of this disease.

**Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS)**

RLS is also known as Willis-Ekbom disease. It is the uncontrollable urge to move the legs following a sensation commonly described as burning, painful or tingling.
