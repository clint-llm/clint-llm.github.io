The main component to focus on assessment are:

- **History**- handedness, occupation, time of injury, place of injury (work-related)

- **Mechanism of injury**- magnitude, direction, point of contact, and type of force that caused the trauma

- 
**Soft tissue damage**

- **Finger alignment**- cascade, digit scissoring, rotational defect

- 
**Open vs. Closed**

- **Tendon/nerve/vessel damage**- tendon ruptures may accompany dislocations such as the terminal extensor tendon rupture in the distal interphalangeal joint dislocation or a central slip rupture in a proximal interphalangeal joint dislocation. Tendon damage otherwise only usually occurs with associated lacerations or open combined injuries. Nerves and vessels are rarely injured as part of a simple fracture or dislocation but often suffer injury in major open hand trauma.
