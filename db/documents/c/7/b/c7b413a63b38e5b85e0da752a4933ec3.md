Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis(LC), also known as "leptomeningeal metastasis" or "carcinomatosis meningitis," is involvement by cancer of the pia and arachnoid mater of the brain with the subarachnoid space in between. It was first described in the late 19th century, and many studies have been carried out on the subject in recent years. Studies have shown that both solid tumors, including brain tumors and hematological cancers, can metastasize to involve the leptomeninges. It is an uncommon and late complication seen in 5% to 8% of cases of solid tumors and 5% to 15% of cases of hematological cancers.Â Additionally, it implies a poor prognosis and limited treatment options.
