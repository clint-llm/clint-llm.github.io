Empyema of the gallbladder may present with symptoms indistinguishableÂ from acute cholecystitis. A high index of suspicion and a combination of clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters helps in early diagnosis. Early and prompt surgical intervention in the form of cholecystectomy, if not feasible, cholecystostomy prevents high morbidity and rare mortality.
