Postpartum depression has repercussions beyond physical harm to the child. Data reveal that the condition also affects mother-infant bonding. Often the child is treated inappropriately with a very negative attitude. This can have a significant impact on the growth and development of the child. Children born to mothers with postpartum depression have been found to exhibit marked changes in behavior, altered cognitive development, and early onset of depressive illness. More important, these children are often obese and have dysfunction in social interactions.
