There are generally accepted contraindications to performing field intubation. Absolute contraindications are hard to define, but if the procedure cannot be completed in a manner that is reasonably safe for both the provider and the patient, field intubation should not be attempted.

Field intubation should also never be used in a punitive manner.Â  Patients that are intoxicated or uncooperative and have no other medical need for urgent airway control should not be intubated.

The time required for arrival to care can be another relative contraindication to field intubation.
