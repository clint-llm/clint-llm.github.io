The sensation of itch is thought to be a complex process involving sensitive neurons and adjacent cellular mechanisms that modulate it. Dysregulation of this process leads to aberrant firing of itch-transmitting nerve fibers without a typical itch-provoking physical stimulus, a disorder known as alloknesis.
