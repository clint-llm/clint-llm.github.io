Lipomas are common, benign subcutaneous tumors of fat cells (adipocytes) that present as soft, painless nodules that are most commonly seen on the trunk. They are benign and have many histologic subtypes. The presence of multiple lipomas may be the presenting feature of a variety of syndromes. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of lipomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology and histopathology of lipomas.
- Describe the presentation of lipomas on physical examination.
- Summarize the various differential diagnoses for lipoma.
- Explain strategies to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by lipomas.
