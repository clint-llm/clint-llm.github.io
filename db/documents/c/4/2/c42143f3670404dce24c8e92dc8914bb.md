Due to the complexity of this condition, management of neutrophilia-associated conditions requires an interprofessional team of health care professionals, including hospital physicians, primary care physicians, specialists including infectious disease specialists, hematologists/oncologists, pediatricians, microbiologists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists working together collaboratively to enhance patient-centered care and improve outcomes. Specialists should recommend treatment options, including antimicrobials, cytoreductive therapies, leucopheresis, immunotherapy, and HCT. Pharmacists should review the indication, dosage, interactions, and contraindications of medications. Nurses taking care of these patients should monitor signs and symptoms associated with neutrophilia-related conditions and report emergent concerns to hospitalists and specialists. Thus, the morbidity and mortality related to neutrophilia-related conditions can be lowered through an interprofessional team approach. [Level 5]
