Inadequate postoperative pain control may result in adverse physiologic effects in the acute postoperative setting and increases the likelihood of developing a chronic pain syndrome. A patient’s health and well-being may further suffer as a consequence of chronic pain. Having an understanding of the pathophysiology of pain, pain reduction strategies, level of invasiveness of the procedures performed, and individual patient comorbidities and social factors can help a physician develop an optimal pain management plan that reduces the risk of these worse outcomes.

While opioid analgesic therapy continues to play a substantial role in the management of postoperative pain, the rise in injury and death due to opioid overdose among the general population warrants careful consideration of a patient’s susceptibility to the development of a substance use disorder or medication misuse before prescribing opioid therapy. Also, patients should receive information on safe storage practices and proper disposal methods of their medication upon discharge home.

A multimodal approach and individualized plan for managing postoperative pain should be emphasized to help reduce opioid demand while optimizing pain relief.
