# Continuing Education Activity

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal fistulas between arteries and veins without an intervening capillary bed. High arterial flow directly into venous structures can lead to disruption of the venous walls and ultimately cause fatal hemorrhage. Intracranial AVMs are most commonly diagnosed during work-up for an acute intracerebral hemorrhage but are also often found incidentally during evaluation of conditions such chronic headaches and seizures. The most well-known classification system to describe them is the Spetzler-Martin grading scale.This system, initially described in 1986, uses the AVMs size, location in the eloquent or non-eloquent cortex, and description of either superficial or deep venous drainage to estimate surgical risk. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of AVMS and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the patophysiology of arteriovenous malformations.
- Describe the typical patient presentation of an arteriovenous malformation.
- Outline the management options available for arteriovenous malformations
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with arteriovenous malformations.

# Introduction

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal fistulas between arteries and veins without an intervening capillary bed. High arterial flow directly into venous structures can lead to disruption of the venous walls and ultimately cause fatal hemorrhage.

Cerebral AVMs are heterogeneous entities that differ significantly in size, location, feeding, and draining vessels. The most well-known classification system to describe them is the Spetzler-Martin grading scale.

# Etiology

Animal and human studies of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)have implicated abnormalities in vessel wall thickness, lack of tight junctions and endothelial continuity, and splitting of the elastic lamina.

Cerebral AVMs are seen both in sporadic cases as well as in genetic syndromes. Concerning genetic associations, studies on syndromic cases have yielded valuable insight. For example, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, the most common syndrome linked with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, has correlated with the insufficiency of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling genes such as SMAD4 and ENG.

Several studies have examined the role of overexpression of genes involving vasculogenesis such as VEGF, angiopoietin-2, Notch4, and MMP-9 in the development and a predisposition to rupture of cerebral AVMs.

# Epidemiology

A systematic literature review by Abecassis and colleagues found the incidence of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) ranging from 1.12 to 1.42 cases per 100,000 person-years.

Risk factors associated with a higher risk of AVM rupture include prior hemorrhage, deep AVM location, exclusively deep venous drainage, and associated aneurysms.

When deep location, deep venous drainage, and prior hemorrhage are all present, a study by Stapf and colleagues reported an annual rupture rate as high as 35.5%.

# Pathophysiology

While arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were traditionally thought to represent congenital lesions resulting from disordered embryogenesis, other studies have supported the notion that they can also develop postnatally.

# Histopathology

Histopathological examination shows thin- and thick-walled channels connecting arteries and veins without intervening capillary beds. Typically, there is also no intervening normal brain tissue.

# History and Physical

The most frequent presentation of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is a hemorrhage. Other forms of presentation include headache, seizures, bruit, and neurologic deficits (related to local mass effect or ischemia from steal phenomenon).

Following the identification of an AVM, a thorough history and neurologic exam are imperative to determine further workup and treatment for these patients. Age, medical comorbidities, and use of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications are essential parts of determining surgical candidacy. In patients presenting with hemorrhage, it is important to also assess for risk factors of related aneurysms (smoking history, family history). History and physical exam may also provide insight as to associated syndromes such as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.

# Evaluation

Aside from a thorough history and physical exam, appropriate imaging studies are also essential in the management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Most patients have a computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to evaluate hemorrhage, ischemia, and anatomy. The most important study for pre-operative evaluation is a catheter angiogram to elucidate anatomy and hemodynamics.

# Treatment / Management

The primary treatment modalities for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) include surgical resection, endovascular embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (considered for small lesions < 3 cm), or a combination of the above.

For unruptured brain AVMs, the ARUBA trial compared medical management alone to medical management along with prophylactic intervention (surgical, endovascular, radiosurgical, or a combination). Out of a total of 223 patients with a mean follow-up of 33.3 months, the primary endpoint of death from any cause or stroke occurred in 11 of 109 (10.1%) patients in the medical group compared with 35 of 114 (30.7%) in the interventional group. These data led to the discontinuation of the study after six years.

In any case, for patients diagnosed with AVMs of the central nervous system (CNS), prompt neurosurgical consultation, and subsequent discussion of treatment options with the patient and family are essential components of the treatment decision-making process.

# Differential Diagnosis

Other vascular malformations seen in the CNS include cavernous malformations, capillary telangiectasias, and developmental venous anomalies.

# Radiation Oncology

Stereotactic radiosurgery is an option for select AVMs, particularly those with a nidus < 3 cm in diameter and for deep AVMs. Potential advantages include the ability to be performed as an outpatient, non-invasive approach, and no recovery period. Disadvantages include a 1- to 3-year latency period between radiosurgery and actual ablation of the lesion, during which time the risk of hemorrhage remains.

The Pittsburgh radiosurgery-based arteriovenous malformation-grading scale was developed to predict outcomes after radiosurgery.

# Consultations

Neurosurgical consultation is an essential part of management and treatment of arteriovenous malformations of the CNS.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Neurosurgical consultation is a crucial part of the work-up and management of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the CNS.

Overall, medical condition, age, vascular anatomy, associated cerebral aneurysms, history of hemorrhage, and other risk factors all merit consideration during clinical decision-making. Risks and benefits of available treatment options (sole medical management, radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, surgical resection, or a combination of interventions) are unique to each patient and AVM and require discussion on a case-by-case basis. Clinicians and nurses need to work together to educate patients and their families regarding the management of potentially life-threatening diseases.
