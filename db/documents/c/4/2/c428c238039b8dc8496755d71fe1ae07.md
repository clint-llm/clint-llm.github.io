Diagnosis of HSIL on cytology requires specific criteria to be met. The cells are smaller with less cytoplasmic maturity than that of LSIL.  Occasionally, the cytoplasm may be densely keratinized.  HSIL cells occur singly as well as in sheets or syncytial aggregates.  Though the size of the nucleus itself is variable, the cells must have a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio.  The nuclei are often hyperchromatic but can be normo- to hyperchromatic. The chromatin can range from evenly distributed and fine to coarsely granular. Nuclear contours must be distinctly irregular with prominent indentations and/or grooves. Nucleoli are usually not a feature of HSIL, though may be seen when HSIL involves the endocervical glands.

Histologic criteria for HSIL exceeds the extent and degree of nuclear atypia allowed for a diagnosis of LSIL and includes less maturation, a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, decreased organization from the lower immature cell layers to the superficial mature layers (loss of polarity), a greater degree of nuclear pleomorphism, highly irregular nuclear contours, increased mitotic index and abnormal mitotic figures, especially within more superficial layers of the epithelium.  CIN3 must have full thickness atypia.  When faced with not-so-straight-forward biopsies where the pathologist is debating between benign mimics of HSIL, such as immature metaplasia or atypical atrophy, utilizing the biomarker p16 may help distinguish them, as p16 shows intense and continuous staining in HSILs and suggests infection with a high-risk HPV type.
