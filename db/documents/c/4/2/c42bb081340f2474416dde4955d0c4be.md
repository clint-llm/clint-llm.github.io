Acute beryllium diseaseÂ presents similar to other cases of chemical pneumonitis, and symptoms depend on the compound's solubility.

Sensitization (not acute toxicity) precedes the development of CBD, and of those sensitized, 31% progressed to chronic beryllium disease.

Inhalation of beryllium salts disrupts the capillary-alveolar membrane and causes epithelial cell membrane disruption, presenting an opportunity for antigen and antigen-presenting-cell (APC) interaction.

Research has shown that macrophages attracted to the site of inflammation can phagocytose beryllium, which will lead to lymphocyte proliferation.

Because of this genetic predisposition, there is no classical dose-response relationship between the level of beryllium exposure and the severity of symptoms or disease progression.
