Nicotine is an amine found in tobacco and tobacco products. It is the addictive agent which confers a much lower risk than other elements of tobacco, but it is not completely benign. When tobacco smoke is inhaled, nicotine rapidly enters the bloodstream through the pulmonary circulation. Inhaled nicotine escapes the first pass intestinal and liver metabolism. Nicotine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier which then promptly diffuses into the brain tissue. The process is said to take only 2 to 8 seconds from the time of inhalation. Nicotine is a selective binder to nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) in the brain and other tissues. The half-life of nicotine in the human body is estimated to be around 2 hours from the time of consumption.

Brain imaging studies have demonstrated that nicotine acutely increases activity in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and visual system consistent with activation of corticobasal ganglia and thalamic brain circuits. Nicotine which stimulates nAChRs produces the release of neurotransmitters, predominantly dopamine but also norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and endorphins. These neurotransmitters cause the various responses and behaviors after nicotine intake. When there is repeated exposure to nicotine, tolerance develops to some of the physiological effects of nicotine. Nicotine is a sympathomimetic drug that causes the release of catecholamines and increases heart rate, cardiac contractility, constricts cutaneous and coronary blood vessels and increases blood pressure.

Nicotine undergoes metabolism in the liver, primarily by the liver enzyme CYP2A6, and converts nicotine to cotinine. Cotinine is a metabolite that can be used as a marker for exposure to nicotine. There are broad individual and racial variations in the rate of nicotine metabolism due to genetic polymorphism in CYP2A6. Thus the metabolism of nicotine is faster in Caucasians than Asians and Africans. Sex hormones also significantly affect CYP2A6 activity, and females metabolize nicotine faster than males.
