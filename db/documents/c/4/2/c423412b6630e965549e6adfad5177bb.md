Although a rare condition, peliosis hepatis has known, well-documented associations with other disease states. In a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of peliosis hepatis, steps should take place to identify and remove the cause. The management of a patient with peliosis hepatis often involves an interprofessional team of providers, including a hepatologist, general surgeon, interventional radiologist, and gastroenterologist. The condition, which can present itself at any point in life, can result in liver, kidney, intestinal, or pulmonary issues. Given the rarity of the condition and the fact that clinicians so seldom uncover it, it is hard to gauge the natural history and course of the disease truly. However, current thought is that the majority of the patients continue living their lives without ever knowing of their condition.
