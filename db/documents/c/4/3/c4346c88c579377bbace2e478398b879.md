Pyogenic granuloma may be seen in patients of all ages. Conflicting reports exist on the epidemiologic pattern of disease.

In one review, the incidence peaked in the second decade of life, and the lesion showed a slight male preponderance in certain studies.

In another review, the ratio of males to females was 1Â to 1.2.

In a pediatric study, the average age at diagnosis was 6 to 10 years, with a male preponderance.
