The exact pathophysiology of hemorrhoids remains poorly understood and is believed to be multifactorial. Hemorrhoids correlate with pathologic conditions that result in increased intra-abdominal pressure such as in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), patients who chronically strain from an enlarged prostate or urethral stricture, patients with a space-occupying intraabdominal lesion like an ovarian tumor or a large rectosigmoid carcinoma, in patients with ascites, and during pregnancy. These conditions lead to symptomatic hemorrhoids by causing a decrease in the venous return from the hemorrhoidal veins which leads to a pathologic increase in the size of the vascular cushions. Also, diets low in fiber lead to hard stools and increased straining - the hard stool causes local tissue trauma which induces bleeding. In addition, the fibers of Treitzâ€™s muscle, which normally support hemorrhoids, can become attenuated and less supportive with age and this can lead to prolapse of hemorrhoids; this explains why the elderly are more prone to hemorrhoidal symptoms.
