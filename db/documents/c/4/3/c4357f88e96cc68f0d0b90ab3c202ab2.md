The management of hyperlipidemia is an essential aspect of healthcare, given the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with it. Interprofessional communication and communication with the patient from all members of the patient’s health care team is vital to help decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Physicians and pharmacists can work together to determine which medications will best help a patient in the setting of their known comorbidities. As a group, clinicians (including NPs and PAs), pharmacists, and nursing staff can relay information regarding the risks associated with hyperlipidemia and the importance of medication compliance. Medication compliance may improve if patients are aware of the long-term benefits of statin use. Pharmacists can also further provide information regarding side effects. Such information from a reliable source may help reduce the fear associated with statin use and improve medication compliance.

Follow-up visits with a physician may increase medication compliance as well, given that it provides an opportunity for patients to learn more about hyperlipidemia and its management.
