The clinical features of SSADH deficiency are often non-specific and variable. SSADH deficiency typically presents in late infantile period and early childhood but may be diagnosed occasionally in adulthood. The disorder often has a slowly progressive or static course. The clinical features are characterized by developmental delay and later intellectual impairment, with prominent expressive language delays, hypotonia, ataxia, movement disorder, and seizures.

Neuropsychiatric features: Prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, especially in the older age group, and are disabling. These include irritability, easy agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, disabling obsessive-compulsive disorder, inattention, hyperactive behavior, and autistic-like behavior.

Seizures are seen in approximately 50% of patients. Generalized seizures are commonly seen, of which generalized tonic-clonic seizures predominate, followed by myoclonic seizures and atypical absences.

Sleep disorders are common and increasingly seen as age advances. Excessive day time somnolence and other disorders of initiating or maintaining sleep have been reported.

Episodic deterioration or encephalopathy is generally not seen asÂ it is in other metabolic disorders. However, a rare presentation with a metabolic stroke following diarrheal illness has been reported.
