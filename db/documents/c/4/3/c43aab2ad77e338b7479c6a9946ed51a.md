Patients with uncomplicated cystitis typically have an improvement in symptoms within three days after initiation of antibiotic therapy. Recurrent cystitis occurs in 25% of women within six months after their first UTI, and the rate increases in women with more than one prior UTI. Complications are rare, especially in patients who are appropriately treated. Bacteremia and sepsis from uncomplicated cystitis are uncommon.

Emphysematous cystitis is a rare but serious complication of a lower urinary tract infection. It is associated with gas formation in the bladder wall and is potentially fatal if not properly managed. Emphysematous cystitis is more likely to cause abdominal pain (80%) than simple cystitis (50%); pneumaturia will likely be present in about 70% of patients, and half will have bacteremia. The diagnosis is most reliably made with a CT scan. The primary risk factor is diabetes which is present in about 2/3 of affected patients. Other risk factors include female gender, immunocompromised conditions, urinary abnormalities, urinary obstruction or retention, indwelling urinary catheter, age over 60, and chronic UTIs.

Treatment is primarily medical with antibiotics, but catheter drainage should be used in cases of retention, incomplete bladder emptying, or significant hematuria. About 10% of patients will develop a necrotizing infection of the bladder wall and will require surgical intervention involving partial or complete resection.
