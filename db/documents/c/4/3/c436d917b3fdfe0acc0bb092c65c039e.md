99mTc-methylene diphosphonate complexes used in bone scintigraphy bind to the hydroxyapatite crystal in bone and quickly clear from soft tissue.

Normal findings on bone scintigraphy include uniform uptake throughout the bony skeleton. Intense uptake at the kidneys and bladder (due to urinary excretion), sacroiliac joints, nasopharynx, sternum, and joint surfaces is also considered normal. Increased uptake will also be seen at the physes of skeletally immature individuals due to increased osteoblast activity.

Gallium-67 citrate binds to transferrin in the plasma resulting in increased concentrations in areas of inflammation and increased local perfusion. In infection, increased concentrations of lactoferrin secreted from leukocytes bind Ga-67 at the inflammatory foci. Bacteria also produce Siderophores which bind Ga-67 and are transported into the bacterium.

Uptake of Indium-111 and 99mTc-exametazime labeled leukocytes is dependent on several prerequisites, including intact chemotaxis mechanism, an adequate number of labeled cells, and a baseline leukocyte count of at least 2000/microliter. The sensitivity of these tests is higher in neutrophil-mediated infections. Labeled leukocytes accumulate in the bone marrow due to phagocytosis by macrophages, and distribution within the marrow can be affected by age, fractures, hardware, or neoplasm.
