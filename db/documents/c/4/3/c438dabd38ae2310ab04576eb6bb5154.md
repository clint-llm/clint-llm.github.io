Use of ginkgo in patients with bleeding disorders or those who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antiplatelet, or anticoagulant therapies requires caution. A case report described spontaneous bleeding from the iris into the anterior chamber of the eye in an elderly patient who took both aspirin and ginkgo.

There has been insufficient evidence about the perioperative risk of ginkgo use. One study recommended physicians to discontinue ginkgo at least 36 hours before a planned surgical procedure.

There has been no existing data on the safety and efficacy of ginkgo in pregnant women, nursing mothers, or infants, so recommendations are against ginkgo use in these populations.

In epileptic patients or in patients who are prone to seizure, physicians should also be cautious with the administration of ginkgo as ginkgo toxin, mostly found in ginkgo seeds but still present in ginkgo leaves, could lower the seizure threshold.
