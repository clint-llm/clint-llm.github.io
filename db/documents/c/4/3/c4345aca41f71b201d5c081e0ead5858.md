Lipids are circulating as lipoproteins, consisting of unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and protein. There are five major lipoproteins in blood: (1) chylomicrons; (2) very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL); (3) intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL); (4) low-density lipoprotein (LDL); and (5) high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Each of these classes of lipoproteins transports cholesterol and triglyceride to its designated destinations.

The level of cholesterol plays a vital role in cardiovascular diseases process. A high level of lipids, including cholesterol and triglycerides in the serum, which also termed as hyperlipidemia, leads to a higher risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinically, obtaining a lipid profile assists in the screening, diagnosing, and managing diseases. Here, we will discuss the indications for testing, the role of lipid profiles, and the relevant health care issues. Generally, a lipid profile or lipid panel consists of the following,

- Total cholesterol

- High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol

- Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol

- Triglycerides
