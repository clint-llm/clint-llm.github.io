Epiphrenic diverticulum, also known as a pulsion diverticulum, is a rare type of esophageal diverticulum occurring in the distal 10 centimeters of the esophagus, most commonly 4 to 8 centimeters above the gastric cardia. These rare diverticula are diagnosed with a barium esophagram and can be managed both non-operatively and operatively, depending on the patient's symptoms and underlying disorders. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of epiphrenic diverticula and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of epiphrenic diverticula. 
- Describe diagnostic exam findings consistent with epiphrenic diverticula. 
- Outline the management options available for epiphrenic diverticula.
- Review the importance of the interprofessional team in optimizing outcomes in patients with epiphrenic diverticula.
