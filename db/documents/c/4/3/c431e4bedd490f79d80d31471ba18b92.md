Pigmented purpuric dermatosis (PPD) is the term used to describe a collection of numerous subtypes of generally benign, chronic, purpuric skin eruptions. Clinically, they are characterized by red to purple macules and patches as well as petechiae with erythrocyte extravasation and hemosiderin deposition in the skin, which can lead to a red-brown to golden-brown color as the hemosiderin is resorbed. These lesions most commonly occur on the lower extremities but can sometimes occur on the arms as well. Pigmented purpuric dermatitis is often asymptomatic but can be associated with mild pruritus. Treatment can be challenging, but patient reassurance on the benign nature of these diseases is crucial.
