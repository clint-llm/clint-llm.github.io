Adenoidectomy is one of the most commonly performed operations in children. Pioneered in the 19th century by Hans Wilhelm Meyer, the procedure has radically evolved over the last century and a half, and now has low associated morbidity and a robust evidence base demonstrating sustained benefit postoperatively. ItÂ is primarily performed as treatment of otitis media with effusion, chronic adenoiditis, and obstructive sleep apnea in children.
