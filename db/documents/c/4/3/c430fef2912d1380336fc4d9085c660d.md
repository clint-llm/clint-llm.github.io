Current guidelines by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend universal screening for hepatitis B, syphilis, and chlamydia at the first prenatal visit, which should occur at 8-10 weeks of gestation.

Additional recommended screening for antepartum infections includes repeat testing for HIV and syphilis in the third trimester in populations at high-risk for the acquisition of these infections.

Hepatitis C screening should be done for patients with a history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992.

Infants born to HIV positive mothers or mothers with unknown HIV status should be tested for the disease using nucleic acid tests (NATs).

Chorioamnionitis is a pathologic diagnosis made by examination of the fetal membranes for a neutrophilic infiltrate.

The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women, not at risk of preterm labor.
