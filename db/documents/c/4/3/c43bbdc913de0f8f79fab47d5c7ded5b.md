Due to the risk of complications during CDT, close monitoring during thrombolytic infusion is required. Most hospitals require intensive care unit level monitoring during infusion. The patient should receive neurologic checks every hour along with regular vascular access site checks to monitor for early signs of possible complications. It is also recommended that the patient be monitored for 24Â to 48 hours after infusion for possible complications in the same manner. If any complications (i.e., signs of bleeding or an acute neurologic event) are observed or abnormalities are seen in laboratory data, a clinician should be notified immediately.
