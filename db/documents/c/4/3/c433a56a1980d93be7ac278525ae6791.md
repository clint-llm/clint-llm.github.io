Tabes dorsalis is a late manifestation of syphilis. The collaboration of an interprofessional health team is necessary to bring about better results. Infectious disease specialists, neurologists, microbiologists, radiologists, laboratory technicians, and the pathologist can work together to pinpoint the causative organism and assess the stage of the disease to make the correct diagnosis. Radiologists are also helpful in CNS imaging in the late stage of the disease, especially in the presence of gummas, which may mimic CNS tumors. Nursing care is also important in hospital-admitted patients. Pharmacists also play a role, especially in preparing the high dose penicillin for neurosyphilis. Ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, neurologists, urologists, and orthopedic specialists are important, especially to manage late complications such as optic atrophy, Argyll Robertson pupil, bladder incontinence, neuronal dysfunction, and Charcot arthropathy. Physiotherapists may be needed in patients with Charcot arthropathies.
