Hypercortisolism, when untreated, correlates with marked morbidity and is often fatal. The most common cause of death is cardiovascular events, including acute coronary syndromes, thromboembolic events, and hypertensive complications, including cerebrovascular disease. Less common but also crucial as causative factors in the mortality of these patients are opportunistic bacterial and fungal infections. Older series have indicated a mortality risk as high as 50% within five years after the development of symptoms in the absence of effective treatment. Most cases of pituitary HCM are curable, and HCM should be manageable even if it requires the most drastic strategies of bilateral adrenalectomy of mitotane therapy to achieve that goal. The underlying etiology of the HCM plays a considerable role in the ultimate prognosis with malignant lesions such as small cell lung carcinoma and adreno-cortical carcinoma having the poorest prognosis while patients with benign adrenal adenomas or benign carcinoids with EcCS have the best prognosis.

The clinical symptoms and signs of HCM take time to resolve even with curative therapy and full hormonal and metabolic correction. Resolution typically takes 2 to 12 months, and certain features like associated weight gain, hypertension, and glucose intolerance may never resolve. The loss of bone mass and/or frank osteoporosis typically begins to improve approximately six months after the HCM gets cured. In such patients, the use of calcium and vitamin supplementation, bisphosphonate therapy, and gonadal steroid repletion therapy can accelerate the recovery process. The health-related quality of life (HRQL) decline associated with HCM typically only partially resolves upon cure.

Children with HCM often have a residual decline in intelligence quotient and cognitive functional indices even after cure, and this occurs and persists in the absence of any psychopathology and even with reversal of prior noted cerebral atrophy.
