Since the advent of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) initiative, enhanced recovery protocols exist for many surgical specialties. Many studies have shown the benefits of the ERAS-based approach in improving outcomes, minimizing complications, and reducing costs. Similar protocols were developed to potentially reap these benefits for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and are now known as the Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS). This activity reviews the ERACS guidelines released by the ERAS cardiac society to help the management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS) preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative guidelines.
- Describe the types of peripheral and neuraxial nerve blocks that can be used for pain control in cardiac surgery.
- Identify the cardiovascular risk in using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as celecoxib.
- Outline the medications that can be incorporated by the interprofessional team in ERACS based protocols.
