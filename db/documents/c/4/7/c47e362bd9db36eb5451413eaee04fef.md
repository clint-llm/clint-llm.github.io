The nurse must monitor the patient undergoing breast conservation therapy postoperatively for possible adverse reactions, both immediate and long term.

Immediate monitoring focuses primarily on incision assessment. The nurse must watch for possible signs of infection, including warmth, erythema, fever, and purulent drainage. Also, the nurse should monitor for swelling as it may indicate a hematoma. The patient should receive instructions to call the office if she develops any of these symptoms.

Long term monitoring includes assessment for signs and symptoms of lymphedema through visual observation and performing arm circumference measurements.
