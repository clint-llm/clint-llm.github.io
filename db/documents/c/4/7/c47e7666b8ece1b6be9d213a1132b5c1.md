Reducing the incidence of urethral strictures would be based on trying to minimizeÂ the incidence of causative etiologies.

- Avoiding pelvic, perineal, and penile trauma.

- Educating the patients about the best and safest way to self-catheterize. Advice should include the liberal use of lubricating gel and using the smallest size catheter possible for short periods of time. Also, the least traumatic technique of catheter insertion should be taught and mastered by patients who self-catheterize.

- The practice of safe sex is of paramount importance, as gonorrhea was the most causative organism leading to strictures. The effectiveness of this intervention has already been demonstrated in the developed countries where numbers of urethral strictures secondary to gonorrheal urethritis have dropped significantly.
