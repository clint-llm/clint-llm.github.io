**Metabolism**

Carbohydrate digestion begins in the mouth, where salivary amylase starts the breakdown. After breaking down throughout the digestive system, monosaccharides are absorbed into the bloodstream. As carbohydrates are consumed, the blood sugar levels increase, stimulating the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin signals the bodyâ€™s cells to absorb glucose for energy or storage. If blood glucose falls, the pancreas makes glucagon, stimulating the liver to release stored glucose.

The body is not able to digest fiber, and therefore fiber does not provide calories or energy. It has a variety of health benefits, including bulking stool for easier excretion preventing constipation, prebiotic properties, satiety, and intestinal issues.
