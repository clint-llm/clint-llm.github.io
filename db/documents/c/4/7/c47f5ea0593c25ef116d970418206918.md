All women of reproductive age presenting with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or menstrual abnormalities should undergo a urine pregnancy test and determination of beta hCG. Pregnant patients who present with vaginal bleeding and or abdominal cramping should undergo an evaluation to exclude any life-threatening conditions. This differential includes ectopic pregnancy, which should be ruled out using ultrasound. Ultrasound is the imaging of choice when assessing these patients and can diagnose several pathologies that may lead to bleeding in early pregnancy.

Ultrasound findings will reveal a hypoechoic or anechoic crescent-shaped area behind the fetal membranes, which may also elevate the edge of the placenta.
