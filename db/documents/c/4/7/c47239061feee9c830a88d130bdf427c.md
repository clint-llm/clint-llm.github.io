In the pediatric population, one should carefully distinguish fractures of the C1 vertebra from unfused ossification centers. Three ossification centers develop in an immature atlas, one for the anterior ring and one for each posterior neural arch. These centers appear at one year of age. The connection between anterior and posterior arches is composed of neurocentral synchondrosis, which fuses at seven years of age. The posterior arch usually closes by three years of age. These unfused ossification centers can mimic fractures and should be considered whenever children under six years present with cervical spine trauma.
