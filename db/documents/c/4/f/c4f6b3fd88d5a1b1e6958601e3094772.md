The prognosis of the congenital hydrocele is excellent, while that of the adult-onset hydrocele depends on the underlying cause.

Congenital hydroceles tend to resolve spontaneously by the end of the first year of life. If persistent, they can be corrected surgically with a high success rate and a good long-term prognosis. In experienced hands, hydrocele repair carries a very low risk of testicular damage or recurrence.

The prognosis of the adult-onset hydrocele is mainly dependent on the underlying cause. For instance, filarial hydrocele's prognosis depends on its size and the severity of lymphatic obstruction.
