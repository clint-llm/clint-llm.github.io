The differential diagnosis of adrenal crisis includes most other conditions that can cause shock. The differential diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is broad. Some common differential diagnoses are discussed here.

**Sepsis**

Many features of sepsis overlap with adrenal insufficiency. The presentation includes weakness, fatigue, vomiting, hypotension, and shock. The confirmation of primary adrenal insufficiency diagnosis is made by low cortisol response to ACTH stimulation test and low ACTH level.

**Shock**(due to any cause)

Plasma cortisol level with shock suggests adrenal insufficiency.

**Chronic Fatigue Syndrome**

Chronic persisting or relapsing fatigue may mimic adrenal insufficiency. However, laboratory evaluations such as cortisol level after corticotropin stimulation differentiate it from adrenal insufficiency.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

The presentation may be similar to fever, fatigue, and myalgias may occur in both conditions. However, exudative pharyngitis is present in this condition. IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen are present.

**Hypothyroidism**

As with adrenal insufficiency, fatigue may be present in hypothyroidism. However, it is associated with weight gain. The cortisol level should differentiate both conditions.
