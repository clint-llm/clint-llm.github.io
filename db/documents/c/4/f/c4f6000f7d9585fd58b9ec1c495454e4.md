On electron microscopy, there is much more appreciation for the complex architecture of the alveoli. Type I pneumocytes are thin (<0.1 micrometers). They have a central nucleus and thin extensions of the cell membrane called leaflets that cover the capillaries. The leaflets have an apical and basal membrane and connect to adjacent cells’ leaflets via tight junctions. The cytoplasm within the leaflets contains cytoskeletal fibrils, microtubules, and membrane vesicles for transcellular transport. The fused basal laminae of the type I pneumocyte and the capillary endothelial cell can be appreciated when observed under EM.

Type II cells are large and cuboidal. They have a large central nucleus with cytoplasm containing multilamellar bodies that are the factories of the protein-surfactant. They are connected to neighboring cells by intercellular and tight junctions. Microvilli are also visible as thin projections protruding from the apical surface of these cells.

Under EM, alveolar macrophages are viewable; these contain nucleoli within a nucleus, ribosomes, Golgi bodies, mitochondria, and, importantly, lysosomes. These help the alveolar macrophages play a crucial role in supporting our immune system by fusing with engulfed microbes to destroy them.
