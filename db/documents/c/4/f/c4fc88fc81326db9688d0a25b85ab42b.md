Symptoms and physical exam will depend on organ involvement at the time of presentation.

The rash is the most common presentation. In children, the rash may be misdiagnosed as seborrhea or atopic dermatitis but will not respond to typical treatment for these disorders. The rash of LCH ranges from a single lesion to widespread involvement. Characteristics include scaly papules, nodules, or plaques and can resemble seborrheic dermatitis. One may distinguish LCH by the presence of petechiae, bloody crusting, or firmly indurated nodules.

Bony involvement occurs in about 78% of patients. Solitary osseous lesions are usually incidentally found and may include the skull, hip/pelvis, femur, or ribs. This bony involvement may present incidentally, when obtaining imaging for another complaint, or may produce bone pain.

Pulmonary lesions occur in 20% of patients, and lymph node involvement in 30%. As such, the patient may present with pulmonary symptoms or lymphadenopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly may be present as well.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis also has a predilection for infiltration of the pituitary and causing diabetes insipidus. If this is the initial presentation, the patient may have polyuria, polydipsia, dilute urine, and hypernatremia.
