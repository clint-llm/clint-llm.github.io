Anomalies in the female reproductive tract are estimated to be present in 0.1 to 3.0% of live births. Because the Müllerian ducts originate from the same intermediate mesoderm as the mesonephros, any female reproductive tract anomaly should warrant investigation of renal anomalies. The typical investigation of Müllerian duct anomalies starts with a physical exam, although this is often unrevealing. Imaging should also be evaluated with the initial imaging modality by pelvic ultrasound. Further investigation can be completed with an MRI, hysterosalpingography, or laparoscopy. Numerous uterine anomalies can be classified, in addition to conditions resulting from failure in developing the Müllerian ducts.

**Class I: Uterine Agenesis/Hypoplasia**

Uterine agenesis and hypoplasia are due to early developmental dysfunction of the Müllerian ducts around five weeks of gestation. This anomaly accounts for 5 to 10% of all uterine abnormalities. Uterine agenesis is defined as no identifiable uterus or the presence of solely rudimentary tissue. This may present in an individual as primary amenorrhea with normal secondary sex characteristics during puberty due to fully developed ovaries. In uterine hypoplasia, there is a small but fully differentiated uterus.

The most common form of uterine agenesis is Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). MRKH is an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. The incidence of MRKH has been estimated to be 1 in 4500 female births. It is defined as agenesis of the uterus, cervix, and upper 1/3 of the vagina. Among the agenesis of these parts of the reproductive tract, individuals with MRKH can also have skeletal, renal, cardiac, auditory, and digital anomalies. There are two types of MRKH. Type 1 has agenesis of the uterus with two rudimentary horns and normal fallopian tubes. Type 2 is defined by either symmetric or asymmetric hypoplasia of the uterus with aplasia of one of the two horns and fallopian tube malformations.

**Class II: Unicornuate Uterus**

This condition is due to the arrest of the development of one of the Müllerian ducts. This anomaly accounts for 20% of all uterine anomalies. There are four different subtypes of the unicornuate uterus: absent rudimentary horn, non-cavitary rudimentary horn, cavitary communicating horn, and cavitary non-communicating rudimentary horn. The cavitary non-communicating rudimentary horn can cause obstruction, potentially resulting in abdominal pain and ultimately needing surgical intervention. Abnormal fetal presentation and intrauterine growth retardation are common obstetrical problems.

**Class III: Didelphys Uterus**

Didelphys uterus is due to failure of fusion of the Müllerian ducts to form the uterus and accounts for 5% of uterine anomalies. In a didelphic uterus, each of the uterine horns fully develops due to the complete non-fusion of the Müllerian ducts. Two crevices are present, and there is a deep fundal cleft. There can also be a transverse or longitudinal vaginal septum. There is no communication between the two uteruses. Spontaneous abortion and premature birth both increase due to this anomaly.

**Class IV: Bicornuate Uterus**

A bicornuate uterus is due to the incomplete fusion of the Müllerian ducts. It is present in 10% of all uterine anomalies. This causes central myometrium, which can extend to the internal or external cervical os. A septum that extends to make two cervixes is called a bicornuate bicollis uterus. The depth of the fundal cleft is greater than 1 cm. The horns are less functional in a bicornuate uterus than in a didelphic uterus. Studies have shown little effect of the bicornuate uterus on obstetrical outcomes; however, there are better outcomes for a partial bicornuate uterus than a complete one. Research has found the bicornuate uterus has the highest cervical incompetence rate among the Müllerian duct anomalies. Problems may present at menarche if an obstructive uterus didelphys is present. Pelvic adhesions and endometriosis are more prevalent in obstructive anomalies.

**Class V: Septate Uterus**

Septate uterus is the most common uterine anomaly, comprising 55% of anomalies. It is due to defective resorption of the fibrous septum between the two Müllerian ducts. The uterus divides into two cavities because of this septum. The septum can be composed of muscle, fibrous tissue, or both. Septate uteruses have the poorest obstetrical outcomes, with spontaneous abortion rates of up to 94% and premature birth rates of up to 33%. The treatment for the septate uterus is a surgical intervention to remove the septum.

**Class VI: Arcuate Uterus**

An arcuate uterus is due to the indention of the endometrium into the uterine fundus. An arcuate uterus is due to the near-complete but not total resorption of the uterine septum. There is limited data on the effect of an arcuate uterus on the obstetrical outcome.

**Class VII: Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Exposure**

DES is a nonsteroidal estrogen analog that causes altered Hox gene expression in the Müllerian Ducts. DES affects newborn girls after their mothers use DES to prevent miscarriage. However, the research found that DES caused uterine malformations and increased the risk of vaginal clear cell carcinoma. Studies have shown that 69% of women exposed to DES have uterine anomalies. The typical uterine malformations include a hypoplastic uterus, a T-shaped uterine cavity (31%), abnormal transverse ridges and hoods, and cervical anomalies (44%). There is an associated two-times increased risk of spontaneous abortion and a nine-fold increased risk of ectopic pregnancy for women exposed to DES. Further, there is an association with DES and an increase in premature labor and cervical incompetence.

**Gartner Duct**

The Gartner duct is a remnant of the Wolffian duct; this can become a cystic structure in the lower wall of the vagina and is known as the Gartner’s cyst.

**Congenital anomalies of the Fallopian Tubes**

These rare anomalies are typically agenesis, hypoplasia, or segmental narrowing of the fallopian tubes.

**Transverse Vaginal Septum**

A transverse vaginal septum is present when there is a defect in the canalization of the vaginal plaque at the location of the urogenital sinus meeting the Müllerian duct. Variations are present in this type of septum, including perforation. A perforated transverse vaginal septum typically causes fewer symptoms as the patient can menstruate. The location of the septum determines the severity and treatment. The easiest to treat is the transverse septum which is thin, located low, and perforated. The most difficult is a high and thick septum. This type can present with a rectovaginal fistula and require a hysterectomy.

**Hand-Foot-Genital Syndrome (HFG)**

HFG is an autosomal dominant condition due to mutations in the Hoxa13 gene. Patients with this disorder have shortened thumbs, great toes, and a bicornuate or didelphys uterus.

**Persistent Müllerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS)**

Alterations in AMH secretion, AMH gene, or AMH receptors result in retained Müllerian ducts. Complete gonadal dysgenesis in males causes no secretion of AMH, while a mutation in the AMH gene or the AMH receptor causes abnormal function of AMH. The normal function of AMH in males is to bind to Type I and II receptors present in the MDM; this causes signal transduction via SMAD phosphorylation. Activation of the receptors results in apoptosis of the MDE in males. PMDS is an autosomal recessive disorder in males caused by a mutation in the gene coding the AMH type II receptor. There have been 38 identified mutations that can cause this syndrome. Some of the mutations cause changes to the C terminal of the receptor rendering it bio-inactive. The non-functional AMH receptor leads to the retention of the Müllerian ducts in males. Normal findings at birth for a patient with PMDS include normal phenotype and cryptorchidism (unilateral or bilateral). The persistent Müllerian structures are typically discovered during surgical repair of the cryptorchidism.
