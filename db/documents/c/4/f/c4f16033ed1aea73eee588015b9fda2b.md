Whenever a patient with suspected acute stroke symptoms presents, code stroke is called, and many different teams come into play. They work together and in succession to give the best care possible. With so many different persons working together, efficient communication becomes important.

Different teams may decide on doing interventions at different times during the hospital stay, such as ED physician/anesthesiologist may decide to intubate the patient if he thinks the patientâ€™s consciousness is declining, a neurologist may decide on starting thrombolysis/thrombectomy and an interventional radiologist may help with mechanical thrombectomy. Also, the different teams may get involved to treat complications of stroke or its treatment. Good communication is valuable in all these scenarios.
