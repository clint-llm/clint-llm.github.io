Electron microscopy can provide a detailed assessment of platelet ultrastructure and is important in the diagnosis of various platelet disorders. Three separate platelet ultrastructural compartments can be described on electron microscopy: cytoplasmic granules, platelet membranes, and the cytoskeleton.

“Grey Platelet Syndrome” may be suspected based on reduced staining on initial light microscopy, but electron microscopy can reveal an absence of α-granules and the presence of empty α-granule-sized vacuoles. Bernard-Soulier syndrome results from a defect in the GPIb/V/IX receptor, and when examined under electron microscopy, a variety of abnormalities may present, such as giant cell size, dilated surface-connected canalicular system, disorganized microtubules, and reduced granule numbers. MYH9-related disorders result in platelets with a similar giant size but otherwise normal ultrastructure on electron microscopy.
