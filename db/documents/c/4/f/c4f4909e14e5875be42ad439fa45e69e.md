Myelomeningocele is the most common disorder of neurulation that results in viable infants. Its incidence in the United States is about 0.2 to 0.4 per 1000 live births. The rates are higher in the Latino population. Females have a 3-7x higher risk compared to males. There are marked racial differences; for example, the incidence is several times higher in some regions in China, parts of Africa, the middle east, Thailand, and India. Folate supplementation guidelines in these countries may play a role in these racial differences.
