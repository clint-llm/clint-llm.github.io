Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most reliable, reproducible, successful, and cost-effective procedures in all orthopedics. The procedure requires coordination of care across various healthcare provider groups, including nurses, physical therapists, advanced practitioners and physician extenders, medical physicians, and orthopedic surgeons.

- Nurses need to provide coordination and monitoring of the patient pre-, peri-, and postoperatively with rapid reporting to the clinicians if there are changes in vital signs or evidence of infections. The nurses should also assist the clinicians in providing patient and family education.

- The pharmacist should evaluate the patient for potential drug-drug interactions, allergic reactions, and assist with appropriate dosing for pain management.

- Clinicians including the surgeon, nurse practitioner, and physician assistant should work together to provide the patient and family with education regarding the procedure, expected issues, and guidance for aftercare.

Only a coordinated effort of the interprofessional team will result in the best outcomes.Â Level of evidence: II-IV.
