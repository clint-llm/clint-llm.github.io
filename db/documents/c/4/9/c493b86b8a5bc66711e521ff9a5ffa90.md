Glottic stenosis can be either congenital or acquired.

Acquired glottic stenosis is more common and has multiple etiologic factors. The most frequent is trauma secondary to endotracheal intubation, which is thought to occur due to the tube’s pressure effect causing tissue ischemia, inflammation, and scarring. The risk of glottic stenosis is related to the duration of the intubation, the size of the endotracheal tube, the number of intubations, and excess movement of the endotracheal tube in agitated patients.

A variety of infectious diseases such as syphilis, fungal infections, and diphtheria can cause glottic stenosis. Additionally, granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, rhinoscleroma, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) are thought to cause the condition. Rare etiologies of glottic stenosis include mycosis in immunosuppressed patients, leprosy, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and scarlet fever.

Gastroesophageal reflux is thought to be a contributing factor; however, its role in the aggravation of the disease remains unclear at present.
