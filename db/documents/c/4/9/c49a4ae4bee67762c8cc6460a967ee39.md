An early presentation and prompt management may allow a good visual prognosis. Early lens extraction under adequate IOP control is the cornerstone of management. Delayed and chronic presentations have a poorer prognosis.Â The development of PAS is a poor prognostic indicator and requires regular IOP monitoring with medical and/or surgical management.

The combined cataract extraction with trabeculectomy has good IOP control in the immediate post-surgical period. However, the trabeculectomy failure rates of combined surgery are high in the long term.
