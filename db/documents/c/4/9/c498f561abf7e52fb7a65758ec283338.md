Under normal circumstances, theÂ monosynaptic reflex is an inducible action, rather than a pathology. However, patients can present with abnormal DTRs from a variety of causes. When pathologic, the monosynaptic reflex can provide insight towards an underlying neurological dysfunction; this could indicate a wide variety of etiologies ranging from a spinal cord lesion to an electrolyte imbalance. Thus, identifying or determining the cause of the abnormal reflex could involve many members of the healthcare team and could improve treatment strategies and management.

Assessing, discovering, and communicating the presence of an abnormal reflex can enhance patient outcomes, safety, and care. Coordination and communication within the healthcare team of a patient are essential to patient-centered care.
