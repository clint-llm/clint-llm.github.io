A double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is usually an asymptomatic entity unless accompanied by mitral valve stenosis, regurgitation, or a concomitant congenital cardiac anomaly. In patients with an associated congenital heart defect, it is usual for that particular disorder to manifest on clinical examination as there are no signs specific to DOMV. In isolated DOMV, the extent of symptoms depends on the grade of left atrial pressure resulting in pulmonary congestion. Symptoms are primarily due to diminished cardiac output and can range from tachypnea, dyspnea, and wheezing to poor feeding and failure to thrive in the pediatric population. In asymptomatic patients, the physical examination may be completely unremarkable as isolated DOMV is benign, even to cardiac auscultation. However, if complicated by mitral valve stenosis (MS), one may appreciate the murmur of MS, a low-pitched mid-diastolic murmur best heard at the apex. The same can be said for DOMV with mitral regurgitation (MR), a blowing pansystolic murmur is appreciated at the apical region. As patients develop symptoms, one may find clinical signs of heart failure such as increased work of breathing, peripheral cyanosis, increased jugular venous pressure, palpation of a parasternal heave, pulmonary crackles on auscultation as well as evidence of hypervolemia such as peripheral edema.
