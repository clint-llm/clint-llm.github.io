Although HAPE is the leading cause of altitude-related death, the prognosis for most individuals suffering from high-altitude pulmonary edema is excellent. Recognition of early symptoms with prompt initiation of therapy is key to a mild course of illness. Attempts to continue ascent and exertion after symptom onset will lead to the progression of the disease. Even moderate to severe HAPE will improve dramatically with oxygen therapy and descent.
