The management of UVFP is an interprofessional. The disorder is often encountered in clinical practice by both primary care providers and nurse practitioners. A consult with an otolaryngologist is highly recommended if UVFP is suspected. Besides imaging studies, laryngoscopy is often necessary.

Treatment plans will vary depending on the patient and injury, but options are generally focused on airway protection and improving dysphonia. Techniques and surgical procedures that should be considered are speech and swallow therapy, injection augmentation, medialization laryngoplasty (laryngeal framework surgery), and arytenoid adduction. The outlook for most patients with UVFP is good as long as the primary cause is benign and not associated with severe damage to the laryngeal nerve. (Level V)
