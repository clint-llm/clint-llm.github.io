The diagnostic criteria for  primary biliary cholangitis include an absence of any other liver disease, no evidence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction on imaging, and at least 2 out of 3 of the following:

- Elevation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at least 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

- Presence of antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) with a titer of 1:40 or higher

- Histopathological evidence of primary biliary cirrhosis (nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis or "florid duct lesion" and destruction of interlobular bile ducts with a predominance of lymphocytic infiltration).

Liver biopsy is not required for diagnosis but is helpful in disease prognosis and staging.

Asymptomatic patients with abnormal liver chemistry, especially abnormal alkaline phosphatase, should be evaluated for primary biliary cirrhosis. Patients who present with vague right upper quadrant pain, unexplained pruritus, fatigue, jaundice, skin hyperpigmentation, and unexplained weight loss should also be evaluated for primary biliary cirrhosis.

Patients who are suspected of having primary biliary cirrhosis should undergo a right abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP), or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) to rule out the extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Once the extrahepatic obstruction is ruled out, AMA should be obtained. In some instances, IgM is elevated.

In cases of atypical disease presentation with elevated ALP but normal AMA, alternative diagnosis, and liver biopsy should be considered for diagnosis. However, with typical clinical features of primary biliary cholangitis and positive AMA, but normal ALP liver biopsy is not required.

Patients with primary biliary cholangitis also have a deranged lipid profile due to cholestasis. Fifty percent of patients have elevated cholesterol, which clinically manifests as xanthomas and xanthelasmas. Primary biliary cholangitis patients also have iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss secondary to portal hypertensive gastropathy.Primary biliary cholangitis patients who have already developed cirrhosis may have coagulopathy (elevated prothrombin time), thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia in addition to anemia.
