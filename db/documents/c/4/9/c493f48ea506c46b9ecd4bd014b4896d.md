The superficial and deep heads of the pre-tarsal tendons of the orbicularis muscle control the pumping action of the lacrimal system. The tendon heads juxtaposed with the cananiculi and the lacrimal sac. Therefore, when the orbicularis muscle contracts, so do the tendon heads, and in concert so does the lacrimal system. This contraction facilitates the capillary action of the lacrimal puncta and lacrimal system that directs the flow of tears to the nasal cavity.
