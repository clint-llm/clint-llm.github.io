The goal of treatment is to limit parasite multiplication during active infection. Therapeutic treatment is indicated in immunocompetent individuals with severe or prolonged symptoms as well as all immunocompromised patients. In cases of suspected T. gondii infection, empirical therapy based on presumptive diagnosis is preferred rather than waiting for test results. The combination of pyrimethamine (200mg loading dose followed by 50mg daily for patients <60kg and 75mg daily for patients >60kg) and sulfadiazine (1000mg four times a day for patients <60kg and 1500mg four times a day for patients >60kg) is the preferred regimen for treatment. Initial therapy should be continued for 6 weeks and be followed by chronic maintenance therapy.

Folic acid is usually added to the treatment regimen to prevent folic acid deficiency due to sulfadiazine. Steroids are added to the standard regimen to treat patients with cerebral edema and ocular toxoplasmosis.

Prophylactic anti-toxoplasma therapy is started in patients with HIV/AIDS who are T. gondii IgG positive with CD4 cell counts <100 cells/microL. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of choice to prevent reactivation of latent infection. Prophylaxis can be discontinued when CD4 count is >200 cells/microL for at least 3 months, and viral load is suppressed.
