Aspirin is the most commonly used of all antiplatelet drugs, so accidental intake is common. The effect can be life-threatening if taken over 150 mg/kg of body weight. Supportive measure to decrease the absorption of the drug is achievable by using activated charcoal but only if administered within 4 hours of ingestion. The patient will need monitoring for signs and symptoms of bleeding and the development of metabolic derangements, such as acidosis. If acidosis develops, immediate dialysis is indicated.

There is no antidote available for most of these drugs; however, a monoclonal antibody against ticagrelor is in development, but it is not commercially available as yet.
