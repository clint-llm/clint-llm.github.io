Above-the-knee amputations (AKA) involve removing the leg from the body by cutting through both the thigh tissue and femoral bone. This procedure may be necessary for a wide variety of reasons, such as trauma, infection, tumor, and vascular compromise. There are several known physiologic and psychologic complications that are associated with this procedure. However, an interprofessional approach to caring for these patients may decrease the rate of these complications.
