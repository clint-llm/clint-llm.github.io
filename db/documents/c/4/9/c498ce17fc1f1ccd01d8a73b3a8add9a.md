At week three of gestation, the appearance of optic grooves from the developing forebrain marks the first sign of eye development. As the neural folds fuse, the optic grooves evaginate, forming the optic vesicle.

Subsequently, the optic vesicle invaginates and forms the optic cup at about four weeks of gestation; this will become the retina.Â The inner and outer layers are due to the invagination process. They form the pigmented and the neural layers, respectively.

Axons of the neural layer then proliferate into the optic stalk, causing obliteration of the lumen; this forms the optic nerve.

A multitude of factors such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), netrin signaling, and Slit proteins have been shown to play a role in guiding optic axons to their target nuclei within the brain.
