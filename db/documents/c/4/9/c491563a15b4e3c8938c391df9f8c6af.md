SCLC is distinguished according to the Veterans Administration Lung Cancer Study Group staging system into Limited Disease (LD) and Extensive Disease (ED). The main criteria for determining LD and ED are whether a reasonable radiation plan can safely encompass disease extent. Two-thirds of patients present with extensive stage or metastatic disease.

TNM staging is useful for patients who are candidates for surgical resection, clinical research, and cancer registries.
