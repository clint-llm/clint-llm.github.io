Blood pressure is continuously regulated via the autonomic nervous system as a balance of the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system acts to raise blood pressure by increasing heart rate and constricting arterioles. The parasympathetic nervous system lowers blood pressure by decreasing heart rate and relaxing arterioles to increase vessel diameter.
