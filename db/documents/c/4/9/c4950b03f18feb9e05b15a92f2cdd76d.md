Referral to an otolaryngologist is rarely needed since most cases are viral and will resolve spontaneously. Acute uncomplicated bacterial sinusitis can be easily treated by primary care physicians with antibiotics. However, if a complication is suspected, prompt referral to an otolaryngologist is required to avoid the potentially catastrophic effects of intracranial and orbital extension. Reasons for urgent referral include:

- Mental status changes

- Cranial nerve abnormalities

- Pain with extraocular movements

- Periorbital edema

- Severe or refractory symptoms in an immunocompromised patient

Routine referral to an otolaryngologist may also be done for any intractable or refractory case of rhinosinusitis to provide further evaluation.
