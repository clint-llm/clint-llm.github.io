Patients' temporary side effects from manipulation can persist undetected if nonspecific guidance to patients is provided aftercare. Prospective research has estimated that approximately 30 to 61%  of patients encounter typical side effects arising from spinal stimulation.

Most often, localized tightness, headaches, weakness, soreness radiating, numbness, dizziness, exhaustion, rigidity, body warmth, and consciousness loss. Premature or severe menstruation, gastrointestinal discomfort, twitching, dysrhythmia, and sweating are the least frequent.

A few individuals may develop a slight headache after cervical manipulation or soreness after back stimulation. In persons with delicate skin, some erythema and petechiae may occur, which may persist for hours. As therapy progresses, some problems can resurface, and when treatment is interrupted, effects can worsen.
