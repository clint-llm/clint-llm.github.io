The uterine arteries are the main blood vessels that supply blood to the uterus. They give off branches that supply different portions of the uterus and plays an important role in maintaining blood supply during physiological processes, such as the altering endometrium during the menstrual cycle and growth of the uterus during pregnancy. During its course, the uterine artery passes anterior to the distal ureter; some refer to this as “water under the bridge.”
