Conservative management with NSAIDs is considered a reasonable option in the treatment of osteoid osteomas.  Resolution of symptoms from conservative management has been documented to occur at 33 months.

Surgical excision is the preferred treatment for an osteoid osteoma.  Historically, open en bloc surgical resection with removal of the nidus was considered curative.  However, wide block resection of bone in a weight-bearing area has disadvantages including prolonged restriction of physical activity, the potential for pathologic fracture, and requirement of bone grafting with internal fixation.

Less invasive surgical options have been explored to minimize damage to the normal, surrounding bone.  Currently, the treatment of choice is CT guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.
