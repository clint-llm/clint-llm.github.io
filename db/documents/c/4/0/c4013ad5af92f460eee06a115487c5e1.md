Following the excision of the tumor, hypotension may ensue. This hypotension is multifactorial. It may be due to the downregulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors, hypovolemia, or residual effects of long-acting antihypertensive medications like phenoxybenzamine. Up to half of the patients may be hypertensive for a few days after the tumor resection.

Plasma catecholamine levels (norepinephrine) may not decrease to normal for a few days after the tumor resection. Persistent hypertension may also signify a residual tumor. Hypoglycemia is another significant concern; blood sugar should be checked regularly every 4Â to 6 hours. As catecholamine inhibits insulin secretion, hence sudden decrease in catecholamine level after the resection of a tumor can result in a rebound increase in insulin secretion
