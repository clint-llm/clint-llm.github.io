Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in the urine and can be classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. A patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as having colonization with one or more organisms in a urine specimen without symptoms or infection. Symptomatic bacteriuria is associated with an infection in the urinary tract, usually by a single organism. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of bacteriuria and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the use of chronic indwelling urinary catheters in the etiology of bacteriuria.
- Outline the patient history associated with both symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria.
- Explain the role of urinalysis (UA) in the diagnosis of patients with bacteriuria.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by bacteruria.
