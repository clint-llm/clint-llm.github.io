Regular and comprehensive dental examinations are critical in the early identification of any infectious or carious process throughout the dentition. Therefore, dentists must emphasize to their patients how crucial frequent, comprehensive dental examinations are. In addition, patients who have received endodontic therapy in the past should be routinely evaluated clinically and radiographically to ensure the healing of their infections is progressing normally.

The dentist must examine for any new or worsening symptoms and identify the potential risk of reinfection of the tooth. Patients should also be advised that any posterior tooth that receives endodontic therapy will require a cuspal coverage restoration to support the integrity of the treated tooth.
