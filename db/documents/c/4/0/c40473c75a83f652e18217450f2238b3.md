**Post-Tracheostomy Care**

Tube cuffs should be monitored to maintain pressure in the 20Â to 25 mm Hg range.

The skin sutures and any stay sutures are removed at this time as well. If patients are alert, awake, and cooperative, the caliber of the tracheostomy tube may be able to be downsized at this time. It is inadvisable to change the tracheostomy tube within the first five days of placement as the cutaneous-tracheal tract is immature and easily lost, which can result in loss of the airway. If tube changes are necessary during this time period, emergency equipment and adequate lighting similar- to the operating suite or, in the operating room, should be considered. Additional measures include the availability of smaller sized trach tubes, endotracheal tubes, exchange catheters, as well as possible bronchoscopic guidance.
