If no complications (i.e., infection, bleeding, etc.) arise during the procedure or hospitalization, most patients can be discharged within one-week postoperatively.

Postoperative guidelines have undergone study, and the following are the recommendations

- A postoperative echocardiogram should be performed soon after the procedure before discharge and is periodically necessary to assess left-ventricular function, especially if symptoms arise.

- Lifelong anticoagulation, particularly with warfarin, is indicated for mechanical or prosthetic valve replacements.

- Clinicians should initiate antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis with patients who have a mechanical or prosthetic valve prior to dental, oral, or upper respiratory tract procedures or in patients with a history of endocarditis.

Exercise therapy (ET) and cardiac rehabilitation after heart valve surgery has been extensively studied and is a general recommendation. Some data supports improved exercise capacity, and ejection fraction, however further studies are needed to develop a definite correlation.

In a retrospective study of 105 patients undergoing heart valve surgery, the mean-time to return to work was about five months. Analysis of these patients also showed improved ejection fraction, 78.4% of patients studied were categorized in NYHA Stage I or II as compared with 38.1% before heart valve surgery.
