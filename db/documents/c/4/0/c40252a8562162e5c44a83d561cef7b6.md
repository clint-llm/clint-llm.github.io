Keratosis pilaris is a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical exam findings. However, evaluation of the skin lesions with a dermatoscope can aid in the diagnosis. Abnormalities of the hair follicle will be displayed when visualizing the papules with a dermatoscope. Hair shafts can be thin and short, coiled, or embedded within the stratum corneum. Scaling and erythema will also be present on dermoscopy.
