- The major underlying pathophysiological mechanism in kidney injury in SCN is from hypoxia, ischemia, and hemolysis.

- Early detection is key as the goal of treatment is to delay the progression of renal failure.

- CKD development is from early glomerular hypertrophy and hyperfiltration; tubular hyperfunctioning; endothelial injury with sickling and vaso-occlusive episodes

- Diagnosis of SCN is primarily based on clinical manifestations and is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion.

- FSGS is the most common glomerular disorder in SCN.

- Hydroxyurea should be used in all patients with SCD and RAS blockade should be considered in SCN patients with proteinuria.

- Renal manifestations are generally more common and severe in SCD compared with those seen in sickle cell trait, except medullary renal cell carcinoma.

- All forms of renal replacement therapy are beneficial in ESRD patients from SCN, with renal transplantation giving a demonstrated advantage in survival benefit

- Physicians should be vigilant in SCD patients for any early signs of renal complications.
