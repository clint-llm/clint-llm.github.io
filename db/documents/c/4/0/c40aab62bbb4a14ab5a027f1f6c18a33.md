With tympanostomy tube placement being the most frequent ambulatory surgery performed in children, an interprofessional team approach is imperative to obtaining optimum outcomes for patients, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (otolaryngologists), nurses, and other health care professionals. General practice clinicians, including family medicine, pediatricians, and internal medicine physicians, play a crucial role in identifying and referring both children and adults who meet the criteria for tympanostomy tube placement to a specialist who can perform the procedure. Nurses can coordinate activities between the different clinicians, assist with the procedure, and counsel patients/parents. The various clinicians must maintain open communication channels and keep accurate, updated patient records.

Likewise, audiologists are crucial in performing both audiograms and tympanograms to identify those children who meet indications for tympanostomy tube placement or require close surveillance prior to referral to a specialist. Because most patients are seen by general practitioners, the American Academy of Otolaryngology has published clinical practice guidelines regarding diagnosing and managing tympanostomy tubes in children.
