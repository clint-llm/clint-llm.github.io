Obesity is a complex, pervasive, and frequently persistent health problem in children and adolescents. Obesity is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age and gender in children aged two years and older. Severe obesity is having a BMI greater than or equal to the 120th percentile. For younger children, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend using the World Health Organization weight-for-length age and gender-specific charts rather than the BMI.

Child obesity rates in the United States have more than tripled since the 1960s, and prevalence increases with age.
