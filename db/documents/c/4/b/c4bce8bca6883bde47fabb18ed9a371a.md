FDG is used to monitor glucose accumulation in the cells with increased metabolism. FDG accumulates in the body in proportion to glucose metabolism. High glycolytic rates in organs like the brain generally have the highest accumulation. The liver, spleen, thyroid, gut, and bone marrow also show moderate FDG uptake. Active skeletal muscles also accumulate FDG. It is cleared unchanged from the body within 24 hours in the urine. In the oncology and neurology diagnostic studies, suboptimal imaging may occur in patients with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. Consequently, monitor blood glucose and consider medical therapy to ensure at least two days of normoglycemia before FDG administration.
