Obesity is associated with severalÂ adverse medical consequences. The most noteworthy diseases are Type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, unexplained congestive heart failure, and hypertension, metabolic syndrome, stroke, gallbladder disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, dyslipidemia, certain types of cancers like colon, prostate, endometrial, and breast cancer, infertility, osteoarthritis, low back pain, psychological problems, and increased total morbidity and mortality.
