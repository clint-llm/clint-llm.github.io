Initial assessment to determine whether the patient is stable or unstable dictates further evaluation. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable and in acute respiratory failure, a bedside ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis if it is available for immediate use. Concurrently, patients should be stabilized, and a complete assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation should be performed. Emergent needle decompression or chest tube thoracotomy must be performed immediately if the diagnosis is highly suspected.

When a patient is hemodynamically stable, radiographic evaluation is recommended. The initial assessment involves a chest radiograph (CXR) to confirm the diagnosis.

CXR can demonstrate one or more of the following:

- A thin line representing the edge of the visceral pleura

- Effacement of lung markings distally to this line

- Complete ipsilateral lung collapse

- The mediastinal shift away from the pneumothorax in tension pneumothorax

- Subcutaneous emphysema

- Tracheal deviation to the contralateral side of tension pneumothorax

- Flattening of the hemidiaphragm on the ipsilateral side (tension pneumothorax)

A chest computed tomography can be done if the diagnosis is unclear on the X-ray. It is the most reliable imaging study for diagnosing pneumothorax, but it is not recommended for routine use.

Ultrasound is about 94% sensitive and 100% specific with a skilled operator. This can be used as a bedside technique to detect pneumothorax, which may be useful in unstable patients. Ultrasound findings include the absence of lung sliding and the presence of a lung point.
