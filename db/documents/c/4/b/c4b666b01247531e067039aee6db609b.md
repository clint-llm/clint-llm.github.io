A kidney biopsy is a gold standard for diagnosing and managing multiple diseases. Since renal diseases may be secondary to evident causes and renal biopsy is an invasive test, its indications are limited.Â Ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) is the most accepted and commonly used technique to perform a renal biopsy.

The ideal sample for microscopy should contain 20 glomeruli for a native kidney biopsy and at least ten glomeruli in a transplant kidney biopsy for diagnosis. The kidney cortex contains glomeruli, and the medulla primarily has tubules. Hence it is essential to obtain renal cortical tissue for analysis. However, in rare circumstances, medullary tissue is helpful in diagnoses like BK virus nephropathy and antibody-mediated rejection in a transplanted kidney.

After obtaining kidney tissue, it is fixed and processed with a microtome into thin sections and processed for light microscopy (LM), immunofluorescence (IF), and electron microscopy (EM).
