- Always consider cyanide poisoning when treating an unconscious victim or a structure fire.

- Both carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning can exist concomitantly in a patient removed from a structure fire.

- Cyanide poisoning causes a prolonged loss of consciousness which does not improve when the patient is removed from the burning structure.

- Cyanide poisoning causes pupillary dilation.

- Cyanide poisoning causes seizures, carbon monoxide rarely causes seizures.

- Suspect cyanide poisoning in any patient removed from a burning structure and who has soot in the nares or around the mouth, or carbonaceous sputum.

- Airway protection with endotracheal intubation is vital to prevent respiratory arrest due to edema and airway occlusion which can happen precipitously.

- Patients with carbon monoxide poisoning and/or cyanide poisoning have improved outcomes when referred emergently for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.Â  Patients with cyanide toxicity should receive hydroxocobalamin before receiving hyperbaric oxygen.

- Treatment with hyperbaric oxygen emergently helps to decrease the development of delayed neurologic sequelae and has been shown to improve functional outcomes in patients with both carbon monoxide and cyanide toxicity.
