The prognosis of cyclothymia is variable. Features of this disorder inherently make normative functioning almost untenable in the absence of appropriate psychiatric aid. The constellation of hypersensitivity, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, emotional-reactivity, and limited self-efficacy leads to chronic interpersonal, professional, and intrapsychic difficulties. Prognosis varies by internal coping styles, personality factors, family support, and early initiation of medications and psychotherapy. Fortunately, the literature suggests that with sufficient support and resources those afflicted with cyclothymia can lead fulfilling lives with minimal perturbations.
