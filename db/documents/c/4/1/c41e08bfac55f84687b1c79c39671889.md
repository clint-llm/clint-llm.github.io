Osteoblastoma recurs in approximately 10 to 20% of patients; the odds of tumor recurrence correlate with how well the surgeon completely removed the tumor without damaging normal structures. The time needed before the patient can return to normal daily activities will vary based on the tumor's location and the procedure used to remove it. Should the tumor recur, treatment still utilizes the same methods.
