A shared decision-making conversation should be held with patients who have WPW pattern on their ECG but no history concerning for or documented arrhythmia. Cardiology or electrophysiology referral is reasonable to discuss electrophysiologic testing for risk stratification. Catheter ablation is the recommended first-line therapy for patients with preexcitation on ECG who have a history of involved arrhythmias. Electrophysiology consultation or referral should be obtained.
