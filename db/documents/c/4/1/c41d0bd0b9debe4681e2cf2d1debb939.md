Absolute contraindications for kidney transplantation are the inability to tolerate surgery due to severe cardiac or pulmonary disease, active malignancy, active infection, active drug abuse, and uncontrolled psychiatric disease.

Relative contraindications are more variable and may differ depending on the institution and geographic region: morbid obesity with a recommended body mass index (BMI) less than 40 kg/m, history of noncompliance with dialysis schedule or medication regimen, frailty, psychiatric problems, and limited life expectancy (defined as less than the anticipated waiting time for a kidney).
