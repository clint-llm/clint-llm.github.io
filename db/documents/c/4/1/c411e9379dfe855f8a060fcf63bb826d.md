Patients at an increased risk of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina) benefit from lipid-lowering medications. It is essential to recognize that these drugs are useful in combination with lifestyle modification. These medications can be used for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. This activity covers lipid-lowering pharmaceutical interventions that members of the interprofessional team need to review the indications, contraindications, and adverse event profiles to optimally manage patients with abnormal lipid profiles and direct care to optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of action of the most prominent lipid-lowering pharmaceutical agents.
- Explain the indications for using the various agents in the lipid-lowering therapy family of medications.
- Review the adverse effect profile of various individuals lipid-lowering therapy agents.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use lipid-lowering medications to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where lipid-lowering pharmaceutical therapy can be used.
