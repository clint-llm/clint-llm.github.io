Dantrolene sodium is a postsynaptic muscle relaxant with multiple indications in the fields of anesthesiology and neurology. While there are many indications for the use of dantrolene, its primary indication, and FDA-approved usage in both children and adults, is for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia: the very rare but life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of dantrolene, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating conditions where dantrolene is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for using dantrolene.
- Review the contraindications for dantrolene use.
- Outline the potential adverse effect profile of dantrolene.
- Describe how interprofessional team strategies can increase dantrolene's effectiveness when its use is indicated.
