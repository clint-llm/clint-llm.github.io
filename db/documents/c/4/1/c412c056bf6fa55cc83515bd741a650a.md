Risks include infection, hemorrhage, thromboembolism, and death from the procedure itself with anaphylactic, allergic, and hemolytic reactions occurring more likely from plasma or blood transfusion.  A recent retrospective cohort study of 1201 therapeutic plasma exchange procedures in 435 children found pruritus/urticaria (7%), hypertension (1.92%), and hypotension (1.17%) to be the most common complications.  There were severe complications (cryptococcosis neoformans, anaphylactic shock, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) in 5 patients (0.42%) following TPE procedures.
