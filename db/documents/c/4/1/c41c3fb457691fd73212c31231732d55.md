Extraocular muscle (EOM) management from ocular, orbital, and cranial trauma can be varied and complex. In the known ocular or orbital trauma setting, elucidating the mechanism, type, and severity of the injury helps triage critical components of the physical exam. Recognition and treatment of life-threatening injuries following Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles hold precedence over all others. These injuries are more commonly encountered when the body has sustained high-velocity forces, such as motor vehicle accidents or firearm assault.

Addressing EOM management in trauma can be conceptualized in two ways: one where there is damage to the EOMs and one where there is not. Direct EOM involvement can range from mild: minimal displacement from adjacent soft tissue edema or hemorrhage; to moderate: contusion of the EOM itself; to severe: disinsertion, laceration, or incarceration of the EOM from the traumatic blow or by an orbital fracture. Indirectly, EOM motility may be impaired from cranial nerve palsy or supranuclear injury associated with head and neck trauma. Contrarily, the EOMs may not be damaged but may need to be iatrogenically detached from the globe to explore and repair open globe injuries.

The presence or suspicion of an open globe injury and mechanical causes of strabismus or neurologic involvement guides the planning and timing of surgery. The goal of EOM management during acute ocular or orbital surgery is to limit the amount of fibrosis that could occur and result in strabismus.
