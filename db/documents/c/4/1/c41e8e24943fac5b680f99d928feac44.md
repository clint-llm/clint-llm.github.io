All other causes of AKI can be considered in the differential diagnosis of AIN. Vasculitis can present with AKI and a rash. The vasculitic rash is usually purpuric, while in drug-induced AIN, a maculopapular rash consistent with an allergic pattern is noted. Atheroembolic disease can present with a rash (livedo reticularis) and peripheral eosinophilia. Pre-renal AKI is associated with a history and exam findings consistent with volume depletion and clinically responds well with a fluid challenge. Post-renal AKI can be identified by renal imaging. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) can be seen in the context of drug toxicity (e.g., vancomycin) and is associated with granular or muddy brown casts in urine sediment. Dysmorphic red blood cells (RBCs), red cell casts, and nephrotic range proteinuria are seen in glomerular diseases.
