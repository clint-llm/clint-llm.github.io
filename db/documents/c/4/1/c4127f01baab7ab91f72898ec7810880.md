Doxycycline is the drug of choice but the patient should be admitted if there are signs of toxicity and organ dysfunction. Anecdotal reports indicate that delay in treatment is associated with a poor outcome.

Infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum can be prevented by avoidance of tick bites in endemic areas as well as by immediate removal of attached ticks. Immediate and complete removal of attached ticks is highly recommended given that the tick must be attached for 4 to 24 hours to transmit infection. It is also recommended to apply a repellent such as N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) to the skin, and wear light-colored clothing that makes it easier for individuals to identify the ticks. For individuals at risk of getting exposed to tick bites, such as when they are engaging in outdoor activities, it is recommended that they inspect their skin, hair, and clothing for ticks when returning from possible infested areas.
