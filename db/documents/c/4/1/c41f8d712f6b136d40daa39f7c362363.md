The septum transversum and pleuroperitoneal membranes are the main components in the development of the diaphragm, which is completed by the 12th week of gestation. Any disturbance in the formation of the pleuroperitoneal membranes can result in diaphragmatic discontinuity and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The associated herniation of the abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity can interfere with normal lung development and forms the basis for the two main pathological findings noted in CDH- lung hypoplasia and abnormal pulmonary vascular development. Lung hypoplasia is reflected by a marked decrease in the airway generations, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli. The hypoplasia is noted bilaterally with the lung on the same side of the defect affected more severely than the other lung. There is also an abnormal vascular remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature resulting in the thickening of the arterial medial walls with the potential to develop persistent pulmonary hypertension (PH). Left ventricular hypoplasia and dysfunction, which can worsen the PH, are also noted in CDH. Another hypothesis for the occurrence of CDH is that the pulmonary hypoplasia is the primary causal factor resulting in herniation of abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity. Irrespective of the cause, pulmonary hypoplasia, abnormal pulmonary vasoreactivity, and PH are the major contributors to the morbidity and mortality associated with CDH.
