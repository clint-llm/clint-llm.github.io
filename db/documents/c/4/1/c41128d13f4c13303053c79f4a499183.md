In the United States, the prevalence of PSVT is approximatelyÂ 0.2%, and it has an incidence of one to three cases every thousand patients. The most common type of PSVT is atrial fibrillation, with a prevalence rate of approximately 0.4% to 1% occurring in men and women equally; it is projected to affect as many as 7.5 million patients by 2050. The risk of developing PSVT was found to be twice in women compared to men in a population-based study, with the prevalence of the PSVT higher with age. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is found more commonly in patients who are middle-aged or older. Whereas PSVT with an accessory pathway is most common in adolescents, and their occurrence decreases with age.

Besides occurring in healthy people, PSVT can also occur after a myocardial infarction (MI), rheumatic heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, and pericarditis. Digoxin toxicity is often associated with PSVT.
