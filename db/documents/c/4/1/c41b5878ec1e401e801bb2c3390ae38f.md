The visceral pleura covers the lung surfaces and inter-lobar fissures, while the parietal pleuraÂ covers the mediastinum, chest wall, and diaphragm. Both the lungs have three separate visceral and parietal pleurae. Therefore, pneumothorax of one lung does not result in bilateral pneumothoraxes. There is a "real" space between the visceral and parietal pleura. This pleural space surrounds the lung and is approximately 10 to 15 micrometers wide.

**Parietal Pleura**

It consists of a mesothelial cell layer and a sub-pleural layer. It overlies the costal fascia and ribs. The mesothelial layer of the parietal pleura consists of stomata for lymphatic drainage.

**Visceral Pleural**

The visceral pleural also consists of a layer of mesothelial cells and a sub-pleural layer. The visceral pleura is thin cranially and thick caudally due change in the density of the sub-pleural layer.
