Acute liver failure is defined as severe acute liver injury for fewer than twenty-six weeks duration with encephalopathy and impaired synthetic function (INR of 1.5 or higher) in a patient without cirrhosis or preexisting liver disease. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of acute liver failure. In addition, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with acute liver failure.
