BM presents as a well-defined, unilateral, hyperpigmented tan or brown patch which increases in size, gradually often developing into a geographic pattern. Some studies have reported the right side of the body to be more commonly affected. The most common sites involved are the shoulder, scapular area, and the upper arms. Rarely, BM may present with bilateral lesions and on atypical sites like the lower limbs. Significant hair growth over the lesions is usually seen some time after the hyperpigmentation is established and may take months to years to develop. Acneiform lesions may develop over the affected area. BM may be associated with other findings related to ectodermal abnormalities known as Becker nevus syndrome. Reported associations include smooth muscle hamartomas, hypoplasia of the breast, pectoral muscle and fat, limb hypertrophy, adrenal gland hyperplasia, and accessory scrotum. A rare association with melanoma has been reported. Once developed, the natural course is for the lesions to persist indefinitely. The hypertrichosis typically develops after the hyperpigmentation and the hairs become progressively coarse with time. Some recent studies have suggested that hypertrichosis may not be associated with a majority of the case of BM.
