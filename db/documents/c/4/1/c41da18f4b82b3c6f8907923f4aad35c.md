There are multiple causative factors of tubulointerstitial nephritis, such as drug-induced, idiopathic, genetic, immune-mediated, and infectious (viral, bacterial, parasitic, or fungal). Associated are systemic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren disease, immunoglobulin G4 associated autoimmune disease (interstitial infiltration of IG4 positive plasma cell and C3 deposition), tubulointerstitial nephritis, and uveitis syndrome.

TIN is the third leading cause of renal transplant dysfunction, whereas transplant rejection in already immunocompromised patients is mainly due to infections, including polyomavirus or cytomegalovirus. Bone marrow transplant recipients are mainly associated with necrotizing TIN due to adenovirus. TIN and uveitis syndrome are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus and bacteria like leptospira, mycoplasma, and yersinia.
