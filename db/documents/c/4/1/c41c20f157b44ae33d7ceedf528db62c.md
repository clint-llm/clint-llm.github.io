Infantile colic is a benign and self-limiting condition that typically resolves spontaneously between three and four months of age. However, there are some indications that infants with colic may be at more risk for developing migraines without aura by age 18. There is also evidence linking excessive crying early in life with preschool adaptive problems, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other behavioral problems, as well as being associated with maternal anxiety and depression. Thus, counseling parents regarding colic andÂ helping them to develop coping mechanisms, as well as offering suggestions on the management of colic symptoms, seems prudent.
