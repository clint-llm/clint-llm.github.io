Literature has reported relatively good outcomes and has used functional parameters to assess prognosis. In 62 to 85% of cases, there is a good voice outcome, with good airway outcomes achieved in 76 to 97% of cases.

Age has a direct influence on prognosis as an older patient tends to have poor outcomes, especially if over 70 years of age.
