Viral agents most often cause upper airway obstruction in the pediatric age group. Bacterial causes such as diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, and epiglottitis are fairly uncommon especially since the introduction of vaccination with Haemophilus influenzae type b Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Pneumococcal vaccines. Males are slightly more commonly affected by croup than females. Viruses including parainfluenza and influenza are the most common viral etiological agents.

Foreign body aspirations are common in young children between 2 to 5 years of age. Laryngomalacia is a  chronic cause of upper  airway obstruction and is the most common laryngeal anomaly in the infant age group. It is a frequent cause of "noisy breathing," and does not always cause physiologically significant airway obstruction.

Odynophagia may be indicative of peritonsillar (quinsy), lingual, or retropharyngeal infecetion or abscess formation.
