The coronary arteries provide the main blood supply to the heart. The coronary arteries also supply the myocardium with oxygen to allow for the contraction of the heart and thus causing circulation of the blood throughout the body. Two main coronary arteries originate from the base of the aorta as it exits the left ventricle: the left and right coronary arteries. These arteries further branch into smaller arteries to supply specific parts of the heart like the atria, ventricles, SA, and AV nodes. It is important to realize that the paths these arteries take may vary slightly from person to person.
