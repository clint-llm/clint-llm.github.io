The posterior tibial nerve is a mixed motor and sensory nerve and courses around the medial malleolus and below the flexor retinacula in the tarsal tunnel. Distal to the medial malleolus, it divides into its terminal branches: lateral plantar, medial plantar, and calcaneal. These branches provide sensory innervation to the plantar foot: the main calcaneal branch supplies the medial plantar heel while the medial and lateral plantar nerves innervate the remainder of the sole of the foot. Proximally, the articular branch of its origin, the tibial nerve, carries sensory information from the knee joint and the sural nerve branch, which runs distal with the small saphenous vein and anastomoses with a peroneal nerve branch, terminates as the lateral dorsal cutaneous nerve of the foot with this distal portion being a part of the posterior tibial nerve. Motor innervation by the posterior tibial nerve gets directed to the intrinsic plantar musculature. Specifically, the medial branch innervates the first lumbrical, flexor hallucis brevis, flexor digitorum brevis, and abductor hallucis, while the lateral branch supplies the plantar muscles of the foot. The posterior tibial nerve is not responsible for any reflexes.
