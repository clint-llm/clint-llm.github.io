The microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis with typical raised epithelial punctate lesions usually resolves without any long-term sequelae or residual effect. However, there is another spectrum of the disease wherein subepithelial infiltrates appear and may leave behind sub-epithelial scars if not adequately treated with topical steroids.

Other sequelae can be limbitis, endotheliitis, and keratic precipitates.

The microsporidial stromal keratitis often remits to recur again until removed in toto by penetrating keratoplasty.
