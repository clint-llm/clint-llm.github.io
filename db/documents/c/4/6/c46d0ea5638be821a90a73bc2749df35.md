The nares are the anterior opening of the nasal sinuses. 5 to 7 cm posterior to the nares the nasal sinus connects to the nasopharynx, which is continuous with the oropharynx. The length of the pharynx from the base of the skull to the start of the esophagus is 12 to 14 cm. The esophagus starts at the upper esophageal sphincter, the cricopharyngeus, and runs down through the diaphragm to the stomach for a length of approximately 25 cm. While the stomach is a highly distensible structure and therefore, can vary in length, the empty stomach is generally around 25 cm long. Thus if one intended to place a tube through the nares and place it in the middle of the stomach, then approximately 55 cm of the tube should be inserted.

There are several methods to estimate the depth that an NG should be placed. All methods for estimation will have some margin of error.
