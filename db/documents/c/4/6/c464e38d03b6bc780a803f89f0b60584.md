Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a rare disease that most commonly occurs in premature infants but can be seen in adults as well. Pathology involves lung damage through alveolar and airway over-distention that can get complicated with air leaks. It must be diagnosed and treated promptly to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pulmonary interstitial emphysema and discusses the roles of interprofessional teams in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation process for pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
- Summarize the management options available for pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
- Discuss inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pulmonary interstitial emphysema and improve outcomes.
