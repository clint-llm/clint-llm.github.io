Bilirubin is known to exert an antioxidant effect which may be protective.

In summary, Gilbert syndrome is a benign, inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism without the risk of progressive liver disease, hepatic decompensation, or increased mortality. Unnecessary testing should be avoided, and patients should be followed conservatively. Moreover, patients with this disorder may benefit from enhanced cardioprotective and anti-neoplastic effects for the reasons discussed above.
