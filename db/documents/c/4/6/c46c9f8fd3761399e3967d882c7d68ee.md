Care is necessary for diagnosis, which should come from history and clinical examination. For instance, an adolescent male who presents with a sudden onset of severe testicular pain with progressive scrotal swelling over the previous few hours, who on examination demonstrates a tender and high lying testis most likely has testicular torsion and would benefit from emergency scrotal exploration and orchidopexy. This presentation compares to a patient with recent symptoms of urinaryÂ tract infection, fever, and subsequent scrotal swelling. They may likely have orchiepididimytis. It is, however, important to have a high index of suspicion in these cases as testicular tumors may sometimes precipitate torsions in these patients.
