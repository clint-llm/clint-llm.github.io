The primary issue of concern with the COBRA and EMTALA laws is that the terminology used is vague and, therefore, open to interpretations.

HMOs and other such insurance programs are often not held liable for these violations while they gatekeep the care their clients receive. While insurance programs are not penalized or pay for this service, physicians and hospitals do not receive compensation for the treatment of uninsured and underinsured patients.

Of all the investigations performed by CMS, 40% were violations, but only 3% resulted in fines.

About 20% of EMTALA violations settlements between 2002 and 2018 included psychiatric emergencies.
