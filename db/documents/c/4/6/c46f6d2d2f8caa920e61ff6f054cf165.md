The most common side effect of setmelanotide is a hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site, which can lead to blistering, burning, hives, inflammation, infection, itching, lumps, and discoloration of the skin

Skin hyperpigmentation occurs because the melanocortin receptors are expressed on melanocytes, and activation of this receptor leads to the accumulation of melanin, thereby increasing skin pigmentation, independent of ultraviolet light.

Sexual dysfunctions are noted in male and female patients treated with setmelanotide, including spontaneous penile erection in males, and sexual adverse reactions, including labial hypersensitivity in females.

Kühnen P et al. mention that patients with severe obesity are 30% more likely to have depression than non-obese patients; however, setmelanotide can cause depression and suicidal ideation as a side effect.

Setmelatonide is not approved for use in neonates or infants because it contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative which can cause fatal adverse reactions, including gasping syndrome.
