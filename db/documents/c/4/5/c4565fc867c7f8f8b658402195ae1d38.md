During the sixth to tenth weeks post-fertilization, physiologic herniation and rotation of the embryonic bowel occur at the midgut. Herniation of the midgut involves the projection of the embryologic bowel into the developing umbilical cord within the yolk stalk, or vitelline, omphaloenteric, or omphalomesenteric duct. At the base of the umbilical cord, the midgut undergoes two episodes of physiologic rotation. Initially, the midgut rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise using the superior mesenteric artery as an axis. The midgut then returns to the abdomen as the abdominal cavity has enlarged. The second rotation is 180 degrees counterclockwise and takes place around ten weeks post-fertilization. In total, 270 degrees of rotation occur. This herniation occurs due to a lack of space inside the abdominal cavity. The fetal midgut, kidneys, and liver are large at this time. The abdominal cavity, however, grows at a much slower rate than the midgut. Herniation allows the midgut enough space to grow rapidly outside of the peritoneum in the extra-embryonic coelom. Upon completion of herniation and rotation, the yolk stalk degenerates. Degeneration commonly occurs in the seventh week of gestation.

The yolk stalk is connected to the midgut prior to herniation and is commonly referred to as the vitelline duct by clinicians. In approximately 2% of people, the vitelline duct fails to degenerate and persists. This outcome results in a gastrointestinal outpouching called Meckel's diverticulum, characterized by a complete or partial opening between the umbilicus and the bowel. Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. In its classically described form, it sits within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve and measures approximately 2 inches long. However, Meckel's diverticulum is highly variable in appearance, and it may be asymptomatic or manifest as symptoms of its heterotopic gastric or pancreatic mucosa that is often present. For example, as heterotopic gastric mucosa produces acid in the bowel, it may cause gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and eventual perforation if left untreated.

A patent urachus is a rare congenital anomaly in which the urinary bladder remains connected to the outside world via the umbilicus. This occurs due to a failed involution of the urachus. It often presents in neonates with urine leakage from the umbilicus after birth. If the urachus only partially involutes, a fluid-filled urachal cyst is formed. Complications of urachal anomalies include infection, urachal neoplasms, stone formation, and umbilical granulomas.
