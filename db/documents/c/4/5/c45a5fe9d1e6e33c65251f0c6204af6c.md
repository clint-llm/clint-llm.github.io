Bone marrow aspiration and biopsies are often performed both in the inpatient and outpatient settings for the diagnosis of a multitude of hematologic disorders. Both the palpation-guided and computed tomography-guided (CT-guided) approaches are commonly utilized for performing this procedure. Both procedural methods have a high degree of accuracy and a low complication rate.

The proper procedural steps in performing a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy will be explained as well as the roles of the interprofessional care team in managing patients who undergo this procedure. The steps involved in performing a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, as well as the required personnel and materials, should be thoroughly understood prior to performing the procedure in order to avoid inadequate sampling or adverse patient outcomes. Additionally, the healthcare professional’s better understanding of the indications, perioperative management, and complications of this procedure can improve both patient experience and better diagnostic accuracy.
