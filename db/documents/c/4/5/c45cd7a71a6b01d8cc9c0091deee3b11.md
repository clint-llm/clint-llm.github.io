The majority of patients have a history of witnessed episodes of sleepwalking with no memory of the event. Sometimes, the spouse reports episodes of sleepwalking and performing actions such as relocating belongings in the room. There have also been reports of concomitant sleep talking and inappropriate sexual behavior during sleep. Other patients have presented with "abnormal activity at night," for example, waking up to find uneaten food left out in the kitchen in the morning. These behaviors are usually intermittent, and patients do not promptly seek medical attention. Physical examination fails to reveal any specific findings in the case of most patients.
