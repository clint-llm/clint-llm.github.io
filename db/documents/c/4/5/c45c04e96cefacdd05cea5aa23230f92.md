There are a variety of proposed mechanisms for the characteristic changes that occur with Chagas disease. There are also key mechanistic differences between sequelae caused by the acute versus chronic phase.

In acute infection, there is direct cellular and organ damage caused by the parasitic organism. During this phase, the organism will invade host cells and ultimately cause cell lysis.

In the absence of treatment, host immune responses will ultimately control the parasite replication and resolution of symptoms in 4 to 8 weeks.

The pathophysiology for the chronic phase of Chagas disease is less well understood. Current evidence suggests there is likely a persistent parasite infection of tissues that causes chronic inflammation resulting in organ dysfunction. There is also evidence that several T. cruzi antigens cross-react with normal tissue antigens and cause an autoimmune reaction.

Reactivation of Chagas disease following immunosuppression results in parasite replication, parasitemia, and clinical picture similar to acute infection, which is often more severe.
