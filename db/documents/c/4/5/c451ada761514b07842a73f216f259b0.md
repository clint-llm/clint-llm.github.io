Granular parakeratosis is a rare, benign, idiopathic condition that is best categorized as a reaction pattern rather than a distinct disease. The diagnosis of granular parakeratosis is made by histopathologic evaluation. A punch or shave biopsy should be completed for diagnosis.Â The confirmation of granular parakeratosis on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is adequate to confirm the diagnosis. On biopsy, a thickened stratum corneum is noted with abnormal retention of keratohyalin granules as well as an intact stratum granulosum.
