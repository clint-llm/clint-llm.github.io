Radiation therapy is frequently used in medicine as both a curative and palliative treatment modality. If a neoplasm metastasizes to the spine, patients may experience debilitating back pain and neurologic dysfunction when there is compression of the spinal cord. Loss of sensation, muscle strength, and bowel/bladder incontinence are clinical manifestations of spinal cord compression.

Palliative radiotherapy of the spine yields partial pain relief in almost two-thirds of patients, but complete pain alleviation is much less likely to occur in less than 15% of patients.

About half of patients diagnosed with cancer will undergo treatment with radiation therapy at some point, and 40% to 50% of patients who receive radiation therapy are treated in palliation. Furthermore, approximately 5% to 10% of cancer patients develop metastatic spinal cord compression during the course of their disease. The most common primary tumors that result in spinal cord compression derive from the breast, lung, and prostate. Multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkins lymphomas, and renal cell carcinomas also have a high frequency of spinal cord compression. In children, spinal cord compression is more likely due to sarcomas, neuroblastomas, and metastatic Wilm tumors.
