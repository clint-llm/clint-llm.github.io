Protein S deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by reduced activity of protein S, a plasma serine protease with complex roles in coagulation, inflammation, and apoptosis.

Protein S deficiency usually manifests as VTE, and any association between protein S deficiency and arterial thrombosis appears coincidental or weak. There is minimal evidence for arterial thrombosis in other forms of hereditary thrombophilias, such as protein C deficiency, antithrombin 3 deficiency, or factor V Leiden.
