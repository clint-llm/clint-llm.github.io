Adverse reactions associated with beta-lactamase inhibitors include gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, and constipation; nervous system effects such as headaches, insomnia, and seizures; hematological effects such as impaired platelet function; allergic reactions including anaphylaxis; pain at the injection site; and dermatologic side effects including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug-induced eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Gastrointestinal side effects can be less severe if the patient takes the medication with food and/or water. Beta-lactamase inhibitor use is also associated with Candida
albicans and Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infections.****It is important for clinicians to monitor patients for adverse effects routinely and discontinue therapy immediately if severe side effects occur.
