The diagnosis and management of normocytic normochromic anemia require an interprofessional team that includes a primary care provider, an internist, and, if relevant, a hematologist, a gastroenterologist, a gynecologist, a surgeon, and a nurse practitioner as well as other professional teams. The key is to find the underlying disease and, if already diagnosed, the treatment and management of the underlying disease. After the diagnosis of the underlying disease, appropriate treatment, in most cases, attenuates the anemia and prevents complications.
