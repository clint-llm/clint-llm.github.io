According to the Testicular Cancer Society: "The overall survival rate is greater than 95%. If diagnosed early, while the cancer is confined to the testicle, the survival rate is 99%. If the cancer has spread to regional lymph nodes, the survival rate is 96%, and even if there are distant metastases, the survival rate is over 70%."
