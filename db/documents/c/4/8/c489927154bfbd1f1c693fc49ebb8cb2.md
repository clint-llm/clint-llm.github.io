The most important complication of Felty syndrome is severe or recurrent infections, particularly of respiratory tract and skin, because of neutropenia. Other complications like anemia due to splenic sequestration and hemorrhage due to severe thrombocytopenia can also occur. Variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension is possible. Treatment modalities like splenectomy for refractory neutropenia can increase the risk of infections post-surgery and have been fatal in a few cases. G-CSF carries a small risk of exacerbation of underlying autoimmune disorder.
