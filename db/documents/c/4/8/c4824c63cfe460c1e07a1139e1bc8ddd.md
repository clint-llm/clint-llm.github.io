The current theory regarding the embryonic development of the arterial pattern of the hand suggests that development takes place by a combined process. At stage 12, an initial capillary network arises from the dorsal aorta and expands into the growing limb bud. At the same time, the proximal parts of this network begin to enlarge, and the arterial wall begins to differentiate by stage 13. From stages 13 to 21, differentiation occurs in a proximal to a distal sequence starting with the development of the ulnar, interosseous, and median arteries. At stage 18, the radial artery develops and acquires its final differentiated morphological state by stage 21. By stage 21, the definitive arterial pattern of the hand with the palmar arches is established.Â However, science does not yet fully understand the mechanisms that determine the development of the arterial pattern. One theory states that oxygenation, nutrient requirements, and hemodynamic forces are important influencers. Another theory suggests that the underlying mechanism may have a genetic component.
