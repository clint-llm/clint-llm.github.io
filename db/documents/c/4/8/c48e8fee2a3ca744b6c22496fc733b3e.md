G6PD is the catalyst in the rate-limiting first step of the pentose phosphate pathway, which uses glucose-6-phosphate to convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) into its reduced form, NADPH. In red blood cells, NADPH is critical in preventing damage to cellular structures caused by oxygen-free radicles. It does this by serving as a substrate to the enzyme glutathione reductase. Reduced glutathione can be used to convert hydrogen peroxide to water and prevent damage to cellular structures, particularly the cell wall of red blood cells (RBCs) since they have limited capacity for repair once mature.
