Approximately 400,000 individuals in the United States and 2.5 million individuals worldwide have multiple sclerosis.

MS demonstrates a prevalence based on latitude gradient with increased prevalence in northern latitudes of Europe and North America. Observations noting variable genetic susceptibility factors amongst different human subpopulations apart from latitude have also been documented, suggesting poorly understood genetic factors interacting with environmental ones. Various studies have noted that populations that migrate to areas of greater MS prevalence during childhood also adopt a higher risk of acquiring MS.
