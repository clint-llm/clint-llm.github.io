Aging has various effects on the sympathetic nervous system. Research has demonstrated that with increased age that baroreceptors of the heart decrease and become less sensitive; there is a compensatory increase in cardiovascular SANS activity and a reduction in PANS activity. However, both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity to the iris decreases with aging, which is consistent with the general decline of peripheral somatic nerve function.
