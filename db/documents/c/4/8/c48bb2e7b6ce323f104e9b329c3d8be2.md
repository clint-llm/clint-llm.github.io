The administration of iron supplementation can be both orally and parenterally. Oral iron therapy is the preferred route as it tends to be both affordable and effective in mild to moderate deficiency cases. In iron deficiency anemia, 100 to 200 mg elemental iron is given daily divided into two doses to adult patients. For severe iron deficiency or when oral treatment fails (or is intolerable), or in patients with impaired intestinal absorption, intravenous therapy can be the administration option. Both oral and intravenous iron is available in a variety of formulations.
