Ascaris lumbricoides, the causative agent of ascariasis, is the most common parasitic worm in humans. Ascariasis can be asymptomatic, causing only malnutrition and growth retardation, or it may present with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and diarrhea. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of ascariasis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the nematode Ascaris lumbricoides in the etiology of ascariasis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of ascariasis.
- Summarize the use of a stool exam to detect ova and parasites in the evaluation of ascariasis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected with ascariasis.
