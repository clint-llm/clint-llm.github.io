Trigger finger, or stenosing tenosynovitis, is tenosynovitis of the flexor sheaths that typically occurs in the 4th finger and thumb as a result of repetitive use. It is a common condition that can cause significant functional impairment. A narrowing of flexor pulley sheaths combined with hypertrophy and inflammation of the tendon/sheath interface causes this condition. Patients typically complain of locking of the digits during either flexion or extension and usually, extension is more problematic. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trigger finger and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of trigger finger. 
- Describe the population most at risk for developing trigger finger. 
- List the management options for trigger finger. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by trigger finger.
