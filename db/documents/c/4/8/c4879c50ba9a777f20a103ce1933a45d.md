Providers who assist in patient transfers should be trained, competent, and experienced. Patient transfers induce many physiologic changes that may be associated with increased risk to the patient. Adverse events that should be considered include: losing the patient wristband/identification, disconnected/obstructed lines, decreased/increased systolic blood pressure, loosened/kinked tubes, fractures, and change in mental status. Many guidelines exist to help providers transfer patients with the utmost care, and specific training is often recommended. As mentioned, pre-transport checklists help decrease the risk of adverse events that may arise, and proper technique will improve the transfer’s safety.

Unexpected events during transfers of critically ill intensive care unit patients can be reduced when an intensivist or medically qualified personnel accompanies the patient.

Depending on the setting, nurses are frequently involved in patient transfers. Transferring a patient may be considered a high-risk maneuver because of the potential harm posed to the patient and the provider. While there is no consistent method used to teach proper transfer techniques, simulation-based or hands-on training is encouraged in teaching these advanced patient handling methods.

Paraplegic patients are taught how to improve the upper extremities' strength and upper back muscles to improve transfers. A realistic goal for paraplegic patients is to become independent with transfers using a slide transfer board. While at a nursing home or a rehabilitation center, the occupational therapy the patient receives should include practicing transfers under various conditions. This will help the patient to adjust to different situations outside the nursing home.
