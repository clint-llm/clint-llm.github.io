A face is unique to each person and is the basis of their own identity. However, the embryological origin is the same for all humans and is similar to other mammals. The development is complex and involves the formation and coordination of various tissues to form the final product. The functions of a face (and head) include hearing, vision, breathing, tasting, feeding, facial expression, and many more. Facial development happens very early during embryogenesis, and facial abnormalities can often be disfiguring and devastating. Treatment is often delayed until after the birth when the patient is stable. Some facial disorders are preventable and caused by teratogens; patients are therefore strongly discouraged from ingesting harmful substances or participating in risky behavior if they are pregnant or believe they may be pregnant. This activity will provide a brief overview of the embryology of facial development and some related pathologies.
