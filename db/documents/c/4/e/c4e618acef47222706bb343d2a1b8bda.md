Typical Poland syndrome presentations are aesthetical complaints regarding chest asymmetry. Most patients are found to be asymptomatic.

The examination begins by assessing the anterior chest wall for asymmetry. The presentation of chest wall tissue deficiency is highly variable. The pathognomonic finding is the absence of the sternocostal head of the pectoralis major muscle. Other structures, which may be absent, include ribs 2 to 5, latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, and pectoralis minor. The presence or absence of the latissimus dorsi muscle is of great importance in terms of surgical planning. The sternum and ribs may appear distorted or hypoplastic. The ipsilateral breast and/or nipple-areola complex may be absent or hypoplastic. The ipsilateral hand may have defects such as syndactyly, microdactyly, brachysyndactyly, or hypoplasia of the hand.

The patient may also present with a variation of scoliosis and anterior chest wall defects such as pectus excavatum.
