Pediatric patients seem to have a lower risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia than adults, possibly due to fewer comorbidities. According to NHSN, 304 participating hospitals revealed ventilator-associated pneumonia rates of 2.36 to 2.08 per 1000 device-days among neonates weighing less than 750 grams and between 750 and 1,000 grams, respectively.

The estimated incidence of ventilator-associated infection in pediatric ICU ranges from 1.8 to 8.3 per 1000 ventilator days.
