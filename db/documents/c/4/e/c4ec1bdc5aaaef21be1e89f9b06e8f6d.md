The pathophysiology of odontogenic cysts depends on the type of cyst.

- Periapical cysts occur through an inflammatory process from non-vital teeth. Apical inflammation occurs due to a bacterial infection and/or pulpal necrosis and will form granulation tissue. The inflamed granulation tissue causes increased osmotic pressure that leads to the proliferation of the residual rest of Malassezia.

- Residual cysts are remnants of periapical cysts. They occur due to incomplete removal of periapical cysts during a previous tooth extraction.

- Paradental cysts are inflammatory in origin and arise from the junctional epithelium of the gingival sulcus or at the cementoenamel junction of the lateral erupted side of the tooth, often near the root furcation.

- Dentigerous cysts are developmental in origin and associated with an impacted tooth, which has failed to erupt. A dentigerous cyst develops as fluid accumulates between the enamel epithelium and dental enamel; the fluid dilates the dental follicles and ultimately prevents eruption.

- Eruption cysts are developmental in origin and occur due to the buildup of blood or fluid within expanding dental follicular space. The space develops due to the separation of dental follicles from the enamel of the erupting tooth.

- Lateral periodontal cysts are developmental in origin and arise from rests of the dental lamina at the lateral aspect of the root surface.

- Odontogenic keratocysts are developmental in origin and arise from the rests of the dental lamina.

- Orthokeratinizing odontogenic cysts are developmental in origin and arise from the rests of the dental lamina.

- Glandular odontogenic cysts are developmental in origin.
