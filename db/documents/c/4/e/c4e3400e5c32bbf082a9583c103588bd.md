Multifocal atrial tachycardia is most commonly associated with underlying pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, electrolyte abnormalities (mainly hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), drugs and chronic renal failure. This arrhythmia is associated with significant lung disease in 60% of cases and has been found in 20% of patients with acute respiratory failure and 17% of patients hospitalized with COPD. It has also been associated with conditions such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, the post-operative period after major surgery, pulmonary artery hypertension and the use of medications such as aminophylline, theophylline, and isoproterenol.
