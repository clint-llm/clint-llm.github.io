Pregabalin is structurally similar to the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It has been modified to be a lipophilic analog to enhance diffusion across the blood-brain barrier. However, pregabalin does not directly bind to GABA-A or GABA-B receptors. Additionally, it is not metabolized to a GABA receptor agonist. In animal models, pregabalin binds to presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels at the alpha-2-delta subunit in central nervous system tissues. The binding of the alpha-2-delta subunit decreases the depolarization-induced influx of calcium into neurons and reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. This action may account for the anticonvulsant and analgesic effects of pregabalin. Pregabalin has no known activity at sodium channels, dopamine receptors, serotonin receptors, opiate receptors and does not modify cyclooxygenase activity.
