The Salter-Harris classification system is a method used to grade fractures that occur in children and involve the growth plate, which is also known as the physis or physial plate. The classification system grades fractures according to the involvement of the physis, metaphysis, and epiphysis. The fracture grade has important implications for both prognosis and treatment. Most of these injuries occur during a child's growth spurt when physes are the weakest. Active children are the most likely to encounter injuries involving the growth plate as the ligaments and joint capsules surrounding the growth plate tend to be much stronger and more stable. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Saltar-Harris fractures and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Salter-Harris fractures.
- Describe the evaluation of Salter-Harris fractures.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Salter-Harris fractures.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of Salter-Harris fractures and improve outcomes.
