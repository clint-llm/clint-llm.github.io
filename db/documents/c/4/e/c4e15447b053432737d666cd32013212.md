Neutropenia is defined as a number of neutrophils, a type of granulated white blood cell, less than 1500/microliter, in the body. It is multifactorial in origin as either by decreased production, sequestration from endothelium and tissues, and increased peripheral destruction. Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) is described as a reduced number of neutrophils resulting from increased peripheral destruction by antineutrophil antibodies from autoimmune disorders.

AIN can be considered as chronic neutropenia if it lasts for more than 3 months and without attributable to any etiology. Chronic neutropenia can be either idiopathic or involve other etiologies of autoimmune neutropenia. AIN is categorized as primary and secondary, according to etiology and pathogenesis. The primary form of AIN is dominant in children, and it presents commonly as a hematologic abnormality and bonemarrow hypoplasia and secondary form of AIN present in adults as autoimmune disorders, primary immune deficiencies, infections, hematologic malignancies, or drug exposure. AIN is also prevalent in post-transplant patients as well as in some neurological diseases.

The clinical manifestations of AIN may vary from being asymptomatic to life-threatening infections in individuals. In the pediatric population, it can lead to recurring infections, hematologic malignancies, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
