# Continuing Education Activity

Chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, is a complex multisystem disease commonly characterized by severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep problems, autonomic dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise, which can severely impair patients' ability to conduct the activities of daily living. Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to prevent high morbidity and its overwhelming effect on the quality of life. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of chronic fatigue syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for chronic fatigue syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ensure the best outcomes for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

# Introduction

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic disease that potentially affects about two million Americans.

CFS does not only present with fatigue but also cognitive dysfunction and impairment of routine functioning that persists for six months or more. CFS is a biological condition, not a psychological disorder. The exact pathogenesis remains to be fully understood. Various mechanisms and biochemical changes have been implicated that affect immune function, hormonal regulation, and response to oxidative stress. It also includes natural killer cell dysfunction and/or T-cell dysfunction, elevated cytokines, and autoantibodies.

Patients with CFS can sometimes present to the emergency department with a list of complex symptoms, such as orthostatic intolerance, postexertional malaise (PEM), fatigue, and diarrhea.

# Etiology

The etiology of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is controversial, complicated, and incompletely understood. Controversy exists about single versus multiple causations. Many theories exist regarding the involvement of infections, the immune system, and genetics in this complex interplay.

**Genetics**

Increasing evidence supports the role of genetic susceptibility in patients with CFS. Many studies have reported the role of family history in the development of CFS or similar fatigue-like symptoms.

**Infection**

Various infectious etiologies, including the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, and the human parvovirus B19, are hypothesized to trigger the disease.

Speculations are that in a few patients, the acquisition of viral infections like infectious mononucleosis triggers the onset of the disease process.

Researchers have detected anti-HHV-6 IgM antibodies and HHV-6 antigens more commonly in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome than in the general population, indicating higher prevalence and higher reactivation of the virus in this cohort.

Parvovirus B19, both with and without viremia, has been implicated in developing and triggering chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Alterations in the Immune System**

It has been observed that alterations in the levels of CD 21+ CD19+ and activated CD5+ cells in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

There is also a reported decrease in transitional B cells and plasmablasts and an increase in the population of CD24+ B cells in these patients.

# Epidemiology

Studies have given different prevalence rates for chronic fatigue syndrome based on the type of definition used, the type of population surveyed, and the study design used.

Studies have found that the prevalence is significantly higher between 40 and 70 years of age.

# Pathophysiology

**Alterations in the Immune System**

The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to chronic fatigue syndrome are not entirely understood.

There is evidence of ongoing inflammation, as indicated by increased production of various proinflammatory interleukins, which also explains malaise and flu-like symptoms about which the patients often complain.

**Increased Oxidative Stress**

Some studies report chronic fatigue syndrome patients to have significantly increased oxidative stress, which plays a vital role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. There is an increase in oxidative stress biomarkers like oxidized LDL and certain prostaglandins and, at the same time, a decrease in the amounts of the antioxidants like glutathione.

**Oligoadenylate Synthetase/RNase L Pathway**

The association between the onset of CFS with a viral infection has always been speculated. One of the interferon-activated antiviral pathways involves activating the 2’-5’-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase/RNase L system.

**Alteration of Natural Killer (NK) Cells**

Studies have shown a lower number of CD3-CD57 white cells lymphocytes, which are a type of NK cell, whereas the levels of the cytotoxic T cells were not changed.

**B Cell Impairment**

The profile of B cell subpopulations may differ in CFS compared with controls. CFS is associated with increased production of the CD20+ CD5+ B cell phenotypes correlating with increased autoantibody production and overexpression of CD21 markers acting as receptors for some viruses.

**Immunoglobulins**

There is also an alteration in the immunoglobulin number and distribution in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. The total immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, particularly subclasses IgG1 and IgG3, is substantially lower. In contrast, there is an increase in IgA and IgM serum levels against the lipopolysaccharides of the normal gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gut permeability.

**Autoimmunity**

Studies have also detected autoantibodies against certain neurotransmitters and neurons, leading to alterations in neurotransmitter response, sleep patterns, and neurocognition.

**Alterations in the Central Nervous System**

**Neuroinflammation and Role of Glial Cells**

The presence of proinflammatory changes causes speculation about the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation of the disease process.

**Neuronal Sensitization**

The hypothesis about neuronal sensitization proposes an exaggerated response to painful stimuli in patients with CFS due to the chemical and structural changes at the central nervous system level.

**Alterations in the Neuroendocrine System**

**Changes in Serotonin Transmission**

Central fatigue, a key symptom in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, is hypothesized to be due to excess levels of serotonin and its metabolites in the central nervous system of these patients.

**Hypocortisolism**

It is also theorized that there are low circulating cortisol levels in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome secondary to dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Cortisol is the principal hormone of the HPA and leads to the cortisol awakening response (CAR). This response is deficient in patients with CFS, leading to the post-exertional malaise.

**Genetic Predisposition**

Studies have shown an interaction between changes in the genes secondary to changes in the environment, leading to epigenetic modification. DNA methylation appears to be the most studied of these epigenetic modifications that can alter the expression of the gene concerning the environmental stimuli and lead to the development of the disease process.

# History and Physical

The hallmark symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome is the post-exertional fatigue associated with numerous neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal complaints.

Patients can also report joint pains, and there could be an associated autoimmune rheumatological condition.

# Evaluation

Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a diagnosis made on clinical examination after excluding other possible etiologies.

Initially, when the etiological considerations were considered mainly viral in origin, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S.A., in 1988, came up with the criterion for the same with the primary focus on the physical symptoms. The Oxford criterion was developed in 1991 and defined a case of chronic fatigue syndrome where mild to severe symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, and tiredness were present.

Subsequent conclusions stated that the Oxford criterion was over-inclusive and had a low threshold that recruited patients with milder symptoms, leading to the generalization of treatments for all patients. Hence, the treatment guidelines could not be generalized to patients with severe symptoms, chronic pain, post-exertional malaise, and other conditions that mimicked chronic fatigue syndrome.

Considering the need for revision of the diagnostic criterion, the CDC, in the year 1994, came up with a broader definition for chronic fatigue syndrome developed by Fakuda and colleagues.

The modified CDC criterion was extensively used until 2015, when the institute of medicine (IOM) proposed the criterion to diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome.

**2015 IOM Diagnostic Criteria for CFS**

Diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome requires the presence of the following three symptoms for more than six months as well as the intensity of the symptoms should be moderate or severe for at least 50% of the time.

The three main symptoms include:

- Fatigue - A noticeable decrease or impairment in a patient's ability to engage in activities they would have enjoyed before the onset of the illness. This impairment continues for more than six months and is associated with new-onset severe fatigue unrelated to exertion and not relieved by rest.

- Post-exertional malaise - Patients experience worsening symptoms and function after exposure to physical or cognitive stressors, which they previously well tolerated.

- Unrefreshing sleep - patients feel tired after a night's sleep.

Criterion fulfillment for diagnosis requires the three above-stated symptoms plus one of the additional below-mentioned symptoms.

- Cognitive impairment - Problems with the thought or executive function worsened by exertion, effort, stress, or time pressure.

- Orthostatic intolerance - Worsening of symptoms upon assuming and maintaining an upright posture. Although not necessarily abolished, symptoms are improved by lying back down or elevating the feet.

The typical approach to a patient with chronic fatigue should begin with a history and physical examination, identifying the underlying symptoms and ruling out any serious illnesses. The providers should use a validated clinical questionnaire like the DePaul symptom questionnaire or the Center for Disease Control Symptom Inventory.

There are no pathognomonic or diagnostic tests or single biomarkers of CFS. Tests to rule out other etiologies are undertaken in the context of the particular patient. The standard laboratory tests include urinalysis, complete blood count with differential, blood chemistries, thyroid function tests, muscle enzymes like creatine kinases, and C- reactive protein.

# Treatment / Management

**Non-Pharmacologic Management**

There is some debate about the appropriate treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome. A randomized control trial conducted in 2011 in the United Kingdom compared the effectiveness and safety of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), adaptive pacing therapy (APT), and specialist medical care in the management of chronic fatigue syndrome. Overcoming fatigue and improvement of physical function were taken as measures of effectiveness, while safety assessment comprised recording all adverse effects. The results showed that CBT and GET improved outcomes when used together, whereas APT was not a helpful addition.

Further analysis of the available data questions the statistical significance of the benefit of CBT and GET.

Treatment for any comorbid condition should be undertaken to minimize symptom burden.

During the CBT sessions, the therapist emphasizes the role of the thought process and its impact on the patient's actions and feelings and recognizes behaviors that cause them to feel more tired and minimize them. Multiple trials and Cochrane reviews have shown the positive benefits of CBT on improving fatigue, mood, and post-exertional malaise in both adolescent and adult patients.

GET involves a supervised, gradual increase in the duration and intensity of physical activity. After the PACE trial, this therapy got much publicity, which showed effectiveness for fatigue and functional impairment with the GET.

Activity management is also called pacing. The goal is to learn to balance rest and activity to avoid flare-ups. These can be caused by exertion that patients cannot tolerate.

**Pharmacologic Management**

**Pain Medications**

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including COX-2 inhibitors, are used due to their action in relieving pain and associated inflammation.

**Tricyclic Antidepressants**

Multiple tricyclic antidepressants have shown varying degrees of success in improving sleep, pain levels, and fatigue severity.

**Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI)**

Many SSRIs like fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine have been used to treat depression and anxiety, which either accompany the disease process of chronic fatigue syndrome or occur as a consequence. SNRIs have the added benefit of providing neuropathic pain relief besides the antidepressant effect. However, neither SSRIs nor SSNRIs directly affect the underlying pathophysiology of the disease process.

**Antiviral Therapy**

Several antiviral medications have been tried in these patients, but most of these studies have been inconclusive.

**Immunoglobulin**

A systemic review conducted by Whiting et al. in 2001 evaluated five randomized controlled trials on the use of immunoglobulins in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. It revealed positive results in four of them.

**Corticosteroids**

Multiple RCTs and systemic reviews performed with steroids in 2005 showed varying responses. One systemic review conducted in 2015 showed a weak benefit from low-dose hydrocortisone, but the effect was only short-lived and was associated with adverse effects.

**Complementary and Alternative Medicines**

Systemic reviews of the studies using essential fatty acids, magnesium, acetyl-l-carnitine, vitamin B12, and antioxidants have shown only partial response and require further studies to establish a definitive relation.

**Newer Treatments and Trials**

**Rintatolimod**

Rintatolimod is a newly approved immunomodulator and an antiviral drug for treating chronic fatigue syndrome in Canada and Europe.

**Rituximab**

Rituximab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody causing the depletion of B cells. An initial small double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 30 patients with CFS receiving rituximab showed some benefit, leading the researchers to hypothesize that B cells might have a significant role in the pathogenesis of some patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Fecal Microbiota Transplantation**

Alteration in gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in CFS patients has been hypothesized as one of the etiologies.

Even though there has been some success with the fecal microbiota, it is still too early to conclude anything. However, it opens doors for future research in this direction.

# Differential Diagnosis

Chronic fatigue syndrome can potentially affect the instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as cleaning, laundry, driving, and managing finances.

**Chronic Fatigue**

Even though chronic fatigue syndrome has fatigue as one of the three mandatory symptoms, it is a complex multisystem neurological disease with evidence of inflammation in the brain, hence the term myalgic encephalomyelitis.

**Rheumatological Disorders**

Fibromyalgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, polymyositis, and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren syndrome present a significant diagnostic dilemma for the provider.

**Psychiatric Disorders**

Roughly 20% of the patients presenting to primary care clinics have an underlying undiagnosed depressive illness, and targeted mental health history is critical.

**Endocrine Disorders**

There could be adrenal abnormalities (Addison disease, adrenal insufficiency, Cushing disease), thyroid abnormalities (both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), and diabetes mellitus, which can mimic symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.

**Hematological and Oncologic Disorders**

Undiagnosed malignancies can present with symptoms of fatigue and warrant a search for underlying cancer with age-appropriate screening. However, age alone should not be the only determining criterion for ordering these screenings.

**Infectious Diseases**

Infectious diseases like the human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and chronic hepatitis can have ongoing fatigue as their initial presentation.

**Gastrointestinal Disorders**

Inflammatory bowel disease can present with chronic fatigue symptoms.

**Neurological Disorders**

Fatigue is the main presenting feature of multiple sclerosis.

**Age-related Orthostatic Hypotension**

It is again imperative to recognize that there are age-related changes in blood vessels, causing decreased autonomic responsiveness, which worsens with inadequate fluid intake and polypharmacy.

**Respiratory Disorders**

Chronic respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sarcoidosis can present with chronic fatigue.

**Sleep Apnea**

Undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea can present with fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, two of the main diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. This is diagnosed by polysomnography.

# Prognosis

Chronic fatigue syndrome has no cure, and the symptoms can persist for years. Its clinical course fluctuates between remissions and relapses. According to one prospective study, around 50% of patients with CFS may return to part-time or full-time work.

Favorable outcomes are associated with less severity of fatigue at baseline, a better sense of control over symptoms, and the absence of any attribution of the disease to a physical cause.

# Complications

As in any chronic illness, it is very common for people with chronic fatigue syndrome to experience depression, stress, and anxiety. While chronic fatigue syndrome is not a psychological condition, it is debilitating. Good days or bad days can be unpredictable. Patients experience ongoing challenges in their education, career, and personal life, as they work to balance how they feel about their obligations and desires. Many people with CFS describe feeling demoralized or even, at times, hopeless.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Living with chronic fatigue syndrome can be stressful, as the symptoms can affect the quality of life. Most people are generally healthy and active before developing CFS, making it particularly distressing. The most crucial factor for patients to successfully cope with CFS is establishing a strong relationship with an experienced health care provider. Having a provider that patients can trust, who listens to them and understands that their symptoms are real, can be validating and helpful. While it is discouraging to know that there is no quick cure for CFS, an experienced provider can work with the patient to find ways to manage their symptoms and maximize their quality of life.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Chronic fatigue syndrome frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. The hallmark symptom is the post-exertional fatigue associated with numerous neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal complaints. Patients can also exhibit uncontrolled anxiety, panic attacks, and impaired social functioning. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a diagnosis made on clinical examination after excluding other possible etiologies. Therefore, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists, including a pain specialist, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, nursing staff, other clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, or PAs), and possibly a physical therapist and/or pharmacist, depending on the treatment course taken. Even though chronic fatigue syndrome has fatigue as one of the three mandatory symptoms, it is a complex multisystem neurological disease with evidence of inflammation in the brain. As the term myalgic encephalomyelitis indicates, a neurology consultation can be useful when indicated.

All interprofessional team members must follow the patient and record and progress or deterioration of their condition and inform other team members so changes in the management approach can occur if necessary. Open communication and diligent documentation are essential to the interprofessional strategy so that all team members can access the same patient data. This will help drive better outcomes. [Level 5]

The primary non-pharmacological treatment modalities are cognitive behavior therapy and graded exercise therapy. There is a wide range of medications that can be used for CFS. They range from NSAIDs to antidepressants; therefore, a pharmacy consult is in order. The pharmacist can perform medication reconciliation and check medication dosing, reporting any concerns to the other team members as appropriate.

A broad range of differential diagnoses should be considered before diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome. However, consultation with an interprofessional healthcare team is recommended to improve outcomes.
