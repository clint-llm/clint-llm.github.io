While primary bone cancerÂ is most often idiopathic, risk factors also play a role in developing this cancer.

- Genetic factors are linked. Germline abnormalities in hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes have an increased risk of later developing bone cancer through downregulation of tumor suppressor genes or upregulation of oncogenes. TP53 tumor suppressor gene is often altered in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, with patients at an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Similarly, a mutation in the Rb1 gene leading to hereditary retinoblastoma is linked to osteosarcoma. Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes are also linked to an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma.

- Previous treatment for cancer with radiotherapy is linked to an increased risk of developing PBC in later life, particularly when exposed to ionizing radiation in childhood.

- Several benign conditions show the potential to progress to PBC. Paget disease of the bone is a condition characterized by a disorder of bone metabolism, particularly osteoclastic function. These patients are at an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma; however, it is a rare complication. Enchondromas and osteochondromas are benign cartilaginous neoplasms that can later develop into malignant chondrosarcoma.
