Evaluation of a malar rash is based on the causative condition.

**Cellulitis and Erysipelas**

In general, no laboratory workup is required for uncomplicated cases of erysipelas and cellulitis. In toxic patients, laboratory blood test like complete blood count (CBC) with differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) is recommended.

**SLE**

Malar rash of systemic lupus erythematosus may precede other symptoms of SLE by months and years or may appear along with other symptoms of acute SLE. laboratory findings in isolated malar rash are similar to SLE such as positive ANA, CRP, ESR. Histopathologic examination of the skin will support the laboratory tests.

**Dermatomyositis**

Diagnosis of a malar rash of dermatomyositis in a patient with no clinical signs of muscle disease is a skin biopsy. Patients with the only clinical presentation of skin disease should be evaluated for concomitant muscle disease. Patients should be evaluated every 2 to 3 months for serum CK level and aldolase along with muscle examination.

**Rosacea**

The diagnosis is made clinically.

**Pellagra**

The diagnosis of pellagra is based on clinical presentation and response to niacin (Vitamin B3) treatment. the laboratory tests that support the diagnosis of pellagra are as follows: Blood count (anemia), hypoproteinemia,Â  low phosphorus, high level of calcium, low serum niacin level, NADP and NAD levels. low urinary levels of N-methyl nicotinamide.
