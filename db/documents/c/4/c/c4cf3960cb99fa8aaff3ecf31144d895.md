There are no universally accepted guidelines that outline strict/absolute contraindications for OAPS, as there are many life-saving procedures that are needed to be performed on patients regardless of their underlying comorbidities. Nonetheless, a thorough and pertinent history and physical exam should be performed on every patient to assess the patient's overall perioperative health. The ASA Physical Status Classification System, created in 1941, is a valuable grading system that is used to evaluate and communicate a patient's level of overall perioperative health before surgery and the administration of anesthesia:

- ASA class I represents normal healthy patients

- ASA class II represents patients with mild systemic disease(s)

- ASA class III represents patients with severe systemic disease(s)

- ASA class IV represents patients with severe systemic disease(s) that pose a constant threat to life

- ASA class V represents patients who are moribund and not expected to survive without the operation

- ASA class IV represents patients who are declared brain-dead and whose organs are being harvested for donor purposes

Additionally, multiple tools can aid in the perioperative risk stratification of patients before surgery and anesthesia. Examples include the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) calculator and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI).

Alternative anesthetic techniques should be considered for patients with significant comorbidities, and careful consideration should be given to the setting where anesthesia is being administered. For example, anesthesia for patients considered ASA III and beyond might be best administered in the hospital/inpatient rather than outpatient clinic setting. Additionally, OAPS should only be performed by those with the appropriate training and certification outlined by their respective governing bodies.
