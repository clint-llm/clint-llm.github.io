Hemangiomas within the oral mucosa can be diagnosed clinically, without the need for lab work or additional imaging. If treatment is desired, a color-doppler ultrasound is often the first-line imaging modality as it can readily provide morphological and vascular information while being cost-effective, non-invasive, and without the risk of radiation. If an intraosseous or intramuscular hemangioma is suspected, a contrast-enhanced MRI would be the imaging modality of choice and is considered superior to CT scan. Generally, a biopsy of OHs is avoided due to a high risk of bleeding. However, a biopsy would be recommended if a malignant process is suspected.
