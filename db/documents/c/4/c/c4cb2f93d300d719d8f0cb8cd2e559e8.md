Oseltamivir is used widely worldwide for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza illness, both confirmed and suspected cases.

When suspicion of influenza illness exists during the viral season in any adult or pediatric patient with chronic conditions or severe disease requiring hospitalization, the treating clinician must initiate oseltamivir treatment immediately, regardless of the duration of symptoms.

In pediatric and geriatric patients and neurodevelopmentally challenged patients, the treating clinician must partner with the nursing staff and family members to prepare the proper oseltamivir that the patient will tolerate without side effects. In addition, a pharmacist must perform medication reconciliation and dispense the appropriate dosage form of oseltamivir. In overdose, a medical toxicologist should be consulted. Intensivist and pulmonologist consultation is vital in case of respiratory failure to deliver optimal ventilatory support in critically ill patients.
