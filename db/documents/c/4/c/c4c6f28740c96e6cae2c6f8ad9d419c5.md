Just as the etiologies of the disorders remain unclear, so too is the subsequent pathophysiology. Studies are currently underway to discover functional and structural abnormalities in the brain of individuals with personality disorders. Sparse research has revealed unique, abnormal neurobiological findings, especially in schizotypal, borderline personality disorder (BPD), antisocial, and paranoid personality disorders. Findings in paranoid personality disorder point to altered amygdala functioning; in schizotypal personality disorder, a volumetric decrease in the frontal lobe, along with dysfunctional temporal lobe cingulum; and in BPD, significantly decreased responsiveness of midline regions of the prefrontal cortex, resulting in a dysfunctional top-down control of the affective response. Further studies have identified curious physiological findings in disorders such as antisocial, including low resting pulse and low skin conductance.
