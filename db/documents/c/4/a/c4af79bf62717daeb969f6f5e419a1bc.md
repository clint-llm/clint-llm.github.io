Testes are the male's main reproductive organs located in the scrotum. These are the structures that produce the sperms and are necessary for fertility. Testicular self-examinations can diagnose testicular cancer by palpating both testes for any abnormal mass or bulge one by one by the patient himself or the physician. It is a curable disease if diagnosed and treated earlier. Most of the time, testes with the mass had to be removed. The patient had to undergo multiple radiological investigations to get the proper diagnosis and stage of the pathology. The signs and symptoms are testicular mass, mostly painless, heaviness in the scrotum, nausea, and vomiting due to distant spread.

Non-seminomatous germ cell tumors are generally curable cancers with a survival rate of more than 95%. Proper awareness about testicular cancer among healthcare providers and the general population helps identify and control this malignancy.
