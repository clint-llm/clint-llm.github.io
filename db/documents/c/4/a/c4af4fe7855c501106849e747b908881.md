Sinonasal malignancies only constitute 1-5% of head and neck malignancies but have a wide differential diagnosis and relatively non-specific symptoms.

A lesser-known and recently classified entity is biphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma (BSNS), which will be reviewed in this article. BSNS was first described in 2012 as "low-grade sinonasal sarcoma with neural and myogenic features" and was first recognized in the 2017 4th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Head and Neck Tumors.

Cervical nodal metastasis is rarely demonstrated in any sinonasal malignancy and has not yet been demonstrated in patients with BSNS.

Unlike squamous cell carcinoma, with an anticipated 5-year survival of only 25 to 50%, there have been no patients with BSNS who developed metastases, and only one death has been recorded in the literature.
