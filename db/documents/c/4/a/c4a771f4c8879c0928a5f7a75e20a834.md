One of the functions of the vocal folds is to protect the lower airway and lungs, and this protection is particularly crucial during swallowing. The vocal folds also function to control airflow and pressure and to generate voice through vibration and meaningful phonation. A vocal note production is through repeated contact and the vibratory and mucosal wave movements of the vocal folds. Glottic insufficiency hampers these functions due to the incomplete contact between the two vocal folds, or through a change in the period or amplitude of the normal fluid-wave motion, which can allow aspiration as well as hamper vocal function and projection.
