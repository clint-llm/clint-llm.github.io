Accidental intravascular injection during the administration of local anesthetics has long been recognized as the most common cause of LAST. However, certain co-morbidities can also increase the risk of local anesthetic overdose, and in turn systemic toxicity. These include hepatic dysfunction, cardiac disease, pregnancy, and metabolic syndromes. Additionally, patients at the extremes of age are at greater risk of toxicity, due to reduced clearance of the anesthetics. Specifically, infants (younger than 4 months old) have low a-acid glycoprotein plasma concentrations, which can result in lower intrinsic clearance of bupivacaine.
