Just as with equipment, personnel requirementsÂ will vary according to the demands of the case, but at minimum, a surgeon and nurse will be needed; for larger cases, an anesthesia provider, a surgical technologist, and a surgical first assistant will be present. Postoperatively, nursing and physical therapy may be required as well, particularly if the defect and/or donor site are located in a limb.
