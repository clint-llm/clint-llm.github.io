Rhabdomyolysis is a severe and potentially fatal complication with statins. The general treatment is supportive and comprises immediate discontinuation of the offending drug. Other supportive measures include correcting any electrolyte disturbances, especially hyperkalemia, which can cause life-threatening arrhythmias.

When used with a statin, ezetimibe can increase the risk of muscle toxicity, especially in advanced age over 65 years old, renal impairment, or hypothyroidism. Patients taking ezetimibe with cyclosporine are at an increased risk of ezetimibe toxicity as it can result in a 2.3- to 12-fold increase in ezetimibe concentration.

Bile acid sequestrants can inhibit the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin K, which can cause derangements in clotting factors. They can also interfere with the absorption of medications such as statins, ezetimibe, warfarin, NSAIDs, and propranolol; thus, the advice is to administer these medications 1 hour before or 4 hours after taking cholestyramine.
