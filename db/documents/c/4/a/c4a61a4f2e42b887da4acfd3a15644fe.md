Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 is due to decreased central tolerance resulting in autoimmunity. Since the discovery of the AIRE gene, there have been considerable advances in the understanding of this disorder. AIRE is expressed in the thymic medullary cells and encodes for a DNA binding protein namely, autoimmune regulator. The hypothesis is that this protein helps in regulating the thymic expression of various tissue-specific antigens leading to the elimination of autoreactive T cells. In its absence, autoreactive cells escape the negative selection and get released into the circulation.
