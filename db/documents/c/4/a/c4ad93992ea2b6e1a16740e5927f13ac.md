Corneal nerves play an important role in maintaining corneal epithelial integrity, proliferation and wound healing. It has been postulated that corneal sensory nerve damage leads to marked changes in levels of neuromodulators, that cause impairment in epithelial cell vitality and metabolism of the epithelial cells. This can affect mitosis of epithelial cells and consequently lead to an epithelial breakdown. There is an associated reduction in lacrimation reflex with sensory nerve involvement, which can worsen the damage. The corneal epithelium thickness is decreased, and epithelial cells show intracellular swelling, loss of microvilli, and an abnormal production of the basal lamina. The resulting morphological and metabolic epithelial disturbances lead to the development of recurrent or persistent epithelial defects, which can progress to corneal ulceration, melting and perforation. A large number of chemical mediators have been postulated to play a role in the development of neurotrophic keratitis including nerve growth factor, Substance P, neuropeptide Y, Calcitonin gene-related peptide, Galanin, and Acetylcholine.
