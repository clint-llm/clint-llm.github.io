Osteonecrosis (ON) is a degenerative condition of the bone in which the cellular component dies secondary to an interruption of the blood supply. This clinical entity was first described in 1968 by Ahlback et al.

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SPONK) has been discussed most in the literature but is the least understood, and its etiology is stillÂ unclear. The insidious and often non-specific onset of SPONK leads to difficulties in diagnosis and, therefore, prompt treatment. Advanced disease of all three subtypes of ON leads to subchondral collapse, end-stage osteoarthritis, and the requirement for surgical intervention. In this article, we will review the current etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of secondary osteonecrosis of the knee (SON).
