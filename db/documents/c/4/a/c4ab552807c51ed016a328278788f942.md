- Anemia of renal disease is common and is chiefly due to decreased erythropoietin production.

- Investigating other treatable causes of anemia in renal failure patients is necessary.

- Anemia of renal disease is associated with adverse cardiac events, heart failure, MI, and death.

- Erythropoietin levels are not indicative of anemia in renal failure patients. Therefore, one should target a hemoglobin level of no more than 11.5 g/dl.
