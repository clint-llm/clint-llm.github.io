The histories and physicals of patients presenting with contrast-related toxicity share only one feature – exposure to a contrast agent within the past 72 hours. Otherwise, patient presentations can be extremely diverse.

CIN may present as a transient elevation in serum creatinine with or without oliguria. The diagnosis cannot be officially made until a follow-up measurement showing decreasing creatinine is obtained within 2 to 3 days. However, there are several acknowledged risk factors in a patient history for CIN including chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, dehydration, diuretic use, advanced age, and concomitant exposure to other drugs or diseases that affect renal hemodynamics. The Roxana Mehran score predictor for CIN calculates patient risk based on the following elements in their history:

- Age (4 points if older than 75 years of age)

- Anemia (3 points)

- Diabetes (3 points)

- Congestive heart failure (5 points)

- Intra-aortic balloon pump (5 points)

- eGFR 60 to 40 (2 points)

- eGFR 40 to 20 (4 points)

- eGFR less than 20 (6 points)

- Hypotension requiring inotropic support (5 points)

- Contrast media volume (1 point per 100 mL)

The minimal risk score using the Roxana Mehran calculator is 7.5% for less than 6 points on the scale. The maximum risk is indicated by greater than 16 points, calculated to be 57% risk of CIN.

Acute adverse reactions can be grouped into either allergic-like or physiologic. Allergic-like reactions include nausea, vomiting, hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, and other anaphylactoid responses. Physiologic reactions include cardiac arrhythmias, depressed myocardial contractility, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and seizures.

Preexisting conditions may increase the risk of certain adverse events. Patients with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma have more bronchospasm than patients without these conditions. Hemodynamic changes are more common in patients with a prior history of cardiovascular disease. Patients with a prior history of myasthenia gravis have a significant increase in disease-related symptoms exacerbation within 24 hours of contract.
