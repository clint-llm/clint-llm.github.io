**Interprofessional Communication and Social Services -**Acute stress disorder (ASD) patients are twenty-four times more likely to die from suicide and have two times more risk of all-cause mortality compared to the general population. ASD can lead to chronic PTSD, which is a debilitating psychiatric disorder. PTSD can significantly affect a patient's quality of life. Due to these risks, managing a traumatic event requires interprofessional care coordination that can involve providers in various disciplines (such as emergency medicine, psychiatry, orthopedics, and neurosurgery), psychologists, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers. Each of these areas will contribute to the overall care plan based on their expertise and engage in open information-sharing regarding the patient's case.

Interprofessional work can be achieved by respecting the roles of each team member and efficient communication. It is of significant importance due to the affordable care act, which calls for improved care coordination.

In treating acute stress disorder, utilizing the interprofessional model with the various specialties and disciplines mentioned above, patient outcomes are improved while the potential for adverse events and relapse is mitigated. [Level 5]
