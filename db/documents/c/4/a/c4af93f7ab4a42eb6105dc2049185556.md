When the sender relays the information, feelings, or ideas that they want to communicate to the receiver, the receiver cannot just acknowledge that they heard or saw the information. The information may be perceived as positive or negative and can change the outcome that the sender wants to get. To be effective, the receiver must provide feedback to the sender. Feedback is a response from the receiver that includes an acknowledgment but also a recap of what they perceived from the sender. By recapping the thought, the sender has an opportunity to agree that the message was received correctly or to restate their original intentions for clarification. This process allows the receiver a chance to also ask questions for their understanding of the message. This type of communication and clarification process does not take any additional time or time away from the tasks being performed but instead allows for much better patient care.
