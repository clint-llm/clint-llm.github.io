The management of orthostatic hypotension is best done with an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, internist, primary care provider, neurologist, and nurse practitioner. The etiology determines the management of these patients. The treatment goal is to relieve symptoms and prevent associated morbidity. According to the literature, asymptomatic patients are left alone except for patients with Parkinson disease. These patients should be screened as they have associated impairments in their quality of life, as well as a higher risk of falls.

Patients with a medication-related disease need to remove the offending agent and optimize the patient's medication regimen. Many patients require an interprofessional approach to address underlying diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson disease, and other comorbidities. Patients that are suffering from dehydration require timely volume resuscitation. Certain medications can result in orthostatic hypotension, so a pharmacy consult is to verify that none of these medications are the source of the issue. This process can be facilitated by a nurse with good medication records for the patient, enabling rapid response if indicated. Overall, the prognosis of asymptomatic patients is excellent, but those with symptoms tend to have a poor quality of life. Interprofessional team cooperation and communication can result in better outcomes. [Level 5]
