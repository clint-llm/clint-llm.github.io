There is no requirement for specific monitoring of patients receiving modafinil. However, a variety of drug-drug interactions are possible. Modafinil is a substrate of hepatic CYP3A4, a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19.

Modafinil may decrease serum concentrations of other drugs to a clinically significant extent, including the following:

- Antihepaciviral combination products

- Antiretroviral combination products

- Clarithromycin

- Clozapine

- Cyclosporine

- Estrogen Derivatives: In patients using combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP), the manufacturer recommends that patients use an alternative method of contraception, instead of or in addition to OCP, during and until one month after completing modafinil therapy.

- Guanfacine

- Lurasidone

- Nimodipine

- Opioid medications (e.g., codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone)

- Ranolazine

- Zolpidem

Serum concentrations of modafinil may be decreased to a clinically significant extent in the presence of drugs that induce CYP3A4. These include rifampin, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort, and efavirenz. Conversely, serum concentrations of modafinil may be increased to a clinically significant extent in the presence of drugs that inhibit CYP3A4. These include azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), ritonavir, and clarithromycin.
