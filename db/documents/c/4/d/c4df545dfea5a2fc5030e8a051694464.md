The long head biceps muscle has a proximal insertion at the shoulder where the tendon is intra-articular, originating on the supraglenoid tubercle and superior glenoid labrum. It exits the glenohumeral joint at the level of the humeral head near the rotator cuff attachments on the humerus, entering the bicipital groove. It is held within the proximal bicipital groove by the coracohumeral and transverse humeral ligaments as well as fibers of the subscapularis tendon.

In most patients, there are distinct attachments of the long and short head of the biceps tendon on the radial tuberosity. The distal biceps tendons traverse the elbow joint and attach to the radial tuberosity. The long head normally constitutes the more proximal insertion on the radial tuberosity and the short head more distal. Therefore it is possible to have an isolated tear of either the long or short head.

At the distal biceps myotendinous junction, there is a broad aponeurosis known as the lacertus fibrosus (also called the bicipital aponeurosis), which circumferentially covers the flexor muscle attachments as well as the median nerve and brachial artery. This aponeurosis originates at the distal biceps tendon and inserts onto the radial tuberosity and proximal ulna.Â  It is held in place by multiple strong fascial connections and serves as a protective covering for the neurovascular structures which course beneath. In most cases, the lacertus fibrosus prevents a torn biceps tendon from retracting more than a few centimeters proximal to the elbow joint; however, if the lacertus fibrosus is also injured, the tendon retraction may be more severe, leading to a more difficult surgical repair.
