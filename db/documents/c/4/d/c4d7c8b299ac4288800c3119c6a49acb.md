Apocrine glands are a subtype of exocrine secretory glands. They are found in many locations but are primarily in the axillae, areolae, and anogenital region. While in the past, certain glands, such as those in the areolae, were considered modified apocrine glands, it is now recognized that all of these glands are true apocrine glands. Apocrine glands release their products by “decapitation,” a process by which membrane-bound cytoplasm from the apical surface of the cells buds off into the lumen of the duct and is secreted. Histologically, apocrine glands can be viewed using light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin staining. They can also be viewed using a variety of specific stains, including histochemical, enzymatic, and immunohistochemical stains. Apocrine glands are associated with multiple pathologies, including apocrine bromhidrosis, apocrine chromhidrosis, apocrine carcinoma of the breast, Fox-Fordyce disease, and hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa).
