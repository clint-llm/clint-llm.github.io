Hydroxyurea is a hydroxylated analog of urea, inhibiting DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide diphosphatase reductase and blocking the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides.

Hydroxyurea is cell-cycle specific for the S phase, causing cell arrest at G1 to S.

Hydroxyurea increases HbF levels by stimulating HbF production, but the exact mechanism of HbF production is unknown. It also has antioxidant properties, alters the RBC membrane, increases red blood cell (RBC) deformability by increasing intracellular water content, and decreases RBC adherence to the endothelium.
