Cardiac abscesses are most commonly thought to occur primarily by the extent of a pre-existing cardiac infection, as it is with the case of infective endocarditis (IE). Secondary causes of cardiac abscess are believed to be due to bacteremia (persistent or transient) without a known cardiac source, as well as susceptible heart tissue soon after myocardial infarction (MI), or prosthetic valve disease, usually in the setting of bacteremia. Other less common predisposing factors may be trauma, penetrating wounds, deep burns, infected transplanted hearts, infected sternal incision sites, pseudoaneurysm, HIV, or parasitic infections.
