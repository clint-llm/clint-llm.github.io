- There is no question that opioids are important drugs for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain, but at the same time, these drugs also have a number of adverse effects, one of which is the NBS.

- In patients with NBS, the opioids induce hyperalgesia resulting in chronic abdominal pain.

- Because the connection between opioids and increasing abdominal pain is not always recognized, these individual are often prescribed higher doses of opioids which makes the syndrome even worse. This lack of awareness leads to a vicious cycle of pain, repeated emergency department visits and hospital admissions, use of escalating doses of opioids, increased costs, and risk of more adverse reactions.

- The only definite way to make the diagnosis of NBS is to make a correlation between the use of opioids and the pain intensity.

- One also has to rule out other abdominal disorders whose pain often improves after administration of opioids. In some cases, the healthcare worker may confirm the diagnosis by prescribing increasing doses of opioids under controlled conditions and noting the presence of pain.

- Once the condition is recognized, the primary treatment of NBS is discontinuation of the opioid and using alternative means of treating the pain.

- No matter what treatment one utilizes, it is important to enroll the patient in a long-term psychotherapy program to prevent relapse and improve the quality of life.
