The pelvis contains a large number of muscles that allow the upper and lower body to function as one. When these muscles are not functioning optimally due to somatic dysfunctions, patients develop pain in various parts of their bodies. This activity reviews muscle energy for somatic dysfunctions of the pelvis and explains the role of the physician in evaluating and treating patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Outline how to diagnose pelvic dysfunctions.
- Describe the findings associated with the somatic dysfunctions of the pelvis.
- Explain how to treat somatic dysfunctions of the pelvis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by pelvic somatic dysfunctions.
