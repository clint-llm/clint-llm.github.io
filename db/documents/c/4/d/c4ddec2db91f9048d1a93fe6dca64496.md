The goal of fluid resuscitation is to maintain homeostasis. This goal requires not only administering enough fluid volume to optimize hemodynamics and perfusion but also to maintain electrolyte balances. Maintenance fluids are given for select indications such as prolonged fasting for planned surgical procedures and conditions limiting oral fluid intake (severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Maintenance fluid volume requirements in children is based on body weight with 100 ml/kg per day for the first 0 to 10 kg, an additional 50 ml/kg per day for the next 10 to 20 kg, and 20 ml/kg/day for weight greater than 20 kg. In adults, maintenance fluid is typically 35 ml/kg per day. One must also consider electrolyte replacement besides maintaining the required fluid volumes. Sodium is required at a concentration of 1 to 2 mEq/kg per day and potassium is replaced at a rate of 0.5 to 1 mEq/kg per day.
