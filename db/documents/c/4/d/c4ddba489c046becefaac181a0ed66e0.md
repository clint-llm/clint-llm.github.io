Initial assessment should attempt to rule out any general medical disorders. Following the exclusion of organicity, diagnoses pertinent on the list of differentials include somatic symptom disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder.

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by multiple persistent somatic symptoms and excessive apprehension and anxiety regarding these symptoms.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder in which patients experience intrusive, unwanted thoughts that are only relieved by performing behaviors or compulsions.

Patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have excessive worry and fear about almost all matters of daily living. They may seem tensed, keyed up, on edge, and excessively worried.

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by a preoccupation with perceived defects in physical appearance that are not apparent or barely noticeable to others. Patients with BDD may demonstrate repetitive behaviors such as body checking and mirror checking. However, unlike IAD, patients with BDD are not concerned about being sick; they are preoccupied with being ugly or unattractive.
