When atomoxetine is used to treat ADHD, the health care team MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs need to prescribe it carefully and monitor patients regularly, e.g., children's growth. Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation and watch for potential drug interactions to report to the clinician. Nursing staff should record vital signs for patients at each clinic visit and provide consultation. Additionally, the medication can significantly affect behavior, and thus the healthcare team needs to monitor patients for anxiety, aggression/hostility, and suicidal ideation, especially in children. If adverse effects appear, discontinuing the drug might be necessary, and the clinician should refer the patient to a psychiatrist for a follow-up consultation. The outcomes for patients treated with atomoxetine can be fair; some patients respond positively, but adverse effects often reduce adherence. Thus communication between the healthcare team is vital for safety and optimal patient outcomes.[Level 5]
