**History**

A thorough medical and ocular history should be taken.

**Examination**

The preoperative examination must include:

- Gonioscopic examination of the angle of the anterior chamber- visibility of trabecular meshwork without indentation is noted as this is the target structure for trabeculoplasty. If the iris approach is steep, but the trabecular meshwork is visible by asking the patient to look towards the mirror, this implies there is sufficient angle area available for treatment. Any synechiae should be ruled out because it will obstruct access to the trabecular meshwork, hence a contraindication to the procedure. The degree of pigmentation of the trabecular meshwork should be noted because it will influence the initial energy level chosen for the procedure.

- Intraocular pressure measurement- to record a baseline IOP before the procedure.

- Central corneal thickness

- Optic nerve evaluation using slit-lamp biomicroscopy for glaucomatous damage

- Visual field charting

**Medications**

-  IOP lowering agents- either apraclonidine or brimonidine, both being alpha-adrenergic agonists. It decreases the chance of an IOP spike in the immediate post-op period.

- Topical anesthetic agents –immediately before the procedure to anesthetize the eye.

Informed consent should be obtained before the procedure. The patient should understand all of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure. It is essential to manage the expectations and address any questions about the procedure patient might have. Also, the possibility of failure of the procedure should be explained.
