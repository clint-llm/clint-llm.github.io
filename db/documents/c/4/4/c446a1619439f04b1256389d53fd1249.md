The underlying pathological condition leading to epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is the initial focus of the management strategy. The central aspect of any treatment regimen is seizure control using anti-epileptic medication(AED). Some drugs have been seen to be more effective than others, but polytherapy using multiple AEDs is fairly common. Studies have shown that phenytoin and phenobarbital may be more effective than valproate or carbamazepine. Newer AEDs like levetiracetam, brivaracetam, lacosamide, and zonisamide may also be used as they are well tolerated.

Surgical interventions such as hemispherectomy may be considered in cases of Rasmussen encephalitis. Furthermore, newer techniques such as repetitive transcranial stimulation and botulinum toxin have reported some degree of success in specific cases.
