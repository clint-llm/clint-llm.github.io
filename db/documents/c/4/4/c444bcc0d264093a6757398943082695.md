The differential diagnosis for a female patient of reproductive age presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding is vast. The initial goal is to identify patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for their symptoms. If the patient is known or found to be pregnant, intrauterine pregnancy should be confirmed via ultrasound to rule out a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy. Other common differential diagnoses include early pregnant loss (miscarriage or spontaneous abortion), threatened abortion, implantation bleeding, placental abruption, placenta previa, vasa previa, gestational trophoblastic disease, uterine rupture, ovarian torsion, a tubo-ovarian abscess.
