The definition of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) in the United States is two or more consecutive failed clinical pregnancies documented by ultrasound or histopathology, while, in the United Kingdom, the definition is as having three or more consecutive early pregnancy losses. Up to 50 percent of cases of recurrent pregnancy loss lack a clear etiology. Recurrent pregnancy loss can categorize into primary and secondary types. Primary, recurrent pregnancy loss occurs in women who have never given birth to a live infant. Secondary recurrent pregnancy loss occurs in women who have given birth to a live infant. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of recurrent pregnancy loss and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the types of recurrent pregnancy loss.
- Describe the etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss.
- Explain the investigations performed for recurrent pregnancy loss.
- Outline the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients and their families affected by recurrent pregnancy loss.
