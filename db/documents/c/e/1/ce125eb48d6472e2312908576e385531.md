**Lifestyle Changes**

Women with extremes in body mass index (BMI) frequently present with infertility and ovulatory dysfunction.

Women with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m^2 with anovulation can improve ovulation with weight loss alone. Multiple studies have shown that a loss of 10% of body weight will restore normal ovulation in 50 to 100% of women in less than 1 year.

**Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation**

The first-line medication for infertility of unknown origin and the medication most providers use is clomiphene citrate (CC). Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with estrogen antagonist and agonist effects that ultimately increase gonadotropin release from the anterior pituitary. Clomiphene effectively treats WHO class 2 anovulation but ineffective in WHO class 1 and class 3 anovulation. Clomiphene is dosed starting at 50mg starting on cycle day 2, 3, 4, or 5 for 5 sequential days. The couple is encouraged to have intercourse every other day for one week, beginning 5 days after the last pill. However, the odds for pregnancy may be increased when clomiphene is combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI). There is little difference in the results of ovulation, pregnancy, or live birth regarding which day the medication is started, between cycle days 2 to 5.

Another commonly used oral medication for ovulation induction is letrozole. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that prevents estrogen production by preventing the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol.

- Higher rate of monofollicular development and a corresponding decrease in twin gestations

- Shorter half-life

- No antiestrogenic effects on the endometrium and central nervous system

- Lower estradiol levels, which is a benefit for women with breast cancer undergoing IVF

Letrozole's beneficial profile compared to clomiphene may replace clomiphene as a first-line treatment in the future.

Gonadotropin therapy is a more intensive medical regimen used for WHO Class 1, 2, or 3 anovulatory disorders. Gonadotropins are beneficial as a second-line treatment option for women who failed to conceive after multiple cycles of clomiphene. There is one study that showed an increased live birth rate with gonadotropins compared to continued clomiphene usage.

upon the infertility treatment decided. Those protocols are outside the scope of this review. However, it is important to discuss that close monitoring is required while using more invasive and intensive gonadotropins. Transvaginal ultrasounds are used to monitor follicular growth every 2 to 3 days during the late follicular phase to evaluate mature follicles. A mature follicle is greater than 18mm in diameter and estradiol of greater than 200 pg/mL. Once a mature follicle is identified, recombinant HCG 250mg subcutaneous injection or intramuscular injection of 10,000U of urinary-derived HCG is given to trigger ovulation.

**Tubal and Pelvic Adhesions**

In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the first-line treatment for bilateral tubal factor infertility. Tubal corrective surgeries have worse pregnancy outcomes and have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Women with severe tubal disease, including hydrosalpinx, are encouraged to have a bilateral salpingectomy to increase the pregnancy rate of IVF.

The patients with a prior bilateral salpingectomy or tubal ligation for contraception are an important tubal factor population. It is always important for healthcare providers to discuss the risk of regret with all women who desire tubal ligation. The chance of pregnancy after tubal reanastomosis depends on the patient's age, the type of ligation, and the tubal length available. Younger women who had a ring or a clip with more than 4 cm of tubal length are the best candidates and have comparable pregnancy rates to IVF.

**Uterine Abnormalities**

There is unclear evidence on the effect of leiomyomas on infertility and live birth rates. It is recommended that the patient receive a complete infertility workup prior to further investigation into fibroids. The most important aspect of fibroids is the location. Fibroids that impinge on the endometrium and distort the uterine cavity result in impaired implantation and increased miscarriage rates.

**IVF Procedures**

This section will discuss an overview of the IVF procedures without discussing medication protocols as the most effective treatment option for infertility. Step 1 is controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with injectable gonadotropins, most commonly. Thirty-six hours after a trigger shot, or HCG injection, a specialist will perform a transvaginal ultrasonography-guided needle aspiration and oocyte retrieval. After retrieval, the oocytes are transferred to a special media, and normal sperm is transferred to the dish for insemination. If there is abnormal sperm, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is performed. ICSI is a procedure that places a single spermatozoon directly into the egg cytoplasm. After fertilization, the embryo is assessed and graded. The embryos are then transferred on Day 3 or Day 5. Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is an additional IVF procedure that helps detect known parental genetic mutations or balanced translocation. Additionally, PGT can also be used to detect aneuploidy, both monosomies and trisomies, from all 23 chromosome pairs. Apart from a known parental carrier for a genetic mutation or balanced translocation, PGT likely is beneficial for advanced maternal age, repeated IVF failures with high-grade embryos, recurrent pregnancy loss, and unexplained infertility.
