The etiology of dysplastic nevi is not entirely clear. The phenotypic expression of dysplastic nevi has been determined to be related to environmental and genetic factors. Factors such as sun sensitivity, fair skin tone, light eye and hair color, and freckling propensity are inherited traits that strongly predict the development of nevi. Also, ultraviolet (UV) sunlight exposure has been shown to accentuate the expression of the dysplastic nevi phenotype. A higher incidence of the dysplastic nevus syndrome phenotype has been demonstrated in epidemiologic studies in children with a history of greater exposure to UV light.

A sequential progression model for dysplastic nevi as the intermediate between banal nevi and melanoma has been proposed in the past by Clark and is still a supported model by many dermatologists. However, this model suggests that mutations in the nevi would be shared with melanoma, which has not been clearly demonstrated in the literature. Also, approximately 25% of melanomas are estimated to arise in pre-existing nevi, and 75% of melanomas arise de novo. One study demonstrated the risk of a dysplastic nevus evolving into melanoma is 0.0005% for people younger than 40 years. Dysplastic nevi tend to be stable over time.
