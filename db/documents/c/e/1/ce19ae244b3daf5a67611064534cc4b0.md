Diving induced decompression illness is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a hyperbaric chamber physician, emergency department physician, pharmacist, hyperbaric nurse, and diving medical technician. The key is to get the patient to a hyperbaric chamber if the patient is symptomatic. Even those who are asymptomatic need to be observed before being discharged. After treatment, symptom improvement is dramatic but a few sessions may be required. The prognosis depends on the time of treatment and the presence of neurological deficits at the time of admission.
