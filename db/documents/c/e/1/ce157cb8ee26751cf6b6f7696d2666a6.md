A nutrient is a substance providing nourishment to the body and is necessary for both growth and maintenance. Nutrients can fall into seven groups that include carbohydrate, protein, fat, fiber, mineral, vitamin, and water. All groups are essential for the adequate functioning of the body. Macronutrients serve as a source of energy, while micronutrients play a crucial role in biochemical reactions. Among the most important nutrients is water; it serves as a solvent, a mode of transport, and a substrate for major metabolic reactions.
