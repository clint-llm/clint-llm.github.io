Injury to the diaphragm may be due to penetrating or blunt trauma. Penetrating trauma with direct injury to the diaphragm is more common and accounts for aboutÂ two-thirds of cases. Stab wounds are the most frequent etiology, followed by gunshot wounds and impalements. Penetrating trauma usually results in smaller, unilateral injuries, which are more likely to be missed in the initial evaluation. The remaining one-third is due to blunt trauma with the vast majority (90%) caused by motor vehicle crashes. Falls and crush injuries account for the remainder. Blunt trauma causes larger ruptures; up to one-third of these ruptures may be bilateral.
