IV access is essential in hospitalized patients. When patients do not have peripheral access, central lines are inserted. While the central line is usually inserted by a physician, the management of the line is done by a nurse. Today, most hospitals have a team that just caters to central lines and oversees antiseptic techniques, indications, and complications. The nurse is in a prime position to assess the line for complications like infection, thrombosis or dislodgement and report findings to the clinical team. There are now protocols on central line dressings and how long a line should be left in the central vein. The key is to prevent complications by using an interprofessional approach, as failure to do so may prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity.

**Outcomes**

Data on outcomes after central line placement indicate that complications are not uncommon. Complication rates ranging from 3-20% have been reported and include hemothorax, pneumothorax, infection and air embolism. Studies show that when the central line is inserted in an aseptic fashion, the risk of infection is low. However, there is a great variance in skills among physicians when it comes to insertion of central lines. Thus, many hospitals have a dedicated team that inserts central lines and monitors them until patient discharge
