Most UTIs in females are acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli (86%), Klebsiella species (5%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (3%), Proteus species (3%), Enterobacter species (1.4%), Citrobacter species (0.8%), or Enterococcus species (0.5%). (In other words, Escherichia coli is by far the most common organism causing urinary tract infections, Klebsiella is the next most likely cause, followed by Proteus.)

The primary risk factor for acute cystitis in women is the proximity of the female urethral meatus to the anus. This easily contaminates the vulvar and peri-urethral area with bacteria originating from the rectum.
