Patients should understand that the causes of hemiballismus may vary depending on the underlying disorder associated with it. Any of the following disorders may present with hemiballismus: traumatic brain injury, stroke,Â cancer, metabolic, systemic infections, brain infections, autoimmune diseases, genetic disorders, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, and toxic substance exposure. Treating the underlying etiology is extremely important. Medical treatment for hyperkinetic movements is sometimes recommended, but surgery is rarely used. Patients should be encouraged that hemiballismus tends to resolve with time. Consultation with the social worker and the psychologist is usually necessary due to the emotional effect that hemiballismus may cause on these patients.
