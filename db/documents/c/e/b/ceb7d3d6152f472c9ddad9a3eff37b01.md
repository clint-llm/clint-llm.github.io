The ischiorectal fossa can be examined by intra-rectal touch, but it can also be evaluated by external examination. The skin of the posterior perineum is located lateral to the anal complex of muscles and delimited by the ischial tuberosities, the sacrotuberous ligament. The coccyx forms the external doorway for the ischioanal fossa space used for manual evaluation and pelvic floor therapy. Soft-tissue mobilization techniques are also useful in nerve entrapment syndromes.

The ischiorectal fossa is the space that exists between the internal surface of the perineal skin and the plane of the plate of the levator ani muscle. It is perceived as descending during inhalation and rising during exhalation. Testing and treating the density of the fatty tissue is essential to rehabilitate the perineal space after surgery or inflammation (scar treatment).
