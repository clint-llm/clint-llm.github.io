The primary disadvantages of mini implants for definitive prosthodontic treatment are as follows:

- The need for multiple implants because of the unpredictability and lack of current scientific guidelines and understanding

- The limited scientific evidence about long-term survival

- The potential for fracture of the implant during placement, screw loosening and prosthetic issues

- Lack of parallelism between implants is less forgiving because of the one-piece design

- The reduction in resistance to occlusal loading need an evaluation of the distribution of forces and movement of the prosthesis, similar to narrow-diameter implants

- Other disadvantages attributable to flapless surgery (when used) such as lack of bone visibility, inability to irrigate the bone, and contraindications in situations requiring alveoloplasty to gain prosthetic space

- Biological complications include peri-implantitis/ progressive bone loss, peri mucositis, periapical implantitis or sensory disturbance.

- Primary stability is poor where the cortex is thinner than 0.5 mm and density of trabecular bone is low

- Infection can occur if the transmucosal portion around the screw is not entirely smooth

- Excessive pressure during insertion of the self-drilling screw can lead to fracture of screw tip

- Overtightening can lead to screw loosening. Stop turning the screw when the smooth part of neck reach the periosteum.

- While obtaining orthodontic anchorage with the bracket like screw head, turning the ligature around the screw will make it impossible to keep the area free of inflammation. The ligature should be placed in the slot perpendicular to the wire on top of the screw
