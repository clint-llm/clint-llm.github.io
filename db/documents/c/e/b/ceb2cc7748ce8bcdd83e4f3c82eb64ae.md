- Heavy metal (HM) toxicity isÂ underestimated in the community.

- The teaching of HM toxicity is underrepresented in the medical curriculum.

- Heavy metals can cause harm to the environment and living beings, including humans, by direct and indirect means.

- Young children are affected more than adults.

- Affected pregnant women can pass on the toxic HMs to the developing fetus and produce much harm.

- The toxicity of HMs can be acute and chronic.

- Although classical symptoms and signs for each HM exist, they are not present in every case, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for a correct diagnosis.

- Heavy metals can affect the nervous, pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, skin, reproductive, and skeletal systems in varying degrees.

- A good history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory testing of blood, urine, and other tissues can aid with the diagnosis.

- The levels of heavy metals in the blood and urine reflect current exposure and not the true tissue levels; a chelation challenge may be needed.

- Heavy metals cause harm to proteins like enzymes, DNA, membrane lipids, and disrupt normal cellular functions.

- Many body-systems can be involved and can mimic other diseases that affect those systems.

- If detected and treated early, the prognosis is good.

- Apart from the removal of the offending HMs and the patient from the toxic environment, supportive care, and chelation therapy are the mainstays.

- Occupational and health regulations require strict enforcement and environmental engineering measures taken to reduce HM toxicity at the community level.
