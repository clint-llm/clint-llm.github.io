Despite its prevalence, a clear cause for infantile colic remains elusive. There have been many theories regarding theÂ etiology, but a lack of uniformity in study definitions for colic have made it challenging to identify a common cause. It is likely that the etiology of the condition is multifactorial. Many of the theories regarding the cause focus on gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, including intolerance to formulas containing cow's milk protein, alterations in intestinal microflora or gut hormones, intestinal hypermotility, increased gas production, or colonic inflammation (indicated by elevated levels of fecal cal-protectin, a marker for inflammation). In breastfeeding infants with colic, maternal diets containing dairy, eggs, nuts, wheat, soy, or fish may contribute to infant distress. Others have suggested a link between colic and migraine physiology, as there are a growing number of studies showing an association between infantile colic and the later development of childhood migraines. Psychosocial issues have also been blamed, such as poor feeding techniques, maternal smoking, or nicotine replacement therapy, inadequate parental interaction, family tension, and parental anxiety. Unfortunately, this wide range of potential causes makes the treatment for colic challenging for both parents and physicians.
