Prasugrel is only available in tablet formulation; therefore, its administration is only via the oral route. Administration can be without regard to the intake of a meal. When undergoing emergent primary PCI, crushing the tablets is associated with faster absorption and a more rapid and higher antiplatelet effect achievable within 30 minutes of administration.

**Available Dosage Forms**

5 mg and 10 mg tablets

**Dosing for Acute Coronary Syndromes**

Loading dose: Initial loading dose of 60 mg requires prompt administration as soon as acute coronary syndrome is known.

Maintenance dose: The maintenance dose for people above the weight of 60 kg is 10 mg daily. There is an increased risk of bleeding in low-weight individuals (weight less than 60 kg) taking prasugrel, so a lower dose of 5 mg daily can be considered in these patients. Prasugrel 5 mg in low body weight (< 60 kg) individuals reduced platelet reactivity similarly to 10 mg in higher body weight individuals (> 60 kg).

**Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Treatment After Stent Placement**

As per ACC/AHA dual antiplatelet therapy guidelines, at least 6 to 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) treatment is recommended in people with ACS receiving either a bare-metal or drug-eluting stent. A shorter duration of dual antiplatelet therapy can be considered in patients with low ischemia risk and higher bleeding risk, whereas a longer duration of DAPT treatment may be reasonable in patients with a higher risk of ischemia and lower risk of bleeding. Decisions about the discontinuation of DAPT are individualized and based on clinical judgment.

**Use in Renal Impairment**

No dosage adjustments are required; however, there is an increased risk of bleeding with moderate to severe renal impairment due to decreased drug excretion. Dosing in end-stage renal disease and patients on peritoneal or hemodialysis is undefined.

**Use in Hepatic Impairment**

No dosage adjustments are necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B). Researchers have not studied the use of prasugrel in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C); however, it generally correlates with increased bleeding.

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

There is no human data regarding fetal or infant risk when using prasugrel during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The maternal risk of hemorrhage exists based on the drug's mechanism of action. There is no data on whether prasugrel affects milk production.

There is no indication for dosing prasugrel in pediatric patients.
