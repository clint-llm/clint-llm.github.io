The blood supply is chiefly from the internal pudendal artery, which may have different branching variables.

The paraaortic lymph nodes are placed around the abdominal aorta and present the lymph node chain to which all the lymph nodes that drain the abdominal and pelvic viscera refer. The two lumbar lymphatic trunks are born from the paraaortic lymph nodes. The internal iliac lymph nodes form the internal iliac plexus along with the afferent collectors, draining the lymph from the urinary tract, the genital organs, the perineum, the rectum, the pelvic cord, and the muscles of the posterior thigh and buttock.
