LS is a chronically relapsing disease and if untreated leads to a potential scarring process that may evolve to a complete loss of standard vulvar architecture in women including introital stenosis, fusion, and resorption of the labia minora, and urethral strictures in males. Tissue adhesion and sclerosis lead to tearing and then the loss of sexual function, in addition to dysuria, constipation, itching, and soreness. Furthermore, vulvar lichen sclerosis may evolve to vulvar squamous cell carcinoma in the affected area with an estimated risk up to 5 %; however, its association with penile SCC is not clear. Extragenital lesions are not associated with this risk of transformation. Melanoma and basal cell carcinoma have been reported.
