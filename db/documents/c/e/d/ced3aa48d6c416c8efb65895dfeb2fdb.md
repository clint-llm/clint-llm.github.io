Depending on the dose, administration route, and coingestants, PCP can cause a wide spectrum of clinical effects, from coma to extreme agitation or psychosis. Many times, patients are unable to give a clear history, so it is imperative to attempt to obtain a history from emergency medical personnel, family, friends, and witnesses. Familiarity with the street names for PCP can be helpful as well.

- HEENT– Nystagmus, horizontal, vertical, rotary (60%- 90%), mydriasis (6%), miosis (2%)

- Cardiovascular – hypertension (60%), tachycardia (30%)

- Neurological – mild to severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, delusions, violent behavior, seizures, muscle rigidity, ataxia, coma
