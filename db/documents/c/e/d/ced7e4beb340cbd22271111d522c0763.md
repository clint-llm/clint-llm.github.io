There are several identified risk factors for osteonecrosis, but the exact pathogenesis remains unestablished. More likely, a combination of different factors and conditions leads to the destruction of bone cells.

Intervention depends on the phase of disease progression and varies from preservation procedures to more definitive salvage operations.

Treatment of early-stage disease reports better results, although this may be difficult to achieve as osteonecrosis is often asymptomatic in its early stages.

The majority of non-traumatic cases are associated with glucocorticoid use.
