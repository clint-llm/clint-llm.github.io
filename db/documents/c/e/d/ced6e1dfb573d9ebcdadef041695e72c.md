Depending on the application, ankle splinting may be done alone or may require an assistant. If the patient can follow directions and there is no dislocation or subluxation of the ankle joint, an assistant may not be necessary. If the ankle requires a reduction, an assistant will be necessary to hold the ankle during splint application. Furthermore, if the patient is not cooperative or is sedated, an assistant will be required to hold the leg.
