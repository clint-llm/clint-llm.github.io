Exposure to blood and bodily fluids for healthcare workers is mostly due to needlestick injuries and cuts on the job. These preventable exposures result in approximately 1000 infections a year with exposure to over 20 different bloodborne pathogens. Hepatitis B is the most common pathogen encountered with these events. The increased incidence of these pathogens, along with the frequency of needlestick exposures, is a significant occupational risk to healthcare workers.
