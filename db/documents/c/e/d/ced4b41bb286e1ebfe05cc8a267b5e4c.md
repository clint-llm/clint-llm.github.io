**Antiseptic Agents**

- Often alcohol or chlorhexidine, a variety of other antiseptics are suitable for nail biopsy.

**Local Anesthetic**

- The most commonly used local anesthetic is a 1% lidocaine solution.

- To decrease pain during the anesthetic application, 1 mL of sodium bicarbonate 8.5% solution may be added to 10 mL of 1% lidocaine.

- To decrease excess bleeding during the procedure, epinephrine diluted to 1:100,000 â€“ 200,000 is generally considered safe to use in healthy patients.

- While data is insufficient to suggest increased risk, caution should be used when using epinephrine in patients with peripheral arterial disease.
- The use of epinephrine for digital blocks can be performed but is less often utilized.
