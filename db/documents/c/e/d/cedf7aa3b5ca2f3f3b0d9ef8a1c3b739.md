Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in both men and women. NSCLC accounts for 85% of diagnosed lung cancer cases in the United States.

Lung cancer evaluation can be divided as:

- Radiological staging

- Invasive staging

**Goals of Initial Evaluation**

- Clinical extent and stage of the disease

- Optimal target site and modality of 1st tissue biopsy

- Specific histologic subtypes

- Presence of co-morbidities, para-neoplastic syndromes

- Patient values and preferences regarding therapy

**Radiologic Staging**

Every patient suspected of having lung cancer should undergo the following tests:

- Contrast-enhanced CT chest with extension to upper abdomen up to the level of adrenal glands

- Imaging with PET or PET-CT directed at sites of potential metastasis when symptoms or focal findings are present or when chest CT shows evidence of advanced disease.

**CT Scan**

Intravenous (IV) contrast enhancement is preferable as it may distinguish mediastinal invasion of the primary tumor or metastatic lymph nodes from vascular structures.

The significant advantage of CT is that it provides an accurate anatomic definition of the tumor within the thorax, which helps clinicians decide the optimal biopsy site.

CT can also identify the following:

- Tumor-related atelectasis

- Post obstructive pneumonitis

- Intra- or extrathoracic metastatic disease

- Co-existing lung disease

The main objective of a CT scan is to identify the extent of the tumor, its anatomical location, and the lymph node involvement. TNM staging relies heavily on lymph node involvement. Therefore, most societies in Europe and the United States agree to regard a lymph node of 1 centimeter or more in the short axis to be considered highly suspicious for malignancy. Lymph nodes can be enlarged secondary to acute inflammation, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation or recent viral infection. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CT scan to identify malignancy are 55% and 81%, respectively. Hence, CT is not a good test for lung cancer staging.

**Radiological Groups**

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) has proposed grouping patients based on tumor extent and lymph node involvement. Although CT is not the right staging tool, it helps the clinician select the site for tissue biopsy. In other words, based on these groups, further staging via non-invasive or invasive methods is planned.

Group A

- Patients with bulky tumors encircling/invading mediastinal structures cannot distinguish remote lymph nodes from the primary tumor.

- Mediastinal invasion is implied; therefore, no need for LN sampling. Tissue diagnosis suffices.

Group B

- Patients with discrete lymph node enlargement greater than 1 centimeter such that an isolated lymph node can be distinguished from the primary tumor

- Lymph node sampling is required for pathologic confirmation before curative intent therapy.

Group C

- Patients with a central tumor and an elevated risk of nodal disease despite normal-sized nodes, such as a high risk for N2/N3 disease.

- Lymph node sampling is needed even if CT/PET is negative due to a high N2/N3 disease risk.

Group D

- Patients with low risk of N2/N3 involvement or distant metastatic disease, such as peripheral T1 tumors.

- Invasive testing is not done routinely except if suspicion of N1 disease is high or the patient is not a candidate for surgery but going for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

**PET Scan**

PET scanning allows in vivo determination of metabolic and pathologic processes. It provides limited anatomic resolution but provides information on the primary tumor's metabolic activity, mediastinal involvement, and potential distant metastases. The new integrated PET/CT scanners have eliminated the problem of unclear anatomy. The primary advantage of PET scanning is that it has reduced the number of futile thoracotomies by accurately identifying metastasis and thus excluding curative surgery as an option. PET scan is also helpful in excluding recurrent tumors after initial therapy. It also can identify recurrence versus metabolic changes post radiation therapy. False positives occur in patients with active infection and inflammation with increased glycolysis. In cases of recent lymph node sampling, a PET scan may be falsely positive. False-negative PET scans occur when there is impaired blood flow and low metabolic activity, such as with carcinoid tumors and some adenocarcinomas, and smaller lymph nodes.

PET scan has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 88%, which is higher than CT but not sufficient to stage lung cancer independently. Therefore, the ACCP recommends that a positive PET does not obviate the need for lymph node sampling except for group A disease.

**Invasive Staging**

After CT and PET scans, the next step is to obtain tissue or pathologic confirmation of malignancy, confirm the staging and histological differentiation of cancer. One of the following procedures achieves this.

- Bronchoscopic endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA)

- Endoscopic-TBNA

- Mediastinoscopy

- Thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopy(VATS)

A CT-guided transthoracic biopsy is an option for peripheral lesions with a low risk of pneumothorax. Certain older procedures, such as the Chamberlain procedure, are sometimes required.

**Bronchoscopic TBNA**

- Convex probe-endobronchial ultrasound-guided (CP-EBUS)-TBNA

- Radial probe-EBUS-TBNA (RP-EBUS)

- Navigation bronchoscopy

**CP-EBUS Bronchoscopy**

This is a bronchoscopic technique in which a miniature convex ultrasound of 7.5 MHZ is attached to the tip of the bronchoscope. It provides direct visualization of structures in the mediastinum or lung parenchyma through the bronchial wall. A biopsy is performed in real-time. It is mainly used to sample the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. The image can be frozen and measured, and there is also a Doppler available to identify blood vessels. It is the procedure of choice for this purpose. CP-EBUS is also the procedure of choice postinduction chemotherapy before surgery to confirm complete remission. CP-EBUS can be used to sample upper and lower paratracheal nodes as well as stations 10, 11, and 12. Stations 3, 5, and 6 are not accessible via CP-EBUS.

**RP-EBUS Bronchoscopy**

Instead of a convex probe, there is a miniature (20 to 30 MHz) probe. The advantages are that smaller lesions or more peripheral lesions can be reached, and it provides a 360-degree view of lung parenchyma. A real-time biopsy cannot be performed.

**Navigation Bronchoscopy**

The concept is to construct a navigational map of airways using either a CT scan or an electromagnetic field. After the map is constructed, the software creates the path to reach the location of the nodule. The bronchoscopist can create the pathway, and the software then navigates the bronchoscopist to the biopsy site.

**Endoscopic-TBNA**

Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is becoming an increasingly useful tool for diagnosing and staging lung cancer. It can sample lymph nodes through the esophageal wall and provides a real-time sampling of stations 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9. The latter two stations cannot be sampled by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). It has the same sensitivity and specificity as EUS, 89%, and 100% respectively. There is also a growing trend to combine EBUS and EUS as minimally invasive lung cancer staging techniques.

**Mediastinoscopy**

Mediastinoscopy was formerly the gold standard for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. It is mainly used to sample lymph nodes after negative needle technique and when the patient is still at high risk for cancer due to lymph node size or FDG uptake on a PET scan. Most commonly, para-tracheal lymph nodes are sampled. Alternatively, an anterior mediastinoscopy (Chamberlain procedure) can be performed to access subaortic and para-aortic nodes, stations 5 and 6, respectively. Mediastinoscopy has a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 100%. Like all surgical procedures, mediastinoscopy has some risks. General anesthesia is required, and the procedure carries a mortality risk of 0.08%.

**Thoracoscopy**

Traditionally, thoracoscopy was performed by dividing the ribs and opening the chest cavity. Like laparoscopic surgery, it has largely replaced open abdominal surgeries. Video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) has replaced thoracoscopy. It is used to treat several chest wall, pleural, pulmonary, and mediastinal conditions. Mediastinal lymph node sampling and full dissection during lung resection for cancer can be performed with VATS. A newer version of VATS is called RATS (robotic-assisted thoracoscopy). There are no trials comparing VATS and RATS for mediastinal lymph node biopsy.
