The prognosis for patients with coccydynia is variable. While most patients' symptoms improve or resolve with conservative (non-surgical) care, other patients have notoriously persistent, even lifelong, coccyx pain. The severity of the pain and the functional impairment (the limited ability to sit) can be disabling. Coccygectomy has a relatively high postoperative infection rate, and even after tailbone removal, many patients have some degree of persistent pain.
