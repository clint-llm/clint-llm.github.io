The risks and benefits of endotracheal intubation should be assessed as would be done with any other procedure. Patients whose respiratory status might improve with less invasive methods should be tried on modalities such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or other modes of oxygenation. Severe orofacial trauma can obstruct oropharyngeal intubation due to significant bleeding or disruption of the facial and upper airway anatomy. Cervical spine manipulation during intubation can be harmful to patients with spine injury and immobility. In the setting of these clinical situations, other modes of ventilation and oxygenation should be undertaken if the clinical condition allows. If a definitive airway is required, providers should be prepared for the potential of a surgical airway. There are no absolute contraindications to intubation, and the decision to place a definitive airway should take into consideration each patient’s unique clinical condition.
