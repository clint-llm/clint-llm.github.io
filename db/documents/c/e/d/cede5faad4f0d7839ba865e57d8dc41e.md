Differentiating VPCs from other arrhythmias can be challenging, because several arrhythmias may mimic VPCs, as listed below;

- Aberrant premature atrial contractions

- Fusion beats

- Premature junctional contractions

- Idioventricular escape rhythms

- Sustained and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia

- Bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy

- Supraventricular tachycardia

- Atrial fibrillation

- Sinus arrhythmia
