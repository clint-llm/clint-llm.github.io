SANRT, as discussed, is prevalent among patients who have structural heart disease. The exact structure of the reentry circuit is controversial but is mostly believed to exist just within the SA node itself or to involve the perinodal tissue together with the SA node for the manifestation of this tachyarrhythmia. No extrinsic factors are known to cause SANRT.
