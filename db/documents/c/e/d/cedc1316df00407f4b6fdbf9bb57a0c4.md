Although ngene sequencing studies have described multiple genes associations with hepatocellular carcinoma, most of the initiating genetic events that incite hepatocellular carcinoma remain unknown. Genomic instability, including chromosomal or single nucleotide polymorphism, could be the force of tumorigenesis in liver cancer. Recurrently somatic mutated genes (e.g., TERT promoter, TP53, CTNNB1, ARID1A, FGF) with implicated signaling pathways (JAK/STAT, WntB-catenin, PI3K-AKT-mTOR) have been identified as major drivers of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. No potential driver or targeted therapy has emerged likely due to the genomic heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma. The classical prognostic biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma include Ki-67 protein expression and TP53 gene mutation, which has repeatedly been demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis.

The most important pathologic issue is the distinction between fibrolamellar variant with tumor encapsulation that presents in younger individuals. These lesions are more likely to be resectable, less frequently related to viral infection or cirrhosis, accompany normal AFP levels and an overall better prognosis, or the traditional hepatocellular cancer presenting in the older population with a chronic disease and less than 25% resectable cases.
