The main complication from internal hemorrhoidal disease is hemorrhage. However, there may be several complications after the different procedures used to treat hemorrhoids. Delayed hemorrhage, severe pain, ulceration, fulminant sepsis may all develop after hemorrhoidal procedures. For rubber band ligation, delayed hemorrhage can happen approximately 1% of the time. Sepsis from rubber band ligation usually develops in immunocompromised patients. These patients present with a fever, perineal edema, and pain. Treatment should be prompt and involves broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement. A colostomy may be required. Urinary retention is another complication that may develop after surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids and occurs in 15% of patients. Risk factors for this include aggressive fluid hydration and pain. Anal stenosis is a rare complication of hemorrhoidectomy that is managed with anal dilation and diet modification.
