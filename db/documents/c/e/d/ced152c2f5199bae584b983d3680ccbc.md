Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (GI), which manifests with chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea. It is a condition that negatively impacts the quality of life of individuals affected and contributes to increased healthcare costs.

Alosetron was eventually reintroduced in 2002 with more restricted indications, with its use limited to treating severe IBS-D symptoms in women that are refractory to other therapies.

The definition of severe IBS-D is diarrhea with one or more of the following

- Frequent and severe abdominal pain and discomfort

- Frequent bowel urgency and fecal incontinence

- Disability or restrictions in activities of daily living as a result of IBS

To meet the criteria to be started on alosetron, women with severe IBS-D had to have:

- Chronic symptoms lasting six months or longer

- Must not have any anatomic or biochemical abnormalities of the GI tract, placing them at risk forÂ ischemic colitis or complications of constipation

- Have failed conventional therapy

The starting dose was also lowered to minimize the incidence of constipation.
