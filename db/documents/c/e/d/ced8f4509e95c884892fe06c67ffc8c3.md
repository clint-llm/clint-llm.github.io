GnIH binds and stimulates the GPR147 receptor to suppress adenylyl cyclase formation which ultimately suppresses gonadotrope function. The inhibitory effects of GnIH on reproduction is mainly accomplished at the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, gonadotropes, and the gonads are major targets of GnIH action based on the interaction and distribution of the GnIH receptor.KISS1 gene in humans).
