Swan-Ganz catheter is a thin tube that is inserted peripherally and passed to the right side of the heart and into the pulmonary artery. This catheterization is to measure the pressures in the pulmonary vasculature and the left atrium. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is an estimate of the pressure in the left atrium given by the Swanz-GanzÂ catheter. It is significant because it helps to differentiate pathologies. In cardiac shock, there is an increase in PCWP, whereas in hemorrhagic shock, there is a decrease in PCWP.
