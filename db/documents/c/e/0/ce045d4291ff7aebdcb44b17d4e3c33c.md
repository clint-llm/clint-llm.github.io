Prevention of contrast toxicity is highly individualized since the risk of adverse reactions is relatively small, and the benefits of an expedited, more accurate diagnosis are tremendous. A complete discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to using contrast agents may be conducted before the use of contrast agents in a patient. Informed consent is not presently required for contrast administration, but increasing patient education may help prevent against and prepare for adverse events related to contrast use.
