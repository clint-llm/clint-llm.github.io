An interprofessional team approach is required due to the complex nature of PAD and its multiorgan involvement. A team approach has been found to significantly improve the patient's treatment outcomes and prevent further disease progression and risk of significant sequelae of the disease. The team can be broken down into three main sections; medical management, wound care, and revascularization, to avoid duplication of care and promote cooperation. Medical management is provided by primary care, cardiologists, endocrinologists, infectious disease team, and dietitians. Wound care is provided by podiatrists, vascular surgeons, nursing staff, orthopedics, and the plastic surgery team. Ultrasound technicians provide the scans themselves, which form the basis for directing clinical decision-making. Nurses can also provide valuable assistance in patient evaluation, counseling, and assisting during revascularization procedures. This interprofessional approach will yield the best patient results.

Revascularization is dealt with by intervention radiologists and cardiologists, and the vascular surgery team. A complete team should include at least one member from each team to treat patients diagnosed with PAD or critical limb ischemia. By bringing together the knowledge of different team members and effective communication, optimal patient-centered care can be provided, and the limb salvage rate can be increased.
