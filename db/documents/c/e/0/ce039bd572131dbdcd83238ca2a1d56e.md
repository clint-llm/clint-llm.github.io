LADA is the most frequent form of adult-onset autoimmune DM. It is also the most prevalent form of autoimmune diabetes as a whole.

Most patients with LADA are positive for a single islet autoantibody, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) is the most predominant. Some population groups have a varying prevalence of different autoantibodies, and measuring just one may underestimate the prevalence of LADA. Autoantibodies have been observed to appear and disappear during longitudinal follow-up. In these situations, the role of assay interference from anti-idiotype antibodies should be considered.

A form of latent autoimmune diabetes in the young (LADY) has been described.
