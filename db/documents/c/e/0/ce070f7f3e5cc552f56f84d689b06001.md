Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a type of mechanical ventilation which is a relatively newer mode of closed-loop ventilation. The feature was introduced in the Galileo ventilator (Hamilton Medical, 1994). Hewlett first described it in 1977 as a form of mandatory minute ventilation (MMV) with adaptive pressure control.

ASV is also called the “no mode” or “integrated mode” or the “three in one way” because of its highly adaptive characteristic to alter its ventilatory settings, which are not found in other closed-loop modes of ventilation. Other modes include proportional assist ventilation (PAV), neurally adjusted ventilatory assistance (NAVA), and knowledge-based systems (KBS).
