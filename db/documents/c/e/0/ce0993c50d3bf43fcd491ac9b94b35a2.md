Nonoperative management has efficacy for many symptomatic SLAP tears and should be considered for initial treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated non-operative management successful for 22 to 85% of patients.

Operative intervention in adults has been reported to be successful between 80 and 97% of patients in several populations.

Ultimately, nonoperative and operative management yields successful results for many patients; however, treatment success is highly dependent upon the patient's functional level and treatment goals. An honest dialogue of outcomes with each patient is vital before selecting the appropriate intervention.
