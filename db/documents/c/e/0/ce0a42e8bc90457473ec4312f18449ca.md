Several treatment options exist, with only a few being FDA approved. When selecting a treatment option, the healthcare provider should encourage the safest option first, such as lifestyle changes, and then proceed to the following hormonal and/or non-hormonal treatments. The most effective treatment for hot flashes is systemic estrogen, with a 75% reduction of VMS frequency.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is the largest study of its kind that evaluated hormone therapy risks in menopausal women. It was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of women age 50 to 79 years at baseline, designed to assess HT’s impact on cardiovascular disease. Initial findings of the WHI reported that combined HT was not cardioprotective.

Since 2002, after the initial findings of the WHI were published, the use of HT decreased substantially (as much as 80%) as patients and providers turned to alternate forms of managing VMS.

Prescription nonhormonal therapies include:

- Gabapentin/pregabalin

- Clonidine

- SSRIs (paroxetine)

- SNRIs (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine)

These medications are more effective than placebos but not as effective as hormonal therapy.

Lifestyle changes such as exercise, layering clothes, maintaining lower room temperature, drinking cool drinks, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol are reasonable to consider for the management of VMS even if there aren't conclusive studies proving their efficacy.
