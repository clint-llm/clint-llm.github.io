Fetal echogenic bowel is considered a soft marker and, when detected in a prenatal ultrasound, should prompt further evaluation to detectÂ additional abnormalities. As discussed above, multiple etiologies can lead to the finding of echogenic bowel.

The following differentials should be considered while evaluating fetal echogenic bowel:

- Increased cellularity or thick meconium (intestinal obstruction, cystic fibrosis, chromosomal abnormality)

- Fetal swallowing of blood (fetoplacental hemorrhage, bleeding into the amniotic fluid, placental abruption)

- Inflammation of the bowel (TORCH infection)

- Decreased blood flow in the bowel (fetal growth restriction, fetoplacental insufficiency)

- False-positive (frequency and gain settings of the ultrasound machine, expertise of the sonologist)

It may be possible to differentiate these based on additional clues to the underlying etiology. For example, additional abnormalities like a congenital heart defect or a thick nuchal cord may point towards aneuploidies, features of fetal ascites or hydrops may point towards an infective etiology, whereas thickened dilated bowel wall associated with obstruction or calcification may indicate cystic fibrosis.
