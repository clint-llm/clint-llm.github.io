The evaluation of HE begins with a complete blood count. Normocytic normochromic anemia can be seen. Additionally, a peripheral blood smear should be done, which typically shows that 15% to 100% of the RBCs are elliptocytes. Other cells that can be seen in different subtypes are spherocytes, stomatocytes, poikilocytes, ovalocytes, and macro-ovalocytes. Testing for hemolysis should be carried out. There is extravascular hemolysis in hereditary elliptocytosis, which is characterized by an increased reticulocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin level. A sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for quantitation of protein 4.1 and spectrin analysis can be done. Osmotic gradient ektacytometry may be helpful and typically shows a decreased maximum of deformability.
