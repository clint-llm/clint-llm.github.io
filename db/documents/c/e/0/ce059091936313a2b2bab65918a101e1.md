Due to the potential for dose-dependent QTc interval elongation, the FDA recommendsÂ EKG monitoring along with potassium and magnesium in susceptible populations, such as the elderly or other at-risk groups. These at-risk groups include patients with electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients on other medications that may prolong the QTc interval.

Pregnant patients should be monitored for adverse fetal outcomes associated with ondansetron therapy.
