Atypical fibroxanthoma is a rare, low-grade superficial sarcoma that frequently presents as a red nodule or plaque. It is considered a superficial variant of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma). Although atypical fibroxanthoma has similar histologic features to undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, it behaves less aggressively.This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation and cause of atypical fibroxanthoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of atypical fibroxanthoma.
- Review the presentation of atypical fibroxanthoma. 

- Summarize the management options available for atypical fibroxanthoma.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with atypical fibroxanthoma.
