Main points on metacarpal fractures:

- Common hand injury

- Require thorough assessment consisting ofÂ the history, examination, and radiological investigations

- They mostly divide into open or closed, based on the digit they affect, intra-articular or extra-articular status, and based on the location on the bone itself (head, neck, shaft, base)

- May have conservative or operative treatment

- Can have long-term sequelae requiring further management
