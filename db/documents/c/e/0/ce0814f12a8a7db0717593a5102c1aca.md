Bioavailability between various forms of cobalt varies widely and mainly derives from animal studies. In humans, the distribution of cobalt is influenced by plasma proteins, such as albumin, as well as transferrin which is a protein that normally binds iron. Uptake is mediated by the P2X7 transporter and is a substrate of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1).

Cobalt elimination is mostly in the urine, with a smaller portion in the feces. Urinary elimination is increased in acute exposures.
