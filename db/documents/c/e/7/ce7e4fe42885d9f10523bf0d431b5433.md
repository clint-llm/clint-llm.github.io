The treatment choice depends upon the degree of opacity sufficient enough to cause difficulty in performing essential daily activities. Following treatment modalities are available:

- **Medical**: If visual acuity is 6/24 or better, pupillary dilatation with 2.5% phenylephrine or refractive glasses is enough to carry on routine activities, and surgery is not required. Cyclopentolate and atropine can also be useful. Recently, there are also cataracts drops under trial, which can dissolve cataracts.

- **Surgery:**If visual acuity is worse than 6/24 or there is a medical indication (phacolytic glaucoma, phacomorphic glaucoma, retinal detachment) in which a cataract is adversely affecting the health of the eye, surgery is always needed.

- **Congenital Cataract:**No treatment is necessary if visual acuity is more than 6/24, and a patient can carry out their normal routine activities. Refractive glasses can be advised for the blurring of vision or diplopia. If visual acuity falls below 6/24, surgery is needed, and the surgeon can opt for one of the following surgical procedures depending upon patients' complaints and severity of the disease.
- Irrigation and aspiration of the lens
- Irrigation and aspiration of the lens with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation
- Irrigation aspiration of the lens with IOL, anterior vitrectomy and primary posterior capsulotomy

- **Senile Cataract:**Treatment options are the following
- **Medical:**No medical treatment is effective once the cataract has become mature.
- **Surgical:**Mature cataract has a very hard nucleus, and one of the following methods are used to extract lens:
- Extracapsular cataract extraction: a procedure of choice
- Intracapsular cataract extraction: an old technique not used frequently due to complications 
- Phaco-emulsification: a modification of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with less astigmatism and early visual recovery
- Laser phacolysis: a recent advancement under trial

- **Management of general conditions before surgery: Many general health conditions require**optimization before surgery for better results.
