In patients with CLL, the survival period could range from 2 to >20 years with a median survival of 10 years. The patients who present as Rai stage 0-II may survive for 5 to 20 years with no treatment. Lymphocyte doubling time is a prognostic factor of CLL, defined as the number of months it takes to double the absolute lymphocyte count. A more aggressive expression of CLL is seen in untreated patients with a lymphocyte doubling time of <12 months. Favorable prognostic factors include mutated Ig heavy chain variable region, 13 q deletion, low expression of ZAP-70, and low CD38 levels on flow cytometry. Unfavorable prognostic factors include specific high-risk cytogenetics abnormalities such as 17p deletion and 11q deletion. The patients with multiple chain lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia have a worse prognosis. One of the commonly used tools to predict CLL related outcomes includes CLL-IPI (International Prognostic Index for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia).
