SBME is playing an increasingly significant role in the delivery of education for all medical specialties. Otolaryngology departments are utilizing simulation to deliver high fidelity technical training with a focus on construct validity. The delivery of a modern otolaryngology service requires a wide multidisciplinary team. Traditionally, training of these teams occurs in isolation; however, SMBE is ideally suited to transform interprofessional team-working and improve patient outcomes.
