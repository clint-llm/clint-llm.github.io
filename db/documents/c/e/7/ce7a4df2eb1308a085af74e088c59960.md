F. tularensis is capable of infecting a wide variety of immune and non-immune cells, leading to necrosis and microabscess development in multiple sites. Macrophages appear to be an important early target of infection and may spread the infection from the initial site of inoculation to the regional lymph nodes and beyond. Studies are underway to define the immune evasion mechanisms, such as caspase-3 mediated cell death, as these may provide targets for future therapy.

Inhalation of as few as ten organisms can lead to disease. Once inside the body, the organism rapidly multiplies. Ulceration is common at the site of entry and this is usually followed by local lymphadenopathy. Granuloma formation is very common and thus the organism is often mistaken for mycobacterium tuberculosis.

F.tularensis can impair phagocytosis and survive for prolonged periods in the infected cells. The incubation period varies from 2-9 days. A few individuals are asymptomatic but in most people, it leads to an acute septic reaction followed by death.
