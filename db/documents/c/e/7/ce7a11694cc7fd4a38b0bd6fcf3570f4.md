Flecainide acetate is an oral class Ic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) which blocks cardiac Na+ channels and received FDA approval in 1984. Flecainide is used to prevent and treat abnormally rapid heart rates, including conditions such as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVTs), Wolf=Parkinson-White syndrome, atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), AV re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in patients who do not have structural heart disease. Flecainide is also an option in treating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
