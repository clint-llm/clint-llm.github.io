Under transesophageal echocardiogram monitoring and anesthesia, using a femoral insertion, the procedure is begun with a transeptal approach. Once in the left atrium, a 7 French AL-2 (Amplatz Left Middle Type) guide catheter is used to capture the pseudoaneurysm, and a 0.035-in glide wire is advanced into it. A 5 Fr hypo tube is threaded over the glide wire into the cavity of the aneurysm and then glide wire is extracted. Multiple embolization coils of different lengths are advanced into the aneurysm cavity. The neck of the pseudoaneurysm is then occluded using a 12 mm AGA Amplatzer II vascular plug or duct occluder. There should be no communication between the LV cavity and the pseudoaneurysm cavity after deploying the plug. Following completion of the procedure, the patient should be monitored in the hospital for 1-2 days to assess for any complications.
