Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy of B or T lymphoblasts characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal, immature lymphocytes and their progenitors which ultimately leads to the replacement of bone marrow elements and other lymphoid organs resulting in a typical disease pattern characteristic of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. ALL accounts for approximately 2 percent of the lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed in the United States. Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia occurs slightly more frequently in males than females, and three times as frequently in Whites as in Blacks. Patients with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia typically present with symptoms related to anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia due to the replacement of the bone marrow with the tumor. Symptoms can include fatigue, easy or spontaneous bruising/bleeding, and infections. B-symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss are often present but may be mild. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy can be seen in up to half of adults on presentation. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is common and can be accompanied by cranial neuropathies or symptoms, predominantly meningeal, related to increased intracranial pressure.
