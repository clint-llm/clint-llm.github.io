**Differential Diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis**

ABPA mimics many diseases that involve both airway and lung parenchyma. Undiagnosed lung infiltrates, pneumonia, bronchiectasis make a long list of differential diagnoses. Following are few diseases which should be carefully ruled out while making a diagnosis of ABPA:

- Corticosteroid-dependent asthma without ABPA

- Severe asthma with fungal sensitivity (SAFS)

- Cystic fibrosis (CF)

- Bronchiectasis

- Chronic necrotizing aspergillosis

- Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Churgâ€“Strauss syndrome

- Bronchocentric granulomatosis

- Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (including drug-induced pneumonitis)

- Pulmonary tuberculosis

- Parasitic infections

- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
