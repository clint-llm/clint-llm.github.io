Heart muscles are innervated primarily by two nerves, the accelerans nerve and the vagus nerve, which provide sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation from the autonomic nervous system, respectively. Intrinsic ganglia for the myocardium are present in the epicardium, which receives signals from post-ganglionic sympathetic connections coming from the accelerans nerve and pre-ganglionic parasympathetic connections from the vagus nerve.
