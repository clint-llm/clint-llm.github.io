Oral zinc is primarily absorbed in the jejunum. Absorption is primarily facilitated by a metallothionein protein complex in the villi of the enterocytes. The majority of zinc is then bound to the metallothionein, a primarily intracellular protein that also regulates levels of many other metals, including copper. Plasma zinc is mostly bound to albumin, with a very small fraction found free in the plasma. The body's response toÂ excess zinc is to produce more metallothionein to decrease free zinc concentrations.
