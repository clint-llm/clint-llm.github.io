Infant head lag is observed when the head seems to flop around or lags posteriorly behind the trunk. Several articles have maintained that head lag should be absent by age 3 to 4 months. There's a higher incidence of head lag in preterm infants. Studies have also shown that head lag was commonly observed in siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This activity describes the evaluation and management of infant head lag and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for developing infant head lag.
- Outline the physical exam findings associated with an infant with head lag.
- Describe the common presentation of a patient with infant head lag.
- Review how interprofessional coordination can improve care for infants who demonstrate head lag.
