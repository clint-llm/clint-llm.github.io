Giant cell arteritis is a chronic systemic disorder. Interprofessional care is needed for the best management of the patients—close collaboration between the patients' primary care physician, rheumatologist, ophthalmologist, and neurologist. Long-term use of corticosteroids, which is the cornerstone of GCA management, correlates with several adverse effects, which need to be promptly addressed. Close monitoring with laboratory and clinic evaluations can be crucial in managing GCA and its relapses and preventing GCA-induced and treatment-induced complications.
