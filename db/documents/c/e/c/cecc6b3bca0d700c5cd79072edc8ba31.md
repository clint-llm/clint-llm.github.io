The immature immune system is the major contributing factor for increased neonatal susceptibility to sepsis. The immature function of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes makes these cells incapable of carrying out a complete inflammatory response in neonates. Furthermore, neonates have a limited number of immunoglobulins at birth and cannot generate a quantitative and/or qualitative adequate mounting response against infectious agents. The insufficient time that premature has in the uterus decrease the transfer of immune globulins to the fetus. This deficiency in immunoglobulins makes premature infants at much higher risk for sepsis when compared to term infants
