Abscesses can lead to sepsis and significant morbidity and mortality for patients. Patients with abscess, especially deep abscess, can be critically ill. Image-guided percutaneous drainage is very beneficial for these critically ill patients as it allows for successful drainage of the abscess with minimally invasive techniques. General anesthesia can be avoided, which may reduce hospital stay and also decrease the cost of care.

Percutaneous drainage can also increase antibiotic stewardship. Most abscesses are best treated with incision and drainage and do not require antibiotics. However, if local erythema is present, and the patient is experiencing systemic symptoms, i.e., fever, chills, lethargy, it is important to recognize this and treat concomitantly with antibiotics. Patients with diabetes, history of MRSA, IV drug use, and other historical information should be considered when prescribing an appropriate antibiotic.
