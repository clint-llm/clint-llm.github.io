A diaphragmatic hernia (DH) is a protrusion of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity due to a defect within the diaphragm. It is most common as a congenital phenomenon; however, there have also been cases where it can be acquired.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) refers to a developmental defect of the diaphragm that will result in the herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest cavity. Neonates with CDH usually present early in the first few hours of life with respiratory distress. The respiratory distress accompanied by the CDH may be mild. Occasionally the accompanied respiratory distress is so severe and can be life-threatening. With antenatal diagnosis and improved neonatal care, survival has been remarkably improved, but there is still a notable risk of morbidity and mortality in infants with CDH.

Diaphragmatic injury is rare, complicating less than 1 percent of all traumatic patients.
