The suprascapular nerve arises from the ventral rami of the fifth and sixth cervical nerves and in some population the ventral ramus of the fourth cervical nerve. Motor nerve roots originate from the ventral ramus of the spinal cord. The ventral (motor) plate begins as a ventrolateral thickening of the intermediate zone of the neural tube. The intermediate zone gives rise to motor neuroblasts of the ventral and lateral horns. Branched axons beginning at the motor neuroblast exit the spinal cord and become the ventral (motor) roots. The basal plate later becomes the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. the neural crest migrates to the nerve and then they differentiate to form the Schwan cells.
