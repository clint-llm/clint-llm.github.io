Management of COVID-19 during pregnancy and the puerperium should be an interprofessional approach involving obstetricians, pulmonologists, and neonatologists at the very least. The decision to use investigational drugs and any drug under emergency-use authorization must be made as a team while explaining the risk-benefit ratio of the same to the patient.

**Medical Management**

- **Oxygenation:**Though it does not vary significantly in most aspects from non-pregnant individuals, one of the basic differences is the threshold for oxygen supplementation, which is at <95% in pregnant individuals. This is to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus.

- **Remdesivir:**Remdesivir is beneficial in both preventing disease progression from mild to severe and preventing worse outcomes in severe disease; however, the major studies for its use did not include pregnant or lactating mothers. A few case reports and series have seen its use on compassionate grounds. The NIH also advises physicians not to withhold it in pregnant women when there is an appropriate indication.

- **Monoclonal antibody therapy:**It is presently recommended for patients with**mild COVID-19 and risk factors for progression to severe disease**. The presently available monoclonal antibodies with EUA are bamlanivimab-etesivimab, casirivimab-imdevimab, and sotrovimab.**post-exposure prophylaxis**in unvaccinated, incompletely vaccinated, and those with factors that would lead to poor immune response development.

- **Interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors:**Tocilizumab or sarilumab, which are presently indicated in patients with a rapidly increasing oxygen requirement, cross the placental barrier and may have an immunosuppressive effect on the fetus.

- **Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors:**Baricitinib and tofacitinib also are likely to cross the placental barrier.

- **Anticoagulation:**Pregnant patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 are eligible for prophylactic anticoagulation as in non-pregnant individuals.

- **Other drugs:**Other experimental drugs inclusive of zinc, ivermectin, plasma therapy, nitazoxanide, etc., either have insufficient evidence for recommendations for use presently or are not recommended, and thereby any use in pregnancy must be approached on the merits of the individual drugs. An exhaustive list of the same is available in the NIH guidelines.

- **Prone Positioning:**Of the non-pharmacological approaches, one of the challenges is proning during pregnancy. Patients eligible for prone positioning for hypoxemia can undergo proning in early pregnancy like a non-pregnant individual. However, proning with the gravid uterus becomes a challenging prospect with advancing gestational age. Appropriate padding above and below the uterus to avoid aortocaval compression and thoracic compression must be ensured. If full proning is not feasible, left lateral decubitus may also be used for pregnant patients.

**Obstetric Management**

It is advisable that pregnant patients suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19 who require hospitalization be hospitalized at a center with the capability for maternal and fetal monitoring as per need. Presently ACOG has not recommended additional visits or monitoring for pregnant patients with COVID-19. The mode of delivery should be determined as per routine obstetric indications for any mode.

COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy is not an independent indication for a Caesarean section per se. Steroids are not needed if the patient is not hypoxemic unless indicated for fetal maturity as per a routine obstetric indication. Conversely, if steroids are indicated for COVID-19 pneumonia, they must be given as would be for a non-pregnant individual.

**Management of Concomitant diseases and Vaccination Decisions**

Patients who have been advised to take inhaled corticosteroids or systemic steroids for other systemic pathologies must continue their steroids irrespective of the COVID-19 infection.

**Post-natal Management**

It is important to establish that a shared-decision-making approach is presently the best for post-natal management of the mother and child. The ACOG, NIH, and American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) have released their statements and/or guidance documents regarding the same.

Separation of the mother and child is inevitable in the event either suffer from a severe illness, which requires further management, which will hamper breastfeeding and/or contact. Additionally, separation may be opted for in circumstances where the mother is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, and the child is at high risk for severe illness (e.g., a premature child).

Mothers must be counseled regarding the possibility of the passage of any investigational drug that they may be prescribed through breast milk and the paucity of information regarding the effects on neonates. This will empower them to participate better in the shared decision-making process regarding breastfeeding.

If symptomatic, mothers may opt to stay away from their children for the period of infectivity, roughly ten days from symptom onset for mild or moderate illness and 20 days for severe illness or in immunocompromised conditions with prolonged viral shedding. However, a practical problem could exist in patients who are eligible for a discharge before the completion of the isolation period. In these cases, if the home isolation is such that it makes mother-child separation unfeasible, a policy of separation during the hospital stay may not change the risk of the child.

Additionally, if a child has been tested during the birth hospitalization and tests positive, there is no need to separate the pair unless necessitated for medical intervention.

Testing children of mothers with suspected or diagnosed COVID-19 is unlikely to influence therapy considerations for the neonates given the absence of approved specific therapy. Testing may be considered to identify the need for infection control practices while handling the children, as per availability and hospital policy. As per AAP, a 48-72 hourly testing regime to ensure mucosal clearance of the virus can be followed. For a child who tests positive for COVID-19 and remains asymptomatic, a follow-up for at least two weeks is recommended even if discharged.

For mothers who opt to stay away from their children during the infectious period, breast pumps may be provided to encourage breast milk expression. For pairs that are together, masking should be a policy for the mothers and NOT for the neonates. In the inter-feeding period, distancing by six feet to minimize exposure is advisable.

The risk of anxiety, depression, and several disorders in the anxiety disorders spectrum increases after COVID-19. Facilitating counseling and psychiatry consult as per the patient's need while actively observing for signs of these anxiety disorders is essential. This includes at least one postpartum screening attempt with a questionnaire. This effort must be taken irrespective of an antepartum assessment, given that the risk continues for a year postpartum.
