Although primarily a clinical diagnosis, radiography can be useful to identify the extent of disease. Also, ainhum has correlations with progressive features that may be identifiable with plain films, ultrasound, computed tomography, or even magnetic resonance imaging. The earliest phase demonstrates a deep sulcus along with the soft tissue of the phalanx; this has been likened to having the appearance of a “sand-glass.” The second phase occurs as a result of lymphedema and appears as increased volume distal to the constricting band. The third phase corresponds with the presence of bone resorption distal to the band, and the fourth phase is that of spontaneous amputation.
