Horner syndrome is a rare condition classically presenting with partial ptosis (drooping or falling of the upper eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and facial anhidrosis (absence of sweating) due to a disruption in the sympathetic nerve supply. It is primarily acquired following damage to the sympathetic nerve supply, but rare cases of congenital forms have been seen. Treatment is centered around the identification and appropriate management of the underlying cause. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Horner syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Horner syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Horner syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for patients with Horner syndrome.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and treatment of Horner syndrome and improve patient outcomes.
