The decision to suture a tongue laceration depends on the size of the laceration or the gaping nature of the wound. Performing tongue assessment is best when the tongue is at rest inside the mouth as this is the most common position, as opposed to protruding outside the mouth. Complex lacerations are those that involve large flaps, active bleeding or through-and-through injuries of the tongue and are more likely to require repair. Lacerations or avulsions that are small can potentially be left to heal without intervention due to the tongue’s ability to bulk up via hypertrophy. The ability to hypertrophy can often fill in the gaps of the wound so that no deficit is identifiable.
