Bone marrow failure has triphasic peaks: at 2 to 5 years (inherited is most common), between 20 to 25 years, and after 65 years (most likely due to acquired causes). The incidence of inherited bone marrow failures accounts for 10% to 15% of marrow aplasia and 30% of pediatric bone marrow failure disorders, with approximately 65 cases per million live births every year. The majority of children with inherited bone marrow failures have an identifiable cause (75%). Patients can present as adults. The most common inherited bone marrow failure is Fanconi anemia which occurs in 1 to 5 cases per million with a carrier frequency of 1 in 200 to 300; however, it is more common in Spanish gypsies (1 in 64), Afrikaners in South Africa carrying a specific mutation (1 in 83), and Ashkenazi Jews (1 in 89). Ten percent of patients who present with bone marrow failure have unsuspected Fanconi anemia.
