About 95% of the women with cervical cancer are infected with one or more HPV subtypes, HPV 16 and 18 are the most common (HPV-16 in 50% of women and HPV-18 in 10 to 15% of women).

**High-Risk HPV (Oncogenic/Cancer-associated):**type****16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 69 and 82

**Low-Risk HPV (Non-Oncogenic):**type 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 72 and 81

However, not all women who harbor HPV infection will develop cervical cancer. Most HPV infections 16, 18 are asymptomatic and clear within two years. The presence of persistent infection and those who have associated co-factors like cigarette smoking or immunodeficiency are at higher risk for the progression of lesions to the development of invasive cancer. Apart from HPV 16 and 18 being the most common etiology discussed, studies have been conducted showing how cervical tar exposure can act synergistically with the co-existing HPV infection to cause cervical squamous cell cancer (co-carcinogenesis). The various ways of cervical tar exposure are cigarette smoking, use of tar-based vaginal sanitization products, and fumes from burning of wood, dung, and coal in poorly ventilated kitchens. Various other clinical characteristics that predispose an individual to cervical cancer are

- Women with Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV, HSV 2

- Early-onset of sexual activity

- Multiple or high-risk sexual partners

- Immunosuppressed individuals (following transplant surgery), viral infections, and HIV

- Combination oral contraceptive and progestogen use

- Poor socioeconomic status and poor personal hygiene

- Tobacco use
