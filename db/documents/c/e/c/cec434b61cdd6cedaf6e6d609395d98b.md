In the WoMan-trial, a randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands and England between August 2010 and May 2014, 161 women were randomly allocated to treatment by Word catheter or marsupialization to compare recurrence of a cyst or abscess within 1 year.

Recurrence occurred in 10 women (12%) in the Word catheter group and 8 women (10%) in the marsupialization group. Within the first 24 hours after treatment, 33% used analgesics in the Word catheter group versus 74% in the marsupialization group. Time from diagnosis to treatment was 1 hour for placement of Word catheter versus 4 hours for marsupialization.

Recurrence rates were found to be comparable within the two groups; however, the marsupialization group had increased use of analgesics within the first 24 hours and increased duration of treatment.

Due to the need for specialist referral (gynecology), as well as the increased duration of treatment for marsupialization, I&D with Word catheter placement is the recommended treatment for first-time Bartholin abscess. (Level II)

Antibiotic therapy should be considered for those who have failed initial I&D with Word catheter placement, patients with systemic symptoms including fever, patients who have suspected sepsis, and those considered at high risk for recurrence.

Women who are pregnant and have Bartholin abscesses should be treated in the same manner as nonpregnant women, with the exception of Bartholin gland excision due to the increased risk of bleeding.
