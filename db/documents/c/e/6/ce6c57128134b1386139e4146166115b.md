The hypothalamic dysregulation may play a role in promoting tumor growth; however, intrinsic pituicyte genetic dysfunction plays a more significant role in tumorigenesis. Due to the pituitary gland being responsible for producing various hormones, the pathophysiology can vary significantly.

Cushing disease: Corticotropinomas occur in people of all ages. They have a female preponderance. It refers to a pituitary adenoma that produces adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in excess, which then leads to excess cortisol secretion. These adenomas are comparatively smaller than others. In adults, there is an absence of diurnal variation of plasma cortisol and ACTH; however, in children, these tumors present with weight gain and growth failure.

Gigantism: Somatotropinomas are adenomas of growth hormone-producing pituicytes, which may cause gigantism when in childhood, open epiphysial plates allow for excessive longitudinal growth. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) mutations have been found to be associated with early-onset gigantism.

Prolactinoma: This is the most common pituitary adenoma found in childhood. Prolactinomas take their origin from acidophilic cells that are derived from the same lineage as the thyrotropes and somatotropes. This is the reason why prolactinomas may also secrete growth hormone and TSH.

Thyrotropinoma: These adenomas secrete TSH mainly; however, they may also secrete excess prolactin, growth hormone, and alpha subunit. They are usually large and aggressive.
