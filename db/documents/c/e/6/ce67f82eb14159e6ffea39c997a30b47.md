CGD occurs in 1 in every 200,000 live births in the United States. Due to the X-chromosome-linked gene mutation, approximately 80% of patients with CGD are males. The incidence rates are nearly identical across ethnic and racial groups, and approximately one-third of the X-linked mutations occur de-novo. In cultures where consanguineous marriage is common, the autosomal recessive subtype of the disease is more common than the X-linked recessive forms, and the overall incidence rates are higher. Children with the X-linked variant of CGD tend toÂ have an earlier onset and suffer a more severe disorder than the autosomal recessive form.
