Hemorrhoidal disease is a common disorder requiring surgical intervention in approximately 10% of cases. The overall prevalence is unknown because asymptomatic patients are less likely to seek medical help. Some sources estimate the incidence of symptomatic patients in the U.S is 4.4%, with patients between the ages of 45 to 65 years old being most affected. Surgical hemorrhoidectomy is necessary for the large third- and fourth-degree hemorrhoids when medical management has failed, when there is a large bulging external component, or when incarcerated internal hemorrhoids need immediate medical treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hemorrhoidal disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for a hemorrhoidectomy. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to a hemorrhoidectomy. 
- Review the potential complications of a hemorrhoidectomy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance hemorrhoidectomies and improve outcomes.
