Prognosis depends on a range of factors. Provided that a patient's wrist dislocation is identified and treated in a timely manner, then one can expect a reasonable outcome. In the setting of recurrent instability and abnormal carpal biomechanics, there is a higher risk of developing post-traumatic arthritis. For patients with chronic scapholunate dissociation, they may go on to develop scapholunate advanced collapse.
