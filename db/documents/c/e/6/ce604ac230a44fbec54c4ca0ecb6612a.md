Cardioplegia cannula is needed to deliver infusion during cardiac surgery. Additional equipment to have readily available includes an aortic cross-clamp, cannulas for arterial and venous access, and accessory cannulas for initiation and maintenance of cardiopulmonary bypass. Monitors must be displayed at all times for all members of the team, including the anesthesiologist, perfusionist, and cardiothoracic surgeon. Monitors should visibly portray mean arterial blood pressure and intraluminal pressure of the cardioplegia delivery system.
