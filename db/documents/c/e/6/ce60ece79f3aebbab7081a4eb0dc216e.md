Full-blown advanced cervical cancer, whether in HIV-positive or negative women, has 100 percent mortality. All women should be made aware of the importance of regular screening and the availability of the HPV vaccine. Patients with nonspecific cervical abnormalities like ASC-US must be educated and closely monitored, so they do not fall through the cracks and later appear with invasive cervical cancer. Weigh the costs of screening for hrHPV and treating invasive cancer with attendant grave consequences on human lives and families; versus prevention. We should choose prevention over cure because it is a less expensive choice. Combined prevention and lifestyle modification, including delay in sexual debut, reduction of sexual partners, consistent and correct use of condoms, male circumcision, and smoking cessation, would go a long way to reduce precancer and cancer.
