Mannitol has four Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved uses.

- Mannitol has approval for the reduction of intracranial pressure and brain mass.

- Mannitol is approved to reduce intraocular pressure if this is not achievable by other means.

- Mannitol can promote diuresis for acute renal failure to prevent or treat the oliguric phase before irreversible damage.

- Mannitol can also promote diuresis to promote the excretion of toxic substances, materials, and metabolites.

There are multiple uses of mannitol that are not FDA-approved.

- Mannitol may be used to prime a heart and lung machine before putting the patient on a heart-lung bypass. The mannitol may help to preserve renal function as the kidneys have decreased blood flow.  The mannitol is suspected to decrease renal cell swelling.

- Mannitol works to protect sharp objects as they get introduced into a vascular space. A mannitol cap on a pacemaker wire will protect the tip from becoming dulled while a clinician introduces it into the vascular system then the mannitol will readily dissolve away with minimal effect.

- Mannitol may have utility as a challenge test for diagnosing asthma.

- Mannitol is a sweetener for diabetic food products. Mannitol is sugar but increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than some other sugars such as sucrose.
