- Hepatic adenomas are rare benign epithelial tumors of the liver frequently associated with women of reproductive age who are taking exogenous estrogens in the form of oral contraceptive pills.

- The classification scheme of hepatic adenomas based on molecular behavior patterns called the phenotypic-genotypic classification has been validated and is a useful classification scheme.

- HNF-1alpha type is associated with hepatocyte differentiation, mostly seen in women or with mature-onset diabetes of the young.

- Beta-catenin activated mutations that account for 15% to 20% of hepatic adenomas are most frequently associated with exposure to male hormones. Because this population has a higher risk of malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma, surgical resection is recommended in this type of adenoma.

- Inflammatory hepatic adenoma is predominantly seen in women with higher body mass index, alcohol consumption, and systemic inflammatory syndrome. These tumors stain positive with serum amyloid A and with C-reactive protein.

- Discontinuation of oral contraceptive pills can lead to spontaneous regression of tumors in cases of single or multiple tumors less than 5 cm in size. Imaging surveillance is still recommended to monitor for regression.

- Surgery is recommended for all tumors greater than 5 cm in size but does not require wide margins or regional lymphadenectomy.

- Obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and metabolic syndromes are associated with hepatic adenomatosis.
