Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion with serum concentrations peaking very soon after ingestion. The volume of distribution is about 0.7 L.kg. Elimination is primarily first order when concentrations are under 250 mg/dL, with a half-life of approximately 4-6 hours.

Like ethanol and methanol, metabolism begins with gastric mucosal alcohol dehydrogenase and occurs primarily in the liver through serial oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, with each step reducing NAD+ to NADH. Ethylene glycol is first oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolaldehyde, which is then oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to glycolic acid, which is primarily responsible for the associated metabolic acidosis. Glycolic acid is then oxidized to glyoxylic by glycolic acid oxidase or lactate dehydrogenase due to its resemblance to lactate. Glyoxylic acid is a precursor for oxalic acid, the nephrotoxic metabolite; and also for the nontoxic metabolites, α-hydroxy-β-ketoadipic acid and glycine, which is further converted to hippuric acid. Thiamine is a cofactor in the production of α-hydroxy-β-ketoadipic acid and pyridoxine and magnesium are cofactors in the production of glycine
