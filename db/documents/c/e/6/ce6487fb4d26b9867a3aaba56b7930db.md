Karyotyping is one of the most preferred methods to detect structural and numerical abnormalities. Deletions, duplications, balanced or unbalanced translocations, insertions, and inversions are examples of structural abnormalities. Common inherited abnormalities include trisomies of chromosomes 13, 16, 18, or 21, and monosomy, triploidy, or tetraploidy of the X chromosome. Using the G-banding technique, the analysis of 20 metaphase-state cells is the preferred method for karyotyping. If mosaicism is suspected, 30 to 50 metaphases should be analyzed.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detects chromosome abnormalities targeting specific genetic sequences using probes with a fluorescent dye that attaches to complementary DNA. It can be performed in the interphase stage, but it does not analyze the full set of chromosomes, only the sequences targeted by the utilized probes. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the case with an adequate differential diagnosis is mandatory before selecting specific probes. FISH studies can detect inversions, insertions, translocations, microdeletions, and microduplications.

Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) is a relatively new method to diagnose patients lacking an apparent syndromic phenotype. Diagnoses of cognitive impairment, developmental delay, or autism in suspected patients are increased by 20% using CMA, especially in suspected cases of mosaicism.
