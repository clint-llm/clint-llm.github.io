Radiographs are needed if a fracture or myositis ossificans are suspected. These injuries are an important consideration for high school and college athletes because the ischial tuberosity and anterior superior iliac spine may fuse as late as the third decade of life. Pediatric and adolescent athletes should be evaluated to rule out potential pelvic avulsion injuries, including

- Iliac crest avulsion injuries

- secondary to abdominal musculature avulsions

- ASIS avulsion injuries 

- sartorius and/or tensor fascia lata (TFL) avulsion(s)

- AIIS avulsion injuries

- rectus femoris avulsion injury

- Ischial tuberosity

- proximal hamstring avulsion injuries

Otherwise, radiographs obtained in the setting of a true, isolated, iliac crest contusion (hip pointer injury) radiographs are unremarkable.

Consider CT scans if the patient has continued pain or the pain exceeds that expected from examination findings. A bone scan can exclude stress fractures if initial symptoms do not resolve. An MRI obtained in the setting of an isolated iliac crest contusion would likely reveal a large hematoma but is otherwise unremarkable.

A hip pointer must be distinguished from chronic exertional compartment syndrome, a femoral neck fracture, avascular necrosis, hip fracture or dislocation, tendonitis, iliotibial band syndrome, osteitis pubis, sacroiliac joint injury, snapping hip syndrome, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
