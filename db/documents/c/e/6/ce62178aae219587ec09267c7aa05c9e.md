Ingestion of less than 20 mg/kg of elemental iron is non-toxic. Ingestion of 20 mg/kg to 60 mg/kg results in moderate symptoms. Ingestion of more than 60 mg/kg can result in severe toxicity and lead to severe morbidity and mortality. The amount of elemental iron ingested is different depending on the formulations of iron salts. The most common iron formulations are 325 mg ferrous sulfate tablets, which contains 20% (or 65 mg) of elemental iron per tablet; 300 mg ferrous gluconate tablets, which contain 12% (or 36 mg) of elemental iron per tablet; and 100 mg ferrous fumarate tablets, which contain 33% (or 33 mg) of elemental iron per tablet. Prenatal vitamins may contain 60 to 90 mg of elemental iron per tablet. Children's vitamins vary from 5 to 19 mg of elemental iron per tablet.
