**Structures Encountered During Alloplastic Chin Implantation**

- Skin and subcutaneous tissue

- Mentalis muscle

- Mandibular periosteum

- Gingivolabial mucosa (if the intraoral approach is used)

- Mental nerve

**Anatomic Structures at Risk**

- The mental nerve is a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve from trigeminal nerve mandibular division which exits the mandible in the vicinity inferior to the first premolar. NOTE: Damage can be avoided by maintaining a dissection plane on the inferior-most aspect of the mandible. If an intraoral approach is used the nerves can be directly visualized and preserved; this may facilitate precise placement of more rigid implants such as Medpor, and may or may not be required in smaller or more flexible chin implants.

- The mentalis muscle will cause a ptotic chin if not re-approximated properly.
