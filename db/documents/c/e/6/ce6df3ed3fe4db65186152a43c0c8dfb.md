**Cardiac**

- Pediatric/Neonatal

- 
              
- Structural congenital heart disease
              
              
- 
                  
- Perioperative support
                  
                

              
              
- Nonstructural congenital or acquired heart disease
              
              
- 
                  
- E.g., cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, intractable arrhythmias, acute right-sided heart failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension, hemodynamic deterioration secondary to intoxication, cardiac failure secondary to septic shock, bridge to heart transplantation, bridge to long-term mechanical ventilatory support (e.g., ventricular assist device), bridge to heart transplantation, post-heart transplantation support, high-risk cardiac catheterization, peri-procedural support (e.g., failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass)

**Respiratory**

- Pediatric

- 
              
- Impaired gas exchange as defined by oxygenation index (OI = mean airway pressure x FiO x 100/PaO) or respiratory acidosis
              
              
- 
                  
- No threshold value for oxygenation; consider ECMO if OI not improving by day 2 of illness.
                  
                  
- Recommended threshold pH < 7.0
                  
                

              
              
- E.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, bridge to lung transplantation.

- Neonatal

- 
              
- Impaired gas exchange as defined by OI
              
              
- 
                  
- Recommended threshold OI > 40
                  
                  
- Consider transfer to ECMO center when OI > 25
                  
                

              
              
- E.g., pulmonary hypertension, meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, air leak syndrome, pneumonia.
