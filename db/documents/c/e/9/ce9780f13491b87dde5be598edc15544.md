The mantra for managing acute or chronic shoulder instability events should be to consult an orthopedic or primary care sports medicine specialist for further management when in doubt. While most shoulder instability injuries eventually require surgical fixation, there are certain situations in which nonoperative management can yield acceptable results. That said, the complexity of the overall assessment and management should include consultation with a surgical specialist with experience managing a wide range of complex instability patterns to provide the patient with the best chance for an ideal outcome.
