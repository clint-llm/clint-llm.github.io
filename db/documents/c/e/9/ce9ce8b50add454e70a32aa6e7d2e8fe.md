The management of corns is best performed with an interprofessional healthcare team. Patients may be treated by a primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant, dermatologist, or podiatrist. The key in all cases is to eliminate the continuous pressure on the foot. The treating provider should refer the patient to a surgical podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon to evaluate for underlying bony abnormalities in lesions that are recalcitrant to treatment or recurrent. Foot care nurses are often involved in the diagnosis and treatment of corns. They should educate the patient on proper foot care and follow-up to ensure resolution, also serving as a liaison point between the various clinical disciplines involved in caring for the patient. Pharmacists often recommend over-the-counterÂ products and should also inform the patients on the appropriate use of these agents, recommending further clinical intervention from a clinician in severe or recalcitrant cases.

While most corns are minor lesions and can be effectively treated with good resolution, an interprofessional approach is still necessary to preclude complications and to ensure the best possible patient outcomes, allowing a full return to regular activity when the lesions have impacted their activities of daily living or limited recreation or sports participation.
