With appropriate early diagnosis and treatment, many avulsion fracture injuries have satisfactory outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that regardless of which type of avulsion fracture a patient may sustain, the associated mechanism and additional injuries to surrounding soft tissues may lead to prolonged recovery or complications despite appropriate conservative or operative management of their injury.

In the setting of sports and exercise, it is extremely important to focus on pre-exercise warm-up activities and pre-season strengthening programs as much as possible as preventative mechanisms.

Chronic overuse can lead to significant symptoms of pain and weakness and produce swelling at soft tissue attachment sites to bone. This is due to repetitive microtrauma and avulsive forces, usually related to sports activities or repetitive actions that can be required in some occupations. This occasionally leads to inflammation, weakening, or fragmentation of the bone and can be a precursor or potential risk factor for an acute avulsion fracture in that area.
