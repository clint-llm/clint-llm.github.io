Various pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed for Takotsubo syndrome. While considerable progress has been made, several knowledge gaps still do exist. Improved understanding of Takotsubo syndrome will help optimize patient outcomes in the future.

The prognosis in Takotsubo syndrome is excellent, with nearly full recovery within 6-8 weeks. About 1 to 2% of patients experience recurrence. Mortality rates of 3 to 4% have been reported. Complications do occur in at least one-fourth of patients and include the following:

- Mitral regurgitation mild to moderate

- Left heart failure

- Cardiogenic shock

- Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which is dynamic

- Development of LV mural thrombus

- Ventricular arrhythmias

- Rupture of the ventricular wall

- Death
