Obesity is a chronic disease having a major public health concern. Obesity is a mild state of chronic inflammation of adipose tissue and a state of malnutrition by excess, which leads to a defective hormonal and immune system. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of obesity, inflammatory markers secreted by excessive fat deposition in adipose tissue, and their effects on chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe obesity as a mild state of chronic inflammation of adipose tissue.
- Explain the role of inflammatory markers released by adipose tissue in worsening chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. 
- Describe obesity in light of hormonal considerations and as an immune disease. 
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with obesity.
