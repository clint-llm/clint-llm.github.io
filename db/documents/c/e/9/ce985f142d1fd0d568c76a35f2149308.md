For dyslipidemia, obtaining a detailed family history is crucial. By identifying family members with any abnormal deposits of cholesterol in the skin or eyes, premature CHD, or those who have elevated cholesterol during childhood assist in establishing a diagnosis. Perform physical examination with attention to abnormal deposits of cholesterol in the skin or eyes, such as tendon xanthomata which mostly present in the Achilles tendons and dorsum of the hands, and xanthelasmas, which are soft and yellow plaques that often present on the eyelids. Fasting lipid profile revealed the majority of the abnormalities. However, an evaluation for causes resulted in secondary hyperlipidemia is warranted. The clinician can offer genetic testing of LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9 gene mutations, even though the benefits are still not well-established.
