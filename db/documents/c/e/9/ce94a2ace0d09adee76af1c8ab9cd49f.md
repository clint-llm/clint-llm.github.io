The differential diagnoses include:

- Central serous chorioretinopathy with fibrin

- There is the presence of serous pigment epithelial detachment and area of subretinal lucency at the location of the leak
- FFA features are typical and show leaks (ink-blot, smoke-stack or diffuse) and pigment epithelial detachment

- Adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (a variant of pattern dystrophy)

- The patients present at late-middle or old age with visual decline
- The lesion is smaller and may not pass through the typical stages of BVMD
- There may be a mutation of the BEST1 or PRPH2 (RDS) gene. Up to one-third of patients have abnormal EOG and the disease is dominantly inherited

- Subretinal granuloma due to choroidal tuberculosis/sarcoidosis

- There is clinical or angiographic evidence of inflammation

- Wet age-related macular degeneration

- Distinguishing features are old age and irregular lesion
- Disciform scar has a whitish appearance rather than the typical yellow, smooth appearance of BVMD

- Acute exudative vitelliform maculopathy

- Fundus flavimaculatus with large flecks

- Large dehemoglobinized subretinal hemorrhage

- Basal laminar drusen
