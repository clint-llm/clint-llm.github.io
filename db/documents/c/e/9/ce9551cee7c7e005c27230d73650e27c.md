A two-team approach is usually feasible during the harvest of ALT flaps, depending on the case. If used in lower extremity reconstruction, the primary surgeon can harvest the flap; simultaneously, the junior surgeon or colleague can prepare the recipient bed, including exposure of the vessels for microvascular anastomosis. This approach requires two scrub nurses and one circulating nurse to monitor flap 'off and on' times and tourniquet times, if a tourniquet is used. An anesthetist and an anesthesia technician are also required. Postoperatively, the patient will require monitoring of the flap for at least 5-7 days by ward nurses trained in free flap monitoring.
