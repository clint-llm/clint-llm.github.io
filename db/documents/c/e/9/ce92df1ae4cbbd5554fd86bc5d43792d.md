After a thorough history and physical, additional testing is available to rule out other etiologies. As TT syndrome is a rare finding, there is no definitive guideline to assess for this disorder, although an algorithm for diagnosis has been proposed. Audiometry is not typically used for diagnostic purposes but can potentially aid in masking treatment. Tympanometry will assess the pressure of the middle ear at a given moment, but if the TT is not contracting, it may not be observed by tympanometry. For this reason, long-term tympanometry can be used. A saw-tooth-like pattern representing tympanic membrane movement can be seen, which supports the diagnosis of TT syndrome. An impedance audiogram is also helpful while diagnosing TT syndrome by assessing the status of the middle ear. Imaging such as CT and/or MRI can also be helpful to rule out other potential causes of tinnitus.
