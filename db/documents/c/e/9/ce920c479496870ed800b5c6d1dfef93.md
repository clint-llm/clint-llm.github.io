Gastric ulcers are a break in the mucosa of the stomach lining that penetrates through the muscularis mucosa and extends more than 5 mm in diameter. When alterations occur to the defense mechanisms of the stomach, it can cause changes in the gastric mucosa which will eventually result in erosion and then ulceration. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of gastric ulcers and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of gastric ulcers.
- Describe the role of Helicobacter pylori and NSAIDs in the pathophysiology of gastric ulcers.
- Review the use of proton pump inhibitors in the treatment of gastric ulcers.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to recognize the alarm symptoms and improve outcomes for patients affected by gastric ulcers.
