Enuresis is considered a multifactorial entity with a strong genetic component that may be influenced by comorbidities and immaturity of the central nervous system bladder control mechanisms.

Once thought to play a causal role, psychological or psychiatric factors are now considered to be either a consequence of enuresis or comorbidity.

Other Conditions associated with nocturnal enuresis include:

- Constipation

- Urethral obstruction

- Ectopic ureter

- Cystitis

- Diabetes insipidus

- Disorders of sleep arousal

- Small bladder capacity

- Overactive bladder
