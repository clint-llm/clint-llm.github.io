**Manual Muscle Testing (MMT)**

MMT is used in the physical examination of patients to assess muscle strength. It may be used to evaluate weakness and can effectively differentiate true weakness from imbalance or poor endurance. The Oxford scale is the most widely and commonly accepted method of assessing muscle strength, as it does not require special equipment and demonstrates reliability among independent evaluators. The Oxford scale involves testing key muscles from the upper and lower extremities against an examiner's resistance and grading the patient's strength on a scale of 0 to 5, documented as x/5 (e.g., 1/5, 2/5 muscle strength).

- 0: no contraction

- 1: visible/palpable muscle contraction but no movement

- 2: movement with gravity eliminated

- 3: movement against gravity only

- 4: movement against gravity with some resistance

- 5: movement against gravity with full resistance

**Electromyography (EMG)**

EMG is the recording of electrical activity occurring within a muscle, with itsÂ primary use being that of distinguishing myopathic from neurogenic muscle wasting and weakness. EMGs can detect fasciculations or chronic denervation in muscles that appear clinically normal and differentiate focal nerve, plexus, or radicular pathology by determining the distribution of neurogenic abnormalities.

EMGs can provide supportive evidence of the pathophysiology of peripheral myopathy and is an obligatory investigation in motor neuron disease to demonstrate the widespread denervation and fasciculation required to secure a diagnosis. EMG recordings are made by inserting a needle electrode into the muscle. Typical EMG needles record a radius of approximately 1 mm where, within this volume, there can be 100 muscle fibers. Analyzing the waveforms and firing rates of single-motor or multiple-motor units can give the diagnostic information needed.
