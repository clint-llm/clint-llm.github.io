It is important to note that the cause of erectile dysfunction is often multifactorial. It is useful to distinguish early, whether the condition has an obvious underlying psychological cause or an organic etiology. Depression, performance anxiety, and other sexual disorders can be strong contributing factors even when organic causes also exist. Aging is an important factor contributing to erectile dysfunction. As patients age, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and other co-morbidities play an increasingly significant role in this condition. Diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome can affect several organ systems resulting in the accelerated deterioration of erectile function and can disrupt the mechanisms underpinning erections on a molecular level.

**Cardiovascular Disease and Erectile Dysfunction**

Cardiovascular disease is a very significant risk factor for erectile dysfunction. Almost 50% of men with known coronary artery disease proven by cardiac catheterization have significant erectile dysfunction.

These patients will often demonstrate subclinical atherosclerosis long before any overt ED by as much as ten years. The cavernosal arteries being of smaller diameter means that vasculogenic ED often precedes coronary artery disease, myocardial infarctions and strokes by up to five years.

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Database showed that having ED increased their cardiovascular risk roughly equivalent to the risk of smoking or having a family history of myocardial infarctions.

This means that erectile dysfunction has useful independent predictive value for future cardiovascular events and is why all patients with ED should be screened for cardiovascular risk.

Besides cardiovascular disease, there are strong correlations between ED, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypogonadism, obesity, smoking, alcoholism, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with lower urinary symptoms (LUTS), depression, and premature ejaculation.

- About 40% of men with ED will have hypertension while 35% of all hypertensive men will also have ED.

- Hyperlipidemia is found in about 42% of men with ED.

- Undiagnosed diabetes is up to three times as likely in men with erectile dysfunction (28%) compared to non-diabetic men with normal erections (10%).

- Among men over 50 years of age, diabetics are roughly twice as likely to have ED (46%) compared to non-diabetics (24%).

- The longer a patient has diabetes and the more severe, the greater the risk of ED.

- One-third of diabetic men will have hypogonadism which may partly explain the high correlation between diabetes and ED.

- Up to 35% of all men with ED will also have hypogonadism and about 6% will have abnormal thyroid function.

- Obesity is associated with a 50% increase in ED compared to men of normal weight.

- In smokers who quit, erectile quality improved 25% after one year.

- Heavy alcohol users also report an increased risk of ED compared to the general population.

- There is a strong correlation between BPH with LUTS and ED.  The majority of men with symptomatic BPH, up to 72%, will also have ED.

- Patients with depression are almost 40% more likely to have ED than normal men without depression. Conversely, the incidence of depression in men with ED is almost three times greater.

- Obesity and morbid obesity are significant risk factors for ED. Treatment of obesity with bariatric surgery has been shown to significantly improve sexual performance.

- At least 30% of patients with ED will also have premature ejaculation and possibly as many as 60%.

One-quarter of all cases of ED are thought to be due to prescription medications. Of the twelve most commonly prescribed medications in the US, eight list erectile dysfunction as a possible side effect.

Of the prostate cancer patients who undergo radical prostatectomy surgery, 85% can expect erectile dysfunction post-operatively compared to an ED rate of only 25% for men who received definitive radiation therapy.

The role of bicycle riding in ED is somewhat controversial. Traditional racing bicycle seats place considerable pressure directly on the perineal nerves as well as the pudendal and cavernosal arteries which suggests it could be a potential problem to serious cyclists.
