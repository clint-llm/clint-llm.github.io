The etiology of congenital diaphragmatic hernia remains unclear. It is thought to be multifactorial with genetic, environmental, and/or nutritional factors playing a role. CDH can be an isolated anomaly or associated with anomalies in other organ systems. Multiple chromosomal aberrations (deletions, aneuploidies, etc.) and single-gene mutations (GATA4, LRP2, etc.) are associated with CDH. The most frequent aneuploidies associated with CDH include trisomy 18, trisomy 13, trisomy 21, and less frequently Turner syndrome (45, X). Some ofÂ the syndromes associated with CDH include Pallister-Killian syndrome, 8p23.1 deletion syndrome, Fryns syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Exposure to teratogenic agents like mycophenolate mofetil, allopurinol, and lithium during pregnancy is reported to be associated with CDH.
