Obstruction of Eustachian tubes causing otitis media with effusion (OME) is the most common complication, but persistent nasal obstruction and obstruction of the oropharyngeal airway are also possible. Intracranial extension and involvement of cranial nerves are debilitating and can have a lifelong disability even after management, as the return of cranial nerve function is not always possible even after the malignancy has been treated. More than oneÂ cranial nerve deficit is a poor prognostic sign.
