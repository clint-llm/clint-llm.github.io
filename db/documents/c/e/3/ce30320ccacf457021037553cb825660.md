Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia can be difficult. It requires a combination of clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic data. The longer the length of intubation, the higher the likelihood of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is suspected in the setting of fever, change in auscultation exam, a change in the chest x-ray, and an increasing requirement for respiratory support. However, auscultation is hindered by sounds of the ventilation system itself, especially with high-frequency ventilation. Many neonates have chest x-ray findings that interfere with the early detection of new infiltrates.
