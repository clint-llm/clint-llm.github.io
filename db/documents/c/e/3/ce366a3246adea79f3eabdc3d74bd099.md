GT is classified into three types based on the function and expression (compared to non-GT platelets) of the alpha IIb beta 3 integrin. Less than 5% expression of the integrin corresponds to Type I GT, 5% to 20% expression corresponds to type II GT, and greater than 20% expression with dysfunction corresponds to variant-type GT. Variant-type GT is rare.
