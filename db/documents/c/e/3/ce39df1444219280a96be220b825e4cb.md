**Proposed mechanisms for the pathogenesis of seborrheic dermatitis include**

- Disruption of the skin’s microbiota

- An impaired immune reaction to Malassezia spp. associated with a diminished T-cell response and activation of complement

- The increased presence of unsaturated fatty acids on the skin surface

- Disruption of cutaneous neurotransmitters

- Abnormal shedding of keratinocytes

- Epidermal barrier disturbances associated with genetic factors

- The role of Malassezia spp. also includes the degradation of sebum and consumption of saturated fatty acids, disrupting the lipid balance on the skin surface. Further evidence for the involvement of Malassezia spp. includes their isolation from SD lesions and the significant resolution of SD with antifungal treatment.

However, there is insufficient evidence to link ISD with the development of ASD.
