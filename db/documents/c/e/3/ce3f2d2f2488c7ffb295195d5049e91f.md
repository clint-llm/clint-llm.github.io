Ophthalmologists should meticulously evaluate any case of trauma to the iris. The ophthalmologists should be aware of various non-surgical and surgical management options for iris repair. If an extensive iridodialysis repair is needed, the patient should be referred to a cataract or cornea surgeon well-versedÂ in complex anterior segment surgical repair. The assisting nurses have a crucial role in the surgical operation theater, counseling, and post-operative management of the patient. The pharmacist plays a vital role in arranging the required drugs. In case of associated retinal trauma, the retinal surgeon also plays a crucial role in managing retinal tear, detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, nucleus, or IOL drop. The interprofessional healthcare team approach helps achieve a perfect outcome in these cases.
