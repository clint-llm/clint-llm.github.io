It can be challenging to differentiate the incidence and prevalence of oral cavity cancers independently of oropharyngeal cancers as there is a huge variation in the categorization of these cancers. Many institutions will group data despite being distinct diseases, which can be confusing. According to the American Cancer Society's Global Cancer Facts and Figures 4th Edition Report in 2018, the global incidence is reported as approximately 2% of all cancers. In males in medium human development (HDI) index countries, lip and oral cavity cancer (together with lung cancer) are the most commonly diagnosed cancers.

Although oropharyngeal cancer incidence is increasing (particularly HPV positive cancers), the incidence of oral cavity cancers is, in fact, decreasing. Countries in Southern Asia, such as India and Sri Lanka, and the Pacific Islands, have the highest incidence of oral cavity and lip cancers worldwide.
