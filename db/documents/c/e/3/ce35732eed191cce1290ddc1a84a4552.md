The three mechanisms by which exocrine glands release their secretions include merocrine, apocrine, and holocrine.

- Merocrine glands are the most common subtype. By definition, merocrine gland secretions exit the cell via exocytosis. In this method of secretion, there is no cell damage. An example of merocrine secretion is the eccrine sweat gland.

- Apocrine glands, in contrast, form buds of the membrane which break off into the duct, losing part of the cellular membrane in the process. A well-known apocrine gland is the breastmilk-producing mammary gland.

- The final subtype of excretion is holocrine, in which the cellular membrane ruptures to release its product into the duct. Sebaceous glands are a representation of holocrine secretion.
