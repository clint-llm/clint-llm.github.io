Ochronosis is named for the reddish-brown hue of tissue termed "ochre-like" that was first described by a young physician named Archibald Garrod in the early-19th century. In what he called an "inborn error of metabolism," Archibald Garrod changed history when he coined that term for the obscure "black urine" disease, alkaptonuria. This activity reviews the two types of ochronosis, a permanent discoloration caused by the deposition of phenols into connective tissue, and highlights the management of the interprofessional team in treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ochronosis.
- Review the processes for the evaluation of patients with ochronosis.
- Outline the management options available for ochronosis.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to manage ochronosis and improve outcomes.
