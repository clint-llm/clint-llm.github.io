Dextromethorphan is contraindicated for patients with known or established hypersensitivity and those with an idiosyncratic reaction upon administration of the drug.

It is not recommended to coadminister dextromethorphan withÂ monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or for two weeks after stopping the MAOI drugs.

Since DM comes in combination with different medicines, consider contraindications of each ingredient for safe prescribing of combination products.
