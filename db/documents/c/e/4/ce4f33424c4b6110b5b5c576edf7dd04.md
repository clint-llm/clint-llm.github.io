Like Alzheimer disease, LBD presents with acetylcholine deficiency, but it is more pronounced in LBD. Decreased levels of acetylcholine in temporal and parietal cortex result in visual hallucinations (a prominent feature of LBD), while up-regulation of muscarinic M1 receptors in the temporal lobe resultsÂ in delusions. Dopamine levels also diminish.

Postmortem examinations have revealed that LBD affects the substantia nigra, dorsal raphe, locus ceruleus, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The key feature of LBD is the presence of alpha-synuclein, a presynaptic protein whose function remains debatable. Other findings include the presence of ubiquitin and neurofilament proteins. Unlike Parkinson's disease, the reduction in acetylcholine is much more severe in LBD.

Using SPECT scans patients with LBD may develop visual hallucinations (due to hypoperfusion of the occipital and parietal cortex), delusions (due to hyperperfusion of the frontal cortex), and misidentification (related to hypoperfusion of the limbic/paralimbic pathways.
