Troponin exists in three distinct molecular forms, corresponding to specific isotypes found in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, slow-twitch skeletal muscle, and heart tissue.

In the myocyte, troponins are found as structural (bound) proteins and as a small free pool that exists in the cytosol, which is about 6% to 8% for cTnT and 3.5% for cTnI.

Before troponin, several different cardiac biomarkers were used to identify myocardial injury.

Troponin measurements were found to have a near 100% sensitivity when checked 6 to 12 hours after the start of chest pain and have a significantly improved specificity for cardiac muscle damage compared to previous biomarkers.
