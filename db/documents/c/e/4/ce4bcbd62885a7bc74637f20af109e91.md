Experienced institutions have excellent outcomes following the BDG, with operative survival over 96%.

Jaquiss et alÂ reported on an earlier BDG in 85 patients with HLHS. Patients were divided into surgical intervention at 4 months (33 patients) and greater than 4 months (52 patients) and compared for preoperative and postoperative variables. Six-year survival and functional assessment were not different between the two groups, although the group of younger patients exhibit more profound hypoxemia and required longer hospitalization. Ultimately, the younger group exhibited a similar outcome following Fontan completion. Carlo et al investigated 92 patients 30 days following BDG repair; 8 of these patients died and 3 required a cardiac transplant.
