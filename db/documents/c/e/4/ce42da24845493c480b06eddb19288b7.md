A urinalysis and urine culture should be routinely performed. A semen culture should be obtained in selected patients. Testosterone and B-12 levels are often deficient in many patients (76%) with chronic orchialgia. Some pain relief has been reported when restorative therapies have been utilized.

The primary imaging study and principle diagnostic aid for chronic orchialgia is scrotal ultrasonography.

In some cases, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan should be considered due to the possibility of ureteral calculi, aneurysms or inguinal hernias causing or contributing to the pain. Spinal MRI is not routinely recommended except in selected cases of patients with simultaneous back or hip pain. Cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrography, retrograde and intravenous pyelography are generally not helpful and are not recommended.

Evaluation of chronic orchialgia can be challenging and lead patients to see multiple physicians. The average patient has been reported to undergo an average of 4.7 to 7.2 diagnostic studies and 1.6 operative procedures.
