In most cases, allergic onjunctivitis does not present a serious health threat.

Complications of allergic conjunctivitis are rare, but when they do occur, they can be serious and include:

- Severe cases can result in scarring of the eye.

- If allergic conjunctivitis progresses to infective conjunctivitis, the infection can spread to other areas of the body, potentially causing serious secondary infections.
