Atropine can be administered by intravenous (IV), subcutaneous, intramuscular, or endotracheal (ET) methods; IV is preferred. For ET administration, dilute 1 mg to 2 mg in 10 mL of sterile water or normal saline before administration. For pediatric ET, double the usual IV dose and dilute in 3 to 5 mL.

- Antisialagogue/anti-vagal: 0.5 mg to 1 mg every 1 to 2 hours

- Organophosphate or muscarinic poisoning: 2 mg to 3 mg every 20 to 30 minutes (may require doses up to 20 mg, titrate to effectÂ for secretion control)

- Bradycardia: 1 mg every 3 to 5 minutes (3 mg max), repeat until obtaining desired heart rate, most effective for sinus and AV nodal disease.

- Pediatric: 0.01 mg/kg to 0.03 mg/kg every 3 to 5 minutes. Pediatric minimum dose 0.1 mg, maximum dose 0.5 mg (child) and 1.0 mg (adolescent); maximum cumulative dose 1 mg (child) and 2 mg (adolescent).

- Rapid Sequence Intubation Pretreatment: 0.01 mg/kg IV for adults with bradycardia secondary to repeat dosing of succinylcholine. Pediatric 0.02 mg/kg IV, minimum dose 0.1 mg. Not recommended as a routine treatment.

In general, the dosing of atropine is repeatable every 5 minutes until reaching a maximum of 0.04 mg/kg.

Dosing in adults to greater than 0.5 mg and slow IV pushes correlate with paradoxical bradycardia (though likely transient) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).
