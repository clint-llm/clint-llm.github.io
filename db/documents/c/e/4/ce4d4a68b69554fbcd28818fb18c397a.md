There are three ways to provide adequate medical language interpretation during patient evaluation.

- The first is to provide an on-site, live well trained medical interpreter. This is expensive and limits the variety of languages provided.

- The second is the use of trained ad hoc hospital personnel, including nurses, technicians, or other hospital employees who have been specifically trained to be medical interpreters in a language they speak fluently.

- The last option is using a language line or video interpretation that provides many languages but is expensive. Large hospitals equipped with on-site interpreters often utilize off-site interpreters for languages in which they are not themselves proficient.

Bilingual hospital employees are a valuable resource for providing one-on-one medical interpretation. However, it has been proven that one out of every five hospital employee interpreters has inadequate language skills. When feasible, these employees should be tested for their language ability before acting as an interpreter. One validated assessment companies may consider is the Clinical Cultural and Linguistic Assessment that is administered via telephone. Some large organizations increase remuneration for employees who are trained and have passed proficiency examinations to expand the number of medical interpreters available.

Video interpretation ensues with a tablet or computer mounted on a mobile stand. The device is connected to a wireless internet network, and companies who provide video interpretation services may then connect to their interpreters. Video interpretation has been shown to improve use and communication over telephone-only interpretation.
