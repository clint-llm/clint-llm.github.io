Regularly, there is a minimal level of variation in the compartmentalization and organization of the thoracic mediastinum between individuals. The structures held within the thoracic mediastinal compartments are highly subject to variability, though. Below are some physiologic variants that can affect and/or be seen in structures within the thoracic mediastinal compartments.

Superior Mediastinum

- Absent brachiocephalic trunk (right common carotid and subclavian arteries branch directly from aortic arch)

- Patent ductus arteriosus

- Tracheoesophageal fistula

Anterior Mediastinum

- Pectus excavatum

- Thymic aplasia

- Thymic cyst

Middle Mediastinum

- Dextrocardia

- Heart side dominance (based on which coronary artery gives rise to the posterior interventricular branch)

- Patent foramen ovale

- Tetralogy of Fallot

- Ventricular septal defects

Posterior Mediastinum

- Bronchogenic cysts

- Esophageal atresia

- Esophageal stenosis
