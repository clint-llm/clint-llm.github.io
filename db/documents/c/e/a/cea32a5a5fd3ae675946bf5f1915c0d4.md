The primary treatment modalities for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) include surgical resection, endovascular embolization, stereotactic radiosurgery (considered for small lesions < 3 cm), or a combination of the above.

For unruptured brain AVMs, the ARUBA trial compared medical management alone to medical management along with prophylactic intervention (surgical, endovascular, radiosurgical, or a combination). Out of a total of 223 patients with a mean follow-up of 33.3 months, the primary endpoint of death from any cause or stroke occurred in 11 of 109 (10.1%) patients in the medical group compared with 35 of 114 (30.7%) in the interventional group. These data led to the discontinuation of the study after six years.

In any case, for patients diagnosed with AVMs of the central nervous system (CNS), prompt neurosurgical consultation, and subsequent discussion of treatment options with the patient and family are essential components of the treatment decision-making process.
