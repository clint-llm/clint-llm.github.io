As discussed above, 80% of adult fibrosarcomas were determined to be high-grade (Grades 2 or 3). Furthermore, 25% of the remaining low-grade lesions progressed to a local recurrence of high-grade sarcoma. These tumors were aggressive with many local recurrences as well as lymph and parenchymal metastases. The survival of adult fibrosarcomas is < 70% at two years, and < 55% at five years.
