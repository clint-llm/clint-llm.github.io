Correct diagnosis is paramount. History of a precipitating event, repetitive strain, or previous lumbar surgery should be ascertained. Three or more provocative tests should identify the sacroiliac joint as the source of pain. Physical therapy using a stretching/stabilization exercise program is the first line of treatment. Correct any anatomical leg length discrepancy with adjustments to footwear. Pelvic stabilization belts can be useful in pregnancy-induced sacroiliac joint dysfunction. If non-interventional techniques fail to provide benefit, attempt an image-guided injection of a local anesthetic with or without steroid. Injections can be either intraarticular, extra-articular, or combined. The injection should provide pain relief, and provocative tests should become negative following injection. Treat any persistent pain with radiofrequency denervation. The majority of patients can achieve adequate pain relief with these techniques. In recalcitrant cases, minimally invasive trans sacroiliac fusion surgery is an option.
