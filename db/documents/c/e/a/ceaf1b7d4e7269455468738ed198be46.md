The complications related to localized neurofibromas are mild and typically related to surgical excision of the lesion: pain, bleeding, scarring, and local infection. In plexiform lesions, complications arise from the inherent risks of surgery, and in rare cases, the inability to surgically remove the entire lesion. In patients with NF1 and persistent lesions, there is an increased risk of malignant transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
