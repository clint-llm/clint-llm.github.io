Classification of traumatic aortic injury contains a grading system based on the extent of anatomic aortic wall damage. Imaging allows practitioners to classify a patient’s injury into four distinct grades. These are critical as they affect patient management and treatment strategies. Grade 1: Tear of intima only, Grade 2: Formation of an intramural hematoma within the vessel wall, Grade 3: Pseudoaneurysm formation, Grade 4: Complete wall rupture.
