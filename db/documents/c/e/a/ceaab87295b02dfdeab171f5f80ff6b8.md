# Continuing Education Activity

A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of dermoid cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of dermoid cysts.
- Summarize the treatment of dermoid cysts.
- Outline the differential diagnosis of dermoid cysts.
- Review the workup of dermoid cysts and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.

# Introduction

A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that arises from the entrapment of ectodermal elements along the lines of embryonic closure.

# Etiology

The etiology of dermoid cysts remains mostly unknown. The cause of this congenital developmental anomaly has yet to be determined.

# Epidemiology

Dermoid cysts are among the most common pediatric skull tumors.

# Pathophysiology

Dermoid cysts result from an abnormal alteration in fetal development.

# Histopathology

Dermoid cyst on histology shows a well-defined wall lined by stratified squamous epithelium and a lumen that may be filled with mature adnexal structures of mesodermal origin, such as hair follicles and shafts, sebaceous and eccrine glands.

# History and Physical

In the majority of cases, dermoid cysts occur in the head and neck region, although they may be found anywhere on the body.

A lower lid dermoid cyst may be evident as a painless, gradually enlarging swelling of the lower lid.

Dermoid cysts usually occur as solitary lesions; however, multiple concurrent dermoid cysts have also been reported.

Hair protruding from a dermoid cyst punctum is pathognomic for dermoid cysts.

# Evaluation

Dermoid cysts have the potential to grow over time and extend intracranially or intraspinally.

Midline dermoid cysts have the highest association with cranial or spinal dysraphism or have an intracranial extension.

Dermoid cysts under an ultrasound will show a well-defined homogenous and hypoechoic cystic lesion.

# Treatment / Management

Dermoid cysts usually tend to grow slowly, further having the potential to cause bony deformities, intracranial extension, or intraspinal extension.

Early resection may also avoid extensive surgery and a shorter skin incision, further resulting in an improved cosmetic outcome.

If the cyst wall has adhered to vital structures, a partial excision may be performed.

# Differential Diagnosis

Dermoid cysts are rare, but all nodular cystlike lesions are included in the differential diagnoses of a patient presenting with a subcutaneous nodule, especially in the head and neck or midline region.

- Epidermoid cyst

- Glioma

- Encephalocele

- Juvenile xanthogranuloma

- Lipoma

- Pilar cysts

- Meningioma

- Neurofibroma

- Teratoma

- Rhabdomyosarcoma

- Olfactory neuroblastoma

- Lymphoma

- Subcutaneous abscess

- Facial trauma

- Trichilemmal cyst

- Pilomatrixoma

- Lymphatic malformation

- Thyroglossal duct cyst

# Prognosis

The overall prognosis for patients with a dermoid cyst is good, especially when there is no intracranial or intraspinal extension.

# Complications

There are no complications for dermoid cysts that don't have an intracranial or intraspinal extension.

Other possible complications include bony erosions, eyelid displacement, and intracranial extension.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

A dermoid cyst is a benign cutaneous developmental anomaly that usually presents in the head and neck regions in pediatric patients.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to diagnosing and treating dermoid cysts can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Health care staff of primary care and emergency departments play a vital role in diagnosing and referring patients with head and neck subcutaneous nodules to dermatology or head and neck surgery. This will aid in better patient satisfaction, quality of life, proper care, and decrease the chance of complications.

Collaboration shared decision making and communication are crucial elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of dermoid cysts are identified; the better is the patient outcome, satisfaction, and prognosis.
