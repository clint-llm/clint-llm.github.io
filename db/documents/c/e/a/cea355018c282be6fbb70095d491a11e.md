**Indications for Angiography Based on Systems**

Neuroangiography

- Extracranial disease indications include cavernous-carotid fistula, extracranial carotid stenosis, epistaxis, and subclavian steal syndrome.

- Intracranial disease indications are subarachnoid hemorrhage without a history of trauma, cerebral arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms, cerebral vasospasm, acute stroke, and WADA test.

Cardiovascular

- Thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm and dissection

- Diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease

- Coronary artery aneurysms

- Peripheral vascular disease including intermittent claudication and limb-threatening ischemia

- Vascular malformations

Pulmonary

- Pulmonary hemorrhage

Gastrointestinal system

- Mesenteric ischemia

- Arterial embolization in critical gastrointestinal bleeding

Renal

- Renovascular hypertension

- Dialysis fistula mapping and maintenance angioplasty

Reproductive system

- Embolization of varicoceles

- Embolization of ovarian veins in patients with pelvic congestion syndrome

- Fibroids embolization

Oncology

- Transarterial cancer therapy (e.g., chemotherapy and radiofrequency ablation)

- Hepatoma

- Colorectal liver metastases

- Carcinoid tumors

- Renal cell carcinoma

Trauma

- Torn extremity arteryIntractable internal bleeding from visceral injury and pelvic trauma
