Preparing a urethral tissue sample for histologic observation is similar to the preparation of any other tissue. The tissue is first fixed with a solution to preserve the sample. Next, the tissue is processed, which generally includes dehydrating and embedding in a wax mold. Lastly, the wax mold gets sliced into thin sections, and the tissue sample is washed and transferred to a slide. At this point, the tissue sample has been harvested and processed, but still needs to undergo a staining process. Different stains reveal structural components in different colors and intensities, and therefore, the stain used is dependant upon the type of tissue and the structural elements sought.
