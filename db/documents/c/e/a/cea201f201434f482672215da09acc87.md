Treatment of angioneurotic edema should be started as early as possible. Some of the HANE patients need airway intervention like intubation. HANE and AANE are bradykinin-mediated angioedema. They are often resistant to antihistamine, corticosteroids, and epinephrine which are useful drug treatments of histaminergic angioedema.

Icatibant is an effective home-based, on-demand treatment.

Acute attacks can be treated with icatibant and C1 inhibitor concentrate (plasma-derived), and prophylaxis is with rituximab with or without chemotherapy and splenectomy.

In pregnancy, the recommended therapy is plasma-derived nano-filtered C1-inhibitor; however, in acute episodes, bradykinin receptor antagonist (icatibant) can be used as it is safe with no maternal and fetal adverse effects.

In the pediatric population, the doses include 500 units (10-25 kg weighed patients), 1000 units, and 1500 units in patients weighing more than 25kg.
