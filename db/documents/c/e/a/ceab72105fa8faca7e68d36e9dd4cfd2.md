As with any other procedure, patient-centered optimal care is critical for the success of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. This approach starts with the Heart Team's appropriate patient selection for the procedure with a careful and comprehensive discussion between the cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and the patient.Â All minimally invasive non-sternotomy mitral valve surgical approaches require femoral arterial and venous cannulation. Careful evaluation and exclusion of atheromatous peripheral vascular disease are required, and patients with severe peripheral vascular disease are excluded. Careful post-procedural follow-up with repeat imaging to assess improvement in MR, clinical status follow-up, rehabilitation therapies.
