The repetitive episodes of flow limitation usually result in arousals due to increased respiratory effort leading to sleep fragmentation. Sleep fragmentation then results in excessive daytime sleepiness for patients suffering from UARS.

A retrospective study from Peru comparing patients (n=93) with UARS (defined as apnea-hypopnea index < 5 events/hour, oxygen saturation ≥ 92%, respiratory effort–related arousal index ≥ 5/h) to individuals with OSA (AHI >5/h) (n= 795) and the general public (n=641) found that those with UARS have a poor quality of life (low total HRQoL score) similar to those with OSA but much lower than the general public.

UARS patient's main characteristic of esophagic pressure (Pes) negativity can cause a diastolic leftward shift of the interventricular heart septum with pulsus paradoxus simultaneously occurring when peak end-inspiratory esophageal pressure reported exceeding more negative than -35 cm H2O.
