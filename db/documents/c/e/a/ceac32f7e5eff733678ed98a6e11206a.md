Some of the close differentials are sideroblastic anemia, iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). Others include hemoglobinopathies. Sideroblastic anemia is easily differentiated by ring sideroblasts due to iron deposition and increased erythrocyte protoporphyrin level. Iron-deficiency anemia is ruled out by conducting iron studies (e.g., serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)), serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are low in iron deficiency. Additionally, RBCs are more likely hypochromic and less microcytic in IDA as compared to thalassemia. HPLC or Hb electrophoresis is used to differentiate other hemoglobinopathies from beta-thalassemia.
