- The prognosis of patients with dextrocardia depends on the presence or absence of other accompanying congenital defects and the type of congenital anomalies.

- As mentioned before, patients with isolated dextrocardia have a normal lifespan without any complications.

- Newborns with dextrocardia and asplenia are easily susceptible to bacterial infections (especially infections from encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Meningococcus) and life-threatening bacteremia. These patients might need to be on antibiotic prophylaxis.
