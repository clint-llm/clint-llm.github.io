The abdominal trunk is an area of special interest to plastic surgeons as it presents a large area of opportunity for body contouring. The trunk is a gross description of the area between the inferior aspect of the breasts and the beginning of the pelvis. The abdominoplasty, commonly referred to as a "tummy tuck," is a procedure to reduce the excess skin and fat around the abdomen and strengthen the abdominal wall musculature. The goal of this procedure is to develop an aesthetically pleasing abdomen, and can incorporate direct excisional techniques as well as liposuction. With the rise in bariatric surgery, the abdominoplasty has become a significant resource to help these patients with an excess abdominal tissue after their weight loss.
