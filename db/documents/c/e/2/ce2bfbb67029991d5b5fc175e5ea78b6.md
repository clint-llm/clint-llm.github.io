Phenelzine is a potent, non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) used in treating depression and as an anxiolytic in adults.

It has no FDA-approved use in pediatric patients less than or equal to 16 years of age but has been investigated for use in selective mutism in pediatric patients; however, the data for this indication remains equivocal.

Non-selective MAOIs have largely fallen out of favor and been superseded by more recently developed antidepressant medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); this is largely the result of the prominent drug and food interactions of these agents. Clinically, they are often relegated to second-line treatment for recalcitrant cases that are resistive to first-line therapeutic options.

Some authors have recently supported increased consideration of MAOI use, despite the typical concerns regarding the need for divided dosing, dietary concerns/limitations, and drug-drug interactions.
