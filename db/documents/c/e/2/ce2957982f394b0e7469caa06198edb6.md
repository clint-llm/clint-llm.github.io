Oxygen-derived free radicals have been proposed as being the probable etiological cause in the development of oxygen toxicity. Free radicals are generated due to the mitochondrial oxidoreductive processes and also induced by the function of enzymes such as xanthine/urate oxidase at extra-mitochondrial sites, from auto-oxidative reactions, and by phagocytes during the bacterial killing. These free radicals create lipid peroxidations, especially in the cell membranes, subdue nucleic acids and protein synthesis, and mollify cellular enzymes. Continued exposure to high concentrations of oxygen results in heightened free radical production.  This may damage the pulmonary epithelium, inactivate the surfactant, form intra-alveolar edema, interstitial thickening, fibrosis, and ultimately lead to pulmonary atelectasis.
