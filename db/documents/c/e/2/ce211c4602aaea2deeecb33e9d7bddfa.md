Contrast toxicity presents in a myriad of ways, with each manifestation often having several underlying mechanisms of action.

Much like its epidemiology, the pathophysiology of CIN remains incompletely understood. Many mechanisms of kidney injury have been postulated to be the source of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following contrast exposure. Among these, the most well-accepted explanation is a combination of direct cytotoxicity on kidney tubule cells and induced renal vasoconstriction. Contrast media has also been shown to diminish glomerular filtration rate by altering the viscosity of the tubular fluid, inhibit tubuloglomerular feedback by causing diuresis, and damage nephron membranes via increased production of reactive oxygen species.

The mechanism by which high-osmolar iodinated agents compromise cardiac function and hemodynamic status is thought to be more singular than the effects of CIN. Specifically, the high-osmolar content of contrast results in water being pulled from the interstitium and expanding the blood volume, leading to right heart overload and diminished cardiac functions.

The reaction to contrast is an anaphylactoid reaction, not an anaphylactic reaction. Allergic-like reactions to contrast agents are assumed to be mediated through the direct release of histamine and other mediators from basophils and eosinophils. The reaction is not associated with the involvement of IgE.
