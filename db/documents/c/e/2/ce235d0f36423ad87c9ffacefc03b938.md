A coronary angiogram is a minimally invasive procedure and can be associated with severe complications. The heart team approach is essential to perform coronary angiograms effectively with minimal complications. The heart team approach consists of an interventional/invasive cardiologist, general cardiologist, cath lab nurse, cath lab technician, cardiothoracic surgeon, primary care physician, or referral physician. Close-loop communication between the heart team members can minimize unwanted complications. Meticulous patient selection is essential for coronary angiograms in stable angina patients. Always review the patient's allergies, home medications, renal function tests, hemoglobin and hematocrit,  platelets, and PT INR before the procedure to avoid common complications.   IV hydration prevents contrast-induced nephropathy. It is vital to watch for pressure tracing and rhythm strips before injecting contrast into the coronary artery ostium. Effective team communication is the key to better cath lab procedure outcomes.
