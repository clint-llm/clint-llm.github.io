Preparation of the tetanus toxoid is via inactivation of the toxigenic strains of Clostridium tetani. The toxic strains are grown in liquid media, purified, then treated with formaldehyde to take away the pathogenic properties. Following purification and sterilization, tetanus toxoid is combined with aluminum or calcium salts. This toxoid antigen is then usually used in combination with Diptheria and pertussis antigens in a vaccination form.

The DTaP vaccine is a 0.5 mL dose, and it is given intramuscularly. For patients who are infants to two years old, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the preferred injection site.  For children aged three and older, the deltoid muscle is the preferred injection site.

- First dose: 2 months old, must be at least six weeks old

- Second dose: 4 months old

- Third dose: 6 months old

- Fourth dose: 15 months to 18 months old, must be at least 12 months old, given at a minimum of six months after the third dose

- Fith dose: 4 years to 6 years old, must be at least four years old, given at a minimum of six months after the fourth dose

As most DTaP vaccinations contain higher levels of diphtheria compared to tetanus and pertussis, Tdap has higher levels of tetanus than diphtheria and pertussis. The Tdap vaccine is a 0.5 mL dose, and it is also given as an intramuscular injection. This vaccine should only be used as a booster every ten years, starting at ages eleven to twelve.
