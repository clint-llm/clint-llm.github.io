Anhydrous ammonia, in liquid or gaseous form, reacts readily with water in the human tissue to form ammonium ions. This process is highly exothermic and causes significant thermal injury to the surrounding tissues. Also, the resultant alkaline solution causes liquefaction necrosis to the tissues through protein denaturation and saponification of fats.
