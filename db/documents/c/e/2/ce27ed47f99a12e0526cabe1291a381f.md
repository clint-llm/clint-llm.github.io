The inherent function of CA 125 membrane protein is still not completely clear. The latest studies suspect that the oligosaccharides associated with CA 125 might play a role in cell-mediated immunity.

In the case of ovaries, it appears that CA 125 expresses when the ovarian epithelium undergoes metaplasia into a Mullerian-type endothelium or a neoplastic transformation.
