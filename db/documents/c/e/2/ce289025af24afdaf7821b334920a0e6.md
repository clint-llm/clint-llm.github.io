The causes of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can be divided based on the intracerebral components causing elevated pressures:

Increase in brain volume

Generalized swelling of the brain or cerebral edema from a variety of causes such as trauma, ischemia, hyperammonemia, uremic encephalopathy, and hyponatremia

**Mass Effect**

- Hematoma

- Tumor

- Abscess

- Infarct

**Increase in Cerebrospinal Fluid**

- Increased production of CSF

- Choroid plexus tumor

**Decreased Reabsorption of CSF**

- Obstructive hydrocephalus

- Meningeal inflammation or granulomas

**Increase in Blood Volume**

- Increased cerebral blood flow during hypercarbia, aneurysms

- Venous stasis from

- Venous sinus thromboses,

- Elevated central venous pressures, e.g., heart failure

**Other Causes**

- Idiopathic or benign intracranial hypertension

- Skull deformities such as craniosynostosis

- Hypervitaminosis A, tetracycline use
