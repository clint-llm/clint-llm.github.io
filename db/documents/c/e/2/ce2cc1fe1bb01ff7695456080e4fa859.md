Low back pain is commonly encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary caregiver, emergency department physician,Â and internist. Isthmic spondylolisthesis is also a common cause of back pain and the diagnosis is confirmed by the radiologist. The initial management of the condition is with conservative measures but when patients fail to respond, a referral to an orthopedic surgeon is recommended. Surgical treatment options consist of decompression of the neural elements alone versus decompression with internal fixation for bony fusion to prevent further subluxation

Unfortunately, many patients continue to have a recurrence of pain because no treatment works consistently or reliably. Surgery only benefits a few patients and is associated with serious complications. Thus the primary care provider should emphasize lifestyle changes, regular exercise, discontinuation of tobacco and a healthy body weight.
