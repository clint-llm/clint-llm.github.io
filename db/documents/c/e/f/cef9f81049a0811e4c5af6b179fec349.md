The pathophysiology of inner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) remains incompletely understood. As described above, the general causes of IEDCS are similar to those that cause DCS in other organ systems, but the presumed mechanism is the precipitation of gases into the endolymphatic system rather than into joint spaces or the more general circulation. Primary factors include inadequate decompression, deep-diving requiring decompression stops, and inadequate surface time to re-equilibrate nitrogen. Immersion, exercise, and warm temperatures are important factors that can increase the risk of developing DCS by increasing inert gas uptake while under pressure. In contrast, these same factors increase inert gas elimination during decompression, reducing the risk.

In addition to these factors, reports also suggest an association of IEDCS with persistent foramen ovale (PFO), a type of right to left shunt (RLS). An RLS allows blood to bypass the pulmonary system. In other words, gas bubbles forming in the venous circulation can enter arterial circulation instead of being eliminated by the lungs, more properly defining it as an arterial gas embolism (AGE).
