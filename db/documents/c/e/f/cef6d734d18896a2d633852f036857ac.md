Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in sarcomere protein genes which effect contraction of the heart. HCM causes alterations of heart structure that affect function. An increase in left ventricular wall thickness (hypertrophy) causes left ventricular outflow obstruction, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and mitral regurgitation. This can lead to fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, and syncope. Sudden cardiac death represents the most severe and devastating presentation of HCM, and is usually seen in young athletes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
- Explain the recommended management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
