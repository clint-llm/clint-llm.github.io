The defective preservation of telomeres causes dyskeratosis congenita.DKC1, encodes for dyskerin protein and is inherited in an x-linked recessive fashion. Dyskerin is directly involved in stabilizing an enzyme called telomerase that is responsible for catalyzing a reaction that sustains the length of telomeres.TINF2, TERC, TERT, C16orf57, NOLA2, NOLA3, WRAP53/TCAB1, and RTEL1 are mutated in DKC.
