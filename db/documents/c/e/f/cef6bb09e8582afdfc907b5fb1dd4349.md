Certain conditions may put patients at an increased risk of complications from therapeutic hypothermia. In such cases, targeted temperature management may still be used to achieve normothermia. Absolute contraindications to therapeutic hypothermia include hemorrhagic stroke, GCS > 8, uncontrolled bleeding, uncontrolled hemodynamically unstable rhythms, and cardiac arrest due to trauma. Relative contraindications to therapeutic hypothermia include thrombocytopenia (<50 K), coagulopathy, prolonged cardiac arrest (> 60 minutes), and refractory hypotension despite fluid and vasopressor support.
