Prognosis and treatment of secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy are understandably related to the primary etiology. Treatment strategy can be broadly classified as follows:

- **Treatment of Primary Etiology******Definitive treatment is targeted at curing the underlying cause, including surgical resection, definitive chemotherapy or radiofrequency ablation for primary lung malignancy, antimicrobial therapy as in pulmonary tuberculosis, or lung transplantation in cystic fibrosis. Beyond pulmonary etiology, treatment of liver disease with liver graft or orthoptic liver transplantation is well reported. Haux et al. reported the first successful treatment of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in cholestatic cirrhosis with copper overload with liver graft. Surgical correction of cyanotic heart disease has been reported as early as 1982 by Frand et al. There are also reports of total esophagectomy achieving cure of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in association with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma or leiomyoma. Unilateral hypertrophic osteoarthropathy from the infected vascular graft is treated with surgical removal of prosthetic graft coupled with systemic antibiotic therapy. However, the overall survival is only 58%.

- **Symptom Suppression**It is somewhat more challenging to treat hypertrophic osteoarthropathy when the primary etiology cannot be cured or treated. Considering the advanced stage of the underlying disease, the extent of symptoms in this subset of patients is also severe.

**Unilateral Vagotomy**

Geoffrey Flavell reported ipsilateral vagus nerve dissection resulting in symptom relief in HPOA in inoperable primary lung malignancy cases in the 1950s. It was later reconfirmed by Yacoub et al. in 1962. It was never universally adopted and lost favor subsequently, as the humoral theory of pathogenesis gained prominence. Less invasive targets for symptom control, therefore, appeared justified. However, the approach was revisited in 2006 by Ooi et al. in a patient with inoperable lung malignancy where HOA symptom control was successfully achieved by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) assisted truncal vagotomy.

**Adrenergic Blockade**

A combination regimen of adrenergic antagonists with propranolol and phenoxybenzamine was reported to achieve symptom suppression in hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with small cell carcinoma lung, as reported by Readon et al. in 1976. The treatment response was objectively measured by improvement in the thermographic index as well as the functional ability, including ring size and grip strength.

**Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**

Letts et al. published a case series of five infants with arthritis and periostitis following PGE2 infusion for patent ductus arteriosus. That aligned with subsequent reports of a robust response of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy symptoms to NSAIDs like indomethacin and ketorolac and COX-2 inhibitors like celecoxib. In contrast, opioid analgesics were not nearly as effective. A PGE2-induced mechanism of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy was suggested, as rofecoxib suppressed cyclooxygenase 2, an inducer of the prostaglandin E2 pathway.

**Octreotide**

Johnson et al. first reported successful hypertrophic osteoarthropathy treatment with 200 mcg of octreotide daily in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma lung. Angel Moreno Maroto et al. also reported pain relief with octreotide in a patient with cyanotic heart disease from Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary artery atresia. Apart from the inhibition of endothelial proliferation through VEGF, octreotide also has a well-demonstrated role in inhibiting nociceptive neurons.

**Bisphosphonates**

There have been several case reports of intravenous pamidronate and zoledronic acid achieving symptomatic relief of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in bronchogenic carcinoma, as well as in metastatic breast carcinoma and cyanotic congenital heart disease. Therapeutic response was noted in terms of symptom suppression and the radiographic resolution of periostitis in the bone scan. The mechanism of action of the bisphosphonates traces them to a proven inhibition of circulating VEGF levels in plasma.

**Specific Inhibitors**

VEGF circulating levels and tissue expression are enhanced in almost all hypertrophic osteoarthropathy cases, irrespective of the primary etiology. Therefore, it is only rational that specific inhibitors of VEGF should inhibit the final common pathway and achieve symptom suppression. Therapeutic trials of combining bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapy regimens in non-small cell lung cancer are underway. Similarly, isolated case reports from Japan suggest reducing periostitis in advanced lung malignancy with erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
