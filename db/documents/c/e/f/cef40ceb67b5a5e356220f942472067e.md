It is suggested to use the following strategies to prevent any opioid prescription diversion:

- In patients who tend to overuse medications, it is often prudent to dispense smaller quantities of medication and see patients more frequently

- Pill counts is another strategy to promote adherence to the prescribed medication regimen

- Ordering random urine toxicology and having a written contract to clarify the conditions under which opioids will be discontinued

- Prescription Monitoring Programs. The physician can use this program to decrease diversion by determining when a patient is receiving a prescription from multiple providers.
