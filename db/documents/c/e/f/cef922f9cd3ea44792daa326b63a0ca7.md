Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary malignant bone tumor, mostly affecting adolescents in the second decade of their life, and it is a highly metastatic class of sarcoma. Despite the use of radiotherapy or surgery, historically, an estimated 85% to 90% of patients died within a few months from a metastasis. Due to the considerable progress in the treatment of disease with both local therapy and multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy, 5â€“year survival rate improved from less than 20% to greater than 70%, but the recurrence rate remains high. It must be promptly recognized and treated to avoid high morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the symptoms, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of Ewing sarcoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of Ewing sarcoma. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of Ewing sarcoma.
- Review the management options available for Ewing sarcoma.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of Ewing sarcoma and improve outcomes.
