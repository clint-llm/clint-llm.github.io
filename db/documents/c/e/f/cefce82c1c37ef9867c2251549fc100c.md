The clinical efficacy of subcutaneous omalizumab as adjunctive therapy in patients with allergic asthma has evidence from several well-designed trials. After nearly two years of use, there is robust evidence that omalizumab is an effective and safe treatment of severe asthma. However, the optimum duration of therapy is not known, though trials have demonstrated that indefinite treatment is not always needed.

Due to the risk of anaphylaxis, patients require close observation for an appropriate period after omalizumab administration. This risk necessitates an interprofessional team approach to therapy. Registered nurses or physicians administering omalizumab should be prepared and trained to manage episodes of omalizumab-induced anaphylaxis. Pharmacists should be consulted for dosing as well as performing complete medication reconciliation, and results reported back to the healthcare team. Clinics administering omalizumab should have resuscitation equipment available, including epinephrine at the bedside.
