In phase 3 of the clinical trials, common adverse events reported mainly were injection-site reactions which include pain, erythema, and pruritus. Two days following administration, approximately 30% of patients reported flu-like symptoms when receiving mipomersen therapy. These symptoms include chills, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, or malaise. Other participants reported malaise, arthralgia, fatigue, chills, and myalgia.

Mipomersen usage is also cautioned when ingesting other hepatotoxic medications, which include methotrexate, tamoxifen, isotretinoin, and alcohol.

Strategies to mitigate the adverse events listed above have been explored. Randomized controlled trials by Reeskamp et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of administering mipomersen 3-times weekly at a dose of 70 mg. The researchers found that such modifications to the administration reduce the adverse effects while improving tolerability to mipomersen.

84% of patients receiving mipomersen therapy have reported injection site reactions. These local effects typically include erythema, pain, pruritus, local swelling, and tenderness. To minimize the adverse effects of injection site reactions, the provider must adhere to the proper technique for the subcutaneous administration of therapeutics.
