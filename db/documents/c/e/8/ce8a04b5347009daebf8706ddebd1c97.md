BP is a rare transmitted condition and typically occurs in sexually active people. It is clinically characterized by multiple well-demarcated red-brown to violaceous papules, usually less than 1 cm in size. The surface of the lesion can be flat, smooth, papillomatous or verrucous. Some papules may coalesce into large plaques. Sometimes, BP presents as warty white plaques. The distribution of lesions is commonly discrete; sometimes BP can have an annular or linear exhibition.Â In men, BP lesions primarily involve the penile shaft, but may also involve foreskin, glans, scrotum as well as the anus. Whereas in women, the lesions are usually bilateral and affect labia major, labia minor, clitoris, inside the vagina, inguinal folds, and perianal area. The lesions are generally darker in women than in men. They are usually asymptomatic; occasionally, patients may complain from pruritus and soreness of the affected area. Extragenital BP is a very rare condition, and it may involve the face, fingers or neck, with or without concomitant genital lesions.
