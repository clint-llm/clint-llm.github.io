Aural atresia is the absence of a patent ear canal, which may be either acquired or congenital. Acquired aural atresia is most often due to an inflammatory process or following trauma or otologic surgery. Congenital aural atresia is a malformation of the external auditory canal resulting in profound conductive hearing loss in the newborn that persists into later life. In the setting of congenital aural atresia, the middle ear may be completely structurally and functionally normal or may have concurrent malformations. The human ear can be divided into three parts - the inner, middle, and outer ear. The outer ear, also known as the external ear, consists of the auricle (or pinna) and external auditory canal. The external ear is functionally important for hearing by guiding sound waves to the tympanic membrane and middle ear, although the loss of the pinna can still leave patients with normal-functioning hearing. The pinna also provides structural support for hearing aids and glasses, if required.

Embryologically, the external ear develops from the first pharyngeal cleft and the first and second pharyngeal arches. The external ear, specifically, develops from the hillocks of His, and remnants of these embryologic structures can persist into post-natal life as cysts or fistulae that can become problematic later if they become infected.
