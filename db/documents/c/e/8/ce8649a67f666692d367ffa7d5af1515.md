Opsoclonus and OMS are associated with various disease entities, most commonly paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic infections, or due to toxic, metabolic, and drug-induced derangements.

In adults, commonly described paraneoplastic etiologies include small cell lung cancer (SCLC), breast carcinoma, and ovarian teratoma, and less frequently non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and renal adenocarcinoma.

Interestingly, the presence of opsoclonus in patients with neuroblastoma portends a better prognosis.Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Rickettsia conorii, Streptococcus, Lyme disease, rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, hepatitis C, West Nile virus, and varicella-zoster virus.

Toxins associated with the presence of opsoclonus include chlordecone, organophosphates, strychnine, thallium, and toluene.

In many cases of opsoclonus, however, no etiology is found even after extensive investigations, and these cases are classified as idiopathic opsoclonus.
