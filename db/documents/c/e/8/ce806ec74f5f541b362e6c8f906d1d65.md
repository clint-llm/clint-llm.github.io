On laboratory tests, an elevated blood level of a cardiac enzyme (troponin)can occur in patients with coronary artery thrombus. Electrocardiogram show ST elevation in leads monitoring the artery containing thrombus. Several imaging modalities utilize for the diagnosis of intracoronary thrombus. Multiple studies have shown the low sensitivity of angiography, although specificity approaches 99-100% while using multiple angiographic views for verification.
