Epidemiological data regarding hypersensitivity reactions are scarce. One-third of the adverse reactions occurring due to drugs are, in fact, hypersensitivity reactions. These hypersensitive reactions can prove to be lethal and can also prolong hospitalizations. Genetic predisposing factors remain unexplored, but it is possible that we can identify high-risk populations with advancing genetic studies in the future.
