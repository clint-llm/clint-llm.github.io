There are three main forms of asbestos exposure. Direct work-related environmental exposure is common among workers atÂ shipyard, mining, aerospace, etc. Bystander exposure is the second form of exposure commonly seen in certain professionals like electricians, masons, and painters. The third and most common form of asbestos exposure is the general community exposure, such as the use of asbestos for road surfaces, playground material, landfills, and chemical paints. The disease is dose-dependent; the dose of exposure is higher in the first group and, respectively, lower in the second and third forms of exposure. Also, the risk of the disease is more with amphibole variety compared to the serpentine asbestosis fibers.
