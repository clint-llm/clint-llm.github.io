Factors contributing to upper airway narrowing during sleep are disadvantageous anatomic factors and/or reduced neuromuscular compensatory mechanisms to maintain airway patency. Upper airway resistance syndrome occurs in the upper airway most commonly due to partial narrowing and increased resistance in the retropalatal (between the hard palate and the uvula) and retroglossal (between the uvula and the epiglottis) locations.

UARS may represent an early stage of the OSA condition and could help elucidate the natural progression of sleep-disordered breathing. Still, there are limited epidemiological data to assess the role of non-apneic respiratory events; these are mainly associated with prolonged flow limitation and effort-related arousals.

The flow limitation can be inspiratory, expiratory, or in both respiratory cycle phases.

The airflow and upper airway resistance (Rua) is governed by Poiseuille's law or what is known as the "Starling resistor" model of the upper airway.
