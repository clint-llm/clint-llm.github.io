Dialogue amongst the involved physicians, nursing staff, and laboratory technicians are vital to identify the availability of TPE at any particular institution and to subsequently make appropriate transitions for patients requiring TPE when not available in the initial facility. In situations when TPE is not emergency indicated, the arrangement of outpatient care will be required. Coordination of effort between the health professionals to enhance patient-centered care and outcomes is a top priority.  They need to recognize who will require therapeutic plasma exchange and when to initiate it.

The diseases that require this treatment are rare, of various etiologies (genetic, physiologic, infectious, autoimmune), and are often initially managed with supportive therapies (supplemental oxygen, intravenous hydration, immunosuppressants, phototherapy).  Appropriate treatment and selection of patients and timing of intervention all need to be clearly communicated within and between medical professionals caring for the patient.
