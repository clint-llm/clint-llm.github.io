The mmanagement of pediatric spinal trauma is with an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, neurologist, neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon and an intensivist. The initial steps include following the ATLS protocol and then assessing the patient for any secondary injuries. Once spinal trauma has been diagnosed, the majority of patients are treated with supportive care. The outlook of children is signficantly better than in adults but the recovery can be prolonged. Those with severe neurological deficits at presentation may have residual deficits evern after full recovery.
