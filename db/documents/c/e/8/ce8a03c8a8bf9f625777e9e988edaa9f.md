The term teledebriefing describes a process in which learners who are participating in a simulation scenario undergo debriefing with a facilitator located at an off-site location.

Telesimulation has seen rapid growth in the last several years and has been implemented in many areas, including (but not limited to) pediatric resuscitation, surgery, anesthesia, nursing, and emergency medicine.

In a simulation, debriefing is often considered to be the most crucial component and is the time when a majority of the learning occurs.
