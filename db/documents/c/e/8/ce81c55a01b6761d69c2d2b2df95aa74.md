Today defibrillators are widely used both in and out of the hospital, despite universal algorithms taught to healthcare workers, the outcomes after CPR and defibrillation remain poor. The key reason for this is because many resuscitation teams deviate from standard protocols. Evidence suggests that in many cases, the absence of a team leader is the key reason for the deviation. Research shows that developing a CPR team with strong leadership is the key to improving results after CPR. Until the arrival of a team leader at the site of the cardiac arrest, the bedside nurse is in the ideal position to run the code. However, other factors that also influence the conduct of code and defibrillation are external factors like equipment, team hierarchy, institutional characteristics, and stress of the situation for the clinical providers. There is no question that defibrillation is an interprofessional event but in order to achieve good success rates, the team has to be organized and functional.
