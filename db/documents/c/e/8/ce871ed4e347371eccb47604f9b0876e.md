Clinical tests for defects in digestion or deficiencies in digestive enzymes are often indicated after a patient presents with gastrointestinal symptoms. An example is testing for lactose intolerance due to a lactase defect or deficiency. Lactase is a disaccharidase produced by the pancreas that hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond in lactose to form the carbohydrate monomers glucose and galactose; this is necessary, as glucose and galactose are absorbable by the SGLT1 cotransporters on the luminal surface of enterocytes in the small intestine, but lactose cannot.

In a patient with defective or deficient lactase, a rise in blood glucose levels after oral administration of a lactose bolus will not occur because lactose will remain undigested in the lumen of the small intestine and no glucose will enter the bloodstream. A second test for lactose intolerance involves a similar administration of oral lactose and then a measurement of hydrogen gas levels in the breath. In a patient with lactose intolerance, lactose will remain undigested and pass into the colon. Colonic bacteria can use lactose as an energy source, producing hydrogen gas as a byproduct.
