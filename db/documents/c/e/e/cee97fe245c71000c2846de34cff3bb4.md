The patient should be positioned in a manner that the jugular venous pressure can be easily seen. Classically, the patient is placed in a semi-recumbent position with an elevation of the head of the bed to 30 to 45 degrees. There should be at least a 3 cm margin from the upper margin of the baseline JVP to the angle of the mandible. A steady abdominal pressure of around 20 to 35 mmHg is then applied. Historically, the pressure was applied for 15 seconds.
