For routine examination in adult patients, preparation for pelvic exams includes asking the patient to remove her lower garments and providing a gown and drape. Privacy is necessary during this step, and a chaperone during the exam is paramount. It is vital that the patient feels comfortable and non-threatened. A non-sterile, lubricated speculum is usable in non-pregnant patients, and a reliable light source should be used to enhance visibility. Culture swabs should be readily available at the bedside if vaginal discharge is reported or appreciated on an exam as foreign bodies are a nidus for infection. Forceps can be brought to the bedside to aid in the removal of foreign material.
