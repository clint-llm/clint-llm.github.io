Hypercortisolism refers to the clinical state resulting from excess tissue exposure to cortisol and/or other glucocorticoids. When such exposure is sustained, it results in the development of Cushing syndrome (CS), which is a distinctive constellation of clinical signs and symptoms resulting from chronic exposure to excess cortisol, either exogenous or endogenous. This activity provides a global summary and review of hypercortisolism, including its epidemiology, causes, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management options, while highlighting the interprofessional team approach required for the detection, prevention, diagnosis, and management of patients with this clinical condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypercortisolism and Cushing syndrome.
- Describe the clinical presentation of hypercortisolism and Cushing syndrome.
- Review the diagnostic algorithms for hypercortisolism and Cushing syndrome while summarizing the treatment strategies and options.
- Outline the interprofessional team approach integral to the successful management of hypercortisolism and Cushing syndrome, describing the roles of various clinical specialists in the diagnosis and management of Cushing syndrome.
