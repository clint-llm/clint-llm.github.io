Although the exact cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis is unknown, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is thought to have a large role. Metabolic problems such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity have all been associated with the development of this disease. It is important that lifestyle and diet modification be encouraged in these patients. Also, once they develop cryptogenic cirrhosis, screeningÂ for hepatocellular carcinoma every 6 months is advised.
