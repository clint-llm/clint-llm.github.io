Visual function will return to near-normal levels over weeks to months whether or not treatment any treatment is initiated. However, visual recovery is hastened when treated with corticosteroid therapy.

Based on the long-term results of the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), the protocol for treating optic neuritis (ON) is widely accepted throughout the medical community.

- Intravenous methylprednisolone (500-1000mg once daily) for three day

- followed by oral prednisone (1mg/kg once daily) for eleven days.

- Note that oral prednisone alone was found to increase the rate of recurrent ON attacks.

If lesions characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS) are evident with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), then immune-modulating therapies should be considered to delay subsequent attacks.
