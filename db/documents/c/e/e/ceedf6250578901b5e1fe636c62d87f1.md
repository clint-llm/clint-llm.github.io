Abdominal wall layers receive segmental sensory innervation in a dermatomal distribution. The skin sensation around the umbilicus corresponds to the T10 dermatome. The intercostal nerves (T7-T11), the subcostal nerves (T12) become the anterior cutaneous nerves as they pass through the rectus sheath towards the skin. The iliohypogastric and the ilioinguinal nerves (L1) also provide sensory innervation to the skin. The iliohypogastric nerve takes the sensory information from the skin above the suprapubic area. The ilioinguinal nerve provides sensation to parts of the skin above labia majora and medial thigh.  All these nerves pass through Scarpa’s fascia as they make their way to the skin.
