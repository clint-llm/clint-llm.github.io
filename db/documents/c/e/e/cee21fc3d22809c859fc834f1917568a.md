A combination of both behavior modification therapy with medications can lead to better clinical outcomes than if either option is used alone. Some studies show enhanced outcomes when certain drugs are used in the psychological treatment of anxiety disorders and even post-traumatic stress disorders. Despite the clinical efficacy of these studies, it should be noted that each individual can have a different treatment plan that is optimal to only them. Some people might respond better to only therapy or medications rather than a combination of both. Furthermore, combination treatments can be more of a "mix and match" treatment where two patients can have similar amounts of treatment success but use different medications and therapy options.
