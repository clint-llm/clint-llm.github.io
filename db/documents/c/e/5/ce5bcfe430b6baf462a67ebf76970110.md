Seventy percent of cardiac arrests that occur outside of a hospital occur in the home. Half of these cardiac arrests are unwitnessed. Despite advances in emergency medical services, the survival rate remains low. Adult victims of non-traumatic cardiac arrest that receive resuscitation attempts by emergency medical services have a survival rate to hospital discharge of only 10.8%. In comparison, adult patients who experience cardiac arrest in a hospital setting have rates of survival to hospital discharge of up to 25.5%.
