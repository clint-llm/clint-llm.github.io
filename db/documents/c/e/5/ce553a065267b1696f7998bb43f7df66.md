There are no environmental risk factors that affect an increase or decrease in the chances of developing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, there are certain syndromes in which there is a substantial risk of developing PNETs. These include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and tuberous sclerosis. Patients with these diseases should be educated about their increased risk of developing PNETs. If the patients are wary of the symptoms, they will heed professional intervention early on in the course of the tumor progression.
