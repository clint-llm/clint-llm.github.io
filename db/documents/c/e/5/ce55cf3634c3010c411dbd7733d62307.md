Monitoring in colostomy care is an integral aspect to assess for complications and to plan for colostomy closure. It is generally done in hospitals by a team of allied health workers and the nursing staff.

In the hospital setup, in the early postoperative period, the nursing staff must check for viability and full functioning of the stoma and also look for complications like stoma gangrene. Also, general surgical complications like post-op DVT, atelectasis, and UTI must be looked for.

After discharge, the patients must be followed every couple of weeks to look for complications like stomal prolapse, retraction, and parastomal herniation. This is generally done by the nursing staff and, in case of complications, must be communicated to the treating surgeon for appropriate action.

The patientsâ€™ weight and body mass index (BMI) should be calculated at regular intervals by a dietician and be advised appropriate dietary and fluid management advice as well as vitamin and mineral supplementation to compensate for the reduced bowel length and reduced absorption.

The mental status of the patient should also be assessed at regular intervals, before and after stoma creation, by a psychologist.
