The largest group of muscles supplied by the subclavian arteries are those of the upper extremity. These muscles include the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, muscles of the forearm and the shoulder. These muscle groups receive vascular supply as the subclavian arteries become the axillary arteries which then become the brachial arteries and eventually the radial and ulnar arteries.
