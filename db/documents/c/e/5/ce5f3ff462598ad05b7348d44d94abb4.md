Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning can be insidious or abrupt in onset. Symptoms can range from mildly bothersome to death. The clinician cannot make the diagnosis and treat the patient for this condition ifÂ he or she does not consider it when assessing a patient with multiple, vague complaints such as a headache and nausea or flu-like symptoms. Poisonings tend to be more common in winter months when improperly vented or poorly maintained heating units can poison entire households or apartment buildings. House fires and suicide attempts are also common causes of CO poisoning. CO can poison scuba divers if tanks are filled near a generator that is not adequately ventilated. Prompt treatment and referral for hyperbaric oxygen treatment is life-saving and reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with this, all too common, poisoning. Installing and maintaining CO detectors in homes and buildings saves lives.
