Gastrocnemius strain usually develops at the posture of the knee. This is during maximal extension of the knee with the ankle in full dorsiflexion, which maximally stretches the gastrocnemius muscle. The posture increases the tension of the elastic elements of the muscle to let them approach the threshold of muscle tear, especially during eccentric contraction of the muscle.
