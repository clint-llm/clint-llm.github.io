Sacral neuromodulation is indicated for refractory urinary tract dysfunction, including symptoms of nonobstructive urinary retention, urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. It has also been shown to be effective even in Parkinson's patients with neurogenic bladder symptoms, who are often refractory to treatment. In a recent study, 82% of patients with neurogenic bladders from Parkinson disease responded well to sacral neuromodulation therapy, and most were able to stop their overactive bladder oral medications.

**Patient Selection**

Patients eligible for sacral neuromodulation therapy for urinary incontinence must have refractory nonobstructive urinary retention, urgency, urge incontinence, or severe frequency that have failed to respond to behavioral modifications and pharmacotherapy with more than one medical therapy for >8 to 12 weeks.

Patients are instructed to keep a voiding diary to establish a baseline level of urinary and fecal symptoms. This diary should be continued at least during the clinical trial period to determine if there is an improvement of 50% or greater, which would be considered a successful trial.

Sacral neuromodulation is not recommended by the Amerian Urological Association Guideline on Adult Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction (2021) for spina bifida or spinal cord injured patients due to the high level of variability in bladder function and progression.
