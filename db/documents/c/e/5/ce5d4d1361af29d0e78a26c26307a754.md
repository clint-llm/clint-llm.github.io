Nevus sebaceus of Jadassohn also referred to as organoid nevus, is a congenital malformation described in 1895 by the dermatologist Josef Jadassohn. These congenital malformations are hamartomas of the pilosebaceous follicular unit. These growths most commonly form on the scalp, but may also appear on the forehead, face, or neck. They undergo a growth phase during puberty due to hormonal changes in the patient's body. In adulthood, the growths may develop secondary neoplasms within them, most commonly trichoblastoma. The treatment of these lesions is controversial, with options ranging from observation to early excision in childhood.

Features of the nevus sebaceus syndrome (also known as Schimmelpenning Feuerstein Mims syndrome) include a large or disseminated nevus sebaceus along with abnormalities of the central nervous, skeletal, or ocular systems.
