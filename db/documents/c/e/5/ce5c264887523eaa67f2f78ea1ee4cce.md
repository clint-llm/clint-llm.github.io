**General Principle.**The Virchow’s triad of hypercoagulability, vascular stasis, and vascular trauma, described in 1856, remains a true predictor of thrombosis.

- Hypercoagulability

- Stasis

- Trauma

**Etiologies.**The physiology of coagulation undergoes alteration due to various factors, including:

- Genetics

- Medications

- Procoagulant

- Anticoagulation defects of the coagulation cascade

- Quantitative defects of the integral components of the coagulation

- Qualitative defects of the integral components of coagulation.

**Clinical Presentations**. With the altering of hemostatic physiology, various clinical outcomes including:

- Pulmonary embolism

- Deep vein thrombosis

- Stroke

- Myocardial infarction

**Coagulopathies.**Few of the disorders of coagulation include:

- Anti-thrombin 3 deficiency,

- Protein C deficiency,

- Hyperhomocysteinemia,

- Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome

**Risk Factors.**Some acquired factors influencing the coagulation include

- Pregnancy

- Trauma

- Malignancy-related hypercoagulable state

- Hormone replacement therapy

- Inflammation

- Infection

- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
