There is not much high-quality evidence for the treatment and diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), both due to difficulty in diagnosis with various clinical presentations and low disease incidence.

Healthcare staff with adequate knowledge of wound care are essential for effective treatment of paraneoplastic pemphigus, which is managed similarly to toxic epidermal necrolysis and burn patients. A wound care nurse should be involved in the care of these patients, and keep the concerned provider apprised of all progress. The patient requires education by the nurse on the different occlusive dressings and the importance of antiseptic baths. The nurse has to monitor the wounds for superinfection and report any changes to the provider. A mental health nurse should also be involved in the care of these patients as the disorder can cause severe distress, anxiety, and depression. A specialty-trained pharmacist must be involved to verify agent selection and dosing when medication is part of the therapy plan, and as always, check for drug-drug interactions. Dieticians aid in the development of dietary plans and nutrient supplementation, especially if the patient requires tube feeds secondary to oropharyngeal involvement.

With comprehensive management by the interprofessional healthcare team, the quality of life of these patients with paraneoplastic pemphigus can be improved. [Level 5]
