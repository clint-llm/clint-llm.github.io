The prognosis for AGEP is excellent, and symptoms most often improve or completely resolve within 15 days of medication discontinuation. Still, the recovery timeline may vary depending on the specific pharmacokinetics of the causative agent. The long half-life of hydroxychloroquine is thought to explain prolonged symptoms of AGEP induced by this drug compared to other cases.

Identifying a suitable alternative treatment is crucial for a patient's overall well-being if AGEP is caused by a medication they would otherwise take long-term, such as first-line medications for cardiovascular disease, inflammatory arthritis, or epilepsy.

The previously cited case-fatality rate of 2 to 5% cannot be definitively attributed solely to AGEP without other comorbidities and is therefore disputed.
