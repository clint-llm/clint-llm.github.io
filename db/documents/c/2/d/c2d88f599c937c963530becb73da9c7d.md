Niemann-Pick disease is a progressive disease, and quite often, complications develop with time.

- The initial involvement of the liver can transform into fulminant hepatic failure.

- Deterioration of the lungs can result in respiratory insufficiency.

- Progressive neurodegeneration can cause dementia, seizures, and schizophrenia-like psychosis.

- Severe thrombocytopenia can result in internal or external bleeding.

- Coronary artery and valvular heart disease

- Bones become deformed, causing enlarged bone marrow cavities, thinned cortical bone, or coxa vara.
