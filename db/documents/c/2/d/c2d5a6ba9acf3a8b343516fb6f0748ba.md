Due to the saphenous nerve’s purely sensory function, a regional blockade of the nerve can be of sizeable clinical significance for procedures terminal to the knee. Nerve blocks for ankle manipulation, particularly around the medial malleolus would be an effective method of pain management during such procedures. Blocks would also be of benefit for meniscectomies due to the saphenous nerve’s course and location of innervation in the medial knee.

The saphenous vein is also a commonly implicated vein in varicose veins that can lead to chronic venous disease. Structural changes can occur to the vein such as intimal wall thickening and increased connective tissue within the venous wall. The structural changes to the wall result in overall weakness and dilation of the vein which promotes reflux of flow. The reversal of flow can contribute to increased venous hypertension which promotes a continuous cycle of structural damage to the vein. Since the saphenous vein is a relatively superficial vein, it is often the vein that is visibly distended and problematic for the patient.
