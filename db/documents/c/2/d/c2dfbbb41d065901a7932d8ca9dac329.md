Enterobacter infections are serious infections with a high mortality rate, even with appropriate treatment. The interprofessional team can consist of infectious disease experts, microbiologists, pharmacists, nurses, and physical therapists. Infectious disease experts may help determine appropriate management andÂ the need for invasive medical devices or catheters. Microbiologists may need to perform specialized tests. Pharmacists may be familiar with the community's antibiogram and also assist the healthcare team in the focus of treatment. Nurses can encourage strict infection control protocols and be aware of medication side effects to inform the rest of the healthcare team. Since many patients who are affected by Enterobacter infections are weak and bedridden, physical therapists may also be helpful in their care.
