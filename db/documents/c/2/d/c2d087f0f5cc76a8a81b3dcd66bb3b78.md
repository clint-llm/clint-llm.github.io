In the United States alone, approximately 11,000 new cases are reported each year among spinal cord injuries, which include incomplete paraplegia and tetraplegia.  Brown-Séquard Syndrome is a rare form of incomplete spinal cord injury which results after damage to one side of the spinal cord only (hemisection), typically in the neck (cervical spinal cord), or thoracic spinal cord, however, it could be anywhere along the length of the spinal cord. Estimates indicate among all traumatic causes, 4% of spinal cord injuries are Brown-Séquard Syndrome.
