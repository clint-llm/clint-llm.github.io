Several physiologic parameters are recorded during a diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG), each with one or more channels displayed electronically when interpreting a PSG. These data form the basis of the utility of a PSG to diagnose a range of sleep disorders. A PSG includes:

- Bilateral frontal, central and occipital EEG

- Surface chin and leg electromyogram (EMG)

- Left and right eye electrooculogram (EOGs)

- Electrocardiogram (ECG) lead II

- Audio and video recording for snoring, body position, and other abnormalities

- Nasal pressure transducer

- Oronasal thermal flow sensor

- Thoracic and abdominal respiratory effort monitored most commonly with respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) belts

- Pulse oximeter

The EEG electrodes are set up according to the international 10-20 system.

Snoring and body position are monitored with the use of audio and video recording. Nasal airflow is measured by changes in pressure from a nasal pressure transducer. Oronasal thermal flow is measured based on the differences in temperature from the nose and mouth during inhalation and exhalation. RIP belts measure respiratory effort.
