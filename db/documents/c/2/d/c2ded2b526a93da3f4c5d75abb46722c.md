It is not uncommon for patients to lose 10 to 15 degrees of terminal extension. Limiting the time of immobilization to less than three weeks can help to avoid contracture. Dynamic elbow splinting along with therapy can be used if the patient is not improving at an expected rate. It may take up to 5 months for patients to regain extension. If these fail, surgical intervention for contracture release may be required.

In children, the prognosis after elbow dislocation is usually more optimistic. Children generally have lower rates of contracture and loss of motion and have a higher tendency to regain normal elbow function.
