The investigation of choice is brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast. This also avoids radiation exposure. However, if the child is neurologically unstable, an urgent head computed tomographic (CT) scan with contrast is indicated. In clinical practice children with posterior fossa tumours tend to get whole neuroaxis imaging as more malignant tumour types can form drop-metastasis. PCAs do not form drop-metastasis like ependymoma and medulloblastoma and theoretically would not require whole neuroaxis imaging. It is important to note, that the variant pilomyxoid astrocytoma is more agressive and can form drop-metastasis. Spinal seeding or leptomeningeal dissemination is extremely rare in PCA; therefore, it is only recommended in suspected or uncertain cases.

PCA can have multiple radiological appearances. In 66%, there is a significant cystic component with an avidly enhancing mural nodule, while in 46%, the cyst wall also enhances.
