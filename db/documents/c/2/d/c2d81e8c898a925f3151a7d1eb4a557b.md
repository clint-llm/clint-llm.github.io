Routine testing of HER2 expression is a strong recommendation on newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer, as well as those with metastatic breast cancer, as patients with a high level of HER2 expression would benefit from agents targeting HER2.

Cancer biopsy: Tests for HER2 are usually performed on biopsy samples via either fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-assisted breast biopsy of surgical excision. The sample attains a score based on the cell membrane staining pattern.

Serum: The extracellular domain of HER2 may shed from the surface of tumor cells. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) to measure serum HER2 would provide a less invasive method of determining HER2 status than a biopsy.
