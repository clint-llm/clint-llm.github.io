Hemorrhage – As with any vascular surgery, hemorrhage is always possible, both on-the-table and in the early postoperative period. Classical signs of bleeding may not be seen. Patients may not demonstrate classical tachycardia in response to hypovolemia as they are often on beta-blockers. Additionally, they can be hypertensive rather than hypotensive as a result of parenchymal compression. They often will complain of new-onset acute flank pain, and there may be a palpable mass or bulge near the incision. High clinical suspicion should be maintained and may warrant a return to the operating room. It’s important to remember that bleeding may be tamponaded by the kidney’s compartmentalized space in the retroperitoneum, an effect that would not be expected following intra-peritoneal placement of the allograft.

Thrombosis – Renal vein thrombosis is fortunately rare but is associated with a high risk of graft loss. This phenomenon may manifest in the early postoperative period with new-onset hematuria, sudden-onset oliguria/anuria, and/or graft dysfunction. Arterial thrombosis is rarer still but is often equally devastating and may manifest similarly in the recipient. Ultrasound is often diagnostic and should be ordered in the event of a precipitous decline in UOP in a previously functioning allograft. High suspicion for vascular complications should be maintained in the early postoperative period due to technical errors and/or clamp injury.

Infection – Infections are common as patients are placed on immunosuppression immediately postoperatively. They are most heavily immune-suppressed in the first 3-6 months post-operatively, putting them at heightened risk of infection during that window. Conventional nosocomial and bacterial infections are seen most commonly in the first month post-transplant and include UTIs and surgical site infections (SSI). High suspicion must be maintained for unconventional or opportunistic pathogens, particularly in the months that follow. Commonly tested viral pathogens include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and polyomavirus (BK-type). Patients are often placed on prophylactic antivirals and antibiotics to decrease the risk of infection in the first 3-6 months – most commonly Bactrim for PCP, Valcyte for CMV, as well as some form of anti-fungal coverage.

Arterial Stenosis – This is a late complication and is often asymptomatic. Its discovery is often prompted by ultrasound examination in the setting of diminished graft function (elevated serum creatinine). Angiography is both diagnostic and therapeutic, and transluminal angioplasty may be attempted.

Lymphocele – This complication occurs due to the disruption of associated lymphatics during the exposure of the iliac vessels. Careful ligation of lymphatic tissue should thus be performed where possible during this dissection.  Patients may present with pain and bulging overlying the transplanted kidney. Alternatively, the collection can become infected or cause graft compression and diminished function. The treatment for symptomatic lymphoceles is percutaneous drainage. Drain aspirate should also be checked for fluid creatinine to rule out a urine leak.  Persistent lymphocele may be surgically treated with peritoneal window drainage.

Urinoma – Usually occurs within the first week of transplantation. Like lymphocele, patients may present with pain and swelling at the incision, compromised graft function as a result of compression, or infection. An elevated creatinine level typically confirms the diagnosis in the fluid aspirate. Many centers preemptively place a ureteral stent at the time of anastomosis to guard against this complication as well as the delayed complication of ureteral stenosis. In the event of a urine leak, bladder decompression with Foley catheter placement is typically all that is needed. However, surgical intervention and revision of the ureteroneocystostomy may be necessary.
