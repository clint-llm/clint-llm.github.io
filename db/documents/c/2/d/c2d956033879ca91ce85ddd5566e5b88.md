**Local Recurrence**

The local recurrence rate is low; when recurrence does occur, it is probably due to multifocal tumors or inadequate excision.

**Malignant Transformation**

Malignant transformation in a Warthin tumor is extremely rare; however, there are a few reported examples in both the epithelial and the lymphoid component.Â The most frequent histological types of malignant transformation in a Warthin tumor are mucoepidermoid carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, oncocytic adenocarcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.
