Clinicians widely use ACE inhibitors in medicine to treat hypertension, heart failure, and patients with chronic kidney disease. While effective, healthcare workers (nurse practitioners, physicians, and pharmacists) who prescribe these agents should be aware of their adverse drug reactions and contraindications. Patients must also be regularly monitored for their renal function and electrolyte concentrations. Healthcare providers should be aware that these agents can produce a chronic dry cough. The clinician should try another class of antihypertensive medication if the patient experiences a dry cough.

Even though ACE inhibitors are among the oldest drug classes available, there is a threat that familiarity can lead to carelessness. That is why, like any other drug, these agents require the oversight and coordination of an interprofessional team. Pharmacists need to verify that dosing is appropriate and check for potential drug interactions.

The clinician must remain informed of these findings from the other interprofessional healthcare team members to take corrective action if necessary. All team members must keep meticulous records of their observations and interventions in the patient's medical record. In summary, the interprofessional team approach using evidence-based medicine and patient-centered care correlates with reduced morbidity and mortality in patients receiving ACE inhibitor therapy.
