ASAS is a rare condition; therefore, statistical studies evaluating the incidence and prevalence of this condition are scarce.

Spinal cord infarctionÂ accounts for 1.2% of all strokes. Spinal cord infarct has an incidence in the USA of 3.1 per 100,000 persons.

Some risk factors associated with ASAS development include smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and family or patient history of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents.
