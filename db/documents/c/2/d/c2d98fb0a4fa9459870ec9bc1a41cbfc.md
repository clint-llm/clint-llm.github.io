AVRT or atrioventricular reentry tachycardia is a type of supraventricular tachycardia that requires an accessory pathway to initiate and maintain the tachyarrhythmia. The accessory pathway connects the atrium to the ventricle bypassing the AV node and has electrophysiologic properties that are different than those of the AV node as well as the  His-Purkinje system. Yet, the accessory pathway resembles more the properties of the Purkinje fibers. The accessory pathway forms one of the two limbs required for the reentrant circuit; the other limb is the AV node, His-Purkinje system. Thus, the accessory pathway may conduct the impulse in the antegrade or retrograde fashion, resulting in orthodromic AVRT or antidromic AVRT:

**Orthodromic A****trioventricular Reentry Tachycardia**

This form compromises 90 to 95% of the reentrant tachycardia and can initiate from atrial premature beats or ventricular premature beats. Atrial premature beats initiating the atrioventricular reentry tachycardia will be blocked in the accessory pathway and conducted to the ventricles in an antegrade fashion through the AV node, His-Purkinje system; after the conduction, the impulse travels back to the atria through the accessory pathway to complete the circuit. While ventricular premature beats initiating the AVRT will be blocked in the His-Purkinje system and conducted to the atria through the accessory pathway in a retrograde fashion, after the conduction, the impulse with travel to the ventricles through the His-Purkinje system to complete the circuit. In both cases, the impulse will travel through the AV node His-Purkinje system in an antegrade fashion and through the accessory pathway in a retrograde fashion.

**Antidromic A****trioventricular Reentry tachycardia**

This type of reentrant tachycardia represents around 5 to 10% of AVRTs. As with orthodromic AVRT, the tachyarrhythmia initiates by either an atrial premature beat (APB) or a ventricular premature beat (VPB). When initiated with an ABP, the impulse is blocked in the AV node/His-Purkinje system but will conduct to the ventricles through the accessory pathway in an anterograde fashion, and then, will travel back to the atria through the AV node/His-Purkinje system in a retrograde fashion. In case the reentrant tachycardia was initiated by a VPB, the impulse will be blocked in the accessory pathway but will conduct in a retrograde fashion through the AV node, His-Purkinje system to the atria, and then back to the ventricles in an antegrade fashion through the accessory pathway. In both cases, the impulse will travel through the AV node His-Purkinje system in a retrograde fashion and through the accessory pathway in an antegrade fashion.
