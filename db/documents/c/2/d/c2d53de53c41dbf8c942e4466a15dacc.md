Deformities and angular variations of the lower extremities are one of the most common reasons for referral to pediatric orthopedics, with in-toeing seen mostly in infants and young children. Pigeon intoeing, also known as pigeon-toeing, is caused by a rotational variation anywhere in the lower extremity that causes the foot to point inward. This activity reviews pigeon intoeing and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pigeon intoeing.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with pigeon intoeing.
- Outline the treatment options available for pigeon intoeing.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination to advance the treatment of pigeon intoeing and improve outcomes.
