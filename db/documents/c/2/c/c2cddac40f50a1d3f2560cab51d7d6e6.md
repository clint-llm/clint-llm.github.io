Mesoderm, also known as the “middle layer,” gives rise to nearly all the connective tissues present in the human body. During embryogenesis, the mesoderm layer found on either side of the notochord, also known as the paraxial mesoderm gives rise to sclerotome and dermomyotome. The sclerotome forms the vertebral body, whereas the dermomyotome can further divide into dermatome and myotome that eventually forms the dermis and skeletal muscle, respectively. In humans, dermatome is identifiable around the third week of embryogenesis. Scarpa’s fascia, a connective tissue layer of the skin, has its origin from the dermatome.
