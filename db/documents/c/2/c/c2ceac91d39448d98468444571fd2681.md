Some common differential diagnoses for food protein intolerance are discussed below:

- Intestinal infections: Intestinal infections may also present with similar symptoms as, or predispose to, protein intolerance. Patients with intestinal infections frequently have signs of infection and can be treated with antimicrobials.

- Celiac disease: Celiac disease is a widely multifactorial disease with a strong hereditary component and HLA (DQ2 and DQ8) association. They can manifest with an autoimmune reaction to the gluten protein in foods. Testing for serum anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies (anti-tTG IgA) can help with the diagnosis of celiac disease or rule it out as a cause for protein intolerance.

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Pediatric patients show symptoms like sleep disturbances, vomiting, poor appetite, poor growth, wheezing, and stridor. Adults experience heartburn, vomiting, and regurgitation. GERD can be managed with or without pharmacotherapy and surgical options. They do not have a relation to a particular food protein.

- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): They include Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, which may present with common GI symptoms like diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and abdominal pain. However, it is important to rule out IBD as they are systemic chronic diseases and require extensive management.
