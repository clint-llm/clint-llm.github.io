Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin malignancy with a lifetime risk of close to 20% in the United States. An estimated more than four million basal cell carcinomas are diagnosed yearly in the United States, which makes up 80% of all non-melanoma-type skin cancers. The number of diagnosed basal cell carcinomas in all age groups has increased at an annual rate of close to 10%. An increase in natural and artificial ultraviolet light exposure has been associated with this increased incidence of basal cell carcinoma in younger age groups, especially females.
