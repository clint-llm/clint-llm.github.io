Propofol is a widely used induction agent in anesthesia. It is used by the anesthesiologist, nurse anesthetist, and intensivist. All healthcare providers who use this agent should be familiar with its adverse effects. A dedicated member of the anesthesia staff should be in charge of monitoring the patient during induction with propofol. The patient must be hooked up to the cardiac monitors and have an additional IV line in case it is needed to manage the hypotension. The anesthesiologist and nurse should also be familiar with PRIS and how to manage it.
