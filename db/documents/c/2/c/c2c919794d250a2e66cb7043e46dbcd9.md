Approximately 90% of the schwannomas are sporadic. Schwannomas occurring in specific syndromes (neurofibromatosis type 2, schwannomatosis, and Carney complex) may have a possible genetic etiology, not only in the syndromic schwannoma but in sporadic cases. Neurofibromatosis type 2 accounts for 3% of the syndromic schwannomas, while schwannomatosis for 2%, and meningiomatosis with or without neurofibromatosis type 2 in 5%.

Genetic studies show that the NF2 gene on chromosome 22 plays an essential role in sporadic and syndromic schwannoma development. The NF2 gene encodes for the merlin protein (schwannomin). Specific gene mutations in the NF2 gene cause the inactivation of the gene, thus preventing the formation of the merlin protein. Inactivation of both alleles of the NF2 gene is observed in most schwannomas. Carney complex may have a loss of PRKAR1A expression.

Spinal schwannomas can have SMARCB1 mutations and inactivation.
