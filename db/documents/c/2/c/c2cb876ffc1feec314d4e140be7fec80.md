Amantadine is an FDA category C for pregnancy. Researchers have observed teratogenic events in multiple animal reproduction studies.

It can influence the production and excretion of breast milk. Physicians should properly advise and weigh out the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of the drug to the mother before starting the medication.
