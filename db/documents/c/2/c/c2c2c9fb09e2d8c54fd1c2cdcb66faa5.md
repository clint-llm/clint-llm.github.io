A sterilized individual to assist with opening packaging and handing sterile equipment in a manner that maintains the sterile field is generally helpful. Additionally, a separate individual to provide sedation/analgesia and monitor effects is ideal and safest for the patient. Lastly, a second sterilized individual may be required to assist with ultrasonography, depending on the comfort and/or experience of the proceduralist.
