The liver is supplied by both the hepatic artery and the portal vein. The portal vein collects venous drainage from the pancreas, spleen, and almost all of the gastrointestinal tract. Typically, this allows for the liver to process newly digested and absorbed nutrients in first-pass metabolism. In the setting of malignancy, it also means the liver can receive metastasis from a wide variety of abdominal and extra-abdominal malignancies. As a result of liver metastasis, patients may have a variety of symptoms depending on disease burden and location. These include abdominal pain, ascites, jaundice, weight loss, and fatigue.

While the hepatocytes are supplied by the portal vein, the cholangiocytes of the biliary system are supplied by the hepatic artery. It is thought that metastatic liver tumors derive their blood supply from the hepatic artery. This presents a unique opportunity for liver-directed therapies that target tumor cells while sparing hepatocytes. In addition, the liver has the ability to hypertrophy to compensate for the loss of function. As long as the vascular supply to the liver and biliary drainage remain intact, up to 80% of the liver can be removed. The remanent will hypertrophy to restore full hepatic function within weeks. This can allow for more aggressive hepatic resections in the case of multiple metastases.
