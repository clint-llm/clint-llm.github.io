- Lack of antenatal steroids

- Maternal smoking

- Pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia

- Hypoxia

- Maternal infection, including chorioamnionitis

- Genetic susceptibility

- Congenital anomalies causing pulmonary hypoplasia

Similarly, various postnatal factors predispose premature infants to develop BPD including:
