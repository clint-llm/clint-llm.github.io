As mentioned, Rotor syndrome is caused by mutations in two proteins responsible for transporting bilirubin and other compounds from the blood to the liver to be metabolized and cleared from the body. Coproporphyrin 1, a significant coproporphyrin isomer in bile, is transported from the hepatocyte back into circulation and is excreted in the urine. Thus, urine coproporphyrin is elevated in Rotor syndrome. Cholescintigraphy using sulfobromophthalein (BSP) has shown that the transport capacity of dye into bile is reduced by less than 50%, and the storage capacity in the hepatocytes is decreased more than five-fold compared with normal values in this disease.

The normal disposition of bilirubin includes hepatic transport through an albumin carrier, where it is conjugated with glucuronic acid to bilirubin glucuronic acid, a water-soluble compound that is easy to excrete in the feces. The donor compound is uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid, and the catalyst of the reaction is uridine diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase (UGT1A1-specific isoform). A reduction in the activity of this enzyme leads to the development of Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome (types 1 and 2). Glutathione-S-transferase acts as an intracellular carrier for certain organic molecules. Patients with rotor syndrome may also have a deficiency in hepatic glutathione-S-transferase.

Rotor syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. In one study, it was found to be coexistent with other inherited disorders, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and heterozygous beta-thalassemia, which suggests a potential interaction between co-inherited genes.

The defective storage and excretion of organic anions, such as bilirubin, lead to impaired secretion of conjugated bilirubin, which leads to its reabsorption into the bloodstream and subsequent excretion in the urine. The resulting hyperbilirubinemia manifests as jaundice. As opposed to Dubin-Johnson syndrome, hepatic pigmentation has not been reported.
