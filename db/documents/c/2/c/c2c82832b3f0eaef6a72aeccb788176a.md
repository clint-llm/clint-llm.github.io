Tinea cruris, also known as jock itch, is an infection involving the genital, pubic, perineal, and perianal skin caused by pathogenic fungi known as dermatophytes.

While tinea infections are often classified by the location of the body affected, they are also organizedÂ according to the responsible organism's primary source and mode of transmission.
