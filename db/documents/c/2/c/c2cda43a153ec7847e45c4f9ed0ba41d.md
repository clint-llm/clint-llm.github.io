- Psittacosis is caused by the bacterium C. psittaci and is a zoonotic infection mostly attributed to contact with birds.

- Diagnosis hinges on the clinician performing a thorough patient interview, asking about occupational history, hobbies, and travel history, as well as maintaining a high index of suspicion.

- Most infected individuals present with an influenza-like illness characterized by headaches, fevers, chills, myalgias, and a cough. A severe headache and gastrointestinal symptoms in the appropriate clinical setting warrant workup for psittacosis.

- Routine laboratory testing is largely non-specific but may reveal elevated liver function testing and elevated inflammatory markers.

- The chest X-ray is noted to be abnormal in most hospitalized psittacosis cases.

- Specific diagnostic testing is recommended when psittacosis is suspected. Preferably with molecular testing (PCR, mNGS) and/or serological testing.

- Newer diagnostic tools utilizing molecular techniques can help in the early detection of psittacosis and should be employed when available.

- Treatment with tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, is preferred.
