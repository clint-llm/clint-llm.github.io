While the most frequent cause of apnea in infants is idiopathic, obstructive sleep apnea due to tonsil/adenoidal hypertrophy, often coexisting with obesity, is the most common cause in children. Other conditions that predispose individuals to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) include:

- Craniofacial anomalies (Pierre Robin sequence, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Apert syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome)

- Chronic nasal obstruction (severe septal deviation, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps)

- Down syndrome

- Metabolic abnormalities (mucopolysaccharidosis)

- Infections (supraglottis, croup, bronchiolitis, pneumonia)

- Asthma attacks,

- Foreign body in the airway

- Congenital chest wall deformities.

Sickle cell anemia has been associated with OSA, but its mechanism is unclear. Predominant central causes of apnea include central nervous system (CNS) infections, raised intracranial pressure (accidental or inflicted head trauma, hydrocephalus, tumors), toxin exposures (CNS depressants, carbon monoxide poisoning), and central idiopathic hypoventilation. Neuromuscular disorders (Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Werdnig-Hoffman disease) often cause mixed apnea. Morbid obesity itself can cause hypoventilation (Pickwickian syndrome) and predispose to apnea. Laryngospasm can occur as a protective reflex during episodes of gastroesophageal reflux and should be suspected when episodes are associated with feeding.
