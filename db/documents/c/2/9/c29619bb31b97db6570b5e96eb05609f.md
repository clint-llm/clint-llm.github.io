Edoxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). It exerts its effects by inhibiting factor Xa (FXa). Edoxaban was FDA approved in early 2015 to treat deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and decrease the risk of hypercoagulability-related illness, stroke, and systemic embolism (SE) in subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).

Various clinical trials and studies (ENGAGE AF-TIMI and Hokusai-VTE) expressed edoxaban's effectiveness compared to the conventional vitamin K antagonist warfarin. It was demonstrated to be non-inferior in preventing blood clots compared to warfarin.
