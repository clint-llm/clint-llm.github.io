Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis first described in 1866 by Adolph Kussmaul and Rudolph Maier. It typically affects medium-sized arterial vessels but may affect small-sized arterial vessels. Unlike other small-sized arterial vessel vasculitides, polyarteritis nodosa is not typically associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). It is a systemic disease process though there is a limited form of the disease called cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (CPAN). This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of polyarteritis nodosa and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of polyarteritis nodosa.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with polyarteritis nodosa.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for polyarteritis nodosa.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with polyarteritis nodosa.
