Enhancing healthcare outcomes in middle lobe syndrome should primarily focus on the accurate detection of this condition. Pulmonologists should be actively involved in the management of patients with recurrent pneumonia or clinical suspicion of endobronchial obstruction, as their expertise with bronchoscopy may prove invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying etiology. Patient education concerning pulmonary rehabilitation and chest physiotherapy may decrease the number of exacerbations.

Antibiotic stewardship is of particular importance in these patients as they often have infections with multidrug-resistant organisms that are difficult to treat; therefore, a pharmaceutical consult can be extremely helpful in this regard. Rapid de-escalation with appropriate cultures would be beneficial as it decreases the likelihood of subsequent multi-drug resistant infections. Coordination of pharmaceutical care with clinicians and pharmacists will result in better outcomes.

Nursing can assist the clinical team by providing patient counseling, monitor treatment progress, and report to the treating clinician any concerns. Nursing can also verify patient compliance with treatment, both drug and other therapies. Age-appropriate vaccinations and limiting exposure to caustic chemicals or smoking can help prevent this condition. This type of interprofessional team coordination is crucial to the successful treatment of middle lobe syndrome. [Level 5]
