Costochondritis is a benign cause of chest wall pain that results from inflammation of the costal cartilage, the cartilage that connect the ribs to the sternum. Patients often present with chest pain; therefore, other causes of chest pain must be excluded with history and physical exam. If the patient's history and physical exam warrant additional workup, this should be done before the diagnosis of costochondritis is made. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of costochondritis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings associated with costochondritis.
- Explain how to rule out more grave causes of chest pain prior to diagnosing a patient with costochondritis.
- Describe common treatments for costochondritis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration amongst interprofessional teams when evaluating patients for costochondritis.
