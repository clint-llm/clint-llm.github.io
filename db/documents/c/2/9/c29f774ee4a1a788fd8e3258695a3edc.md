Bladder trauma is an uncommon injury that can be caused by a direct blow to a distended bladder, high energy injury which disrupts the pelvis, penetrating, and iatrogenic injuries. Bladder traumas are divided into broad categories of extraperitoneal (EP), intraperitoneal (IP), or combined injuries which guide the management plan. There is limited data regarding morbidity and mortality associated with isolated bladder injuries as patients often present with concurrent injuries. Injuries to the bladder occur in up to 10% of abdominal trauma and may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality (10% to 22%).
