Peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) or so-called transcutaneous magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive method of delivering a rapidly pulsed, high-intensity magnetic field to the periphery other than the brain. Interest in the research and clinical applications has increased over the last three decades as it is considered a novel, painless, and easy approach for many neurological and musculoskeletal conditions.
