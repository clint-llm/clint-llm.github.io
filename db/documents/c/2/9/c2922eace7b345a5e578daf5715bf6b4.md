Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is a sequential algorithm that is the basis of achieving the return of spontaneous circulation. While pediatric patients are less likely than adults to require the administration of CPR, this population has unique risk and pathophysiologic factors that may alter a clinician's approach to a decompensating patient. This article reviews guidelines and research vital to maximizing success in a pediatric code by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the criteria to begin resuscitation of a pediatric and neonatal patient. 
- Explain the critical steps to resuscitation of the pediatric and neonatal patient.
- List differential diagnoses that are unique and/or more common to this population set compared to adults.
- Outline the roles in an interprofessional approach to resuscitation of a critically ill pediatric and neonatal patient.
