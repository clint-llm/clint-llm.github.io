Myelomeningocele management is best with an interprofessional team. The prevention of neural tube defects should start by increasing peopleâ€™s awareness through health promotion and educational activities. These activities should take place in schools, communities, and workplaces and include various topics on spina bifida. Healthcare educators, including nurses and pharmacists, should address common genetic, maternal, and environmental factors responsible for the development of neural tube defects such as low folic acid supplementation.

Premarital and antenatal counseling should be a consideration for high-risk individuals. Regular antenatal examination and visits are essential to follow fetal development and address possible fetal and maternal complications. Detailed medical history is important to search for several causative factors such as maternal diabetes, smoking, certain medications, malnutrition, previous affected pregnancy or family history of spina bifida, as well as the exposure to hazardous materials. Females should be advised to take folic acid supplements three months before conception and continue until the end of the first trimester of pregnancy.

The management of myelomeningocele is often interprofessional and involves coordinated care from different specialties. The child and family should receive education about the potential complications and ways to prevent them. Also, safety measures should be implemented in hospitals and the community to avoid further complications.

Increasing awareness about spina bifida is significant to improve the outcomes of patients in their society. Nevertheless, 94% of spina bifida adults have finished a high school degree, and about 62% have completed a college degree. Hence, there are no boundaries for patients to learn or be part of their community. However, ignorance about the disease and its possible complications in addition to delaying therapeutic interventions and not providing adequate medical services would lead to more difficulties in the future and impact the quality of life.

Furthermore, providing training programs and encouraging autonomy as well as community and work participation have shown to be effective in improving the satisfaction and standards of living in patients.

Bowel and urinary incontinence are commonly reported complications of myelomeningocele. Since patients with urinary problems might require repeated catheterization, clinicians should address any further complaints to prevent renal failure. It was shown to be one of the causes of death in patients with myelomeningocele.

Patients with functional disability and mobility problems could require physical therapy, occupational therapy, and strength exercises to improve their muscle power and avoid the development of weakness and contractures.

Considering that patients are in special needs, and may require dependence, some may complain of mental health issues and psychosocial problems. Therefore, health care practitioners of social therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists can help patients and their caregivers to access appropriate care tailored to their needs.
