Syndactyly isÂ best managed by an interprofessional team, including a pediatrician, hand or orthopedic surgeon, hand or physical therapist, and occupational therapist. When a patient's presentation is concerning for a genetic syndrome consultation of a geneticist to provide recommendations for further workup and treatment of associated findings is essential. In patients who form hypertrophic scars or in postoperative patients where excessive scar formation is a concern, the involvement of a therapist early may improve the postoperative cosmesis, function, and limit contracture.
