**Clinical Examination**

The patient should be observed for external signs such as incomplete blink, exophthalmos, eyelid malposition, degree of Bell's phenomenon. The degree of lagophthalmos can be measured by asking the patient to close their eyes and checking if there is a space between the upper and lower eyelid margins. If there is lagophthalmos, the vertical height at the greatest distance of the palpebral fissureÂ should be measured, and any scleral or corneal show documented. All cranial nerve function should be then examined, especially those governing ocular motility and the orbicularis oculi muscle.

On the slit lamp, the conjunctiva should be assessed for injection or chemosis, followed by examination and testing the cornea for sensitivity. The presence of punctate epithelial erosions or epithelial defects can be highlighted with fluorescein staining, with special attention focussed on the inferior cornea where lid excursions terminate. The tear breakup time should be recorded.

**Further Investigations**

Laboratory and imaging studies are determined based on what the underlying etiology could be. If there is suspicion of thyroid eye disease, thyroid function tests along with CT orbital imaging may become necessary in the presence of exophthalmos. If there are fluctuating and progressive neurological signs, then CT/MR neuroimaging is indicated to rule out hemorrhage or tumor.
