Gastric resection remains the preferred surgical treatment option for many diseases of the stomach including malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, and bariatric procedures. Minimally invasive gastrectomy has been shown to have decreased hospital length of stay, fewer perioperative complications, and less intraoperative bleeding than open procedures. This activity outlines the preparation and complications of gastric resection, as well as highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients who require gastric resection.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for gastric resection.
- Outline common complications of gastric resection.
- Summarize the evaluation, planning, and techniques involved in gastric resection.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes in patients with gastric carcinoma requiring gastric resection.
