Given prostaglandin E2’s oxytocic properties and potential side effects, its administration and possible adverse effects require careful monitoring. The most effective way to do this requires an interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists to keep track of the patient’s progress. The team should be especially careful to remove prostaglandin E2 before administering other oxytocic drugs, especially when inducing labor.

The pharmacist should make sure that the clinicians are aware of the potential adverse effects of the drug and how to manage them, assist in preventing the above drug interactions, and verify all dosing. If side effects develop, both the nursing staff and pharmacy staff should report back to the clinical team. Neonatal nursing staff will be an invaluable asset during the entire labor and delivery process, regardless of what manner it occurs, assisting during the procedure and taking care of the neonate and mother subsequently.

Followup to prostaglandin E2 administration is typically by either the evacuation of uterine contents or labor. Because of this, patients require constant close observation and will often need further procedures soon after the drug’s desired effect.

Communication among members of the healthcare team will help with understanding the progression of the drug’s effects and the expected outcome, and the next steps to be taken.
