Due to the nature of interstitial cystitis to follow a chronic path, it can lead to significant disturbance in a patient's quality of life and therefore have a profound negative impact on their psychological and social health. The condition is often not easily managed by one intervention alone, and there are often many physical and psychological co-morbidities. Therefore, an interprofessional approach involving different specialties is best suited to offer the best care to the patient. This would likely include a urologist, pain specialist/team, specialist nurses, mental health specialists, and their family doctor.
