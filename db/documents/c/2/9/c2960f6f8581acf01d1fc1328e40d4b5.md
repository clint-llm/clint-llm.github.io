Noonan syndrome is typically a genetically inherited disorder with heterogeneous phenotypic manifestations that can change with age. The most consistent features are wide-set eyes, low-set ears, short stature, and pulmonic stenosis. Noonan syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. At least 8 different gene mutations can cause this syndrome, and patient presentation can range from mild to severe. Diagnostic criteria have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of Noonan syndrome and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of Noonan syndrome.
- Review the symptoms associated with Noonan syndrome.
- Explain how to evaluate for Noonan syndrome.
- Describe how interprofessional team coordination can lead to a more rapid diagnosis of Noonan syndrome and subsequently decrease associated morbidity in affected patients.
