Disasters can occur at any timeÂ and preparation is essential. In the 1970s a series of forest fires produced significant morbidity, mortality and property damage despite adequate resources. After a study of the management of these forest fires, many problems were revealed. Multiple organizations had to work together. However, their differing command structures made instituting and continuing leadership challenge. Other problems that were also noted were a lack of communication between agencies with significant differences in terminology that supervisors had too large a breadth of people they were supervising, and planning and resource distribution that was poorly managed. Out of this event, it was recognized that a better and more structured approach to disasters was needed. The incident command system (ICS) was developed to combat these issues.
