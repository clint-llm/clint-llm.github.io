In a prospective study, the mortality rate of internal jugular vein thrombosis was reported to be 44%. The mortality rate is significantly higher in patients over 75 years old, patients not treated with anticoagulation and patients with an indwelling central venous line.  In patients with underlying comorbidities such as malignancy, chronic kidney diseases, infections, and multiorgan failure, mortality is significantly higher.
