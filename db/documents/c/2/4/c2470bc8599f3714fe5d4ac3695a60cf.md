The development of an aneurysm is a complex interaction of biomechanical factors such as intraluminal pressure and wall sheer on atherosclerotic walls and biochemical and proteolytic influences resulting in changes in the cellular composition of the aortic wall. Aortic aneurysm rupture ultimately occurs when the force per unit area within the vessel exceeds the tensile wall strength. Although aneurysm diameter is a predominant predisposing factor in the likelihood of aneurysm rupture, aneurysm shape and geometry, the presence of intraluminal thrombus, aortic wall thickness, the presence of wall calcification, and the degree of wall inflammation also influences rupture risk.
