Evaluation of lead encephalopathy is primarily clinical, with supporting evidence obtained through both laboratory and imaging studies. If there is a clinical suspicion of lead encephalopathy, a careful history of potential lead exposure(s) is important. A thorough neurologic examination should be performed both to assess for the degree of dysfunction and to establish a baseline on presentation.

Important laboratory studies to obtain include a whole blood lead level, which will be markedly elevated, as well as a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC will show anemia, usually microcytic, but also possibly hemolytic in an acute high magnitude intoxication, and may have basophilic stippling. A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is also of benefit and may show mild pre-renal azotemia and/or transaminitis in the setting of acute intoxication.
