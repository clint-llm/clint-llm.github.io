Administration of neostigmine methylsulfate, which does not cross the blood-brain "barrier," can be administered as an antidote in incremental intravenous dosages of 0.25 mg in adults and can be repeated every 5 to 10 minutes until anticholinergic activity noted is reversed up to a maximum of 2.5 mg.

If CNS symptoms including restlessness, excitement, convulsions, or psychotic behavior are to occur, physostigmine which does cross the blood-brain "barrier" should be used and slowly administered in dosages of 0.5 to 2 mg administered IV and is repeatable as indicated up to a total of 5 mg in adults.

Supportive care generally is undertaken to reverse hypotension, including pressors with supportive care as needed.

In acute overdose, a curare-like action may occur in which neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness, including paralysis, where artificial respiration and mechanical ventilation in patients whose code status/advanced directive/POLST allows will need to be instituted and maintained until effective respiratory action returns.
