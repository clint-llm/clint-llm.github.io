Left heart catheterization is used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Indications include:

- Evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease.

- Assessment and evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafts.

- Evaluation and treatment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain of uncertain origin, when non-invasive tests are not diagnostic.

- Assessment of the severity of valvular or myocardial disorders such as aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis, mitral insufficiency, cardiomyopathies, etc. to determine the need for surgical correction when there is a discrepancy between signs, symptoms, and echocardiographic findings.

- Evaluation and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

- Percutaneous closure of congenital cardiac defects such as atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

- Treatment of valvular heart diseases such as valvuloplasty or percutaneous transcatheter valve replacement.
