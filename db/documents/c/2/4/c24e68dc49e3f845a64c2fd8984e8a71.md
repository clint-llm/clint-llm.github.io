Fontan completion is a major procedure and patients with univentricular congenital heart disease are complex. Prior to Fontan, proper workup and selection criteria are critical for optimal patient outcomes. After Fontan, patients have "Fontan" circulation, which is different than anatomically biventricular patients. These patients are now surviving longer into adulthood, with the expected number of patients to double over the next 20 years.

In a large cohort of over 500 Fontan patients published by Atz and colleagues,

Transplant-free survival for 90% of Fontan patients was over 12 years, demonstrating that this cohort overall did well. Poor functional status and lower exercise performance appeared to contribute to an increased risk of death or transplantation. Future studies and innovations were suggested by Atz and colleagues to focus on preserving exercise capacity after the Fontan procedure.
