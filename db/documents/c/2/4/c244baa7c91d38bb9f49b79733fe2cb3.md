Management of erosive lichen planus is often challenging for both the patient and the provider. Treatment response is often poor, and relapses are common. Topical corticosteroids have been shown in a randomized control trial to be effective for oral lichen planus and are the mainstay of treatment for both genital and oral erosive lichen planus.

Topical steroids are generally applied for courses of 4 to 6 weeks in the acute setting, with maintenance therapy often being necessary for the long term. For genital erosions, ultra-potent steroid ointment or cream should be applied to the lesion daily. A stepwise lowering of application frequency should be performed after remission has been achieved to minimize the risk of side effects while still preventing relapse. For oral disease, ultra or high potency topical steroids are recommended. The application should occur 3 to 4 times per day in the acute setting and should be performed after the site has been dried.

The gingival disease may be treated by either rinsing with oral elixirs or with the aid of a gingival tray.

Pain is often a significant symptom in erosive LP. Topical anesthetics such as viscous lidocaine frequently prove useful, especially in patients who have decreased oral intake due to painful oral LP. For vulvar and vaginal erosive LP, dilators and surgery can often help correct anatomic distortions due to adhesions and scarring.
