Some cardiac tumors occur in the setting of genetic predispositions or are part of genetic syndromes; this may have implications for genetic counseling and therapeutic implications for targeted therapies.

- Cardiac rhabdomyomas correlate with tuberous sclerosis, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of hamartomas in multiple organs.

- Cardiac fibromas may correlate with Gorlin syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to neoplasia.

- Cardiac myxomas may be part of the Carney complex, an autosomal dominant syndrome.

- Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy sometimes occurs in families, but the exact genetic abnormalities are unknown.

- The genomic profile of most cardiac undifferentiated sarcomas is like that of pulmonary artery intimal sarcomas with recurrent alterations in MDM2, PDGFRA, and CDKN2A genes.

- Papillary fibroelastomas have been reported after cardiac instrumentation and thoracic irradiation.
