Trigeminal neuralgia is not a life-threatening condition. However, it can lead to lifelong pain and can be disabling. The course of TN is variable. Some patients may have episodes lasting weeks or months, followed by pain-free intervals. Some patients have persistent background facial pain concomitantly with TN. In some patients, the pain attacks worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free intervals before they recur. Also, the medications might lose effectiveness over time. Correct diagnosis and proper management can be beneficial to the patients and leads to a good prognosis.
