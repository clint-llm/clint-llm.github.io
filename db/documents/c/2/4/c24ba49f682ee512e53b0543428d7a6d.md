The tensor fasciae latae (TFL) is a muscle of the proximal anterolateral thigh that lies between the superficial and deep fibers of the iliotibial (IT) band. There is high variability in muscle belly length, although, in most patients, the TFL muscle belly ends before the greater trochanter of the femur. The TFL works in conjunction with the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus in a wide variety of hip movements, including flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. It acts via the iliotibial (IT) band's attachment to the tibia to assist with knee flexion and lateral rotation. The TFL is most important clinically for assisting in pelvis stability while standing and walking.
