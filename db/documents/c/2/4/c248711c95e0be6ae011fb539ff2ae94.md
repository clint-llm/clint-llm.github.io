**Blood Supply**

The radial and ulnar arteries supply most of the blood to the forearm. These two arteries branch from the brachial artery just below the antebrachial fossa.

**Lymphatic**

The majority of lymphatic drainage from the upper limb drains into the axillary lymph nodes. There are five groups of axillary lymph nodes; central, lateral, posterior, anterior, and apical nodes.  The drainage from the upper limb mainly travels to the lateral nodes, also known as the brachial and humeral nodes.
