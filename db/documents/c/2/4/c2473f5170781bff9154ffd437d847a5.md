A heterozygous mutation in the TBX5 gene on chromosome 12q24.1 causes Holt-Oram syndrome. This gene is responsible for encoding a transcription factor, T-box5, which regulates the expression of other genes in the development of the heart and limbs. Specifically, the gene is an important factor in cardiac septation and the development of bones in the arm and hand. More than 85% percent of individuals diagnosed with Holt-Oram syndrome carry the mutated TBX5 gene.

The condition is an autosomal dominant disorder, so one copy of the mutation in each cell will lead to the development of the syndrome. For an affected parent, this means that he or she has a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to the offspring. However, most cases of Holt-Oram syndrome are sporadic and occur via de novo mutation.

There is complete penetrance for upper-limb abnormalities and 75% penetrance for cardiac defects. The phenotypic spectrum is wide given the variable expressivity of the gene, leading to difficulty in predicting the malformation characteristics of the offspring. However, if the gene is inherited in an autosomal manner rather than de novo mutation, the offspring will often manifest greater severity in cardiac and limb deformities.
