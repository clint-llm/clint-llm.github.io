A condition commonly confused with cradle crap is atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis presents with moderate to severe pruritus that interferes with sleeping and feeding in the infant, as well as erythematous, scaly and sometimes crusted lesions that are poorly demarcated on the cheek, scalp and extensor surfaces. Impetigo can be confused with cradle cap. However, impetigo starts out as vesicles with a thin, fragile roof. Tinea capitis presents similarly although with possible hair loss, and confirmed with KOH examination and the presence of lymphadenopathy. Diaper dermatitis normally spares the innermost skin folds. Psoriasis is uncommon in this age group, but would present as sharply defined, bright red, silvery scale papules that coalesce into plaques. Lastly, Langerhans cell histiocytosis should be considered in refractory cases of ISD that present with ulceration and erosion along with brownish-red to purpuric nodules in similar areas, ultimately confirmed by biopsy.
