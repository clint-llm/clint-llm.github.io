A diagnosis of HE should involve a thorough evaluation of the patient’s vital signs and airway followed by classification of the symptoms according to the West-Haven Criteria.  Also, it is important to properly differentiate between the presence of asterixis and tremulousness that may, in fact, be associated with alcohol withdrawal or abuse.

Elevated blood ammonia levels are often seen in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.  It is more useful, however, to assess the clinical improvement or deterioration of a patient undergoing treatment rather than monitor serial arterial blood ammonia measurements.

Although electroencephalogram(EEG) changes (e.g., high-amplitude low-frequency waves and triphasic waves) may be observed in hepatic encephalopathy, these findings are not specific for the syndrome. An EEG may, however, be useful in ruling out seizure activity during the initial workup. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be employed to rule out the presence of intracranial lesions, masses, or hemorrhage. MRI may additionally be useful in demonstrating a common finding in hepatic failure and encephalopathy – basal ganglia T1 hyperintensity.
