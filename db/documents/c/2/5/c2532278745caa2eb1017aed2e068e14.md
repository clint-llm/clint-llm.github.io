Facelifts overall should be attempted cautiously; careful assessment by the physician and nursing staff is required. The initial encounter must include a thorough medical evaluation. The physician should be able to determine which facelift technique benefits the patient the most. The patient should endeavor to understand every risk posed by the surgery, including that of dissatisfaction, even in the setting of a technically successful facelift. There are times when surgery alone might not be able to achieve the desired result, and fillers or neuromodulators may supplement the operation. A minority of patients may have body dysmorphic disorder or other disorders that warrant specialist evaluation before surgery.

Expectations must be communicated and understood before performing a facelift. Postoperative pain control should also be discussed before and after the surgery with the patient and a pharmacist. Coordination among the surgeon, nursing staff, and pharmacist will improve outcomes, lower complication rates, and contribute to higher patient satisfaction.
