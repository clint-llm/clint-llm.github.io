The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is a live-attenuated combined vaccine used to prevent infectious diseases (measles, mumps, and rubella). It is also indicated in specific patient populations as post-exposure prophylaxis to measles, mumps, and/or rubella. This activity outlines the MMR vaccine's indications, mechanism of action, administration schedule, and significant adverse reactions needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of individuals to administer the MMR vaccine. This activity also includes other key factors, including contraindications to MMR vaccine administration, toxicity, and monitoring for individuals in the clinical setting for the interprofessional team members when vaccinating individuals with MMR vaccine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the MMR vaccine.
- Describe the contraindications of the MMR vaccine.
- Summarize adverse drug reactions of the MMR vaccine.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the proper administration of the MMR vaccine and improve outcomes.
