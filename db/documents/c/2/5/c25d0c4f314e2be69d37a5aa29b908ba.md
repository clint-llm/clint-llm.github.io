CKD has a multitude of manifestations and is optimally managed by an interprofessional team of health care professionals who practice at a single location such as CKD clinic. These clinics focus on guideline driven kidney care, evaluate and treat complications, suggest patient lifestyle modifications, and provide adequate patient education regarding the various modalities of dialysis. Fishbane et al. compared a standard care model with a healthy transitions program where a nurse care manager works with a protocol-driven informatics system which provides daily reports with incomplete steps of the process for each patient.
