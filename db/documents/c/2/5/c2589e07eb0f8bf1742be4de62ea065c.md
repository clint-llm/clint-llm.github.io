Total knee arthroplasty offers an alternative to individuals suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. The improvements in surgical techniques, pain management, preoperative medical optimization, patient selection, and implant design have allowed primary total knee arthroplasty to be offered to qualifying individuals of varying ages, even to be performed as an outpatient procedure. The need for primary total knee arthroplasty is estimated to increase to nearly three and a half million procedures performed in 2030, a 673% rise compared to 2005.
