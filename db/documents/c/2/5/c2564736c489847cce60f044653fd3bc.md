Interferons are a family of proteins released by a variety of cells in response to infections caused by viruses. There are several classes of IFN, including IFN alpha, beta, and gamma. IFN alpha has been used for the management of hairy cell leukemia, malignant melanoma, follicular lymphoma, condylomata acuminata, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, and chronic hepatitis B and C. IFN beta has been used for multiple sclerosis, and IFN gamma has been used for chronic granulomatous disease and malignant osteopetrosis. In ophthalmology, IFN has been used to manage subretinal neovascularization of age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma filtering surgery, and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. The ophthalmic complications of IFN are mainly limited to the optic disc and retina, and the characteristic finding is vascular retinopathy.
