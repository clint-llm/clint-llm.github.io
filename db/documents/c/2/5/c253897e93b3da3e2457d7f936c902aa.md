Below is the Robson staging for RCC; although it has largely been replaced by the TNM staging which is much more complicated.

Robson staging:

- Stage I: limited to kidney

- Stage II: involvement of perinephric fat but remains limited to Gerota's fascia

- Stage III

- IIIa: renal vein involvement

- IIIb: nodal involvement

- IIIc: both IIIa and IIIb

- Stage IV

- IVa: direct invasion of adjacent organs/structures

- IVb: distant metastases

TNM staging (seventh edition)

- T1

- T1a: limited to kidney, greater than 4 cm

- T1b: limited to kidney, greater than 4 cm but less than 7 cm

- T2: limited to kidney, greater than 7 cm

- T2a: limited to kidney, greater than 7 cm but not more than 10 cm

- T2b: limited to kidney, greater than 10 cm

- T3: tumor/tumor thrombus extension into major veins or perinephric tissues but not into ipsilateral adrenal gland or beyond the Gerota fascia

- T3a: spread to renal vein

- T3b: spread to infra-diaphragmatic IVC

- T3c: spread to supradiaphragmatic IVC or invades the wall of the IVC

- T4: involves ipsilateral adrenal gland or invades beyond Gerota's fascia

- N0: no nodal involvement

- N1: metastatic involvement of regional lymph node/sM

- M0: no distant metastases

- M1: distant metastasesStage groupings

- Stage I: T1 N0 M0

- Stage II: T2 N0 M0

- Stage III: T3 or N1 with M0

- Stage IV: T4 or M1
