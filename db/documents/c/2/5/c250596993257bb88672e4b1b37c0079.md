- Pigment dispersion syndrome: Corneal endothelial changes are similar to those of PEX (Krukenberg spindle).

- True exfoliation of the lens capsule: This is a rare disorder where the superficial and deeper layers of the anterior lens capsule separate in association with exposure to infrared radiation. Slit-lamp examination shows a thin white membrane emanating from the lens into the anterior chamber.

- Amyloidosis: Amyloid can appear similar to PEX material and deposit within the anterior segment structures.

- Primary open-angle glaucoma: There are no signs of white, flaky deposits on the anterior segment of the eye.

- Primary angle-closure glaucoma: Elevated IOP is due to angle closure without the presence of PEX material.
