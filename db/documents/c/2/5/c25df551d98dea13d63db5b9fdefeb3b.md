Addisonian crisis, also known as adrenal crisis or acute adrenal insufficiency, is an endocrinologic emergency with a high mortality rate secondary to physiologic derangements from an acute deficiency of the adrenal hormone cortisol, requiring immediate recognition and treatment to avoid death

Addisonian crisis refers to an episode of acute adrenal insufficiency (which may be primary, secondary, or tertiary), which is a medical emergency. Chronic, stable primary adrenal insufficiency is called Addison disease, a  chronic condition controlled with long-term glucocorticoid therapy.
