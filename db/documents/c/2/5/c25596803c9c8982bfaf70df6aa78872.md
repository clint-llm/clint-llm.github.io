Prenatal management of the mother and fetus depends on gestational age at onset of infection. If infection happens before 18 weeks gestation, the fetus is at high risk for infection and severe symptoms. Termination of pregnancy could be discussed based on local legislation. Detailed ultrasound examination and assessment of viral RNA in amniotic fluid is recommended.

For infections after 18 weeks of gestation, pregnancy could be continued with ultrasound monitoring followed by neonatal physical examination and testing for RV-IgG.

Limited data suggest a benefit of intramuscular Immune Globulin (IG) for maternal rubella infection leading to decrease in viral shedding and risk of fetal infection.

Although symptoms associated with congenital rubella syndrome can be treated, there is no cure for the syndrome; hence, prevention should be the goal.

**Control Measures**

Children with congenital rubella syndrome should be considered contagious until at least one year of age unless two negative cultures are obtained one month apart after 3 months of age. Neonates should be isolated. Hand hygiene is of utmost importance for reducing disease transmission from the urine of children with congenital rubella infection.
