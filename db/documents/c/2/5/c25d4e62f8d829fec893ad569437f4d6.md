There have been reports of a fourth head in a few cadaver studies. This accessory muscle can originate from the humerus, shoulder capsule, coracoid processes, or muscles in close proximity. These accessory muscles can potentially compress the radial and ulnar nerves. Therefore, it is essential for surgeons and physicians to keep in mind that although rare, these variations exist, which can help diagnose cases of nerve entrapment and other pathologic causes that may not be explained by any other typical factors.
