Following the physical exam, imaging studies should be obtained to evaluate injuries further.

Salter-Harris Classification:

- Salter-Harris I: fracture through the growth plate, epiphyseal and metaphyseal separation

- Salter-Harris II: through physis with extension into the metaphysis, the name of the metaphyseal fragment a Thurston-Holland fragment

- 
              
- Most common

- Salter-Harris III: through physis with extension into the epiphysis, risk of post-traumatic arthritis

- Salter-Harris IV: extension of fracture line through metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis

- 
              
- Wide range of incidence of growth disturbance based on the location of the fracture in the extremities

- Salter-Harris V: physeal crush injury.
