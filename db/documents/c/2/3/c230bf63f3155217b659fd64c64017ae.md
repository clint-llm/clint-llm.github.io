The nerves that innervate the occipital area includes the greater (a branch of C2 spinal root), lesser (a branch of C2 and C3 spinal root), and least occipital nerve (a medial branch of the posterior division of C3). The greater occipital is the largest pure sensory nerve and provides sensory innervation to the skin of the posterior skull, occipital, and temporal area. ItÂ is closely associated with the occipital artery at the exit site. The lesser occipital nerve is a cutaneous branch that provides sensory innervation to the skin of the upper and back part of the auricle. The least occipital nerve lies medial to greater occipital nerve and supplies C2-C3 zygapophyseal joint, part of semispinalis capitis, and a small area below the occiput.
