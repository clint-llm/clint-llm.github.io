Recent work in eye embryology has begun to elucidate the complex orchestration of numerous gene products necessary for proper eye development. Among the most notable of these are PAX6, PAX2, sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Rx. Throughout this interplay the importance not only of accurate products but also of accurate gene dosage cannot be overlooked: both deleterious and over-expressive mutations have been shown to result in eye malformations

PAX6 is expressed at the anterior neural plate, indicating the eye field. At this stage, the eye field has not yet been divided to create two globes. The division of the eye field is accomplished by sonic hedgehog (SHH), which is responsible for central nervous system polarity SHH divides the eye field via the division of the forebrain from which the optic vesicles arise. SHH also upregulates the expression of PAX2 PAX2 will become restricted in its expression to the proximal optic vesicle and be essential for optic stalk formation as well as the closure of the retinal fissures Rx is also expressed in the anterior neural plate and will continue to express in the optic vesicles. Rx plays a critical role in spatial patterning and morphogenesis of the optic vesicle. Additionally, Rx is essential for optic vesicle evagination and PAX6 expression Rx becomes localized to the neural retina and may be necessary for retinal differentiation and proliferation
