Infection with the adult tapeworm is most commonly asymptomatic or cause mild disease. Rarely do sequela from the intestinal parasites occur.

Taeniasis typically will cause few or mild health concerns but is characterized by anal pruritus from the escaping proglottids (worm segments) and mild abdominal pain.

Diphyllobothrium is one of the largest parasites of humans and may grow up to 2 to 15 m in length. Despite its size, Diphyllobothrium presents as either mild disease or asymptomatic. One in five infections may have diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, constipation, pernicious anemia, and less commonly headache and allergic reactions.D. latum burden may cause megaloblastic anemia due to the parasite absorbing up to 80% of B12 uptake within the gut.

Cysticercosis also has a fairly unremarkable presentation given that cysts in most tissues are generallyÂ asymptomatic and rarely noticed. Human cysticercosis may affect multiple tissues; however, the parasite is destroyed by the host immune response and surviving only in areas impervious to major immune responses such as the central nervous system and the eye.

Neurocysticercosis (NCC) symptoms can range from asymptomatic brain lesions to mimicking any kind of neurological disorder.
