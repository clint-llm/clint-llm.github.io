According to the American urological association (AUA) guidelines for bladder rupture, IP bladder rupture is repaired surgically while uncomplicated EP bladder rupture may be treated with catheter drainage. If a retrograde urethrogram shows urethral injury, a suprapubic catheter is placed either via a percutaneous or an open approach.

Surgical intervention is indicated for IP bladder injury due to the risk of intra-abdominal sepsis. In hemodynamically stable patients with isolated IP bladder injury, diagnostic laparoscopy with repair can be considered. Intramural bladder hematoma is left undisturbed as releasing the tamponade effect can lead to significant hemorrhage. The bladder lumen is inspected, any foreign body is removed, and nonviable tissue is debrided. An indwelling catheter is placed before repair. The bladder is classically repaired in two layers with running absorbable suture. Watertight closure is ensured with irrigation by filling the bladder in a retrograde fashion through a urinary catheter. The bladder can also be filled in a retrograde fashion with methylene blue to identify leaks. A pelvic drain may be also be placed in the perivesical space. The abdominal wall layers and skin are closed. Postoperatively, the patient should be placed on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for 24-hours in cases of penetrating injury. The pelvic drain may be removed if it has low output. The indwelling catheter can be removed after 10 to 14 days, and a cystogram is performed before removal, as described earlier.

Uncomplicated EP bladder injury without urethral injury is managed non-operatively with an indwelling catheter for 10 to 14 days and antibiotic prophylaxis. Before removal of the catheter, a repeat retrograde cystography is performed to ensure healing of the injury. If extravasation continues greater than three months after the traumatic event, the injury should be surgically repaired. Indications for operative management EP bladder injury include concomitant vaginal or rectal injury, foreign body in the bladder wall, or orthopedic repair involving hardware.
