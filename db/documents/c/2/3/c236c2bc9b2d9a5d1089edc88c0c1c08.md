Following steps should be taken precisely before start venipuncture for either the purpose of blood sampling or therapeutic phlebotomy. The appropriate and convenient mode of communication with the patients should not be underestimated, as transparent communication to describe the details for the patient explicitly is considered the key step to a successful encounter with them during the phlebotomy procedure. During the course of the procedure, empathic communication would guarantee the success of the proposed sampling and or therapeutic phlebotomy along with the patients' satisfaction.

The provider who is willing to obtain the blood collection should introduce him or herself to the patient by providing the first name and a brief explanation of their role in patient care. Patients' identification and the purpose of the procedure, whether to collect blood samples for diagnostic measures, what specific tests to assess with the sample, or for therapeutic reasons, and the exact amount of blood to be collected should be double-checked. Accordingly, the obtained information should be shared with the patient to raise comfort and develop a competent professional atmosphere.

Following the comprehensive explanation and discussion, informed consent without any patient resistance should be obtained. The informed consent should be definitely obtained when the proper procedure-related information by the patient has been acknowledged and all the potential inquiries, including the time to return the results, are fully responded to. The patient should also be asked about the convenient collection sites to be prioritized. Specific attention should be paid to identify the patients who are afraid of blood testing or have a positive history of vasovagal attack during prior similar procedures, to be prepared with all means to take action for a mishap of a vagal syncope provocatively.

Simple steps like counting down might significantly decrease anxiety and optimize the condition for proceeding with the venipuncture. In case of severe history of panic attacks during the procedure, the patient might be asked to lie down. Special attention should be paid to the patients' position during the procedure.

The importance of position maintenance in the phlebotomy procedure should not be underestimated. The patients who are planned to undergo the procedure in an office-based setting should be advised to stay in a sitting position for at least 15 minutes before initiating the procedure. In case of inevitable change in the position, it should be well recorded to interpret the test results accordingly.

All admitted hospital patients planned for phlebotomy should be identified with a ubiquitous identification measure, including ID bracelets. The patients' name and date of birth should be asked and recorded. Several consensuses have been made to identify patients in an active optimized manner. Patients' first and last name, date of birth, plus an extra general information identifier, including patients' social security number and or address, are well accepted. However, additional supplementary data might significantly decrease the risk of preventable errors.

Before the blood is withdrawn, the patients' identification data and the tube labeling should be double-checked. In terms of any discrepancy among the mentioned data, any blood sampling should be deferred till the issue is resolved. The process of both tube identification and tube labeling should be undertaken in the presence of the subjected patient to minimize the risk of tube misidentification. According to each center's own policy, several relevant patient's identification data might be mentioned on the records, including the identification data of the provider who has requested the blood testing, patient's first, middle, and last name, date of birth, complete address, the blood sample's discrete identification characteristics, and specific time and date of the collection, and the details of the sampler's identification data.

Once the identification data has been verified, the fasting status and appropriate patients' preparation for the requested parameters should be double-checked. patients' specific factors with well-documented impact on the blood sampling results should be asked and recorded, including any distinct diet, medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal preparations.

According to the recent guidelines, morning blood sampling on a fasting condition, which should not be less than 12 hours following the last solid meal, is recommended. In cases of blood sampling for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) purposes, according to the specific reasoning for the procedure, whether for dosage justification, monitoring adverse effects, or excluding drug intoxication, the timing for phlebotomy procedure might differ. Moreover, diurnal blood sampling might be requested to evaluate specific biochemical markers with circadian Water use during the fasting period is acceptable. However, other drinks, including energy drinks, or coffee are not allowed on the morning of the procedure. Alcoholic drinks should not be taken within 24 hours of the procedure, and all non-emergent medications should be avoided. Non-fasting conditions are rarely acceptable for a minority of patients who can't tolerate the mentioned strict settings, emergency cases, and specific parameters that are not affected. Patients in the out-patient setting should be prohibited from excessive physical activity within 24 hours of blood collection.

Providing a clean, convenient, private, and well-designed environment, specifically in those patients who are planned for outpatient basis phlebotomy, should not be underestimated. A comfortable chair for both the patient and the provider should be prepared. The armrests of the patients' chair should be specifically adjusted to a convenient position and allowing appropriate action in case of patients' mishaps with vasovagal attacks.

Appropriate hygiene and disinfection strategies should be undertaken by washing hands with soap and other approved disinfectant solutions before proceeding with the procedure. The mentioned required pieces of equipment should be provided in a prepared tray in an organized and clean manner.

To respect absolute compatibility, a set of needles, tube holder, and blood tub from a similar manufacturer should be selected.

Despite the unclear effect of the role of personal protective equipment on the outcomes of blood sampling according to the latest Cochrane reviews, proceeding with the procedure with a new, unused pair of gloves and careful hand wash protocol both before and after the procedure for each patient is still recommended.

To prevent a prolonged tourniquet application, wearing gloves before tourniquet application might be recommended.methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for both patients and providers should be applied on almost 3 inches above the targetted venipuncture loci, and the tightness should be managed to halt the venous flow while maintaining the arterial blood flow.

Recommendations include utilizing venous illumination devices instead of a prolonged tourniquet application to visualize the non-prominent veins, especially if the need for equal or more than two tubes to be collected exists. The so-called devices have the advantage of preventing venous stasis with prolonged tourniquet application, which might negatively impact the results of several parameters, including biochemistry and coagulation factors.
