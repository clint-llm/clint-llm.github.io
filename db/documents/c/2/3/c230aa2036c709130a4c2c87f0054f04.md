As previously stated, ankle sprains are a common injury, which can lead to ligament attenuation of the lateral ankle and can further propagate ankle instability.  An injury to the lateral ankle can lead to both functional and mechanical instability of the ankle. Lateral ankle instability can also be caused by hereditary ligamentous conditions such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome and Turner’s syndrome.
