Left ventricular heart failure can result from a variety of pathologies such as ischemia, excessive peripheral demands, high output failure, volume overload, pressure, and volume overload, and primary muscle disease. Four determinants of left ventricular performance are an intrinsic decrease in muscle contractility, an increase in systemic afterload causing decreased cardiac output, increased preload that pushes fluid into the lungs causing pulmonary congestion, and increased heart rate associated with sympathetic tone.

Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when the heart contracts against a high pressure chronically. The high pressure can be attributed to conditions like hypertension or aortic stenosis. Over time, the heart adapts to this stress through myocyte hypertrophy. However, this process is a pathologic mechanism as the ventricular wall thickens, which decreases overall left ventricular function. On the contrary, non-pathologic hypertrophy can result from exercise where the myocytes increase in size but do not cause wall thickening associated with decreased ventricular function.
