An osteoid osteoma is a benign bone-forming tumor that has no potential to become malignant. It classically causes severe pain at night relieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.  Occasionally, it resolves without treatment.  If it is painful, initial treatment consists of anti-inflammatory medications.  The lesion can undergo surgical excision if conservative management fails to provide relief of symptoms.
