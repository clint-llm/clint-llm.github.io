- Sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker

- Severe hypotension(SBP<90 mm hg)

- Documented hypersensitivity to the drug

- Acute myocardial infarction and pulmonary congestion

- Concurrent administration of intravenous beta-blockers

- Wide complex ventricular tachycardia

- Atrial fibrillation or flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract (i.e., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)

- Second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker

- Cardiogenic shock

- According to ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines, in patients with HFrEF(heart failure with reduced ejection fraction) after acute myocardial infarction, diltiazem is associated with a higher risk of recurrent HF.

- Alcohol increases the rate of absorption of diltiazem hydrochloride. Alcohol increases the rate and extent of exposure to diltiazem controlled-release (CD) formulation and is associated with dose-related adverse reactions. Advise patients to avoid simultaneous consumption of alcohol with diltiazem CD.
