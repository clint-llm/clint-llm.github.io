Five-year mortality in patients with OIS is 40%, with myocardial infarction accounting for 67% of cases and cerebrovascular accidents for 19%.

The visual prognosis is also dismal, with about 50% of patients having worse than finger counting vision in a year after diagnosis. Patients with NVG has still worse prognosis with over 80% developing visionless than finger counting in three months. In a study, it was found that the duration of macular ischemia may be a better indicator of visual prognosis as compared to baseline visual acuity.
