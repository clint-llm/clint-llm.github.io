In males, LH stimulates testosterone release by the Leydig cells of the testes. In females, LH stimulates steroid release from the ovaries, ovulation, and the release of progesterone after ovulation by the corpus luteum

**Ovulation**

Ovulation is made possible due to the combined actions of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovary. The hypothalamus begins the process of ovulation by releasing GnRH in a pulsatile fashion. This pulsatile release causes the anterior pituitary to release LH and FSH, which then act on the ovarian follicle. This follicle is made up of 3 essential cells: theca cells, granulosa cells, and the oocyte. LH causes the theca cells to make androstenedione. Androstenedione then converts to estradiol via aromatase, which is stimulated by FSH. Upon achieving a critical concentration of estradiol, the negative feedback on LH that normally occurs by estrogen is shut off, and it begins to have positive feedback on LH release, which causes an “LH surge” which initiates ovulation. Once ovulation has occurred, the follicle becomes the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone and is stimulated by LH or hCG if a pregnancy occurs
