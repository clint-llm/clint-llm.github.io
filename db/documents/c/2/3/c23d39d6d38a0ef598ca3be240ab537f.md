Nipple discharge is fluid that leaks from one or both nipples of non-pregnant and non-breastfeeding women. Nipple discharge can at times be a complex diagnostic challenge for clinicians since it can be completely benign and due to excessive nipple stimulation, or can be a manifestation of a wide variety of diseases. With heightened public awareness of breast cancer, an increasing number of women are asking their health care providers about nipple discharge. Thus, clinicians must be knowledgeable regarding the best practices for evaluating nipple discharge. This activity reviews the causes of nipple discharge and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its workup and management.

- Identify the etiology of nipple discharge.
