Since scarlet fever is due to an infection caused by GAS, it is treated with antibiotics. Penicillin or amoxicillin is the first-line treatment. If the affected person has an allergy to penicillin, a first-generation cephalosporin, clindamycin, or erythromycin can be used. The use of antibiotics has reduced the morbidity and mortality of scarlet fever when compared to the early 20th century when the mortality was approximately 30%.

GAS has its reservoir in the nasal mucosa, adenoids, tonsils. Asymptomatic individuals who test positive for GAS are generally referred to as carriers. Current practice deters treatment of carriers with antibiotics.
