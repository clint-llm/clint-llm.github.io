Single ventricle heart syndromes are typically corrected through direct intervention, obfuscating the origin of certain complications. Expected complications of corrected single ventricle hearts are listed below:

- Arrhythmias

- Esophageal varices

- Heart failure with thrombus formation and increased risk of bleeding from treatment

- Increased risk for decompensation with anesthesia

- Long-term cyanosis

- Restrictive and diffusion-limited lung disease.

- Protein-losing enteropathy

- Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

- Reduced height and somatic development

- Renal dysfunction

- Systemic venous-to-pulmonary venous and systemic artery-to-pulmonary artery collaterals
