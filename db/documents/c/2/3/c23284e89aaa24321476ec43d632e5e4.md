It is imperative to obtain consent before performing a pelvic examination. Examinations should not take place against patient wishes, as this can constitute assault. In pediatric patients or mentally handicapped patients, consentÂ is necessary from their legal guardians. In these patients, an obstetrics and gynecology consult can be considered to perform an exam under sedation if there is a concern for patient distress. The majority of pediatric patients are manageable with same-day surgery.

The clinician should not perform a pelvic exam if there is suspicion of rape or assault if the patient or guardian has any desire to press charges. In this case, defer the pelvic exam to a specialized investigation team, as introducing anything into the vulva or vagina, even sterile lubrication, can interfere with specimen collection. This approach is a critical consideration in the pediatric population if there is any suspicion for physical or sexual abuse.
