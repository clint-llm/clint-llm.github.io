The most commonÂ etiology is nephrotic syndrome as it results in a hypercoagulable state. In patients who are nephrotic, the most common underlying nephropathy associated with RVT is membranous nephropathy, followed by minimal change disease, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

**Systemic**

- Primary hypercoagulability disorders (e.g., antithrombin III deficiency, protein C or S deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation)

- Antiphospholipid syndrome

- Postrenal transplant/allograft rejection

- Renal vasculitis

- Sickle cell nephropathy

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Amyloidosis

- Diabetic nephropathy

- Pregnancy or estrogen therapy

- Behcet syndrome

- Severe dehydration or prolonged hypotension (especially in neonates)

**Local**

- The malignant renal tumors, typically renal cell carcinoma that extends into the renal veins, are associated with thrombus in 4% to 25% of cases.

- Extrinsic compression of the renal vein or IVC due to a tumor, lymph nodes, retroperitoneal disease, or an aortic aneurysm

- Blunt abdominal trauma or trauma during venography
