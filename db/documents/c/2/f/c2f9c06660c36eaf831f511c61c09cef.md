The ventral rami of C5 through T1 form the brachial plexus, and the lateral and medial pectoral nerves arise from the lateral and medial cords, respectively.

The medial pectoral nerve communicates with other nerves to innervate certain structures. This is the case of the lateral and medial pectoral nerves, which together form a loop called the ansa pectoralis, through which the lateral pectoral nerve also contributes to the pectoralis minor muscle innervation.
