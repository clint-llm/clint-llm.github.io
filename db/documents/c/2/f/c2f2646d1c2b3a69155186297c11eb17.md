The three fundamental principles in MRI are:

- Accurate and reproducible image quality

- Good characterization of the disease process

- Comprehensive information for the area of interest

To achieve these principles, patient positioning is an essential step in the MRI. It is important to recognize the value of appropriate coil positioning as part of sequence optimization. The accurate patient position is deemed important in claustrophobic, pediatric, and other age groups.
