If an associated genetic syndrome is suspected as a cause of the Madelung deformity, such as Leri-Weill dyschondrosis, Turner syndrome, or multiple hereditary exostoses, a genetics consultation may be warranted. Due to the rarity of congenital Madelung deformity, referral to a hand or pediatric hand surgeon should be considered to discuss surgical options.
