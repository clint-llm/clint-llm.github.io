The signs and symptoms of an anembryonic pregnancy can potentially mirror those of an ectopic pregnancy. Anembryonic pregnancy is often incidentally noted on an initial first-trimester pregnancy sonogram. If an anembryonic pregnancy progresses to an early pregnancy loss, the patient can present with abdominal crampingÂ and vaginal bleeding. Early pregnancy loss in the setting of an anembryonic pregnancy can be clinically silent.
