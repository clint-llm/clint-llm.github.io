Perirectal abscesses often require surgical drainage even if they have ruptured or are already training. Therefore a general or colorectal surgeon should be consulted to evaluate the patient. Alternatively, an ED physician may perform the drainage procedure themselves.

If the abscess is recurrent or complicated, then a work-up for Crohn's disease or HIV should be performed with appropriate consultations to gastroenterology or an HIV management team as needed.
