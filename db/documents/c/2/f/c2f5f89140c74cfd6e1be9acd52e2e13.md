Osteopathic medicine (OM) was founded in America by the ideas and studies of Dr. A. T. Still in the late 1800s. The evaluation approach and manual treatment can be developed starting from the five osteopathic models: biomechanical-structural; respiratory-circulatory; neurological; metabolic-nutritional; behavioral-biopsychosocial. These models are not a constraint but a starting point; osteopathic models must always be integrated. The five diaphragms are part of the respiratory-circulatory model, where the focus is on improving the circulation of body fluids to improve the patient's health.

- Tentorium cerebelli. This meningeal structure is located in the posterior cranial fossa area. It has a semi-circular transverse septum shape, with a concave front edge and convex posterior edge; it separates the cerebral lobes from the cerebellum. The falx cerebri merges with this septum, while below is the falx cerebelli. Its path involves the internal occipital protuberance, the occipital bone, the parietal bone, and the temporal bone; inside, we find the superior petrosal sinuses and the sinus rectus for the venous outflow and the glymphatic system for the lymphatic outflow.

- Innervation: The supratentorial portion is innervated by the nervus tentorii, which is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve, involving, in particular, the tentorial notch and the area of the straight sinus and transverse sinus. Parasympathetic fibers innervate the supratentorial area, probably originating from the sphenopalatine ganglion, together with fibers deriving from venous and arterial blood vessels that nourish the meninges; sympathetic fibers derive from the middle meningeal artery (which derive from the stellate ganglion), which terminate in the supratentorial area. The afferents of the tentorium deriving from the nervus tentorii end their path in the dorsal horns at the level of C2; the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic afferents derive from the dural vascular plexus and terminate in the medullary area of C1-C3. The subtentorial area is involved by the roots of C1-C4, by sympathetic fibers deriving from the sympathetic trunk, and by some cranial nerves such as X (vagus), IX (glossopharyngeal), XII (hypoglossal). The literature describes other possible innervations, such as some branches of cranial nerves VII (facial), together with parasympathetic fibers, and fibers of the IV (trochlear with the tentorial segment) coming from arterial vessels.
- Myofascial relationships: The subtentorial area is involved by 3 of the 4 suboccipital muscles (rectus capitis posterior minor, oblique capitis inferior, rectus capitis posterior major), forming a myodural bridge; we must remember that the suboccipital muscles are part of the thoracolumbar myofascial system. Through a fibrous structure known by the name of to be named ligament (TBNL), the nuchal ligament has relations with the tentorium cerebelli.

- Tongue. The suprahyoid and sub-hyoid muscles influence the movements of the tongue and vice versa; equally, the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue work in synergy: one can speak of the lingual complex. The lingual complex affects the occipitocervical area, the anterior area of the cervical tract, and is involved in chewing, breathing, and other bodily functions. Intrinsic muscles: transversus and verticalis linguae, inferior longitudinalis, superior longitudinalis; extrinsic muscles: genioglossus, styloglossus, hyoglossus, palatoglossus, glossopharyngeus, chondroglossus.

- Innervation: At the central level, the tongue musculature is represented in specific areas, such as the limbic area, the somatosensory cortex, the medulla oblongata, and the midbrain area. The innervation concerns the XII cranial nerve (hypoglossal), the V (the lingual nerve that derives from a mandibular branch), parasympathetic branches (deriving from the mandibular ganglion). The lingual nerve and the XII are anastomosed within the lingual musculature (and in other areas). Cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) with parasympathetic branches innervates the tongue; the IX anastomoses with the parasympathetic branches, the XII, and the lingual nerve within the lingual musculature. Nerve VII (facial) provides afferent information of the tongue. Sympathetic-type fibers innervate the tongue, which fibers originate from the superior cervical ganglion—myofascial relationships. The lingual complex directly involves different muscles, such as the supra and sub-hyoid muscles, the masseter, the temporalis, the buccinator, the mylohyoid, the pterygoid, digastric, superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle; all the connective tissue of the craniocervical tract and up to the thoracic outlet is in communion with the lingual complex.

- Thoracic outlet. This structure contains musculoskeletal components: sternum, first two ribs, clavicle, scapula, first two thoracic vertebrae, trapezius muscle, subclavian muscle, pectoralis major and minor muscles, intercostal and deep musculature of the dorso-cervical tract, and scalene muscles. We find three narrow passages for the brachial vascular-nerve package (C1-T1): anterior and middle scalene muscle, clavicle-first rib, and pectoralis minor muscle. This location also contains aspects of the sympathetic system, particularly the stellate ganglion and the vagus nerve with its parasympathetic component. The thoracic outlet region contains the fusion of the cervical bands with the thoracic bands and the passage of some visceral structures, including the pleural dome.

- Diaphragm. The diaphragm muscle involves the terminal portion of the sternum (xiphoid process), the last six ribs, the vertebral bodies anteriorly of the dorsal-lumbar vertebrae (T11-L4), the transverse processes of L1. The vena cava, the esophagus, the aorta, the azygos, and hemizygous veins cross the muscle, as well as the lymphatic system (Quilo cistern). The innervation comes from the phrenic nerve and the vagus nerve, with components of the sympathetic system (subdiaphragmatic ganglia). The diaphragm directly involves the abdominal muscles, the psoas muscle, the quadratus lumborum muscle, as well as the entire fascial continuum of the thorax, abdomen, and back-lumbar area.

- Pelvic floor. It is a muscle complex formed by the levator ani muscle, three muscle groups (puborectal, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus muscles), and the ischiococcygeus muscle. Furthermore, the gluteus maximus muscle is part of the levator ani muscle via a fascial septum at the level of the posterior ischioanal fossa. The pelvic floor area involves the abdominopelvic cavity, pubic symphysis, coccyx. The innervation of these muscles derives from S2-S4 (pudendal nerve) and the nucleus of Onuf (sacral spinal cord). The parasympathetic fibers derive from the S2-S4 area; sympathetic fibers derive from the lumbar chain. The pelvic floor is affected by different bands, such as the transversalis fascia, prevertebral fascia, iliac fascia, pectineal fascia, thoracolumbar fascia. Other contractile districts are involved via fascial connections, such as the adductor muscles, the tensor fascia lata, and the pyramidalis muscle. Below the pelvic floor, we find a triangular fascial formation, known as the urogenital diaphragm.

During a quiet inhalation, a central pattern generator (CPG) comes into action, which components are found in the brainstem and spinal cord. The XII nerve is activated in the pre-inhalation and inspiratory phase to dilate the upper airways, undergoing a double movement: the hyoid portion is tractioned towards the front, while the posterior and upper portion is brought caudally and posteriorly. The sensation that the person feels is that of bringing the tongue back during the inhalation.

During the continuation of the inhalation phase, the phrenic nerve activates the diaphragm muscle; the vagus nerve manages the area of the esophageal hiatus (depending on whether there is a food bolus or not), the external intercostal muscles contract; tendentially, the abdominal muscles, the internal intercostal muscles, and the pelvic floor muscles are inhibited by the CPG, although the basic muscle tone remains in them.

The pelvic floor musculature descends, mirroring the movement of the diaphragm muscle. The opposite of the movements described happens during the exhale. When the diaphragm moves, all the myofascial systems of the five diaphragms are in tension (elongated and shortened), just as all bodily fluids are stimulated in their movements.
