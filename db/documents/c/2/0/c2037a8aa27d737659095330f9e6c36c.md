Select clinical pearls regarding TCP include:

- Careful patient selection is paramount as the risks associated with certain types of TCP outweigh the benefits.

- TCP should be used when maximum medical therapy, including cardioversion when appropriate, has failed.

- Assuming that electrical capture is equivalent to ventricular or mechanical capture is one of the most significant pitfalls in TCP. Electrical activity in the form of a QRS complex is sometimes present without subsequent ventricular contractions. TTCP is especially prone to this due to the chest wall impedance and greater depth of the ventricles from the pacing pads. Ensure mechanical capture is present by confirming a pulse that matches the set pacemaker rate by palpation, echocardiogram, pulse oximetry, or arterial waveform. Check for signs of mechanical capture as mentioned above and re-evaluate them frequently, especially after transfers, procedures, or repositioning.

- Another pitfall related to TTCP is basing capture on the ECG waveform of a separate cardiac monitor. Many defibrillators/pulse generators require the placement of their own ECG electrodes, and any decision about electrical capture should have their basis in ECG waveforms on the defibrillator/pulse generator itself, rather than a separate cardiac monitor.

- TTVP catheter placement should be confirmed by a chest X-ray. Continuous echocardiography may also be useful to confirm lead placement.
