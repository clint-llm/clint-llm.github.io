Ipecac, or syrup of ipecac (SOI), is a medication once used to induce vomiting. Its medical use has virtually vanished, and it is no longer recommended for routine use in toxic ingestion. The abuse of SOI as a purgative in eating disorders, however, is increasing.

Ipecac is commonly made from alcohol extraction of the plants Cephaelis acuminata and Cephaelis ipecacuanha. The extract is commonly mixed with glycerin, sugar (syrup), and methylparaben. The active ingredients are plant alkaloids, cephaeline, and methyl-cephaeline (emetine).

Paradoxically, ipecac is itself a poison. Because it promptly induces vomiting, however, there is little concern for its intrinsically poisonous nature. Emetine, a component of ipecac, has been found to have antihelminthic and antiamoebic properties.
