Posner and Schlossman first published a series of nine patients with the characteristic presentation of unique glaucoma, with open anterior angles of the anterior chamber, associated with unilateral acute elevations in intraocular pressure (IOP) in 1948.

PSS is therefore classified as inflammatory glaucoma. These episodes or attacks could eventually result in secondary chronic glaucoma.

The clinical course of the disease tends to exhibit a variable pattern, and a patient could have frequent attacks with shorter symptom-free intervals or less frequent attacks with more prolonged symptom-free intervals. In-between episodes, the patient has a normal IOP. Whatever the case, the symptoms are self-limiting, with spontaneous resolution within days or weeks, even without treatment.
