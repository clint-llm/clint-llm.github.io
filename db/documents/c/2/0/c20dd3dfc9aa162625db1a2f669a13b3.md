Spasticity is a motor disorder marked by a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone or tonic stretch reflexes associated with hypertonia.

Colloquially, it is often referred to as “tightness” or “stiffness.”  Spasticity can present variably in a clinical setting, sometimes with a subtle neurological manifestation and, other times, with severely increased muscle tone leading to immobility of joints.
