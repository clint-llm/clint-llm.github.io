The management of MPS II patients requires a holistic approach. A team of specialists including pediatrician, neurologist, orthopedic surgeon, otolaryngologist, cardiologist, speech therapist, physiotherapist, pulmonologist, and child psychiatrist treats the wide spectrum of clinical symptoms of patient's with Hunter disease. Surgical treatment might be required for joint mobility and cardiac valves replacement. Patients should have a regular follow-up with an otolaryngologist. Recurrent middle ear infections may require placement of ear tubes. MPS II patients usually undergo adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy to relieve airway narrowing. Patients require oxygen supplementation and positive airway pressure for sleep apnea in severe cases.

Primary care physicians and specialists should have good communication to improve patient outcomes with this condition. Each specialist should follow up with the patient regularly for early diagnosis and correction of relevant complications. Geneticists should provide genetic counseling to the patient and their families. Interdisciplinary collaboration is pivotal to good patient outcomes in MPS II patients.
