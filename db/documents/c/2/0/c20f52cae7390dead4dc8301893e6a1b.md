Inflammatory breast cancer is associated with very poor prognosis and a high risk of early recurrence. The current evidence suggests that for the same stage of locally advanced breast cancer, inflammatory breast cancer has a poorer prognosis. The factors which suggest poor prognosis are negative receptor status, 4 or more lymph node involvement at the time of presentation, and lack of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. With the advent of tri-modality treatment, current overall 5-year survival rates range from 30% to 70%.
