Counseling patients to avoid tyramine containing foods when taking MAOIs remains standard of care. Patients on MAOI should be instructed to keep a record of their blood pressures. Maintaining a high index of suspicion and inquiring about tyramine consumption containing foods in hypertensive patients on MAOIs can aid in diagnosis. The physiologic effects of irreversible MAOIs such as tranylcypromine, phenelzine, and selegiline can persist for up to 3 weeks, and tyramine avoidance should continue during that time. Dietary counseling for patients taking MAOIs should begin before therapy, continue during follow-up to monitor compliance, and include

- Education on a low tyramine diet with consumption of only fresh foods

- Identification and avoidanceÂ of high tyramine foods

- Instructions to begin the diet before MAOI therapy and continue for four weeks after stopping MAOIs

Tyramine has been implicated as a potential migraine trigger.
