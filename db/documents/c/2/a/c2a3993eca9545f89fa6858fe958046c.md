Most of the treatment of adhesive disease is centered around the manifestations of symptoms, such as bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions. The initial treatment of these patients includes intravenous fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement. A surgical consult should also be obtained for possible surgery (adhesiolysis) if necessary. Oral intake should be minimized in outpatient situations, and those requiring hospitalization should have nothing by mouth. Generally, imaging in the form of plain film and/or CT scan is performed for evaluation of the obstruction. Any evidence of complete bowel obstruction, closed-loop obstruction, ischemia, necrosis, or perforation on imaging is an indication for immediate surgery.

Often nasogastric (NG) tube placement is necessary for bowel decompression and the management of nausea and vomiting.

Nonoperative management of bowel obstruction can often be successful.

Other indications for surgical intervention include increasing abdominal pain, ongoing high output from NG tube, new instability of vital signs, or increased inflammatory markers such as lactic acid or white blood cell count. Diagnosis of these complications of obstruction is based on clinical and radiological examination and if suspected the patient should be taken to the operating room for abdominal exploration in a timely fashion.

Definitive management for bowel adhesions causing symptoms is laparoscopy or laparotomy with adhesiolysis. As mentioned previously, these procedures are not without risks, and full disclosure of risks vs. benefit should be undertaken with the patient/family when feasible. There is strong evidence that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) with laparoscopy/robotic surgery can prevent the formation of adhesions compared to open (laparotomy) and should be attempted if possible.

Patients with a chronic disease process such as those with infertility suspected to be due to adhesions or inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or ulcerative colitis) may be observed and at times, followed as an outpatient.

**Operative Care**

- Gentle tissue handling: meticulous hemostasis and gentle, minimal tissue handling are paramount. Preventing serosal injury by minimizing trauma, excess bleeding, and ischemia, and keeping the surgical field moist is recommended.

- Laparotomy sponges are abrasive and should be avoided. When abdominal or pelvic packing is required, place laparotomy sponges in sterile plastic bags or drapes to minimize tissue injury and adhesion formation.

- Preventing foreign body reaction to excess suture, lint, or talc minimizes fibrin deposition. Silk sutures should be avoided as they are fibrogenic.

- Adhesion occurrence is similar regardless of the closure of the peritoneum after laparotomy.

- MIS techniques minimize tissue handling and create smaller abdominal incisions, both of which minimize bowel adhesions. However, this does not guarantee the prevention of adhesions; and longer surgery time and higher insufflation pressure can increase the risk of adhesions.
