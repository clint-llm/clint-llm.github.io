Salicylate toxicity is a medical emergency. Intentional ingestion or accidental overdose can cause severe metabolic derangements, making treatment difficult. Co-ingestion of other medications can further complicate management. Salicylates are widely available over the counter medications. They are commonly used for their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-thrombotic properties, and toxicity can occur due to acute ingestion or from chronic ingestion. Salicylates can be compounded into formulations with other classes of medications including narcotics, antihistamines, and anticholinergic medications. This can complicate management. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of salicylate toxicity and reviews the role of interprofessional team members in managing patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the common presenting features associated with salicylate toxicity. 
- Describe the metabolic derangements that may be seen in patients with salicylate toxicity. 
- Outline the principles of managing a patient with salicylate toxicity. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by salicylate toxicity.
