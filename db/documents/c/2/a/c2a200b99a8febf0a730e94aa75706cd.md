According to the TLGS study done in Tehran, the incidence of pre-HTN in older age groups and has higher numbers of cardiovascular risk factors in both females and males. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), age and body mass index (BMI) are considered significant predictors of preHTN. In both females and males, incidence of pre HTN is higher in those with higher BMI, are older in age, has higher blood pressure (both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure), has higher total cholesterol, has higher triglyceride, has higher fasting blood glucose, and higher homeostasis model assessment- insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In this study, it was also found that people with lower eGFR, lower 2-hour post-challenge plasma glucose are an independent predictor only in men. While diastolic blood pressure and waist-to-hip ratio were significant predictors only in women.
