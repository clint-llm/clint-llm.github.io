Within the thoracic cavity, the lungs are separated from the thoracic wall by the visceral and parietal pleurae.  Between these two layers exists a potential space called the pleural cavity.  It is clinically significant, as pathologic processes can result in fluid accumulations within this space.  The pleural cavity also maintains a negative intrapleural pressure, which resists the lungs’ natural tendency to collapse and facilitates proper function during respiration.
