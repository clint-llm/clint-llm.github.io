**Hypermagnesemia: Serum Magnesium Concentration Greater Than 2.6 mg/dL**

- HypermagnesemiaÂ is a potential effect of administering magnesium. If too much magnesium is administered too quickly, hypermagnesemia may ensue.

- Symptoms include vasodilation causing flushing, hypotension, hyporeflexia, and respiratory depression. With a magnesium concentration above 6 mg/dL, ECG changes can consist of PR prolongation, widening of QRS, and peaked T waves. Cardiac arrest occurs whenever levels are above 15 mg/dL.

- Hypermagnesemia is less common than hypomagnesemia. The most significant cause of hypermagnesemia is renal failure causing increased retention of magnesium. It can also occur in the overuse of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids.

- Treatment for hypermagnesemia includes calcium gluconate, diuresis, or dialysis. It is important to maintain circulatory and respiratory support for those with severe hypermagnesemia. IV furosemide is the diuretic of choice, as it increases magnesium excretion.
