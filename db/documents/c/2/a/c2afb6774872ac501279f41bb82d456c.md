A genetic cause of this syndrome has been identified for both variants due to homogenous or heterogenous CHRNG gene mutations, which encode the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) gamma subunit on chromosome 2q37.Â In addition, genomewide linkage testing of some families also detected a locus on chromosome 2q36.

The identified germline-inactivating mutation of the AChR gamma subunits suggests the role of acetylcholine receptor dysfunction in the etiology of both types of MPS. Dysfunction of the receptor leads to AChR protein malfunction, interrupting communication between nerve cells and muscle cells in the developing fetus. The absence of signaling between the nerves and muscles causes absent or reduced fetal movements and pterygia in-utero. Also, the impaired signaling contributes to several findings of MPS.
