A 12-lead electrocardiogram should be performed to look for QT-prolongation, QRS-widening, or any arrhythmias. Blood gas and a chemistry panel should be ordered, in addition to a complete blood count, liver panel, and prothrombin time.Â  As with any other potentially toxic ingestion, the physician should screen for co-ingested substances. While a specific nicotinic acid level can be ordered, the results will not come back in time to alter management, and should not be relied on to make the diagnosis. There is rarely an imaging study that would have any utility in the diagnosis of niacin toxicity. Finally, it is important to remember that a diagnosis of niacin toxicity should be one of exclusion.
