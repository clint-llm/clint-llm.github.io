Pyridoxine is the emergency antidote for isoniazid (INH) overdose, ethylene glycol, hydralazine, and gyromitrin mushroom poisoning.Â  The two most common uses of vitamin B6 are in the treatment of toxicological emergencies: INH and ethylene glycol overdoses. In INH overdose-related seizure, the dose is 5 grams in adults and 1 gram in children unless the amount of INH is specifically known. Pyridoxine can be given at a rate of 0.5 to 1 gram/minute until seizures stop or maximum dose given. Patients who are asymptomatic and have not had seizures after potentially toxic ingestion of isoniazid within 2 hours should receive the recommended dose of pyridoxine. In ethylene glycol overdose, vitamin B6 is recommended at 50 to 100 mg IV every 6 hours to facilitate shunting the metabolism of ethylene glycol to nontoxic pathways leading to glycine (nontoxic) instead of toxic pathways leading to toxic metabolites such as formate.
