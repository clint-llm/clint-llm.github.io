Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM), a rare pulmonary condition, is defined as a structurally abnormal communication between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein, creating a pathologic intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt.

A vast majority of patients with PAVMs can be asymptomatic; however, patients that remain undiagnosed can later present with life-threatening complications such as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarctions, cerebral abscesses, massive hemoptysis, and hemothorax.
