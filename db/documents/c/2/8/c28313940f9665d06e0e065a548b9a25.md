A medication administration route is often classified by the location at which the drug is administered, such as oral or intravenous. The choice of routes in which the medication is given depends not only on convenience and compliance but also on the drugâ€™s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profile. Therefore it is crucial to understand the characteristics of the various routes and associated techniques. Many interprofessional healthcare team members are involved in administering medications to patients.
