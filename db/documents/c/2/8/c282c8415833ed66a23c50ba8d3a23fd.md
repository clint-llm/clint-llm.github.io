The styloid process is surrounded by various nerves. On the medial aspect, particularly surrounding the internal jugular vein, one will find the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), the vagus nerve (CN X), and the accessory nerve (CN XI). Lateral to the styloid process is the facial nerve (CN VII) and the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII). The facial nerve exits the skull from the stylomastoid foramen, which is directly posterior to the styloid process; however, it passes lateral to the process as it pierces through the parotid gland prior to splitting into its subsequent branches.
