Five-year survival of hepatocellular carcinoma is 18% and second to pancreatic cancer. The prognosis of patients with HCC is dependent on the tumor size, differentiation or grade of the tumor on histopathology, severity of the underlying liver disease, presence or absence of metastases, and tumor extension to adjacent structures. HCC with high levels of alpha-fetoprotein is associated with poorly differentiated HCC and confers a poor prognosis.
