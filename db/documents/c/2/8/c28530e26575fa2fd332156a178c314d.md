The following medications can affect different levels of conduction delay:

- Increased parasympathetic tone, digoxin (which upgrades vagotonic action), calcium channel blockers (which obstructs the inward calcium current responsible for depolarization) and beta-blockers can affect the AV node

- Medications such as procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide can block sodium channels and delay conduction in the bundle of His

- Similarly though rarely, medications such as procainamide, quinidine, and disopyramide can also delay infra-Hisian conduction system
