The posterior radial collateral artery, a branch of the profunda brachii artery, is used as a pedicle in lateral arm flaps.  The pedicle of a skin flap is the narrow base of the flap that is left connected to its original site and provides blood supply during grafting.

Surgeons perform the free lateral arm flap procedure when there is a defect in skin coverage of the forearm or hand that necessitates fat and skin coverage.  This procedure allows for a skin flap that can be up to five centimeters wide and span from the lateral epicondyle to the insertion of the deltoid muscle.  The flap is disconnected from its blood supply at the distal portion and elevated proximally, where it is left intact with the posterior radial collateral artery.  At this point, the surgeon can relocate the flap to the primary defect.
