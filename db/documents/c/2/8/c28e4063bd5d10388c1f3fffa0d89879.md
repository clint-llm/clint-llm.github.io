Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is one of three major transport proteins, which are primarily responsible for binding to and transporting thyroid hormones to the necessary tissues.  The other two serum transport proteins include transthyretin and human serum albumin.  While there are higher amounts of albumin in serum, TBG has a greater affinity to thyroxine (T4).
