The median lethal dose of VX for humans is approximately 6 to 10 milligrams by dermal exposure. Absorption is rapid (seconds to minutes) by inhalation but is significantly slower (minutes to hours) by dermal exposure. V-series nerve agents are odorless and tasteless. Biologic half-lives of V-series agents in humans are dependent on the dose administered as well as numerous other factors.
