Patients and their families should direct questions to their interprofessional team. The team will provide information on the most likely etiology of the enuresis. Parents will be provided the risk, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options.

Parents should be provided psychoeducation that enuresis is common, not volitional, and resolves with time.Â Parents should be aware that children can develop stress and lowered self-esteem due to punishment or shame from enuresis. Parents should avoid blaming their children for enuresis. Parents should limit the intake of fluids in the evening. Children should be encouraged to go to the bathroom frequently during the day and before bedtime.
