There are many different ways to stage sacral decubitus ulcers. The most widely accepted classification system is the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) system.

The stages are as follows:

- Stage I: The skin is intact with the presence of non-blanchable erythema.

- Stage II: There is partial-thickness skin loss involving the epidermis and dermis.

- Stage III: There is a full-thickness loss of skin that extends to the subcutaneous tissue but does not cross the fascia beneath it. The lesion may be foul-smelling.

- Stage IV: There is full-thickness skin loss extending through the fascia with considerable tissue loss. There might be possible involvement of the muscle, bone, tendon, or joint.
