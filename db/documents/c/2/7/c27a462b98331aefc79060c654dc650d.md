Physicians and nurses work together to review the fetal heart tracing when employing electronic fetal monitoring during labor. In a patient without complications, they should review the tracing every 30 minutes during the first stage of labor and then every 15 minutes in the second stage. For patients with complications, it is recommended to review the fetal heart tracing every 15 minutes for the first stage and every 5 minutes during the second stage of labor. Providers should periodically document review of the tracing.

One study looked at the implementation of a fetal monitor safety nurse. They found that the nurses in the safety role felt more comfortable notifying peers about fetal heart rate concerns and that they perceived an overall safety benefit to having a designated nurse who was free of patient care to assess fetal heart tracings continuously. However, the nurses felt that staffing measures were lacking to support the role, especially during times of high acuity and high census.

Despite the ambiguity surrounding fetal monitoring, physicians and nursing (and ideally, neonatal specialty nurses) must work collaboratively, particularly in cases with variable decelerations, so that both mother and baby can receive the best care and the therapeutic direction taken is the best possible choice.
