Guidelines for this neuroendocrine malignancy and others can be found at the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which emphasize the need for an interprofessional approach for better outcomes. The management of thymic NETs requires the participation of thoracic surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and nursing staff. Because of the high recurrence rate and aggressive behavior of these tumors, lifelong surveillance might be recommended in specific cases.
