The mechanism of TPP involves two major factors: the occurrence of hypokalemia and associated muscle paralysis. Skeletal muscles house the largest share of total body potassium in the body (2600mmol) and play a vital role in maintaining extracellular potassium homeostasis. This balance is maintained by the sarcolemmal Na-K ATPase pumps and K channels. The former regulates the intracellular movement of potassium, whereas the latter, including the inward rectifying (Kir) and delayed rectifying potassium channels, regulates the extracellular movement of potassium.

Thyrotoxicity can contribute to hypokalemia by a direct increase in the genetic transcription of genes coding for the Na-K ATPase pump as well as an increase in the pump's intrinsic activity.

Hyperinsulinemia seen in attacks of TPP may also contribute to a depletion in extracellular potassium.
