The function of the carotid sheath is to separate and help protect the vital structures within it. It facilitates the passage of intrathoracic structures through the neck to terminate in the head and face. It is a fibrous connective tissue sheath encircling several key structures within the neck.

- Common carotid artery

- Internal carotid artery

- Internal jugular vein

- Glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX)

- Vagus nerve (cranial nerve X)

- Accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI)

- Hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII)

- Sympathetic plexus of nerves

- Deep cervical lymph nodes

The carotid sheath is located posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and is a part of the deep cervical fascia of the neck. Superiorly, the carotid sheath encircles the margins of the carotid canal and the jugular fossa at the skull base. From here, it extends downwards, terminating at the aortic arch. It is divided in the craniocaudal direction into two regions, the suprahyoid and infrahyoid spaces, the boundary between which is the bifurcation of the common carotid artery.

The immediate relations of the carotid sheath are the pharynx medially, the parotid gland laterally (in the suprahyoid region), the infratemporal fossa anteriorly (in the suprahyoid region), and the prevertebral fascia posteriorly.
