Glycogen is an extensively branched glucose polymer that animals use as an energy reserve. It is the animal analog to starch. Glycogen does not exist in plant tissue. It is highly concentrated in the liver, although skeletal muscles contain the most glycogen by weight. It is also present in lower levels in other tissues, such as the kidney, heart, and brain.
