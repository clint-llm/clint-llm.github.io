**Patient Education**

Because phenazopyridine is available as an OTC product, there is an opportunity for misuse and abuse. Effective patient education is important.

Although some uncomplicated lower UTIs spontaneously resolve and even have a bacteriological cure, the cure rate is comparatively low. It is well documented that appropriate antibiotic treatment results in faster symptom resolution and bacteriological cure than placebo.

In two surveys of OTC phenazopyridine purchasers in Los Angeles County, 71% of respondents were unaware their symptoms were from a bladder infection or UTI, and 38% reported buying the drug as a substitution for medical care.

Because phenazopyridine is a dye, the drug will change the urine color to a reddish-orange color. The color change is from the drug and is not a symptom of bleeding. Any spilled urine may result in staining, especially on clothing. Inappropriately prolonged use may result in a yellowing of the skin and sclera. The drug is also reported to change the color of tears and ejaculate and stain contact lenses. Patients should also report any urinary tract symptoms that do not resolve or worsen.
