Women who experience a molar pregnancy, whether complete or incomplete, should be counseled as to the risk for the development of choriocarcinoma. These patients should be monitored closely for resolution of their hCG levels. Any woman who has given birth, but particularly if she is a high risk, should be counseled to return for continued post-partum bleeding.
