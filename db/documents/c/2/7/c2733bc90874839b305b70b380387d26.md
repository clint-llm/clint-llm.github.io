Antiplatelet drug therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists. These professionals must all collaborate and engage in open communication as an interprofessional team to achieve optimal patient results.

The choice of an antiplatelet agent depends on the clinical situation. Because of the availability of a large number of antiplatelet agents, the ordering/prescribing clinician should consult with a cardiology or pharmacotherapy specialized pharmacist. When prescribing these agents, the pharmacist should review the patient's medication list as well as past diagnoses to determine if specific agents are recommended or contraindicated. Communication between the clinical provider and the pharmacists is essential to minimize adverse outcomes for patients when using these drugs. A cardiac pharmacist can offer direction regarding agent selection, drug-drug interactions, dose verification, and overall medication reconciliation for high-risk patients.

The role of the cardiac nurse administering these medications in the acute setting involves monitoring for any acute adverse symptoms and patient education in regards to the same. Prompt communication by the astute nursing staff of an adverse reaction or a complication can significantly reduce patient morbidity and mortality.

Nurses are often the first healthcare provider to verify the therapeutic effectiveness of these agents and to monitor for adverse effects. This role becomes crucial in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, as is often the case for the prevention of stent thrombosis or after an ACS event. The specialty-trained nurse not only educates the patient on possible complications but also regarding the indications for the prescribed therapy as well as the need for adherence to the medication treatment regimen. The nurse should communicate with the clinical provider and the pharmacist if noting any adverse reaction or if there is a concern for patient adherence with drug therapy so that alternative therapies can be considered. An interprofessional approach, with a multifaceted and targetted approach to treatment, is necessary to improve patient outcomes with antiplatelet medications. [Level 5]
