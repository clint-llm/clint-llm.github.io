Hematogenous dissemination is the primary route of spread for vertebral osteomyelitis.Â This differs from extremity infection where direct inoculation through adjacent skin ulcers is the more common form of pathogen dissemination. Vertebral osteomyelitis can also originate from iatrogenic infection following spinal surgery and spinal procedures including facet or epidural injections for pain management. Once infectious pathogens have access to the vertebral column, the infection can spread to adjacent paraspinal tissues, nerve roots, epidural space, and even the intradural space; this creates inflammation, abscesses, and both soft tissue and osseous destruction.

The majority of infections involve the vertebral body and only 5% of cases involve the posterior structures of the spine. This disparity is chiefly due to the excellent blood supply of the vertebral bodies. Besides the arterial route of spread, retrograde seeding of venous blood via the Batson plexus can also spread the infection to the spinal cord. In rare cases, the infection may spread in a continuous fashion from the retropharyngeal space to the vertebral body.
