**Scapholunate Dissociation**

Patients with scapholunate dissociation have a better prognosis if treated early, prior to the onset of degenerative changes. In one study, 83% of patients who received treatment within three months of a scapholunate ligament tear remained symptom-free and maintained scapholunate joint reduction over a 7-year follow-up period.

**Lunotriquetral Dissociation**

Patients with acute lunotriquetral ligament injuries who undergo arthroscopic debridement can expect symptomatic improvement, especially if there is only a partial tear. Patients with chronic injuries are more likely to require some type of procedure, as a prior study demonstrated that only 25% of patients with chronic injuries had symptom improvement with immobilization.
