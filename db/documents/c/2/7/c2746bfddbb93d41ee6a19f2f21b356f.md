Uremic encephalopathy is an absolute indication to start renal replacement therapy. Hence, early diagnosis of UE is essential. Uremic encephalopathy is a clinical syndrome with a variable and subtle presentation. There is no confirmatory test, which leads to a delay in diagnosis. During the evaluation, it is essential to exclude conditions that may mimic UE, such as infection, osmotic demyelination, subdural hematomas, hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular accidents, and disequilibrium syndrome, among others.

**Laboratory Evaluation**

There is no specific confirmatory test to diagnose uremic encephalopathy. Renal function tests reveal markedly elevated BUN and creatinine levels in uremic encephalopathy.

**Neurological Evaluation**

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is non-diagnostic. Often an EEG is performed in patients to exclude underlying seizures. EEG findings in UE include a loss of alpha frequency waves and slowing overall and intermittent bursts of theta and delta waves with slow background activity. These findings are non-specific. EEG wave slowing is directly proportional to the worsening renal function. After initiation of dialysis, the EEG changes stabilize but may not come back to baseline. Some improvement may occur over several months.

**Cognitive Tests**

Cognitive tests that can be employed are the trail-making test, which measures psychomotor speed; the short-term memory test; and the choice reaction time test, which measures simple decision-making.

**Neuroimaging**

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain can exclude focal lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in uremic patients show widespread involvement of the brain.

- Cortical and subcortical involvement. Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) may also be present at the same time.

- Bilateral basal ganglia involvement is seen in diabetic patients.

- White matter involvement only, which is rare.

The presence of PRES in imaging studies performed for UE suggests a close relationship between vascular dysfunction and neuronal dysfunction, as described in the pathogenesis of UE. A published case demonstrated that the MRI changes of increased signal intensity are reversible after several intermittent hemodialyses (IHD) compared to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). MRI changes involve multiple brain areas, and currently, there is no evidence to delineate the reversible and non-reversible changes in functional imaging. In general, dialysis must be adequate.
