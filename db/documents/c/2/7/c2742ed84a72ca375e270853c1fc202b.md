**Blood Supply**

Blood enters the external iliac arteries via the common iliac arteries which arise from the bifurcation of the distal abdominal aorta. Branches of the external iliac arteries include the inferior epigastric arteries and deep circumflex iliac arteries. The majority of the blood flow continues through the lumen of the external iliac artery past the inguinal ligament and into the common femoral artery.

**Lymphatics**

Eight to ten external iliac lymph nodes surround the external iliac arteries in three groups: lateral, medial, and anterior. The lymph node afferents include deep lymphatics of the abdominal wall, adductor region of the thigh, glans penis, glans clitoris, membranous urethra, prostate, the fundus of the bladder, cervix, and upper portion of the vagina. The medial group of nodes contains medial, external, and obturator nodes. Obturator nodes have clinical significance as a common “landing zone” for prostatic cancer metastasis.
