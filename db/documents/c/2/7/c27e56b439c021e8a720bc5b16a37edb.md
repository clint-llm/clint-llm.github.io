Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum, third-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Levofloxacin is a safe and effective medicine on the World Health Organization's essential medicines list. It****was patented in 1987 and subsequently received FDA approval in 1996 for medical use in the United States.

**FDA-approved Indications of Levofloxacin**

- Nosocomial Pneumonia

- Community-Acquired Pneumonia

- Skin and Skin Structure Infections Complicated and Uncomplicated

- Chronic bacterial prostatitis

- Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

- Acute Bacterial Sinusitis

- Inhalational Anthrax, Post-Exposure in adult and pediatric patients

- Plague in adult and pediatric patients

- Urinary Tract Infections (UTI)

- Bacterial conjunctivitis(Ophthalmic formulation)

**Non-FDA Approved Indications**

Due to an increased risk of severe side effects (e.g., tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects), levofloxacin is used in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, acute bacterial sinusitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who do not have alternative treatment options.

To decrease the development of drug-resistant bacteria, the FDA has recommended using levofloxacin only****for strongly suspected bacterial infections. Also, levofloxacin****should not be used empirically in patients at risk of multidrug-resistantEscherichia coli.enterobacterales), AmpC-E (AmpC β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales), or stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mild infection).
