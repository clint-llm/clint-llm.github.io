Trypanosomiasis is generally used to refer to African human trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness. African sleeping sickness is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and transmitted by the tsetse fly. This disease is distinct from Chagas disease, which is also known as American trypanosomiasis and is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by the Reduuvid insect vector. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of both African and American trypanosomiasis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of African and American trypanosomiasis
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with African versus American trypanosomiasis.
- Review the treatment and management options for African versus American trypanosomiasis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes for patients with trypansomiasis.
