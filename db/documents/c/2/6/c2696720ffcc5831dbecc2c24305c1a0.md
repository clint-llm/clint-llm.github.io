All penicillins share the same core beta-lactam and thiazolidine ring structures but differ in their side chains. The ring structure is metabolized into major (penicilloyl) and minor (penicillin, penicilloate, and penilloate) antigenic determinates. Immediate reactions are the result of IgE that cross-like on mast cells when exposed to the antigenic component. The result is degranulation and release of histamine as well as other vasoactive substances. It is the minor antigenic determinates that generate IgE specific responses that are associated with true penicillin allergy. These minor determinates result in immediate reactions, within minutes to 1 hour, and characterized by signs and symptoms of acute anaphylaxis such as urticaria, flushing, dyspnea, bronchospasm with wheezing, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, mental status change or gastrointestinal (GI) upset. The major antigenic determinates more commonly are associated with less severe urticarial reactions.

Delayed reactions are mediated by IgM and IgG which activates the complement system resulting in inflammatory reactions that include Type 2 to 4 hypersensitivity reactions. Serious hypersensitivity reactions include hemolytic anemia, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Steven's Johnson Syndrome (SJS), vasculitis, interstitial nephritis, serum sickness, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.
