The evaluation of immediate hypersensitivity includes obtaining a complete blood cell count, assessment of immunoglobulin IgE and skin prick test.

**Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins**

- IgM, IgG, and IgA

**Total Leukocyte Count and Differential**

- Hb (decreased in autoimmune hemolytic anemia)

- Eosinophilia

- Lymphocyte studies (CD4/CD8 count and suppressor T cells count that may be lower than the standard value)

**Allergic test**

- Skin prick tests utilizing various allergens from animal, plants, food, pathogens and environmental pollutants

- The radioallergosorbent test (RAST): Use to determine specific IgE antibodies

**Other tests**

- Serum protein electrophoresis (to rule out IgE myeloma)

- Stool examination (for intestinal parasitism)

- Appropriate exclusion diet and blinded provocation (for food allergy diagnostic clarification)

- Chest X-ray (in bronchial asthma)
