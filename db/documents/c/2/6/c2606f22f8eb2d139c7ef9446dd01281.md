If the specimen collection is not sterile, multiple organisms can contaminate the specimen. Similarly, improper specimen collection and prior use of antibiotics can interfere with the growth of organisms. During the interpretation of the Gram stain, as described by the World Health Organization in 2003, the following steps should be followed:

**1. General nature of the smear requires analysis under low power magnification (10X)**

- The background of the slide should generally be gram-negative or clear

- White blood cells when present should stain gram-negative

- Thin crystal violet or gentian violent precipitates should not be confused as gram-positive bacillus bacteria

- The smear should be one cell thick with no overlapping of cells

**2. Low power magnification should be utilized to note the following:**

- Relative numbers of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), mononuclear cells and red blood cells (RBCs)

- Relative numbers of squamous epithelial cells, and normal microbiota bacteria

- Location, arrangement, and shape of the organisms

**3. Oil immersion examination of multiple fields is necessary to note the following:**

- Micro-organisms: If identified, please note numbers and morphology

- Shapes: coccus, bacillus, coccobacillus, filaments, and yeast-like

- The appearance of ends: rounded, tapered, concave, clubbed and flattened

- The appearance of sides: parallel, ovoid, irregular or concave

- The axis of the organism: straight, curved or spiral

- Pleomorphism (variation in shape)

- Branching or cellular extensions
