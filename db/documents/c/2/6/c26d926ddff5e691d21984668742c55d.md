Peroneal neuropathy is more common in males (male-to-female ratio, 2.8 to 1). Approximately 90% of peroneal lesions are unilateral, with no preference for the side.

- The frequency of occurrence is 0.3 to 4% after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

- 3 to 13% of cases may end up with foot drop after proximal tibial osteotomy.
