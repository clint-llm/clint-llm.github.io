Gowers sign presents with any condition that is associated with weakness of the pelvic girdle or proximal muscles of lower extremities such as

- Becker muscular dystrophy

- Limb-girdle and other muscular dystrophies

- Proximal ascending pseudomyopathic diseases

- Spinal muscular atrophy

- Sarcoglycanopathy

- Polymyositis

- Discitis

- Juvenile idiopathic arthritis

A most salient feature in muscular dystrophy is adopting a prone position before standing persisting beyond 3 years.

The valley sign, owing to hypertrophic infraspinatus and the deltoid with atrophy of axillary folds, can also help to clinch the diagnosis.

There is an increase in serum level of creatine phosphokinase muscle/brain (CPKMB), Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study will be normal, and electromyography (EMG) will show a myopathic pattern. Muscle biopsy reveals hyaline hypereosinophilic fibers scattered within the vesicles with characteristic crowding of the multinucleated nuclei in the center, degenerative fibers, and fat infiltration.
