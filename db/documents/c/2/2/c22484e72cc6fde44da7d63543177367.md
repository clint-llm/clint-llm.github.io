Before initiating pharmacotherapy assuming primary dyslipidemia, a thorough workup should be done to rule out any secondary causes of dyslipidemia. The most common secondary cause of dyslipidemia is elevated BMI in the overweight or obese range.

Other secondary causes of dyslipidemia include but are not limited to hypothyroidism, liver disease, renal disease, diabetes, pregnancy, alcohol, and certain medications.
