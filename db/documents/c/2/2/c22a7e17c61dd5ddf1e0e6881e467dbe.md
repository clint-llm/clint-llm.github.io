The critical factor in preventing complications is patient compliance with their medications and follow-up with specialists and educators. Patients need to understand their disease, how to monitor glucose, and the importance of medication compliance. At each follow-up visit, the patient needs to be screened for complications to the foot, eyes, and eyes. Appropriate referrals need to be made before disease occurs in these organs. A home care diabetic nurse should educate the patient on self-insulin injection and how to perform fingerstick tests for blood glucose level monitoring.
