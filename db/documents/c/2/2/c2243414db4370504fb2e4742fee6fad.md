The exact cause of LWE is unknown, but it is believed to be multifactorial in nature. One theory suggests that LWE is caused by friction between the eyelid and the cornea during blinking, which leads to microtrauma and inflammation of the lid wiper area. Another theory suggests that LWE is related to the increased exposure of the ocular surface due to incomplete blinking or poor eyelid closure, leading to desiccation of the cornea and conjunctiva.

Although boasting relatively high oxygen permeability (Dk/t), extended-wear contact lenses have also been associated with LWE because of their higher modulus and subsequent increase in the coefficient of friction.

Ultimately, LWE likely involves a combination of factors, including mechanical trauma, chemical irritation, inflammation, and environmental exposures. Mechanical trauma may be caused by contact lens wear, excessive blinking, or rubbing of the eyelids. Chemical irritation may result from topical medications, preservatives, or cosmetics. Inflammation may be further exacerbated by comorbid autoimmune diseases, infections, or allergic reactions. Exposure to irritants such as air pollution or cigarette smoke can also be associated with LWE.
