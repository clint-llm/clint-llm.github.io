In veryÂ low birthweight infants, breastfed infants have a lower incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis. Mothers of these infants should be counseled on the benefits of breastfeeding, particularly regarding its relationship to the development of necrotizing enterocolitis.

Antenatal and postnatal conditions which cause diminished intestinal blood flow have been implicated in the increased risk for development of necrotizing enterocolitis. For example, conditions causing placental insufficiency in the antenatal period, such as hypertension, preeclampsia, and cocaine use, may decrease infant intestinal blood flow. For infants born under these conditions, cautious enteral feeding is justified. Postnatal conditions causing similar decreased splanchnic blood flow and therefore an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, include patent ductus arteriosus, other cardiac diseases, or general hypotension and cardiovascular compromise.
