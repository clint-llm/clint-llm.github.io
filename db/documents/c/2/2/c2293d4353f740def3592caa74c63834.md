Fibroblasts are the most common cell type represented in connective tissue. These cells produce a diverse group of products including collagen type I, III, and IV, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminins, glycosaminoglycans, metalloproteinases, and even prostaglandins. In the adult body, fibroblasts remain in a quiescent form until stimuli activate protein synthesis and contractile mechanisms. These cells synthesize reorganize the ECM found in the skin, lung, heart, kidney, liver, eye, and other organs. The ECM is in constant communication with the surrounding cells as fibroblasts can secrete and respond to both autocrine and paracrine signals.

Fibroblasts are a diverse group of cells.Â  Within one organ system, there can be a great variety of functions. Within the integument, dermal fibroblasts in different locations have separate roles. The superficially located lineage involves the formation of the hair follicle and is responsible for reepithelization during wound healing; the deeper lineage is responsible for ECM generation.
