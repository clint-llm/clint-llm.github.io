Managing knee effusions requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, laboratory technologists, and a number of clinicians in different specialties. Without proper management, morbidity and mortality may be increased from an undiagnosed septic knee effusion. The moment the triage nurse sees an acute knee effusion, the emergency department physician must be notified to determine whether there is a high suspicion of septic arthritis.

The best outcome for a patient can be achieved with a coordinated therapy plan between multi-specialty and interprofessional teams. This starts the moment the patient is in triage in the ER or the ambulatory clinic, to the diagnosis of the septic knee, orthopedic management, and finally, appropriate treatment. Essential for a timely diagnosis is the diagnostic laboratory. Consultation with the pharmacist and infectious disease clinician about the choice and administration of antibiotics will increase efficacy and patient safety. If the patient requires any resources for home, the social worker and case manager should be notified. Finally, due to knee pain and decreased mobility, a physical therapist must be consulted for early ambulation. All members of the interprofessional team must exercise open communication with the rest of the care team to ensure optimal patient outcomes, alert appropriate personnel regarding changes in the patient's condition, and maintain accurate records so that everyone involved in the case has updated, accurate patient information from which to make clinical decisions.

Using this shared decision-making model, communication among providers is key to achieving the best result. This interprofessional approach must use evidence-based medicine and a unique, integrated care pathway. The best prognosis and outcomes depend on the early recognition of potential complications.
