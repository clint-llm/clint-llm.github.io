In the initial workup for traumatic diaphragmatic injury, the differential diagnosis is much more extensive in blunt trauma. This is due to the magnitude of associated injuries that produce nonspecific signs seen on initial imaging, such as pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, atelectasis, and hemothorax. Findings suggestive of diaphragm injury may suggest a phrenic nerve paralysis or injury.
