Before initiating therapeutic hypothermia, the neonate should have a secure airway and vascular access. The central line access (umbilical arterial and double-lumen umbilical venous) is preferred. If umbilical access is difficult, insert a peripheral intravenous line and a peripheral arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring. Attach pulse oximeter, cardiorespiratory monitor, and an EKG monitor to the neonate. Assess the baseline clinical and neurological status and record in chart. The cooling team has to send the baseline labs, including complete blood count, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, blood gas, lactic acid, troponin, ammonia, and coagulation profile. The neonate needs a foley catheter to assess strict input-output charts.
