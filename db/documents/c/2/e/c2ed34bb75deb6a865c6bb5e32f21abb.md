Monoclonal gammopathies are characterized by the monoclonal proliferation of the lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and monoclonal immunoglobulins (Igs) deposition in the tissues. The most common ones include solitary plasmacytoma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering myeloma, multiple myeloma (MM), and immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis). Abnormal renal indices can be the first sign of multiple myeloma or light chain amyloidosis. Despite significant advances in treating multiple myeloma, the overall prognosis of renal recovery is still poor.

The renal injury can be categorized into immunoglobulin (Ig) mediated, non-immunoglobulin (Ig) mediated, and glomerulonephritis (GN). The most common renal injury is an immunoglobulin (Ig) mediated, which includes cast nephropathy (also known as myeloma kidney), monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), and light chain amyloidosis (AL). Non-immunoglobulin (Ig) mediated, or Ig-independent mechanisms include hypercalcemia, volume depletion, sepsis, tumor lysis, medication toxicity, and plasma cell invasion of the renal parenchyma. GN can present as membranoproliferative, crescentic, or cryoglobulinemia. Occasionally minimal change disease or membranous disease can also be seen.
