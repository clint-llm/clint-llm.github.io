The most common site of ulnar nerve entrapment is at the elbow in the cubital tunnel. Cubital tunnel decompression with possible ulnar nerve transposition is a relatively common orthopedic procedure. The cubital tunnel is comprised of Osbourne's ligament (cubital tunnel retinaculum) and the deep layer of the aponeurosis of the 2 heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Osbourne’s ligament is the proximal roof of the cubital tunnel and prevents subluxation of the nerve with elbow flexion. Surgical decompression for cubital tunnel syndrome, Osbourne's fascia is incised to relieve pain and paresthesia caused by nerve injury. Transposition of the nerve from the arcade of Struthers to the flexor carpi ulnaris is also one of the recommended surgical treatments. The arcade of Struthers is formed by the internal brachial ligament, medial head of the triceps, and medial intermuscular septum just proximal to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. This is another possible site of ulnar nerve compression.

Another surgical consideration includes incidental ulnar nerve damage during carpal tunnel release surgery. During surgical intervention for carpal tunnel syndrome, a small incision is made near the wrist crease. The surgeon will dissect through the soft tissues of the wrist down the transverse carpal ligament to relieve compression of the median nerve. Damage to the deep motor branch of the ulnar nerve can occur during this dissection as the branch courses just medial to the carpal tunnel along the hamate carpal bone. Although ulnar nerve damage is a rare complication of carpal tunnel release surgery, it is important for the incision to remain in line with the radial border of the ring finger.
