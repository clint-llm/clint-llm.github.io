Pregnancy is the most challenging immunological encounter because a genetically different fetus needs to be supported within the pregnant uterus. The maternal-fetal interface is a highly specialized tissue that nourishes the fetus and protects it from immune-mediated injury. It comprises the maternally derived uterine epithelium, also called decidua, and the fetally derived placenta. The maternal-fetal interface ensures an adaption to the semi-allogeneic fetus, ensures embryo development in addition to maintaining defense against various infections.
