The use of BTM as an additional method to identify patients at higher risk of fracture, to track anti-osteoporosis treatment efficacy and adherence, and to elucidate potential secondary causes of osteoporosis will help patients avoid the significant financial, physical and psychological costs accompanying fragility fractures. However, physicians must convey the importance of screening, whether through DXA or in combination with BTM measurements, to identify these patients before fracture incidence.
