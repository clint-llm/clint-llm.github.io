The two joint spaces of the ankle that are routinely involved in arthrocentesis are the subtalar joint and the tibiotalar joint.

Two tarsal bones form the subtalar joint. It is formed by the inferior surface of the talus and the superior surface of the calcaneus. The joint capsule is supported by the posterior talocalcaneal, medial talocalcaneal, and lateral talocalcaneal ligaments.

The two long bones of the lower leg and a tarsal bone form the tibiotalar joint. It is formed by the superior surface of the talus, the mortise formed by the distal end of the tibia and fibula. The joint capsule is supported by three sets/groups of ligaments: tibiofibular syndesmosis, medial/deltoid collateral ligaments, and the lateral collateral ligaments.
