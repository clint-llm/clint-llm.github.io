Aldosterone is created from cholesterol within the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands. Cholesterol interacts sequentially with the enzymes 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-alpha-hydroxylase, 11-beta-hydroxylase, and steroid 18-hydroxylase (also called aldosterone synthase) to produce 11-beta, 21-dihydroxy-3, 20-dioxopregn-4-en-18-al (aldosterone). These enzymes also function in the production of other steroid hormones from cholesterol in the adrenal glands, including glucocorticoids (corticosterone and cortisol) and androgen hormones (estrone, estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone).
