The TTMPB is most often described as being performed at the level of T4-T5.

As this is a relatively novel block, there have been variations in where and how the TTMPB is performed. The T4-T5 intercostal space is most often targeted, as it was used by Ueshima et al., who first published their findings on the block. A cadaveric study has also corroborated the T4-T5 intercostal space as an ideal place for the TTMPB, showing the spread of local anesthetic from the manubrium of the sternum to the T5-T6 intercostal space.
