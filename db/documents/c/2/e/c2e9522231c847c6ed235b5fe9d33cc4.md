Complications after pectoral implantation are similar to those for breast augmentation. These include bleeding or hematoma formation, infection, poor cosmetic outcome, asymmetry, shifting or rotation of the implant, seroma, implant rupture, capsular contracture, and poor scarring. Any time implant placement is under the pectoralis muscle, the patient may develop muscle spasm. This condition can be treated with muscle relaxers, or for persistent spasms, botulinum toxin can be a possible treatment modality.

Other less common complications include anesthetic complications and resulting paresthesia of the inner arm. Although there are no reports of breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) with pectoral implants, they have a textured surface, which can theoretically cause this rare condition.
