Asteroid hyalosis (AH) is characterized by yellow-white brilliant reflecting particles surrounded by tightly adherent fibrils inside the vitreous cavity. It is a common ophthalmological finding. Proper ophthalmic evaluation and correct diagnosis of this condition are needed. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of asteroid hyalosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and managing care for patients with asteroid hyalosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of asteroid hyalosis.
- Describe the ophthalmic evaluation of asteroid hyalosis.
- Outline the management options available for asteroid hyalosis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance studies on asteroid hyalosis and improve outcomes.
