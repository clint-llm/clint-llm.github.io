Inter-facility transport is defined as the transport of patients between two healthcare facilities. The process is generally accomplished through ground transportation or air vehicles. Inter-facility transport is a crucial part of today's healthcare system that allows facilities to transfer patients needing specialized care that cannot be adequately performed at their current facility. Financial constraints of integrated hospital systems and managed care organizations also necessitate the use of inter-facility transport to help maintain high practice standards and reduce financial burdens.
