The skin is made up of two layers, the epidermis, and dermis, and their thickness varies depending on location, age, and gender. Deep to the skin is the subcutaneous fat and then a fascial membranous layer before the deeper structures, such as muscle. Heat (and other injury mechanisms) can denature proteins, leading to loss of plasma membrane integrity and cell necrosis. Superficial burns only affect the epidermis; they are clinically painful, erythematous, blanch on pressure, and are sensate. Partial-thickness burns involve both the epidermis and dermis; clinically, they can appear pink or cherry red, blister, are sensate to touch, blanch on pressure, and are also painful. Full-thickness burns affect the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue forming an eschar. Clinically, these burns appear dry and leathery, but they are not painful, sensate, or blanching and can feel firm and waxy on palpation.

In limbs, circumferential full-thickness burns act as a tourniquet, and restrict circulation distally, resulting in tissue ischemia and necrosis. On the chest and abdominal wall, due to the inflexible nature of the eschar, normal respiratory chest and abdominal wall movements are restricted thus limiting normal respiratory function.
