According to the AIUM's accreditation policies, sonographers are required to be credentialed in their practicing specialty. Ultrasound examinations are supervised by a licensed medical provider who meets the training specialty guidelines, and a qualified physician should be readily available to interpret the ultrasound examination.

Additionally, according to "Training Guidelines for Physicians Who Evaluate and Interpret Diagnostic Obstetric Ultrasound Examinations," physicians and sonographers who read and perform Early Comprehensive Fetal Anatomy Ultrasounds should undergo specialized training at a teaching facility that will allow the adequate experience to become proficient. Performance of early comprehensive fetal anatomy ultrasounds should be done within referral centers with specialized expertise in reading and counseling patients on findings.
