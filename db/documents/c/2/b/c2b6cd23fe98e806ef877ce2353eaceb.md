The cytochrome CYP3A4 is responsible for the liver metabolism of disopyramide. It can be induced or inhibited by various substances. Hence, these substances should be avoided or used cautiously to prevent the unpredictable modification of disopyramide pharmacokinetics. Listed below are several substances that are known to induce and inhibit CYP3A4.

CYP3A4 inducers (increase disopyramide metabolism, reducing the disopyramide's plasma half-life):

- Rifampin

- Phenobarbital

- Phenytoin

CYP3A4 inhibitors (decrease disopyramide metabolism, increasing the disopyramide's plasma half-life):

- Verapamil

- Diltiazem

- Ketoconazole

- Macrolide antibiotics

- Protease-inhibitors

- Grapefruit juice

If any of these substances will be used concurrently with disopyramide, monitoring disopyramide's plasma concentration is warranted to prevent adverse consequences.

In patients with severe renal dysfunction (renal clearance of < 8mL/min), disopyramide's half-life is longer, and the duration ranges from 14Â to 43 hours.
