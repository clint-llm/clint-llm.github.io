Nimodipine (C21H26N2O7) is a second-generation 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It was initially invented for the management of systemic hypertension.

FDA approved the use of nimodipine for the first time in 1988. However, its use is restricted mainly to managing vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- Prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (FDA-approved use): Nimodipine is indicated to improve neurological outcomes by reducing the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits regardless of their post-ictus neurological condition (Hunt and Hess Grades I to V).

- In the treatment of diffuse brain injury along with hyperbaric oxygen therapy

- In assisting the recovery after cranial nerve injury

- Migraine prophylaxis

- Peripheral vertigo and Meniere disease

- Nimodipine reduces the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients under general anesthesia

- Drug-resistant epilepsy

- Orgasmic headache and bath-related headache

- The ophthalmic formulation of nimodipine is a potential agent in the management of glaucoma

The following findings are derived from various trials regarding the use of nimodipine:

- Nimodipine should be given to patients with no neurological deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage to reduce the onset of new neurological deficits due to vasospasm. (Cerebral arterial spasm controlled trial of nimodipine in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1983)

- Nimodipine 60 mg every 4 hours given orally was well tolerated and reduced cerebral infarction. It also improved the outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage. (British aneurysm nimodipine trial, 1989)

- There is no statistically-proven benefit of nimodipine in head injury patients. (The British/Finnish Co-operative Head Injury Trial Group, 1990)

- Nimodipine has no role in improving the functional outcome of acute ischemic hemispheric stroke. (A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nimodipine in acute ischemic hemispheric stroke, 1994)

- There is no benefit of nimodipine in the treatment of head injury patients. (Nimodipine in traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage: a re-analysis of the HIT I and HIT II trials, 1996)

- Nimodipine has got only a very minimal role in the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. European multicenter trial of nimodipine in the prophylaxis of common migraine (migraine without aura). Migraine-Nimodipine European Study Group (MINES), 1989.

- Researchers noted a beneficial effect of nimodipine in acute cerebral ischemia. (A randomized, double-blind controlled study of nimodipine in acute cerebral ischemic stroke, 1998).

- Nimodipine may be effective in patients with small vessel subcortical vascular dementia. (Efficacy and safety of nimodipine in subcortical vascular dementia: a subgroup analysis of the Scandinavian Multi-Infarct Dementia Trial, 2000)

- Early supplementation of nimodipine in stroke patients does not have any beneficial effect. (Very Early Nimodipine Use in Stroke (VENUS), 2001)

- Oral and intravenous nimodipine are equally efficient in preventing vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. (Nimodipine in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a randomized study of intravenous or peroral administration, 2009)

- Nimodipine has a potential neuroprotective effect by preventing calcium overload in ischemic neurons. However, this gets outweighed by its harmful hemodynamic effects in the ischemic area in treating acute ischemic stroke. (Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial (INWEST Trial,1994)

- A Phase III randomized trial compared the efficacy and safety of single intraventricular administration nimodipine microparticles to the standard of care of oral nimodipine in patients with SAH. The trial concluded that sustained release nimodipine administered via external ventricular drain did not significantly increase favorable outcomes compared with the standard of care.

- A recent innovative formulation has connected nimodipine with pH-sensitive chitosan nanoparticles. The objective of using such a technique would be to maintain systemic administration of nimodipine but restrict the release of the drug to tissues with decreased pH in the ischemic penumbra.
