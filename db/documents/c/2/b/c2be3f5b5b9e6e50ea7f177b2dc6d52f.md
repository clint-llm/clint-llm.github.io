The most common lifelong negative outcome after an anterior elbow dislocation is the loss of terminal extension. Patients who have a simple anterior elbow dislocation have a strong chance of regaining full range of motion after recovery. However, patients with injuries that require periods of greater than three weeks of immobilization, such as complex anterior elbow dislocations or those withÂ neurovascular injuries, tend to lose terminal extension. It is not uncommon for patients to lose up to ten to fifteen degrees of terminal extension after an elbow dislocation.
