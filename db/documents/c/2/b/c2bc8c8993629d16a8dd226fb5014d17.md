The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United StatesÂ cites lung cancer as, by far, the most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Multiple society guidelines recommend that cancer treatment decisions be based on tumor histologic type and molecular markers. Although exceptions can be made, tissue diagnosis is the general rule before both curative and palliative therapy.

However, just as it is good medical care for physicians to see patients as persons and not as diseases, clinicians need to understand that for tissue diagnosis to be obtained, biopsy procedures often require special considerations regarding the person undergoing the biopsy. The patient may not be able to lie still long enough to create an accessible avenue for the needle, may not be able to hold their breath consistently sufficient to enable access to the moving lesion given limitations in a hospital's CT fluoroscopy equipment, or may warrant specialist consultation to optimize pre-biopsy and post-biopsy care to prevent prolonged hospitalization or even severe permanent injury secondary to complications.

For these reasons and because most experienced interventional radiologists can reach a target of at least 5 mm diameter and less than 15 mm depth, the commonly asked question "Can the lesion be biopsied?" is generally inappropriate. The following three questions are more appropriate to decision-making for patient care:

- "Has the lesion reached a size allowing a reasonable chance at a tissue yield, or is it more reasonable to wait to allow the lesion to grow in anticipation that a diagnosis will still likely be achieved before potential metastasis?"

- "Assuming that biopsy is now appropriate, how should the physicians and patient work together to optimize the patient medically and psychologically to improve the likelihood of a safe and successful biopsy?"

- "Anticipating that the biopsy attempt may not yield adequate tissue, what will plan B be?"
