Overdose is rare, and there is no fatal dose yet established. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have a broad therapeutic index with mild side effects that occur infrequently. Treatment is primarily supportive. Monitor for the rare cases of ECG changes, ventricular arrhythmias, serotonin syndrome, and masked bowel ileus or bowel obstruction. Due to the unknown fatal dose and extremely rare documented cases of overdose causing significant morbidity or mortality, there is little commercial motivation or clinical need for antidote development.
