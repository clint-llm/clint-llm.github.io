ACS is typically only seen in critically ill patients and will likely be a diagnosis made in the ICU setting rather than in the emergency department. Clinical suspicion for abdominal compartment syndrome should be high in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma or surgical patients following extensive abdominal surgery. Patients may present with abdominal pain and distension. However, this is not a sensitive or specific finding. Patients in the ICU setting may present with a wide array of organ failure, not limited to the abdomen, which can make the diagnosis difficult.

The physical exam may reveal an increased abdominal girth, tense abdomen, cyanosis, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.

In abdominal compartment syndrome, the displacement of the diaphragm cephalad leads to compression of the thorax, which causes an increase in work of breathing, ventilation/perfusion inequality, and increases in both peak and plateau pressures.

The tense abdomen also prevents venous return, resulting in elevated intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure.
