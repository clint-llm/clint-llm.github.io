There is no uniformly accepted definition for prosthetic joint infection. The presentation is often varied and classic features of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis are often absent. The diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection is supported by joint aspirate or surgically obtained peri-prosthetic material from which certain microorganisms are recovered. Other factors that support prosthetic joint infection include the presence of a sinus tract communicating with the joint space, wound dehiscence, purulence around the joint without an alternative explanation, loosening of the prosthesis, elevated synovial fluid leukocyte count with neutrophil predominance, and elevated inflammatory markers. However, failure to identify a pathogen does not rule out infection. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of prosthetic joint infections and reviews the role of interprofessional teams in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how signs and symptoms that may be present in patients with prosthetic joint infections. 
- Describe how to evaluate a patient for a prosthetic joint infection. 
- Review management strategies for prosthetic joint infections. 
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by prosthetic joint infection.
