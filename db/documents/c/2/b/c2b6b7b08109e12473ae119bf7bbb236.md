Vacuum extractors often have replaced forceps when assistance is required for vaginal delivery. Compared with metal-cup vacuum extractors, soft-cup devices cause fewer neonatal scalp injuries and are easier to use; however, they detach more often.

Vacuum extractors can result in neonatal injury. These devices should be employed only when indicated, such as for a nonreassuring fetal heart tracing or second-stage labor failure to progress. Complications may be minimized if contraindications are considered. Clinicians should have adequate training and experience before attempting to perform a vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery.
