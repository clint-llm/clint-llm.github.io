Patients with a neurilemmoma typically present with an asymptomatic mass but may experience pain and paresthesias throughout the distribution of the entire nerve as the tumor grows larger and applies pressure to the nerve. Neurilemmomas of the posterior spinal nerve will produce sensory symptomatology, while compression of the anterior spinal nerves may produce motor deficits.

On physical exam, physicians may notice a palpable mass that can be mobilized in the plane orthogonal to the axis of the affected nerve, but not longitudinally aligned with the affected nerve.

Neurilemmomas most frequently occur in the neck and mediastinum, and when present in the extremities are far more common along the flexor surfaces.
