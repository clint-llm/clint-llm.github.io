A release of the transverse carpal ligament can be performed to relieve compression of the median nerve as it traverses through the carpal tunnel. This procedure has been shown to relieve compression of the ulnar nerve at Guyon canal as well. When a patient has concomitant median nerve compression at the carpal tunnel and ulnar nerve compression at the Guyon tunnel, surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament can be performed to help relieve compression of both nerves.
