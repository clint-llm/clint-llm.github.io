Emphysematous cholecystitis is a fulminant variety of acute cholecystitis that differs in its pathology and epidemiology from cholecystitis induced by gallstones. The characteristic feature of this sinister variant of cholecystitis is the presence of gas in the lumen and wall of the gallbladder. The presence of gas may be detected elsewhere in the biliary tract or adjacent structures in addition to gas in the gallbladder wall. Emphysematous cholecystitis occurs in about 1% of all cases of acute cholecystitis but carries significantly higher morbidity and mortality. Individuals most susceptible to emphysematous cholecystitis are people with diabetes mellitus and those with a weak immune system. This activity reviews the evaluation of patients with an emphysematous gallbladder and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this life-threatening condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of emphysematous cholecystitis.
- Review the frequency of emphysematous cholecystitis.
- Outline patients that are at highest risk of developing emphysematous cholecystitis.
- Summarize the interprofessional teams coordination of care in a patient with emphysematous cholecystitis.
