The Lachman test is widely regarded as the most useful test for diagnosing an acute ACL injury and should be used in conjunction with the pivot shift test and anterior drawer test for assessing ACL integrity. Prompt evaluation and diagnosis of ACL injuries by the interprofessional healthcare team are essential to expedite further management and rehabilitation. The team consists of primary care and emergency providers, sports medicine physician, orthopedists, and nurses. It is important to evaluate and consider other knee structures that often sustain an injury in conjunction with an ACL injury, as isolated ACL tears reportedly occur less than 10% of the time in acute knee injuries.
