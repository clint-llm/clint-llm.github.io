Angiostrongyliasis has been associated with the consumption of the intermediate hosts of the Angiostrongylus cantonensis species. Local cases should be reported to public health to decrease further consumption of infected intermediate hosts and to contain the source. It is essential to raise public awareness of the undercooked consumption of crabs, snails, slugs, prawns.

Since the risk of infection occurs from the ingestion of the vectors, then the ingestion of raw snails/slugs, crabs, shrimp should be avoided. Additionally, there can be accidental inclusion of the raw snail slug in uncooked foods such as salads. Care should be taken in food preparation and careful handwashing.
