Dobutamine is a medication used in the ICU to manage low blood pressure. While the drug is safe, its use requires close monitoring as it has the potential to raise blood pressure and cause arrhythmia. Therefore the involvement of an interprofessional healthcare team is the optimal approach to ensuring therapeutic effectiveness and avoiding adverse effects. This team includes clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists. Nurses perform IV dobutamine administration; hence these professionals should be familiar with the dosing and what parameters to monitor. Overall, the effects of dobutamine are short-lived. As soon as the infusion stops, the hemodynamic parameters will reverse. Collaboration and open communication between all interprofessional team members will drive the best patient results with dobutamine and any other drugs or procedures. [Level 5]
