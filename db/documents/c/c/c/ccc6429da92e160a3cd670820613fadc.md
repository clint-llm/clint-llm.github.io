Toxicity usually occurs with medications that can increase serum concentrations of torsemide like methotrexate etc. No antidote is available for the treatment of toxicity. In instances of toxicity, close monitoring of kidney function and electrolytes are essential to promptly identify and treat acute kidney injury and severe electrolyte abnormalities.

Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity occur with concomitant use of nephro or ototoxic medications. Animal studies have shown temporary ototoxicity with no permanent effect.
