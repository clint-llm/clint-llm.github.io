SDS is caused by an SBDS gene mutation on chromosome 7. It codes for the SBDS protein (SBDSP), which is widely expressed, throughout the body, in different organ systems. SBDS gene and SBDSP pseudogene are located in proximity on chromosome 7, and a possible conversion event between the 2 loci result in the mutation.
