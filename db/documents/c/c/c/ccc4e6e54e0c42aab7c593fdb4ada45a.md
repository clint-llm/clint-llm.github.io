The etiology of substernal goiter is the same as cervical goiter. Descent of cervical goiter through the thoracic inlet is considered to be the cause, because substernal goiters get their blood supply from the neck, mainly from the inferior thyroid artery. Ectopic thyroid tissue in the chest causing de novo substernal goiter is rare, accounting for only 2% of all substernal goiters.
