Functional voice disorders (FVD) are caused by insufficient or improper use of the phonation apparatus without either anatomical or neurological abnormalities. The most common FVDs include vocal fatigue, muscle tension dysphonia, diplophonia, and ventricular phonation. This activity reviews functional voice disorders by discussing their etiology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology, as well as the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of patients with functional voice disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the impact that functional voice disorders can have on patients' quality of life.
- Identify the etiology of functional voice disorders.
- Outline the evaluation of functional voice disorders.
- Review the management options available for functional voice disorders.
