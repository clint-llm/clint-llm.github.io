LMWH administration is via subcutaneous injection; this has long-term implications on the choice of anticoagulant for prophylaxis, for example, in orthopedic patients recovering from joint replacement surgery or in the treatment of DVT/PE. Patients often dislike injections, especially self-administered ones, complaining of pain or bleeding with injection, and prefer an oral alternative.
