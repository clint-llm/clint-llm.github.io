A patient's right to the refusal of care is founded upon one of the basic ethical principles of medicine, autonomy. This principle states that every person has the right to make informed decisions about their healthcare and that healthcare professionals should not impose their own beliefs or decisions upon their patients.

With those principles in mind, the first step in any situation regarding the refusal of care is to determine the patient's capacity to refuse. Capacity is defined as a person's ability to process information and make an informed decision about their care in a way that is in line with their beliefs, values, and preferences.

Capacity has four accepted assessment components. First, a patient needs to express understanding about their medical situation,  the decision they are making, and any risks or benefits that are associated with that decision. The patient must also express a clear, consistent choice without frequently changing their mind. The third component of capacity is appreciation, defined as when a patient is able to apply the understanding of their medical situation to their own life. If a patient is able to explain the situation but does not understand how it applies to their situation, they lack appreciation. This can take the form of being able to describe what a heart attack is, but being unable to appreciate that they are having one despite being presented proof.  The final aspect of capacity is reasoning, which is the patient's ability to infer the consequences of their decision and to express an explanation as to why they would rather refuse care.
