- SCN accounts for less than 1% of ESRD patients in the United States, with higher mortality compared to other causes of ESRD

- Median survival among patients with and without kidney failure is 29 and 51 years, respectively.

- In a US study, the average age of patients with SCN, who reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, is 23.1 years (with HbSS), with a mean time of death from the beginning of dialysis being 4 years.

- United States renal data system (1992 through 1997) showed that SCN is an independent risk factor for the death in hemodialysis patients and are less likely to receive a renal transplant.

- A French study of dialysis patients with ESRD from SCN compared the five years mortality, with patients of ESRD from other causes and it was 46.3% versus 6.4%. Moreover, these patients were much less likely to receive a renal transplant (26% versus 53.5%).

- Recurrence of SCN has been reported in the literature.

- The latest literature points toward improved outcomes in SN transplant recipients when compared to diabetic kidney disease.
