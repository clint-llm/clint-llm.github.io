Most pediatric patients are managed with medical therapy, and most of them will improve. However, at least 30% will persist to be symptomatic until adulthood. Factors that are associated with a worse prognosis are female gender, older age of onset, longer time between symptom presentation and starting therapy, and longer colonic transit time.

In adults constipation has a poor prognosis; it seriously affects the quality of life. In many cases, treatments do not work and even when they work, the benefits are short-lived.
