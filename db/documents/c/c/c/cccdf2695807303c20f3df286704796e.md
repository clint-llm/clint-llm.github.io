In T1D, there is autoimmune destruction of the beta cells in the pancreatic islets over months or years, causing an absolute deficiency of insulin. Although the exact etiology of T1D is still unknown, researchers believe there is a genetic predisposition with a strong link with specific HLA (DR and DQ) alleles. This association is more pronounced in youth-onset T1D compared to adult-onset T1D.

In those at risk, it is generally believed that viruses,  environmental including dietary factors, and/or other stressors can trigger autoimmune beta-cell destruction. Some studies have found an increased risk of development of T1D related to infection with Coxsackie virus, enteroviruses, cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, influenza B, mumps virus, and more recently, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).

The presence of circulating pancreatic islet autoantibodies suggests that the individual is at risk for or has developed T1D. These antibodies include islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICA), antibodies to insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase isoform 65 (GAD65), insulinoma antigen 2/islet tyrosine phosphatase 2 (IA-2) and zinc transporter isoform 8 (ZnT8). IAAs are primarily detected in children.
