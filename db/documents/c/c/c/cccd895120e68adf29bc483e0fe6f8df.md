The clinical history is very important and should aim to determine the underlying etiology of the lagophthalmos. If the patient had recent surgery or trauma to the eye, orbit, face, or head, then this should be ascertained. Previous infections in history should be reviewed, especially if it was herpes zoster. A detailed medical history will help to reveal any systemic causes, such as thyroid disease or obstructive sleep apnea. The history of acute facial nerve paralysis is a sudden unilateral loss of facial motor function. This results in a distinctive facial asymmetry.

If the lesion is the lower motor neuron, then the complete hemiface is affected; upper motor neuron lesions will spare the frontalis muscle, and hence the forehead is not affected. For a lower motor neuron lesion causing complete facial paralysis, patients will have a loss of forehead, nasolabial folds, ptosis of the eyebrow, lower lid ectropion, upper lid retraction, lagophthalmos, oral droop, problems with speech, and possibly emotional distressÂ due to the physical effects.
