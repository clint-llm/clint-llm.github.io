Although the precise mechanism of action of topiramate is unknown, there is sufficient evidence to explain the drug's anticonvulsant activity.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Topiramate is well absorbed from the GIT, with peak plasma levels usually achieved in 2 to 3 hours. The bioavailability is greater than 80%. Concomitant ingestion of food slows the time required to reach peak plasma concentration, but the extent of absorption is not significantly altered. Consequently, topiramate can be administered regardless of meal time. Topiramate follows linear and predictable pharmacokinetics over the recommended dose range (15 to 400 mg/day).

**Distribution:**Topiramate has plasma proteins-plasma protein binding of (15% to 41%). The fraction of bound topiramate decreases as blood concentration increases.

**Metabolism:**Topiramate is metabolized by hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation.

**Excretion:**Topiramate is eliminated by renal excretion in unchanged form and as metabolites. The clearance of topiramate in adults is 20 to 30 mL/min. The mean plasma elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours. The elimination half-life varies according to age and concomitant use of enzyme-inducing or inhibitor drugs. The clearance increases in patients taking concomitant enzyme-inducing drugs such as phenytoin, barbiturates, and carbamazepine.
