Complications of a splenic abscess includeÂ the following:

- Pneumothorax

- Atelectasis

- Life-threatening hemorrhage

- Left-sided pleural effusion

- Subphrenic abscess

- Perforation of the stomach, small bowel, or colon

- Pancreatic fistula

- Postsplenectomy thrombocytosis

- Pneumonia

Respiratory complications can be minimized by advocating incentive spirometry, pain control, and aggressive chest physical therapy.

If a subphrenic abscess develops, it usually requires prompt drainage.

Post-splenectomy sepsis is always a risk, especially in young people who have had the spleen removed. These patients should undergo immunization against Meningococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.
