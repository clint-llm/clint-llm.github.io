If the histopathological examination of the endometrial biopsy shows hyperplasia without atypia, there is less than a 3% chance of developing cancer, and hence progestin therapy is considered appropriate. Progestin stimulates progesterone receptors in the endometrium and causes the decidualization of the stroma and thinning of the endometrium. If hyperplasia with atypia is present, the chances of developing endometrial carcinoma increase by up to 30%.

In women considering future pregnancy, progestins can also be used in the presence of atypia, but if the patient has no plans for pregnancy, hysterectomy should be considered. It is important to stage the disease and plan the treatment accordingly in the presence of carcinoma. For endometrial carcinoma stage I, transabdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the treatment of choice.

For stage II, radical or simple hysterectomy along with adjuvant radiotherapy is preferred. Stage III endometrial carcinoma is treated with transabdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic radiation, while for stage IV, cancer surgery and radiation therapy are the mainstays of treatment. Patients with stage IV cancer might also require palliative care to improve their quality of life.
