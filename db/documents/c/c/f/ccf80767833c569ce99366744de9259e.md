Cross-sensitization may occur in the population affected by allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). This process occurs when an antigen that is chemically similar to an antigen that had previously been sensitized by the host triggers a contact dermatitis. Additionally, systemically-induced allergic dermatitis may take place when an individual who previously has been sensitized to a contact allergin consumes the allergen by another route (inhalation, ingestion, injection).
