Stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expense in the United States. However, stroke care is now in a stage of rapid therapeutic advancement for even the most devastating strokes. It is critical for providers to understand current stroke guidelines and corresponding stroke center certifications for appropriate patient care and destination protocols. Timely recognition is also critical as treatment delays lead to poorer outcomes, and may even take patients out of treatment windows for an outcome changing medication or intervention.
