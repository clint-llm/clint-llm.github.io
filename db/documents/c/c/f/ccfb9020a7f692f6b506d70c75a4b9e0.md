Tachypnea in newborns is a problem with the respiratory system that can become apparent shortly after delivery. It can result from impaired clearance of fetal lung fluid, which leads to respiratory distress. Transient tachypnea of the newborn has a higher prevalence in preterm infants. It occurs in approximately 1 in 100 preterm infants, whereas, in term infants, it presents in about 4 to 6 per 1000 infants.

Tachypnea in adults is breathing more than 20 breaths per minute. Twelve to twenty breaths per minute is a normal range.
