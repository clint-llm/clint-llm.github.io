The incidence of toxoplasmosis infection depends on the seropositivity of Toxoplasma gondii in the population. In the United States, the seropositivity of T. gondii is approximately 10% of the adult population. Seropositivity is higher in Africa and Europe where it can reach up to 80%, and toxoplasma encephalitis could be as high as 25% to 50% of susceptible hosts. The seropositivity in the HIV population mirrors that of the general population.

Even though cats and related felines have traditionally been associated with toxoplasmosis, the prevalence of infection is not related to owning a cat. In the HIV Toxoplasma-seropositive patients with CD4 less than 100 who are not on appropriate prophylaxis, the probability of developing reactivated toxoplasmosis is as high as 30%.

Apart from oral transmission, toxoplasmosis can also be transmitted via the placenta from mother to fetus or through transplantation of an infected organ.
