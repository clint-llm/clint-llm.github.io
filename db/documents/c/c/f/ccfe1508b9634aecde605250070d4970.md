Though several clinical variants have emerged over the years, classical Foville syndrome is characterized by ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy, facial palsy, and contralateral hemiparesis. This activity reviews the inferior medial pontine stroke syndrome that is known as Foville syndrome and describes the clinical presentation, etiology, pathophysiology as well as treatment and management. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing stroke patients, specifically, regarding this stroke syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical signs and symptoms of Foville syndrome.
- Review the clinical variants of the syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available.
- Describe the role of the interprofessional team and its role to focus diagnosis and management of Foville syndrome on enabling appropriate diagnosis and treatment, resulting in improved outcomes.
