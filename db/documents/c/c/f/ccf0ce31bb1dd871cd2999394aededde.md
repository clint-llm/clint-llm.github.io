Medical advances have helped the US population live longer with more comorbidities than previously possible. As the aging population expands, the incidence of degenerative heart disease and valvular disease has increased.

The advent of minimally invasive mitral valve repair in recent years provides a necessary therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic mitral valve disease. Additionally, studies of minimally invasive mitral valve repair have been shown to preserve cardiac structure and function when implemented early. Minimally invasive surgical mitral valve repair has become routine for the treatment of MR.

Enhancements of minimally invasive surgical techniques improved surgical trauma and postoperative recovery, resulting in increased acceptance of these techniques.
