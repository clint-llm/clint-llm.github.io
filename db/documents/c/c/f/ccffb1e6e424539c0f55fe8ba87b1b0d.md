The study of epidemiology is difficult in sinus node dysfunction due to the variable disease manifestations and ECG findings. However, according to a pooled analysis from two extensive studies that included 20572 patients with a mean age of 59 years old, 43% were males, who researchers followed for an average of 17 years. The incidence of sinus node dysfunction was 0.8 per 1000 person-years. Age showed the greatest significance as a risk factor for having sinus node dysfunction.
