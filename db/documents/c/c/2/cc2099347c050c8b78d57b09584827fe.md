Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to have significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with many nations enduring multiple outbreaks of this viral illness. Many vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, Ad26.COV2.S, and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ) have been developed at an unprecedented speed using distinctive technologies to prevent COVID-19. Several cases of uncommon thrombotic events associated in combination with thrombocytopenia were observed in patients who were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines. This article will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with the rare syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of VITT.
- Describe the pathophysiology and pertinent clinical features of VITT.
- Review the treatment options in the management of VITT.
- Describe the importance of an interprofessional approach in managing patients affected with VITT that would lead to better patient care and improved outcomes.
