The posterior longitudinal ligament is one of the three more important ligaments that contribute to stability in the spine. It runs along the posterior aspect of the vertebral body inside the vertebral canal from the body of the axis to the sacrum.

The fibers are wider at the intervertebral spaces and are more adherent to the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral discs than at the vertebral body where they are thinner. This phenomenon is more visible in the posterior ligament than the anterior. Therefore, the posterior longitudinal ligament is much thinner than the anterior longitudinal ligament, which is significant for the pathophysiology of disc herniations occurring posterolateral.
