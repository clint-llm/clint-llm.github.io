The Tullio phenomenon is a symptom or physical exam finding, whereas nystagmus or vertigo are induced in response to sound. This was described in animals nearly 90 years ago by professor Pietro Tullio in Bologna, Italy. In humans, the phenomenon was first observed in patients suffering from advanced syphilis. Since that time, numerous reports and studies have shown that the Tullio phenomenon canÂ be seen in various pathologies, including patients with no pathology at all.
