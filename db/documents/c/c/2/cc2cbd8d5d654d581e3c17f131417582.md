Immature erythrocytes require the same organelles as other human cells to function and synthesize materials necessary to proceed with maturation. Ribosomes facilitate the translation of mRNA to produce proteins utilized in numerous cellular functions and remain present in reticulocytes alongside other essential organelles, such as mitochondria, following enucleation of erythroblasts. Terminal maturation of reticulocytes into erythrocytes involves the elimination of these remaining organelles. Clearance of ribosomes is thought to occur during later phases of maturation in which reticulocytes enter circulation from the bone marrow to complete their conversion into erythrocytes. Enzymatic degradation via Ulk1 protein kinase signaling appears to be attributable to ribosome clearance; however, a detailed mechanism is not clear at this time.

Incomplete or failure of ribosomal degradation leads to precipitation of ribosomes or ribosomal remnants in circulating erythrocytes, which is visible as basophilic stippling on microscopy. Aberrant terminal maturation is involved in several hematologic disorders but is of particular interest in heavy metal toxicity and anemia â€“ especially those associated with heritable enzymopathies. For example, pyrimidine nucleotidase is a key enzyme involved in the catabolism of ribosomal and messenger RNA during terminal maturation. Deficiency or inhibition of this enzyme causes anemia with marked basophilic stippling on peripheral smears.
