Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are a type of central venous catheter that offers the ability to have long-term central venous access. Some patients require this procedure to be performed in Interventional Radiology (IR) under fluoroscopic guidance, which produces a continuous real-time X-ray image, ensuring correct line placement. This technique works well for patients with small diameter veins and reduces the risk of dangerous misplacement. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications associated with fluoroscopic PICC line placement and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in ensuring safe practice.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for fluoroscopic PICC line placement.
- Explain how to insert a PICC line under fluoroscopy.
- Summarize the complications of fluoroscopic PICC line placement.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and coordination amongst the interprofessional team to facilitate safe fluoroscopic PICC line placement and improve patient outcomes.
