In developed countries, there is less morbidity and mortality related to caustic ingestion secondary to better product regulations and education about alkali products. Exposure to caustics is still a problem in underdeveloped nations.serious injuries occur after intentional ingestions.

Developed countries have more effective exposure preventions, such as childproof containers, regulation of highly corrosive substances, better access to emergency care, healthier nutrition status, and better follow up. As opposed to underdeveloped nations where lack of regulations, delay of care, malnutrition, and cultural-specific propensities to the use of caustic agents during attempted suicides pose a more significant challenge with increased morbidity and mortality.
