Silver sulfadiazine is considered extremely safe, and overdose is uncommon; however, it is essential to remember that systemic absorption of the medication can occur and may be significant, especially when used near mucosal or ocular areas or when used on a large surface area.

In large amounts, propylene glycol is potentially toxic and, as mentioned previously, is found in many formulations of silver sulfadiazine. Toxicity with these formulations has correlated with hyperosmolality, seizures, lactic acidosis, and respiratory depression.
