The pediatric airway is narrowest at the subglottis (as opposed to the adult airway, where the glottis is the narrowest point) and is located cephalad and more anterior when compared to the adult airway. Children 12 years or younger have a smaller cricothyroid membrane, and their larynx is more compliant, funnel-shaped, and rostral in position. The larger occiput combined with a shorter neck makes laryngoscopy relatively more difficult, providing obstacles to the alignment of the oral, laryngeal, and tracheal axes. It often requires a folded towel or shoulder roll to achieve a neutral position of the neck and open the airway.

The dimensions of the trachea depend on the age and sex of the child. Please see Table 1. There are different formulas to select the proper size of the ET tube.

- The Cole formula for uncuffed tubes: ID (internal diameter) in mm= (age in years)/4 + 4 (F)

- The Motoyama formula for cuffed ETTs in children aged 2 years or older: ID in mm = (age in years)/4 + 3.5 (EK)

- The Khine formula for cuffed ETTs in children younger than 2 years: ID in mm = (age in years)/4 + 3.0

For children aged 1 month to 6 years, ultrasound measurement of subglottic airway diameter better predicted appropriately sized endotracheal tube than traditional formulas using age and height. This may not be practical in an urgent or emergent situation, so familiarity with the airway sizing algorithms above is paramount.
