Respiratory failure is one of the most important and common causes of patient admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the last few years, non-invasive ventilation has gained increased prominence in the management of a variety of conditions causing acute as well as chronic respiratory failure. Different modalities of non-invasive ventilation exist, with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) being the most commonly used modes. Average volume-assured pressure support (AVAPS) is a relatively newer modality of non-invasive ventilation that integrates the characteristics of both volume and pressure-controlled non-invasive ventilation. This activity reviews the utilization of average volume-assured pressure support in the intensive care unit and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with respiratory failure using this modality of non-invasive ventilation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the functioning mechanism of average volume-assured pressure support.
- Summarize the clinical significance of average volume-assured pressure support.
- Outline the complications of average volume-assured pressure support.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients on average volume-assured pressure support.
