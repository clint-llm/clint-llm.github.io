The overall prognosis is variable. Two-thirds of patients with Moyamoya disease have a symptomatic progression over five years with poor outcomes. Progression of the occlusive process continues regardless of symptom severity, ongoing treatment, age, sex, type and location of the disease. However, data from the North American series shows 13.3% and 1.7% of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, respectively. Factors that may show a poor prognosis could be but not limited to: hemorrhagic strokes at presentation, female gender, familial form of onset and pediatric age of onset.  Concomitant thyroid disorder and smoking impacts negatively on overall prognosis in MMD.  Early surgical revascularization has a preferable prognosis
