The exact etiopathogenesis of echolalia is not entirely understood. Speech imitation and repetition is a part of normal language development in toddlers. Echophenomena improves over the first two years of life. Self-regulation in speech and language develops around the age of 3 years.

Pathological echolalia persists beyond the age of 3 years. Some researchers have postulated a “broken mirror neuron system” and “wealth of stimulus” hypothesis to explain the imitative language behaviors seen in ASD.
