The skin is a vital organ providing barrier protection as well as thermal regulation. The three layers, starting with external, are the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat. The dermal layer accounts for about 90% of the integumentary system. The dermis is composed of fibroblasts, blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and sweat glands.

The injury immediately initiates the first process of wound healing, the inflammatory phase. The inflammatory phase lasts about 2 to 5 days.

Scar assessment is usually by vascularity, pigmentation, pliability, area, and height.
