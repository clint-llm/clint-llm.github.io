Interprofessional collaboration is crucial for preventing surgical errors. These interprofessional interventions include safety checklists, briefing and debriefing, error reporting, and effective communication. Nurses are essential in monitoring the patient's vital signs, administering appropriate medications and fluids, and ensuring all necessary steps are taken before and after procedures. Allied health professionals can provide expertise and technology, such as intraoperative imaging, to enhance the precision and accuracy of surgical procedures. Interprofessional team interventions, such as briefing and debriefing, can help ensure that all team members are aware of their roles and responsibilities and can identify areas for improvement to prevent errors in future procedures. By working together in this manner, nursing, allied health, team members, and other healthcare professionals can effectively reduce surgical errors and improve the quality of care for patients.
