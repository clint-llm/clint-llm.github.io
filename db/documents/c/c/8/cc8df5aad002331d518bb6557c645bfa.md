The majority of patients with common variable immunodeficiency have no history of affected family members. In other words, it is mostly a sporadic disease. Genetics plays a role in a minority of CVID. About 10% to 15% of patients have at least one first-degree relative with CVID, immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD), IgG subclass deficiency, or other immunity disorders, including specific antibody deficiency and relative hypogammaglobulinemia. CVID can be both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.

Potential susceptibility loci have been recognized in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC), particularly HLA A1-B8-DR3 and B14-DR1, is associated with CVID.

CVID is also related to gene mutations. Around 25% to 50% of patients presenting with clinical features of CVID have a single gene defect identified.

Several genes mutations that were identified in patients with common variable immunodeficiency include mutations in the genes transmembrane activator and calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), syntax binding protein 2 (STXBP2), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4), nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B1 (NFKB1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PIK3CD), the gene encoding IKAROS (IKZF1), etc.
