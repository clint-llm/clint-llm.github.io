Management of ICVT aims to recanalize the occluded vessel and prevent its propagation to other parts of the venous system.

In patients with evidence of cerebral herniation, neurosurgery should be consulted, and decompressive craniectomy should be considered. In patients who have evidence of worsening neurologic symptoms despite adequate treatment with LMWH or heparin, mechanical thrombectomy or endovascular thrombolysis may also be an option.

In the setting of ICVT, there is a risk of increased intracranial pressure. A neuro-intensive care admission should be considered as frequent ICP monitoring, elevating the head of the bed, administering osmotic agents such as mannitol or hypertonic saline, and allowing permissive hyperventilation with a partial target pressure of carbon dioxide of 30 to 35mmHg may be required. Intravenous dexamethasone is not recommended in treating ICVT. Patients that initially present with seizures, edema, infarction, or hemorrhaging on imaging should be placed on seizure prophylaxis.

Levetiracetam or valproate are the first-line drugs of choice. Once the patient is stabilized and discharged, anticoagulation therapy with either warfarin or dabigatran should be considered for a minimum of three months to prevent recurrence of ICVT.
