Acetazolamide is a diuretic and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor medication used to treat several illnesses. It works to cause an accumulation of carbonic acid by preventing its breakdown. FDA-approved indications include glaucoma, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, congestive heart failure, altitude sickness, periodic paralysis, and epilepsy. In addition, it is used off-label for central sleep apnea, Marfan syndrome, prevention of high-dose methotrexate nephrotoxicity, and prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. This activity outlines the indications, contraindications, interactions, monitoring, and other therapeutic information pertinent to members of an interprofessional team in the care of patients with conditions requiring the use of acetazolamide.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for acetazolamide, both FDA-approved and off-label.
- Describe the mechanism of action of acetazolamide.
- Summarize the adverse event profile of acetazolamide.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with acetazolamide therapy to improve patient outcomes for patients with indicated conditions.
