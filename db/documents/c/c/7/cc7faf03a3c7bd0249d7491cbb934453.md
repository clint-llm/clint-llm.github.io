Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by hyperglycemia, acidosis, and ketonemia. It is a life-threatening complication of diabetes and typically seen in patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus, though it may also occur in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. In most cases, the trigger is new-onset diabetes, an infection, or a lack of compliance with treatment.
