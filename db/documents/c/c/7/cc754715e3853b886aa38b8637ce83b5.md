The lymphatic system is intimately connected to the vascular system and is made up of a large network of lymphatic vessels, lymphatic organs, and lymphoid tissues. The primary lymphoid organs include bone marrow and thymus, as these organs generate lymphocytes, integral to the immune system. The secondary lymphoid organs include lymph nodes and spleen. The cisterna chyli and thoracic duct are some of the largest vessels of the lymphatic system, located within the thorax.

The lymphatic system plays an important role in the regulation and maintenance of tissue fluid balance, immune system, and lipid transport from the alimentary tract. Neoplastic cells are spread to lymph nodes through lymphatic vessels resulting in the progression of cancer into distant tissues. Extracellular fluid enters the lymphatic system through the single layer of endothelial cells with a broken basement membrane, which functions as a one-way valve where increased extracellular fluid pressure will force fluid into the lymphatic system. Collective lymphatic vessels then have a more structured wall allowing lymph to stay within the vessel, which eventually flows through the regional lymph nodes and back into the blood circulation. Many factors result in the propulsion of the lymph through the lymphatic system, including pulsatile blood flow, muscle contraction, pressure gradients, and autonomous lymphatic vessel contractions. There are intraluminal valves within larger lymphatic vessels to help prevent backflow.

Tumors cause a local increase in surrounding lymphatic vasculature, which does not extend into the tumor itself. Instead, local fluid pressure gradients and active signaling from VEGF factors result in the passage of tumor cells into the increased adjacent lymphatic vasculature. The local infiltrating cancer cells will then travel through the collecting lymphatic vessels into the draining lymph nodes. Cancer laden lymph node will cause increased flow resistance, and subsequent rerouting of lymph flow will occur, allowing for a greater spread of metastasis.
