The known major risk factors are age, ethnicity, obesity, and family history.

The overall incidence increases as people get older, but fortunately, cancer aggressiveness decreases with age.

Prostate cancer risk factors include male gender, older age, positive family history, increased height, obesity, hypertension, lack of exercise, persistently elevated testosterone levels, Agent Orange exposure, and ethnicity.

**5 Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors**

These inhibitors, such as finasteride and dutasteride, may decrease low-grade cancer incidence, but they do not appear to affect high-grade risk and thus, do not significantly improve survival. These medications will reduce PSA levels by about 50%, which must be accounted for when comparing sequential prostate-specific antigen (PSA) readings.

**Genetics**

The cause of prostate cancer is unclear, but genetics is certainly involved. Genetic background, ethnicity, and family history are all known to contribute to prostate cancer risk.

- Men in the top 1% high-risk profile category have an almost 6-fold increase in developing prostate cancer compared to controls.

- Men with a first-degree relative (father or brother) with prostate cancer have twice the risk of the general population.

- Risk increases with an affected brother more than with an affected father.

- The risk increases further if the first-degree relative had early-onset (<55 years) disease.

- Men with two first-degree relatives affected have a five-fold greater risk.

- Patients with a strong family history of prostate cancer tend to present with cancer at a younger age (2.9 years) and with more locally advanced disease.

- They also have a higher risk of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy surgery.

- In the United States, black men are more commonly affected than white or Hispanic men, and it is more deadly in blacks.

- The incidence and mortality for Hispanic men with prostate cancer are one-third lower than non-Hispanic whites.

- No single gene is responsible for prostate cancer, although many genes have now been implicated.

- Mutations in BRCA1 and particularly BRCA2 have been associated with breast cancer and prostate cancer.

- P53 mutations in localized prostate cancer are relatively rare and are more frequently seen in metastatic disease. P53 is generally considered a tumor suppressor gene. Its activity produces p21 protein, which acts to slow cell division. Loss of p53 activity reduces tumor androgen sensitivity, increases prostate cancer cell proliferation, and promotes tumor growth. Therefore, p53 mutations are generally considered a late and ominous finding in prostate cancer.

- Over 100 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genes have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. These include: hereditary prostate cancer gene 1, various androgen and Vitamin D receptors, HPC1, HPC2, HPCX, CAPB, mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), mutS homologs 2 and 6 (MSH2 and MSH6, respectively), postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), homeobox B13 (HOXB13), checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), nibrin (NBN), BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the TMPRSS2-ETS gene family; TMPRSS2-ERG and TMPRSS2-ETV1/4 which all tend to promote cancer cell growth.

- A Genetic Risk Score (GRS), including high-risk genetic markers and SNPs, has been proposed to help with the risk stratification of prostate cancer, especially in families; but this type of testing is not yet ready for individual patient diagnostics.

**Diet**

Prostate cancer is generally linked to the consumption of the typical Western diet.

- There is little, if any, evidence that demonstrates an association between trans fat, saturated fat, or carbohydrate intake and prostate cancer.

- However, a lard diet (high in unsaturated fats) has been shown in a mouse model to significantly enhance the progression of prostate cancer.

- Alcohol consumption appears to have little or no effect on prostate cancer risk.

- Vitamin supplements do not lower the risk, and in fact, some vitamins may increase it.

- High calcium intake is associated with advanced prostate cancer.

- Diets high in saturated fat and milk products seem to increase the cancer risk.

- Whole milk consumption after a diagnosis of prostate cancer has been linked to an increased risk of recurrence, especially in overweight men.

- Lower vitamin D blood levels may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer.

- Prostate cancer patients with vitamin D deficiencies have a higher overall and cancer-specific mortality.

- This suggests that vitamin D supplements may be helpful in prostate cancer patients who are deficient in the vitamin.

- Red meat and processed meats also appear to have little effect overall, but some studies suggest increased meat consumption is associated with a higher risk.

- Fish consumption may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not affect the occurrence rate.

- However, high dietary omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil have been linked to an increased risk of clinically significant, high-grade prostate cancer.

- Some evidence supports the belief that a vegetarian diet lowers rates of prostate cancer, but this is not considered a conclusive or significant influence.

- Increased soy products in the diet seem to reduce prostate cancer risk. These products contain phytoestrogens that may have a direct estrogenic effect or by inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase.

- Folic acid supplements have also not been shown to significantly affect the risk of developing prostate cancer.

- Lycopene from tomatoes appears to have a protective effect against prostate cancer.

- Overall, a Mediterranean diet (rich in anti-oxidants from olive oil, tomatoes, etc.) appears to be somewhat helpful in reducing prostate cancer risk.

- It has also been shown to reduce Gleason Grade progression in patients on Active Surveillance for low-grade prostate cancer.

**Chemical Exposure and Medications**

Prostate cancer is linked to some medications, surgical procedures, and medical conditions.

- The use of statins, metformin, and NSAIDs, especially those with anti-COX-2 activity, may decrease prostate cancer risk.

- Metformin inhibits the COX2/PGE2 axis, which blocks prostate cancer progression by suppressing tumor-associated macrophages. This effect is increased in patients on androgen deprivation therapy.

- Regular aspirin, now used by an estimated 23.7 million men, appears to reduce prostate cancer risk.

- This effect may be from both anti-inflammatory activities as well as reduced angiogenesis.

- The beneficial effect of aspirin and NSAIDs appears to be more significant in aggressive prostate cancer and those with prostatitis.

- Veterans who have had Agent Orange exposure tended to present with prostate cancer at a younger age and higher clinical stage than veterans without such contact. However, overall outcomes were similar.

- Agent Orange exposure may increase the risk of prostate cancer recurrence, particularly following surgery.

**Sexual Activity**

Multiple lifetime sexual partners or starting sexual activity early in life increases the risk of prostate cancer. Frequent ejaculation may decrease overall prostate cancer risk, but reducing ejaculatory frequency is not associated with a corresponding increase in the incidence of advanced disease.

**Infections**

Infections may be associated with the incidence and development of prostate cancer.

- Infections with chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis seem to increase the risk of developing prostate cancer.

- Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been proposed to have a role in prostate cancer incidence, but the evidence is inconclusive.

**Vasectomy and Prostate Cancer**

There was once thought to be an association between vasectomy and prostate cancer, but larger follow-up studies have failed to confirm any such relationship.
