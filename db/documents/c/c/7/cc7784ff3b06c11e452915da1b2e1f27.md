Normally, the cilia that line the respiratory tract are responsible for continuously pushing the thin film of mucus which traps different invaders and duct particles upwards for excretion via cough. Due to the abnormally thick mucus produced in the lungs of a patient with CF, the mucociliary escalator is significantly affected. This condition leads to the colonization of bacteria and infection, especially Pseudomonas, which induces inflammation and the accumulation of neutrophils in the affected area. After the initial response, neutrophils die, leading to an increased amount of highly polymerized deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the mucous, leading to even further thickening of the mucous. The presence of DNA material in the mucous results in the plugging of the patient’s airway and further increases the risk of infection. Repeated endobacterial infection and damage due to the neutrophils’ oxidants lead to irreversible damage and, eventually, respiratory failure, the most common cause of death in patients with CF.

Dornase alfa is a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (rhDNase) that cleaves down extracellular long-chain DNA in the sputum reducing mucous viscosity and preventing airway infections and damage to the lung parenchyma. It improves lung function and quality of life. Also, it diminishes exacerbation frequency in children aged six years or older. When inhaled, it mainly exerts its effects locally; it has minimal systemic absorption.
