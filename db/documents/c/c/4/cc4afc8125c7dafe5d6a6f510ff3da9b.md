Levetiracetam is a novel antiepileptic drug used to treat partial, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. In 2000, the FDA approved the use of the oral formulation as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of focal seizures, myoclonic seizures, and primary generalized seizures. In addition, the FDA approved intravenous levetiracetam (LEV) in 2006 for use in patients older than 15 years as adjunctive anticonvulsant therapy when the oral formulation is not tolerated. In Europe, it is approved for treating partial seizures as a single agent and as an add-on treatment for partial seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, and myoclonic seizures.

It is chemically unrelated to other antiepileptic drugs. However, its favorable safety profile, distinct mechanism of action, and fewer drug interactions make it an attractive therapeutic choice for treating seizures.

**Uses**

- Myoclonic seizures: It is approved for adjunctive therapy in treating myoclonic seizures in adults and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in adolescents 12 years and older.

- Partial seizures can be used as adjunctive therapy for treating partial seizures in adults and children one month or older with epilepsy.

- Primary generalized tonic-clonic seizure: Levetiracetam is used for adjunctive therapy to treat a primary generalized tonic conic seizure in adults and children over five years old with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.

- It is sometimes used off-label (non-FDA-approved) for status epilepticus and seizure prophylaxis in subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- Levetiracetam is also used off-label for the prophylaxis of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and supratentorial neurosurgery.

- Levetiracetam is also used off-label used for seizures in palliative care.
