The RGEA supplies blood to the anterior and posterior antrum and lower body of the stomach. The RGEA also supplies inferior branches to the right greater omentum, which can sometimes branch and supply the final segments of the duodenum. The LGEA reaches the stomach about the midpoint of the greater curvature and supplies blood to the anterior and posterior body of the stomach. The LGEA also supplies the greater omentum along with anastomotic branches of the middle colic artery.
