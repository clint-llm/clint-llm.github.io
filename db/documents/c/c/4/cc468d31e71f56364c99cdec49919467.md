The differential diagnosis forÂ PACs is broad due to its non-descript symptoms, physical exam, and imaging findings. Cardiac differentials can be categorized into arrhythmic and non-arrhythmic etiologies. Arrhythmic causes can include premature junctional contractions, premature ventricular contractions, and narrow or wide complex tachycardias. Accordingly, an EKG can be vital in the delineation of these causes. Non-arrhythmic cardiac etiologies include acute coronary syndrome, valvular disorders with a preponderance for mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, heart failure, and pacemaker complications.

Non-cardiac causes may also mimic premature atrial contractions. A clinician should keep in mind psychiatric differentials such as panic attacks and anxiety. Alcohol, use of illicit drugs, and adverse effects of prescribed medications may cause or mimic PACs. Finally, other considerations should be given to pulmonary embolism, hyperthyroidism, and anemia.
