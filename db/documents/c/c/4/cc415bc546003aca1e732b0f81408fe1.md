Pacing pads are positioned on the patient's chest either in the anterolateral position of anteroposterior one. Multiple variations of pacer pad placement are equally effective. "Negative electrode in the left parasternal region, the positive electrode in the right subscapular region; a negative electrode in the left parasternal region, a positive electrode in the left subscapular region; or negative electrode at the cardiac apex or the position of lead V3, a positive electrode in the right parasternal region." As long as the apical/anterior pad is negative, precise electrode placement is not essential. The rate should be set between 60 to 90 beats per minute with the electrical output, also known as the current, set to its lowest setting. The rate should be slowly increased until a pacer spike is seen on the monitor. Continue to increase the rate until a QRS complex follows each spike. This indicates electrical capture. Confirmation of mechanical capture should be done by feeling for a pulse. Additionally, mechanical capture can be confirmed using ultrasound and byÂ observing ventricular contraction. If the patient is conscious, little sedation can be considered to reduce the feeling of discomfort associated with cardiac pacing
