Gallbladder polyps describe several conditions that present as projections into the gallbladder lumen. They may be asymptomatic, or they may be related to symptoms of cholecystitis (right upper abdominal discomfort, nausea and food intolerances). Often gallbladder polyps are found inadvertently on ultrasound or CT scanning or can be incidentally found on pathologic examination of the gallbladder. These polyps can be true neoplastic growths or pseudopolyps of cholesterol balls clinging to the wall of the gallbladder.
