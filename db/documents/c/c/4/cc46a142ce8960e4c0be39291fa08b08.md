In addition to physicians, pharmacists have become more involved in screening patients for syphilis, thus allowing for more patients to receive treatment when necessary. This also prevents further transmission and complications of infection. Dried blood spot (DBS) testing is available for purchase in select pharmacies in the U.K. and the United States. Patients use a lancet on their fingertips to draw blood themselves and place the sample on a testing cassette.

Other interventions to improve the number of conducted diagnostic tests include “task shifting,” in which specific clinical tasks are transferred to healthcare providers other than physicians. For instance, nurses are responsible for conducting syphilis screening in various health clinics in the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia.
