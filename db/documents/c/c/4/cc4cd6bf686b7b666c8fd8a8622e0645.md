Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has become the most popular weight loss procedure in the United States over the last two decades.  Long-term data is now available on the outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy, and it is very promising. The average excess weight loss after five years in a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is reported to be around 60%, and the resolution of comorbidities is excellent.  A meta-analysis in 2017 compared midterm and long-term results between sleeve gastrectomy and roux-en-y gastric bypass.  The conclusion was that in the midterm (3-5 years postoperatively) the two surgeries had similar results in terms of excess weight loss and resolution or improvement of comorbidities. The long-term data demonstrated that gastric bypass eventually did have superior excess weight loss but the improvement in comorbidities remained the same between the two procedures.
