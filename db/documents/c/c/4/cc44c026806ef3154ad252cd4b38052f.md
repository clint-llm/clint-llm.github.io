The iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and lower intercostal nerves supply motor control and sensory feedback to the abdominal wall. The seventh, eighth, and ninth intercostal nerves supply the supraumbilical part of the rectus abdominis and the epigastric skin. The 10th intercostal nerve supplies skin sensation at the level of the umbilicus and motor innervation extending inferiorly to the level of the anterior superior iliac spine. The 11th intercostal nerve supplies sensation below the umbilicus to the level of the inguinal ligament. Finally, the 12th intercostal nerve supplies sensation to the skin, extending inferiorly to the skin above the groin. All of the nerves mentioned above must pass through Camper's fascia to innervate the skin. Thus, edema of the skin can cause disturbances in sensation due to stretching of the nerve endings in the fascial layers of the skin.
