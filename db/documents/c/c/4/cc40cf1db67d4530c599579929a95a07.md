Because of its quick turnaround time and place in various workflows,Â POCT has great clinical significance; the information gleaned from POCT is used routinely to guide patient treatment and management. POCT offers several advantages compared to conventional lab testing, with benefits that vary depending on the specific setting in which the testing is conducted.

POCT, performed near patients, typically enhances patient satisfaction and experience by eliminating the need for sample transport, reducing turnaround time (TAT), and avoiding procedure delays. POCT enables patient counseling, prevents unnecessary treatment escalation, and provides rapid results outside the hospital setting, such as in outpatient testing, to avoid hospitalization or confirm viral illness, thereby reducing antibiotic use.

POCT offers advantages in different test types. For example, fingerstick blood glucose measurements can replace venipuncture for serum testing, requiring less training and posing lower risks of complications and infection, thereby improving patient experience and safety.

POCT has some drawbacks, primarily related to the potential for less accurate results than traditional laboratory testing. This can be attributed to variable personnel training and control over pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical variables, which can be better managed in a laboratory setting. POCT can be more costly on a per-test basis compared to traditional laboratory testing, primarily due to the single-use nature of most POCT devices, which adds to the overall expenses.
