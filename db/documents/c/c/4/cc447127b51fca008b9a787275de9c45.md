Complications can arise from the procedure itself or as an adverse effect to the compound injected into space.

Procedural complications can include damage to surrounding structures such as tendon rupture or local nerve injury, infection such as septic arthritis, pain, hemarthrosis, and re-accumulation of effusion. Septic arthritis is a rare but significant complication. Using a sterile technique minimizes the risk; however, the patient may be placed on prophylactic antibiotics if the risk is determined to be higher.

Possible corticosteroid injection complications include procedural complications and allergic reaction, diabetic hyperglycemia, steroid flare, tendon, or local skin atrophy.
