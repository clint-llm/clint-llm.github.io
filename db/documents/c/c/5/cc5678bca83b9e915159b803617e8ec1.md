An electrophysiology study is performed for the identification of arrhythmias and risk stratification of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. Measurement of baseline intervals, incremental and decremental pacing of the atria and ventricles with an additional pharmacologic challenge, mapping, and catheter ablation are components of an electrophysiology study. This activity highlights the use of electrophysiology by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism physiology of electrophysiology study.
- Identify important parameters measures in an electrophysiology study.
- Outline the role and appropriate use of electrophysiology study in various cardiac pathologies.
- Summarize how interprofessional collaboration can provide benefits and improved patient outcomes when using electrophysiology studies.
