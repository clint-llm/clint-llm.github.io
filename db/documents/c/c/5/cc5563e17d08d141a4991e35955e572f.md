Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury with resulting vocal cord paralysis is a complicated condition that requires an interdisciplinary approach. Physicians and nurses in the primary care setting may be required to evaluate patients presenting with RLN injury from a variety of etiologies and will need to determine the clinical management of the patient. This requires input from additional specialists. Most notably, ENT evaluation with laryngoscopy is necessary as an initial assessment. Radiology is also helpful for any adjunct evaluation with CT imaging.

Once the etiology of the RLN injury is identified, clinical management can be decided by the team. Of note, a recent review article shows the improved reliability and accessibility of reinnervation techniques in the management of RLN injury.
