Catheter ablation is a rapidly evolving field and has proven to be a valid solution for many patients suffering from recurrent arrhythmias. Even though the success of catheter ablation is high for many atrial arrhythmias, the procedure is also associated with a fair number of serious complications that include death, pulmonary vein stenosis, esophageal perforation, heart block requiring a pacemaker, stroke, phrenic nerve injury, and vascular access complications. It is important to educate patients on the potential complications before they decide to move forward with the procedure. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing catheter ablation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for catheter ablation.
- Summarize the contraindications to catheter ablation.
- Identify the complications associated with catheter ablation.
- Explain a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing catheter ablation.
