The PFC can be divided into two broad regions, each with a different function: the lateral PFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and the ventromedial PFC (also known as the orbitofrontal PFC). Lesions in the dorsolateral PFC tend to cause a loss of working memory and/or an inability to perform delayed response tasks. Furthermore, there are impairments in memory recall and the context in which the memory was originally founded. This causes patients to have difficulty switching tasks and dealing with changes in rules during testing. In contrast to the dorsolateral PFC, lesions in the ventromedial PFC result in confabulation. Ventromedial PFC lesions also can present with poor judgment, emotional lability, inappropriate affect, and distractibility.

As previously stated, dysfunction and dysregulation of neurotransmitters and their respective receptors within the PFC are found in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Patients with depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders have been studied.
