Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication that is FDA-approved and indicated in patients with overactive bladder or symptoms of detrusor overactivity, including urinary frequency and urgency. It has been studied and approved for patients over five years of age. It also is indicated in patients with detrusor instability related to neurogenic bladder. Occasionally, oxybutynin indications include treating bladder spasms provoked by indwelling ureteral stents or Foley catheters. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of oxybutynin so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes where anticholinergic therapy is indicated in patients with overactive bladder.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of oxybutynin.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for using oxybutynin.
- Summarize the adverse event profile and contraindications of oxybutynin.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from anticholinergic therapy with oxybutynin.
