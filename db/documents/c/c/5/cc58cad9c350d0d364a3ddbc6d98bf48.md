The initial workup of neonates with suspected sepsis should include complete blood count with differential (CBC-diff), chemistry panel, and cultures of the blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). C- Reactive Protein (CRP) and procalcitonin can be used in conjugation with other factors as a risk stratification to identify infants at risk for serious bacterial infection. Based on the presentation, one could also include a Respiratory Pathogen panel or tests for RSV, influenza, gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens, and possibly a chest x-ray. Rochester criteria, Philadelphia criteria, and Boston criteria all recommend full septic workup in infants less than 28 days of age presenting with fever regardless of other risk factors.

After the wide use of the streptococcal vaccination, the prevalence of bacteremia in febrile infants has decreased. Gomez et al. validated the “Step by Step” approach,**Greenhow et al. concluded that 24% of well-appearing neonates with fever despite having no laboratory studies done and none of them had delayed bacteremia or meningitis**.
