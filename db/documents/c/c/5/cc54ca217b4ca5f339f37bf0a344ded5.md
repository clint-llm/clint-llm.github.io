White rami communicantes derive from trunk neural crest cells. These neural crest cells migrate ventrally from the dorsal portion of the neural tube and give rise to neuroblasts. Some of the sympathetic neuroblasts synapse with fibers of the spinal cord to form the white rami communicantes and other portions of the sympathetic nervous system.
