Vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC) is the term applied to women who undergo vaginal delivery following cesarean delivery in a prior pregnancy. Patients desiring VBAC delivery undergo a trial of labor (TOL) or trial of labor after cesareanÂ section (TOLAC). While TOL is an acceptable, generally safe practice, serious, potential complications include uterine rupture or dehiscence with associated maternal and/or neonatal morbidity. Providers caring for patients with prior cesarean section need to be aware of and able to counsel patients regarding risks and benefits of attempting TOL, factors which affect the likelihood of successful vaginal delivery, and knowledgeable regarding intrapartum management of patients undergoing TOLAC.
