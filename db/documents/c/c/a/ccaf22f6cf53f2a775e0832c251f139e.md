This condition occurs when the loss of proteins through the gastrointestinal tract exceeds the synthesis of proteins by the body, leading to hypoproteinemia. Normally most of the proteins entering the gut are degraded into amino acids and are reabsorbed. In conditions causing inflammation and erosions of the gastrointestinal tract, the mucosal permeability increases, leading to excessive leakage of serum proteins into the gut, and poor reabsorption. This state leads to hypoproteinemia. In diseases causing increased lymphatic pressure and lymphatic obstruction, there is an increased leak of lymph into the gastrointestinal tract and decreased absorption of chylomicrons, resulting in a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and protein loss.
