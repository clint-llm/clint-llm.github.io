On presentation, more than half of the patients with Cushing disease have a microadenoma with a diameter of less than 5 mm.

Biochemical diagnostic tests to confirm hypercortisolism include salivary and blood serum cortisol testing, 24-hour urinary-free cortisol testing, and low-dose overnight dexamethasone suppression testing.

Two or more positive initial screening tests in a patient with a high pretest probability of Cushing disease confirms the biochemical diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.

For high-dose 48-hour dexamethasone suppression testing, a plasma cortisol level above 50 nmol/L (measured 48-hours after either administration of dexamethasone 2 mg by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours, or 48-hours after one dose of 8 mg is given) is indicative of Cushing disease.

The most accurate test used to differentiate a pituitary adenoma from ectopic or adrenal Cushing syndrome is inferior petrosal sinus sampling.Â This invasive method measures the difference in the level of ACTH found in the inferior petrosal sinus (where the pituitary gland drains) as compared to the periphery.
