The complete anatomy of the vascular system is beyond the scope of this article. Key anatomical structures relevant to angiography will be discussed.

The aorta starts at the aortic root, which in healthy individuals measures up to 4.3 cm.

- The brachiocephalic trunk divides to form the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries.

- The left common carotid artery further divides to form the internal and external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery, together with the vertebral artery, will form the circle of Wilis, while the external carotid artery gives off the superior thyroid artery, the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the lingual artery. Other branches of the external carotid artery include the facial artery, the occipital artery, the posterior auricular artery, the maxillary artery, and the superficial temporal artery

- The left subclavian artery

The subclavian artery is divided into three sections by the scalenus anterior muscle. The first part gives off the vertebral artery, which supplies blood to the vertebrobasilar system and the circle of Willis. The other arteries that originate from the first part are the internal mammary artery and the thyrocervical trunk. The costocervical trunk arises from the second part of the subclavian and the dorsal scapular artery from the third part. The subclavian artery changes its name to the axillary artery after passing over the first rib and supplies the upper extremity.

The abdominal aorta has three anterior unpaired branches to the viscera: coeliac axis (giving off the hepatic artery, splenic artery, and left gastric artery); the superior mesenteric artery; and the inferior mesenteric artery. The abdominal aorta also has three important lateral paired branches to the viscera: the suprarenal artery, the renal artery, and the testicular or ovarian artery. The abdominal aorta terminates as common iliac arteries, which further bifurcates to form internal and external iliac arteries. The internal iliac artery divides into the anterior and posterior divisions to supply the pelvic and perineal organs, while the external iliac artery courses below the inguinal ligament to form the femoral artery. The femoral artery supplies the lower extremity. The femoral and radial arteries are common sites of angiography catheter insertion.

A limitation of angiography is its inherent limitations of obtaining images that are a lumenogram compared with intravascular imaging modalities such as intravascular ultrasound, particularly in regard to the identification of arterial calcification.
