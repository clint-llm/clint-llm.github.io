Patients should be educated on the possible etiologies and concomitant shoulder pathologies seen in association with proximal biceps pathologies. A point of emphasis should be given to including any LHBT pathology that may be seen in association with other known shoulder pathologies. For example, a patient should be educated on the injury affecting the rotator cuff itself and the potential for co-existing injury to the biceps tendon. A discussion should be had, especially with older patient populations, that the concomitant procedure to be planned (i.e., the tenotomy or tenodesis procedure) may or may not occur. In doing so, the patient’s postoperative expectations can be adequately managed before performing surgery.
