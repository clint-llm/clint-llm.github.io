HIV/ AIDS patients with a low CD4 count have decreased humoral and cellular immunity, predisposing them to opportunistic infections. These diseases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV/AIDS. This activity will highlight the prevalence and risk factors of common opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. It will proved a concise review for an interprofessional team of physicians, specialists, and nurses in the current guidelines for prophylactic antibiotic use and vaccinations against common opportunistic infections.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology and risk factors of opportunistic infections.
- Describe the role of antiviral therapy, vaccinations and immunizations in the prevention of opportunistic infections. 
- Identify the development of immune reconstitution syndrome after initiation of HAART. 
- Outline the common opportunistic infections in HIV patients, risk factors for exposure and prophylactic antibiotics.
