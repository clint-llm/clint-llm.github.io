Mild cases of serotonin syndrome, with subtle symptoms such as tremor or restlessness, are often overlooked completely or attributed to anxiety or the underlying psychiatric condition. When gastrointestinal symptoms are present, symptoms often are attributed to food poisoning or the flu. Serious cases share many common features with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, sympathomimetic toxicity, or infectious causes such as meningitis or encephalitis. NMS can cause urinary incontinence. Careful medication history and diagnostic testing will help delimitate the cause.
