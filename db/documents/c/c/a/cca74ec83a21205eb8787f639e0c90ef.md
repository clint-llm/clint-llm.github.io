**Biophysical Profile**

Amniotic fluid volume is also part of the fetal biophysical profile, a special type of ultrasound used to assess fetal well-being. The biophysical profile has four sonographic components, each of which must be seen within 30 minutes of starting the ultrasound:

- Fetal breathing (continuous movement of the fetal diaphragm for at least 30 seconds)

- Fetal movement (at least three discrete movements of the fetal body or limbs)

- Fetal tone (at least one active extension of a fetal limb with the return to flexion, or opening and closing of the fetal hand)

- Amniotic fluid volume (single deepest pocket of at least 2 cm)

If available, a fetal non-stress test (fetal heart rate tracing) is also performed with theÂ biophysical profile, for a total of five components.

A healthy, term fetus that is not under physiologic stress would be expected to demonstrate all four of these behaviors on ultrasound. Fetuses that are preterm may not display all of these behaviors, so management of pregnancies in which the fetus does not demonstrate all four of the behaviors described depends on the gestational age, and on which factors are abnormal.
