Plaque psoriasis is an unpredictable disorder. Not only is there no cure, but it is difficult to know who will relapse, how long the active disease will last or how frequently the patient will have remissions. The disorder is not life-threatening but with constant relapses, it can significantly affect the quality of life. Poor prognostic factors include stress, family history and early onset of symptoms. Both warm weather and sunlight have benefits and improve the symptoms. If the disorder becomes pustular, then mortality rates are high. In addition, all treatments have major adverse effects including skin cancers, liver damage and susceptibility to infections. The biggest morbidity is from poor aesthetics which can cause depression, isolation, and withdrawal from society.

Finally, psoriasis is associated with obesity and adverse cardiac events.
