Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a benign, locally proliferating disease, that tends to arise in the skin of the head and neck, particularly in the periauricular area and the scalp. Nonetheless, lesions can occur on any site of the body including extremities, trunk, oral and genital mucosa, and orbit.

ALHE presents with dermal and/or subcutaneous, single or multiple, pink to red-brown papules and/or nodules of variable size ranging from a few to multiple centimeters. The lesions are most commonly symptomatic, accompanied by pruritus, bleeding and/or pain. Regional lymphadenopathy is rarely associated. The lesions tend to be persistent and recurrent. However, there are also reports of spontaneous remissions. Early age of onset disease characteristically has a longer duration and multiple bilateral lesions, more prone to bleeding, pain, and pruritus.

Dermoscopy of ALHE lesions reveals a polymorphous vascular pattern composed of regularly distributed dotted and linear vessels, over a concomitant pink to a red background.
