Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy presents in patients with a suppressed immune system.  Since this is a fatal condition and the therapeutic regimens that have been explored so far have not been found to be effective, it is crucial to evaluate patients who are immunosuppressed regularly. Primary care providers play a crucial role in evaluating patients with AIDS, malignancies, transplant recipients, those with MS or Crohn disease, and identifying abnormal neurological signs and symptoms. Since symptoms present in a subacute manner paying close heed to the history and examination can provide a diagnosis early on in the disease.

Although treatment regimens continue to be studied, early identification and initiation of ART in AIDS patients have been found to improve survival. Alerting neurologists and infectious disease specialists to the concerns of the primary care provider can be beneficial in determining the optimum course of management. At this juncture, pharmacists, nurses, and other health care providers contribute to the interprofessional decisions. Therefore, interdisciplinary communication is important in treating patients with PML.
