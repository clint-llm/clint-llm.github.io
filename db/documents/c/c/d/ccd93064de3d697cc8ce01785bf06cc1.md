Subarachnoid hemorrhages are true emergencies that demand prompt treatment. Subarachnoid hemorrhages result from a medical aneurysmal rupture or traumatic head injury, resulting in bleeding in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Unfortunately, subarachnoid hemorrhages are often associated with poor outcomes. Nearly half of patients presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days, and a third of those who survive have complications. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhages and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in caring for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the differential diagnosis for subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient with suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- Describe treatment considerations for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages.
- Summarize the roles of various interprofessional team members in caring for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages and improving chances for survival and recovery.
