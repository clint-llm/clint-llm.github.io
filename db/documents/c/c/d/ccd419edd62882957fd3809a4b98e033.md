Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a linear dsDNA virus that is a member of the Alphaherpesviridae subfamily. HSV-1 is responsible for establishing primary and recurrent vesicular eruptions, primarily in the orolabial and genital mucosa. HSV-1 infection has a wide variety of presentations, including orolabial herpes, herpetic sycosis (HSV folliculitis), herpes gladiatorum, herpetic whitlow, ocular HSV infection, herpes encephalitis, Kaposi varicelliform eruption (eczema herpeticum), and severe or chronic HSV infection. Antiviral therapy limits the course of HSV infection. This activity describes the evaluation, and treatment herpes simplex virus type 1 and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of a herpes type 1 infection.
- Review the risk factors for herpes type 1 infection.
- Explain the presentation of a patient with herpes type 1 infection.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by the herpes type 1 virus infection.
