Dens evaginatus, or a “talon cusp,” presents as an outcropped growth of normal tooth structure, commonly affecting the lingual aspect of an anterior maxillary tooth. Talon cusps have been classified into three categories with distinct clinical presentations.

Dens invaginatus has various clinical presentations, which depend on the severity of the in-folding or the phase of morphodifferentiation where the invagination occurs. Several classifications exist to describe the extent of the in-folded tissue. The most utilized system is the Oehlers classification due to its ease of application.

The various clinical presentations of amelogenesis imperfecta depend on the gene that is mutated.

Hypominerazlied amelogenesis imperfecta, or type III, is the most severe form of amelogenesis imperfecta due to the reduced enamel mineral content. Teeth with this condition are very sensitive to temperature and tactile pressure, presenting clinically with dark yellow or brown enamel color. On radiographic examination, enamel and dentin may appear to have the same radiodensity.

The clinical presentation of dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) depends on the extent of the disruption during dentinogenesis. DI is classified into three types based on clinical and radiographic features.
