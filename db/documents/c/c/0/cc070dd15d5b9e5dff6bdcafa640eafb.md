The falciform ligament derives from the ventral mesentery, which is a part of the embryological foregut and forms a connection between the ventral abdominal wall and the liver. The umbilical vein, which is within the umbilical cord, carries oxygen-rich blood from the placenta to the fetal liver. Once the child is born, the umbilical vein degenerates because maternal-fetal circulation is no longer needed to sustain fetal life as the placenta is no longer intact. After birth, the umbilical vein remnant forms the round ligament of the liver, which in adults, contains paraumbilical veins.
