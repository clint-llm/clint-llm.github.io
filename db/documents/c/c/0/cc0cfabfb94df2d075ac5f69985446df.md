Two percent to 12% of routine gallbladder pathology specimens may contain gallbladder polyps, but true adenomatous polyps are present in less than 0.5% of all gallbladder specimens. Cholesterol polyps show an increased cholesterol content and are associated with gallbladder cholesterolosis and sludge. Inflammatory polyps exhibit inflammation of the gallbladder wall with Rotatinski- Aschoff bodies, and findings of acute or chronic cholecystitis. True adenomatous polyps have a glandular histology. Malignant polyps can demonstrate cancerous changes characteristic of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenoacanthoma. The degree of malignant differentiation usually correlates to polyp size.
