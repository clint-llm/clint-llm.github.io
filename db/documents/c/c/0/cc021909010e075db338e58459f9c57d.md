PDMPs have been implemented in 49 of 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 1 United States territory (Guam).

One model is operated through non-mandated use, where prescribers and dispensers access the database voluntarily. Another model involves proactive reporting, where in addition to voluntarily checking databases, prescribers and dispensers also receive unsolicited reports on patients obtaining a dangerous dose or combination of controlled substances, or if they are acquiring prescriptions from multiple providers.

Features of well-functioning and resourceful PDMPs have been described by the CDC, noting requirements to have providers check a state PDMP report prior to prescribing a controlled substance (mandated model), providing real-time data on when controlled substances are dispensed, and permitting access to state health departments to analyze the behavior of the opioid epidemic and assess interventions (Drug Overdose Data, CDC).

Access to PDMP data varies per state law, although healthcare prescribers and pharmacists are usually allowed to obtain reports on patients they are directly treating. Some states provide reports to law enforcement organizations, state Medicaid programs, licensing and regulatory boards, medical examiners, and various research programs.
