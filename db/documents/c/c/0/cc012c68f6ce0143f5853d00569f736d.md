Familial combined hyperlipidemia is believed to be caused by an underlying pathophysiological mechanism characterized by hepatic overproduction of lipoprotein particles containing apoB-100, namely VLDL and LDL. This results in elevated levels of plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoB. Furthermore, individuals with FCH exhibit reduced HDL cholesterol levels and an increase in small dense LDL (sdLDL) and remnant lipoprotein particles.

Initially, it was believed that FCH was inherited through a dominant monogenic manner. However, subsequent studies proposed a more complex polygenic inheritance to explain the variability in the lipid phenotype. Several loci, specifically at 9p, 16q, and 11q, have been linked to LDL size in FCH patients.

Patients with FCH are noted to have delayed clearance of chylomicron and VLDL remnants.

Impairment in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) can increase LDL levels. Mutations in the LDLR may lead to FCH.
