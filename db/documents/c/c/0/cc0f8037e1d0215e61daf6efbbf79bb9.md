The prognosis for patients with CTK may be fair to good, as the central opacity eventually clears to a degree, and stromal thickness increases with time. However, residual hyperopic defects often remain, which may be disappointing for patients whose initial desire to undergoing excimer laser ablation was uncorrected emmetropia. However, patients may undergo post-surgical enhancement after the opacity remits to reduce residual striae and correct persistent hyperopia without the recurrence of CTK.
