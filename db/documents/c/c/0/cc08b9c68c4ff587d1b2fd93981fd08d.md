An abdominal wall hernia consists of a protrusion of intra-abdominal tissue through a fascial defect in the abdominal wall. Inguinal hernias are very common (approximately 75% of abdominal wall hernias) with other types of hernias occurring at weak areas of abdominal wall fascia.Typically a hernia consists of visceral contents, a peritoneal sac, and overlying tissue (e.g., skin, subcutaneous tissue). This activity describes the pathophysiology that leads to inguinal hernias and reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing open inguinal hernia repair. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures pertinent to open inguinal hernia repair.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with an inguinal hernia.
- Explain how to perform an open inguinal hernia repair.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies to optimize care coordination and communication to enhance the management of inguinal hernias and improve patient outcomes.
