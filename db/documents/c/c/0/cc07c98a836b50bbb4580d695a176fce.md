Since the thenar eminence is on the radial side of the palm, it received its blood supply mainly from the superficial palmar arch. The superficial palmar arch derives from the radial artery. This arch will go onto and perfuse the opponens pollicis muscle and the other muscle in the thenar compartment. The deep palmar arch formed from the ulnar artery also provides collateral blood flow to the thenar muscles.

The lymphatic drainage of the hand drains into the cubital lymph nodes and then to the axillary lymph nodes. The axillary lymph nodes will drain into the right lymphatic duct on the right upper limb. The thoracic duct will be the proximal drainage site for the left upper limb.
