FXIII deficiency can either be congenital or acquired.

**Congenital FXIII Deficiency**

- It can occur due to mutation in either FXIII-A (type 2) or FXIII-B (type 1) genes. FXIII-A (Type 2) defect accounts for 95% of all FXIII bleeding disorders.

- The pattern of disease inheritance is autosomal recessive.

- Missense mutations are most common amongst all genetic defects.

- The A subunit gene is located on chromosome 6p24-p25 and contains 15 exons and 14 introns. To date, 153 mutations have been reported, of which missense mutations occur in more than half of cases.

- The B subunit gene is located on chromosome 1q31-32.1 and contains 12 exons and 11 introns; 16 mutations, mostly missense, have been reported.

- The B-subunit acts as a carrier for subunit A. Hence, deficiency or defect of subunit B makes the FXIII A2-B2 complex unstable and leads to a relative deficiency of subunit A. The patients with subunit B deficiency have a less severe bleeding phenotype with FXIII activity reduced to 5% to 10%.

**Acquired FXIII Deficiency**

Acquired FXIII deficiency can be secondary to autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. and non-immune conditions (hyper-consumption and hypo-synthesis)

- Autoimmune conditions

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
- Malignancy
- Medication- isoniazid
- Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance

- Hyper-consumption

- Surgery
- Disseminated intravascular consumption
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Henoch-Schönlein purpura
- Sepsis
- Thrombosis

- Hypo-synthesis

- Liver disease
- Leukemia
- Medications-valproic acid, tocilizumab
