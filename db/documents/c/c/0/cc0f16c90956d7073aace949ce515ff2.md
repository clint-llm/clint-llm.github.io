Patients with DIGO will report a past medical history of hypertension, angina, epilepsy, or recent organ transplant. They typically present with gingival enlargement, pain during mastication, and cosmetic disfigurement one to three months after starting treatment with one of the drugs associated with the disease.

Not all drug-induced gingival overgrowth lesions are fibrotic like it was previously believed. According to histological and histomorphometric analyses, phenytoin-induced lesions are the most fibrotic. Cyclosporin-induced lesions are more inflamed and show a low fibrotic component, and nifedipine lesions are mixed.

**Clinical Findings**

- Firm, painless, nodular enlargement of the interdental papilla, limited to the keratinized portions of the gingiva and extending to the facial and lingual gingival margins.

- In severe cases, a huge fold of hypertrophied gingival tissue is observed covering the crowns.

- If no secondary inflammation is present, it appears firm and pale pink with minute lobulations, pouting from underneath the gingival margin, delineated by a groove of tissue that does not bleed on touch.

- If secondary inflammation exists, the gingiva appears smooth, and red or bluish-red.

- The enlargement is generalized, but it is usually greater in the anterior regions.

- Typically, it is not seen in edentulous areas.

- The gingival overgrowth disappears when teeth are extracted.
