The management of hyperchloremic acidosis is with an interprofessional team that consists of a nephrologist, internist, endocrinologist, cardiologist, and a pulmonologist. The acidosis can result in many symptoms and even lead to cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. The key is to manage the primary condition causing the hyperchloremic acidosis. Patients with respiratory and cardiac symptoms may need close monitoring, and the acidosis may have to be reversed with bicarbonate. It is vital to rule out any medication causing the acidosis. For most patients, the prognosis is okay as long as the primary condition is managed. Failure to manage the primary condition can lead to high morbidity and mortality.
