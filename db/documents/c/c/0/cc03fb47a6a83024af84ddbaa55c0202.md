Tricuspid valve stenosis is a rare disorder and is best managed by an interprofessional team. In most cases, mild cases of tricuspid stenosis are well tolerated and can be managed medically. Severe cases may require surgery. While percutaneous dilatation of the leaflets can be undertaken, recurrence is common. Choosing between percutaneous or open surgical treatment depends on the patient’s frailty, comorbid conditions, valve morphology, and regional expertise. Optimal management requires a multidisciplinary team that includes a cardiac surgeon, interventional cardiologist, and cardiovascular imaging specialist.

The interprofessional team in tricuspid stenosis cases includes the cardiologist, family clinician, and nursing staff. Clinicians will coordinate their activities, and nurses are often invaluable in ensuring that communication between specialties and the patient is accomplished efficiently. Nurses also help monitor patients, offer patient counsel about their condition, and can enlist the pharmacist for medication reconciliation if the condition requires medical care. All care team members must maintain accurate and updated records, so everyone on the case has the most recent data. Every team member can also make valuable contributions and should be treated as a respected interprofessional team member. This coordinated approach to care will yield optimal patient outcomes.
