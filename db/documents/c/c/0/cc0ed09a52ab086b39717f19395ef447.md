The mechanism of RNA translation into protein is carried out in three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. During initiation, a tRNA and ribosome join an mRNA. The start codon, AUG, codes for methionine and will always be the first amino acid in the sequence. After initiation, the ribosome moves along the mRNA in the 5’-3’ direction reading the codons and binding tRNAs carrying the respective amino acids for which the codons are coding. The sequence of amino acids progressively becomes longer and terminates upon reaching a stop codon. The stop codons are UAG, UAA, and UGA. The polypeptide is then released from the ribosomal complex and modified into an active protein. In eukaryotic cells, translation occurs after transcription, while in prokaryotic cells, transcription and translation occur simultaneously.
