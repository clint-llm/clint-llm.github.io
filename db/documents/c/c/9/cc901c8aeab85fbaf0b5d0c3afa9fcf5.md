Most commonly, these abscesses arise as a late complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Pathogens from the cervical infection or vaginal infection ascend first to the endometrium and then travel through the fallopian tubes into the peritoneal cavity where they form a walled-off mass. The majority of cases have associated peritonitis. Lastly, TOAs can arise from the extension of an infected adjacent organ, most commonly the appendix, less commonly, hematogenous spread from a distant nidus of infection, or as an association with pelvic organ cancer.

Risk factors for a TOA are similar to those of PID and include reproductive age, IUD insertion, multiple sexual partners, and a history of a prior episode of PID. The differential diagnosis for TOA often includes appendicitis, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, PID, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, pyelonephritis, and cystitis.
