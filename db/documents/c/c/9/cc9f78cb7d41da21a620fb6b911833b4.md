Hypothalamic hamartomas occur as sporadic abnormalities unlinked with congenital malformations nor family history. Nearly 95% of cases are sporadic, although 5% of cases are associated with Pallister-Hall syndrome, which presents with dysmorphology in the hands, feet (postaxial polydactyly and syndactyly), larynx (bifid epiglottis), anus, and hypothalamus. The syndrome is associated with a mutation in the GLI3 gene expressing a transcription factor in the sonic hedgehog intracellular pathway.
