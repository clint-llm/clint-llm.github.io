Patients with symptoms consistent with encephalitis are initially evaluated with neuroimaging and lumbar puncture. MRI or CT may show bilateral thalamic edema, lesions, or hemorrhage. A lumbar puncture may be significant for elevated opening pressure, elevated protein, and normal glucose. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis or hyponatremia. These findings are common in many forms of encephalitis or viral meningitis. If clinically suspected based on travel history, Japanese encephalitis virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) may be detected using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) on serum or cerebrospinal fluid. Humans are dead-end hosts with low, transient viral loads making virus isolation difficult.
