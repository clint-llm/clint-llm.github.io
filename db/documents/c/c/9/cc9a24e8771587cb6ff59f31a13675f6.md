Following a Vickers ligament release and physeal bar excision, a short arm orthosis is recommended for three to four weeks, followed by progressive range of motion and weight-bearing. Following an ulnar shortening or dome osteotomy, long-arm immobilization is recommended for two weeks, followed by an additional four weeks of short-arm immobilization. After a total of six weeks of immobilization, an active range of motion is allowed withÂ progression to weight-bearing at three months.
