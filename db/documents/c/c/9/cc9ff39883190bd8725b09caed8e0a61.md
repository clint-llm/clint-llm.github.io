There are no specific patient positioning requirements to optimize the imaging of amyloidosis. Positioning that maximizes patient comfort coupled with using standardized views is considered sufficient. Minimizing unnecessary radiation dosage to the patient can be achieved by reducing photon energy and quantity, optimizing the source-to-object distance, maximizing collimation and filtration, and ensuring the patient is within the isocenter of the field of view.

Radiographic positioning should correspond to the standard imaging plane view types associated with the specific area of interest, such as anterior-posterior and lateral views of the tibia and fibula.

Optimization of patient positioning during the use of ultrasound prioritizes patient comfort while positioning the area of interest in such a way as to accommodate the probe and planned sonographic window.
