Infection typically occurs after the colonization of the oropharynx and nasopharynx of healthy individuals. Inhalation of these colonies causes the infection of the lower airways. Infection, typically will not result unless a patient has predisposed risk factors, a bolus of infectious cells or due to a particularlyÂ virulent strain of S. pneumoniae.

The capsule plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It is made up of polysaccharides and surrounds the cell wall. It helps in escaping phagocytosis by preventing the access of granulocytes to the underlying cell wall. These polysaccharides of the capsule help in the identification and serotyping of the bacteria. Many serotypes have been detected, 6, 14, 18, 19 and 23 are the most common ones causing the infection. On culture media, the virulence of these strains can be identified by their appearance, opaque and transparent types. Transparent type usually colonizes in nasopharynx while the opaque type is present in the lung, brain and bloodstream infection.

The second important characteristic of the pathogenicity of Streptococcus pneumoniae is its ability to adhere to the respiratory epithelium and invasion.

The severity of the pneumococcal disease is due to significant inflammatory response induced by the activation of complement pathways and cytokine release by cell wall proteins, autolysin, the capsular polysaccharides and DNA released by bacterial end products.
