Since there is no known antidote for tetrodotoxin, the management is an interprofessional. All symptomatic patients must be monitored closely in the ICU and resuscitated according to the trauma ABCDE protocol. Specialists should be involved depending on the organ involved. Healthcare professionals use neostigmine to treat acute respiratory failure from tetrodotoxin poisoning. However, a review of the current literature indicates that there is not enough data to provide evidence for or against this practice. No patient should be discharged until he or she has been observed for at least 12-24 hours in an ICU setting. The prognosis for most patients is good. (Level V)
