Numerous molecular markers can be used to label and quantify Purkinje cells. One specific one is L7/Pcp2, a G-protein signaling component only found in Purkinje cell dendrites and proximal axons. Calbindin D28K is also specific to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Other reasonably specific markers include PCD6, Pep19/Pcp4, and GAD67.

A particularly interesting marker is zebrin-II, so named because staining a whole cerebellum with it results in a very stereotypical striped pattern with strong conservation between individuals and species. The zebrin stripes appear to correlate with different functional units of the cerebellum, and indeed the expression of several other genes exactly correlates with zebrin expression. Zebrin-II positive cells also appear to be slightly more resilient to various insults to the Purkinje cells.
