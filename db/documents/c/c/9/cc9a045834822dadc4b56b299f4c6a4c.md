Cirrhosis is characterized by fibrosis and nodule formation of the liver secondary to chronic injury, leading to alteration of the normal lobular organization of the liver. Various insults can injure the liver, including viral infections, toxins, hereditary conditions, or autoimmune processes. With each injury, the liver forms scar tissue (fibrosis), initially without losing its function. After a chronic injury, most of the liver tissue becomes fibrotic, leading to loss of function and the development of cirrhosis. This activity reviews the causes, evaluation, and management of hepatic cirrhosis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cirrhosis.
- Identify the etiology of cirrhosis.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with cirrhosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for cirrhotic patients.
