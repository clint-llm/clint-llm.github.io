Unfortunately, research remains lacking in regards to current strategies to manage PCH. Therefore, options for consideration include using typical medications seen in the treatment of headaches with similar phenotypes. A list of these medications is beyond this review's scope, but, in the neurological population, care must be taken when using medications that may obscure the ability to monitor neurologic responses.

This is of particular importance when opioids are prescribed. They remain a heavily relied upon option for moderate to severe pain, even with the risk of addiction, cognitive clouding, and respiratory depression. Worth noting is the ability to combine other analgesics with opioids to lessen the chance of adverse events. Some combinations in past studies include fentanyl and ketorolac or tramadol and diclofenac.

Regarding prophylaxis, one single-center, randomized, the blinded trial found that a preoperative dose of 100 mg of diclofenac decreased the headache's intensity on postoperative day one and up to post-op day 5 for patients with infratentorial surgeries. Still, caution must be exercised due to the potential to increase the risk of bleeding using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

Other interventions have been studied, either for PCH or post-craniotomy pain in general, but warrant more research before standardizing their use in these patients. These include transcutaneous electrical acupuncture stimulation, nerve blocks, gabapentinoids, COX inhibitors, and dexmedetomidine, a presynaptic alpha two adrenoceptor antagonist.

In the chronic phase, a shift to more non-pharmacological adjuncts may be considered. Alternatives to consider are physical therapy, acupuncture, TENS units, hot or cold packs, massage, or bio-behavioral interventions. A small case series of four patients demonstrated a benefit using Botulinum toxin-A to treat delayed onset PCH, but more research is needed, similar to the other treatments.
