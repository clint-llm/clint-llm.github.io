Posterior spinal decompression is one of the most common surgical procedures to release neural structures when nonoperative treatment has failed and is usually the procedure performed for degenerative conditions such as spinal stenosis, especially in middle-aged and elderly patients.

Currently, there are several techniques to accomplish posterior spinal decompression, such as open or minimally invasive laminectomy, hemilaminectomy, laminotomies, and laminoplasty. Decompression techniques classify as direct and indirect; direct procedures involve those techniques with visualization of the dural sac during the surgery, such as laminectomy. On the other hand, indirect decompression takes place without dural sac visualization. Laminectomy alone or associated with fusion is one of the most common procedures performed by a spinal surgeon.

The goals of the surgery include:

- Reduce neurological claudication

- Halt clinical deficits and

- Promote functional ambulation.
