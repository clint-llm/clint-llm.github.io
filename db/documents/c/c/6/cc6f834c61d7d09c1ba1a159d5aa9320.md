Headaches are broadly classified as primary or secondary. Primary headaches are those with no identifiable underlying cause. Secondary headaches are the result of other underlying pathology.

The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III) classifies headaches.

- Primary headache, including tension, migraine, and cluster

- Secondary headache, including potentially life-threatening etiologies such as traumatic brain injury and vascular disorders

- Cranial neuropathies, such as trigeminal neuralgia

Headache can be a symptom of many underlying pathologies, some of which can lead to severe disability and mortality.

- Hypertensive emergencies

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension

- Carotid or vertebrobasilar dissection

- Space occupying lesions (tumors, abscesses, cysts)

- Acute hydrocephalus

- Dural sinus thrombosis

- Intracranial hemorrhage

- Giant cell (temporal) arteritis

- Cerebrovascular accident or stroke

- Meningitis and encephalitis
