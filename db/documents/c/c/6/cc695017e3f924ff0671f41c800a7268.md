The differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with GERD can be quite extensive and is the reason for such a thorough work-up prior to operative therapy. Typical heartburn is described as an epigastric caustic or burning sensation. This does not typically radiate to the back or be described as a sensation of pressure. This is an important part of the history and physical as it can distinguish GERD from other pathologies such as pancreatitis or acute coronary syndrome.

Extra-esophageal symptoms of GERD arise from the respiratory tract and manifests asÂ laryngeal or pulmonary symptoms. It can be difficult to distinguish the etiology of such symptoms, and it is important to have a high suspicion for primary esophageal motility disorders, gastric or esophageal cancer, and primary lung disease. If a patient presents with such symptoms and the primary work-up is negative, it is important to explore other etiologies. Often times consultation to a pulmonologist is warranted.
