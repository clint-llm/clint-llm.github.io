The blood supply to the originates from branches off of the thyroid arteries. The superior thyroid artery branches from the external carotid artery inferior to the greater cornu of the hyoid bone and gives rise to two arteries of the larynx: the superior laryngeal artery and the cricothyroid artery.

Lymphatic drainage is important to understand due to the aggressive metastasis of some laryngeal cancers. Though the lymphatic drainage can vary individually, there are understood consistencies. Supraglottic structures drain lymph to the deep cervical lymph nodes, which can further subdivide into levels. Subglottic structures drain lymph to the paratracheal and pretracheal lymph nodes.
