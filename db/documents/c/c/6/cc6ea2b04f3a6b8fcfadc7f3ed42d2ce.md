Prescribers must be cautious with it comes to dosing to achieve diuresis. A black box warning states each loop diuretic is a potent diuretic and, at higher dosages, could lead to a profound diuresis with water and electrolyte depletion. Careful medical supervision is necessary as adjustments to these drugs should be according to the patient's needs. Electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia, can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Electrolyte requires monitoring periodically to assess diuretic tolerance.

Ototoxicity can occur with any of the loop diuretics, especially with the concomitant use of aminoglycosides and renal impairment. Furosemide has an increased risk for ototoxicity in those with hypoproteinemia (those with nephrotic syndrome). Ethacrynic acid has been known to have a more ototoxic potential than the other members and can lead to permanent sensorineural hearing loss without proper caution of its use, especially concomitantly with another loop diuretic.

Hyperuricemia secondary to loop diuretic use can result in acute gout attacks or flares.

Caution is necessary for patients known to have a sulfonamide allergy. There is a low potential for cross-allergenicity between the two drugs when taken with a loop diuretic, although this has not received extensive study. Allergic reactions could include a maculopapular rash, and extra consideration is necessary before giving a loop diuretic in patients with a history of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Since ethacrynic acid is not a sulfonamide derivative like the other members of loop diuretics, it is a safer diuretic to use in a patient with a potential sulfonamide allergy.

In those with advanced renal failure with symptoms of fluid overload, physicians should closely monitor fluid status and renal function to prevent the onset of oliguria, BUN, creatinine increases, and azotemia. Close management of aggressive diuresis requires careful surveillance.

Care is necessary when weighing risk vs. reward when considering adding a loop diuretic to a neonate at risk for kernicterus. It is a drug that can displace bilirubin and cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Patients with hepatoxicity or cirrhosis also require caution as changes in electrolytes and acid/base balance may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. An aldosterone antagonist or potassium-sparing diuretic may offer adequate diuresis without the risk of electrolyte imbalance.

Digoxin-diuretic interactions increase the electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias noted in several studies. With the setting of hypokalemia, it is a known fact that digoxin toxicity can increase with the administration of a loop diuretic. Studies have shown that loop diuretics carry the greatest risk of digoxin toxicity compared to thiazides or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Diabetic patients are at risk of hyperglycemia when using a loop diuretic. Caution is prudent, with periodic monitoring of blood glucose levels.

Loop diuretics, especially furosemide, have been used to treat pulmonary edema, severe hypertension accompanying renal disease and, congestive heart failure in pregnant mothers. Loop diuretics have been given a Grade C for their use in pregnancy. Risk versus rewards merits consideration when considering starting a diuretic with a potential side effect of neonatal kernicterus.
