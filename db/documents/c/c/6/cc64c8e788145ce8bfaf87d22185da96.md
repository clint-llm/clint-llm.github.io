Vitamin B12 deficiency has 3 primary etiologies:

- Autoimmune:Â Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition in which antibodies to intrinsic factor are produced. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies bind to and inhibit the effects of intrinsic factor, resulting in an inability of B12 to be absorbed by the terminal ileum.

- Malabsorption:****Parietal cells in the stomach produce intrinsic factor; therefore, any patient with a history of gastric bypass surgery may be at risk for developing a B12 deficiency because their new alimentary pathway bypasses the site of intrinsic factor production. In patients with normal intrinsic factor production, any damage to the terminal ileum, such as surgical resection due to Crohn's disease, will impair the absorption of B12 and lead to a deficiency. Other damage to the small intestine, such as inflammation from celiac disease or infection with the tapewormDiphyllobothrium latum, may also result in a B12 deficiency.

- Dietary Insufficiency: Vitamin B12 is stored in excess in the liver; however, patients who have followed a strict vegan diet for approximately three years may develop a B12 deficiency from a lack of dietary intake.
