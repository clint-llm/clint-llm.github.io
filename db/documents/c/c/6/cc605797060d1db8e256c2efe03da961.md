Prenatal diagnosis is uncommon in patients with a cloaca, although prenatal ultrasound or MRI may identify a cystic pelvic structure in the pelvis of a female patient consistent with a fluid-filled vagina (hydrocolpos).

The definitive diagnosis of cloacal malformation is made in the newborn period by physical examination with the identification of a single perineal orifice, usually posterior to the clitoris. A thorough perineal examination with adequate lighting is required, which is best accomplished by retracting the labia “up and out” to assess the relation of the urethra to the hymen. In cloacal malformations, the urethra is inside the hymen, or the anterior hymen is absent. If the urethra is distal to the hymen, then a cloaca can be ruled out. Further examination of the genitalia may demonstrate a diminutive and foreshortened labia minora and a clitoral hood. Abdominal examination may divulge the presence of a mass in the lower abdomen which likely represents a hydrocolpos which can be present in as many of 40% of patients with a cloaca.
