Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is bactericidal. Gentamicin passes through the gram-negative membrane in an oxygen-dependent active transport. As oxygen is required, this is why aminoglycosides are not effective in anaerobic bacteria.

Once in the cytoplasm, gentamicin and other aminoglycosides bind to the 16s rRNA at the 30s ribosomal subunit, disturbing mRNA translation and, thus, leading to the formation of truncated or non-functional proteins.

Gentamicin, like all aminoglycosides, exhibit concentration-dependent killing. Higher concentrations correlate with greater antimicrobial killing. For these reasons, clinicians should monitor peaks and troughs closely with systemic use. Additionally, research has noted the synergistic effects of aminoglycosides on gram-positive bacteria when combined with other medications have been mentioned, but the mechanism is unknown.

**Pharmacokinetics**

When administered as an intramuscular injection, gentamicin achieves peak serum concentrations after 30 to 90 minutes. Because of its polar nature, the penetration into the central nervous system and general cells is minimal, and the binding to plasma albumin. Most gentamicin is excreted unmetabolized by glomerular filtration, which enables a urinary concentration almost 100-fold higher than the serum.
