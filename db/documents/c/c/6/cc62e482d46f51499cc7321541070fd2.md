Patients with allergic interstitial nephritis may present with the classic triad of rash, fever, and eosinophilia (in 10% of cases), but often present with mild worsening of renal function, prompting further investigation. The initial workup of the suspected condition should include a thorough history and physical examination with particular attention to over-the-counter medications such as NSAIDs and any recently introduced medications. The physical exam is only positive for rash, fever, and eosinophilia in 15%, 27%, and 23% of cases, respectively. AIN may occur as quickly as three days to several months after exposure to a drug. AnÂ earlier presentation is typically associated with repeated exposure to offending drugs.
