IH and CH are both vascular tumors of infancy but differ in their underlying cause and clinical course. The underlying pathogenesis in both cases is only partially understood. In the case of IH, it is theorized lesions form as a product of dysregulation of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Hypoxic stress appears to be a triggering signal, prompting over-expression of VEG-F and other angiogenic factors, leading to an abnormal proliferation of fetal endothelial cells.

In the case of CH, somatic activating mutations are implicated in their pathogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated mutations in the alleles GNAQ and GNA11 in CH. Interestingly, both RICH and NICH demonstrate similar mutations, suggesting their different clinical behavior may be the result of postnatal factors or epigenetics.
