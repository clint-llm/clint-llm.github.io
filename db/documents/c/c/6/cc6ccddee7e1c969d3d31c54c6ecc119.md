Caput succedaneum refers to common benign edema that crosses cranial suture lines and midline that appears on an infant’s scalp shortly after birth. This swelling is associated with multiple etiologies related to birth trauma, including strain to the newborn’s head during vertex (head down) and vacuum-assisted delivery. It is important to differentiate caput succedaneum from other, more concerning, etiologies of fetal head trauma that require closer monitoring.
