Anterior interosseus syndrome is an isolated palsy of flexor pollicus longus, the index and long fingers of the flexor digitorum profundus, and the pronator quadratus muscles of the forearm. It manifests as pain in the forearm accompanied commonly by the weakness of the index and thumb finger pincer movement. This activity explains the etiology, relevant surgical anatomy, evaluation, and management in patients with the anterior interosseous syndrome, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of anterior interosseous syndrome.
- Outline the neurological evaluation in patients with anterior interosseous syndrome.
- Explain the management in patients with anterior interosseous syndrome.
- Summarize a coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide an accurate diagnosis and effective care to patients with anterior interosseous syndrome.
