The presentation ofÂ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dependent on the stage of the tumor and background cirrhosis.

- Non-cirrhotic related HCC may present asymptomatic in the early stage of the disease. The median age of the clinical presentation of HCC is 69 years.

- Cirrhotic-related HCC patients may present with symptoms of decompensated liver failure, including worsening jaundice, pruritus, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, palpable mass in the upper abdomen, fever, malaise, weight loss, early satiety, abdominal distension, and cachexia. Abdominal pain is the commonest presentation for HCC.

- Paraneoplastic syndrome in HCC patients may present with hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, diarrhea, and cutaneous findings such as pemphigus foliaceous, pityriasis rotunda, dermatomyositis, and Leser-Trelat sign.

- Symptomatic patients may present with variceal bleeding, intraperitoneal bleeding, obstructive jaundice, pyogenic liver abscess, and hepatic encephalopathy.

- The most common extrahepatic metastasis of HCC is to the lung, intra-abdominal lymph node, bone, and adrenal, respectively.
