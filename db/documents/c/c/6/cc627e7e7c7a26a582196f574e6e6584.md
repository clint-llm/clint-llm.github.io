Epiglottitis is a relatively common fear in the emergency department, but actually rather rare. Because of its high morbidity and mortality, ER providers must be familiar with its presentation and management and it is highly recommended that the disorder be managed by an interprofessional team that includes an intensivist, pulmonologist, infectious disease consult, anesthesiologist, and an ENT surgeon. Since most patients present to the emergency room, it is important that the triage nurse and emergency room physician know the signs and symptoms of the disorder. The condition can rapidly lead to respiratory distress and death.

Once the patient has been admitted, the emergency department physician should consult with an infectious disease expert and the ENT surgeon. Nurses should be educated about not placing the patient supine and the importance of monitoring oxygenation. Nurses should also be aware that the patient should never be allowed to go to a radiology suite alone and without monitoring equipment.

Some patients may require mechanical ventilation for a few days. However, all patients with acute symptoms must be admitted, and a tracheostomy tray must be available at the bedside. The oral cavity should not be probed until the airway is secure, and the patient must not be stressed. Once the patient is admitted, the ENT surgeon must be notified in case there is a need for an airway if they have not been intubated already.
