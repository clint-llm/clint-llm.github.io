Cholinesterase inhibitors function by inhibiting cholinesterase from hydrolyzing acetylcholine into its components of acetate and choline'; this allows for an increase in the availability and duration of action of acetylcholine in neuromuscular junctions. The cholinesterase enzyme has two active sites: an anionic site formed by tryptophan and an esteractic site formed by serine. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase from cleaving acetylcholine by interacting with the serine esteractic site. As a result, acetylcholine will continue to accumulate and activate associated receptors.

Cholinesterase inhibitors classify as reversible, irreversible, or pseudo-reversible. Reversible cholinesterase inhibitors are generally utilized for therapeutic purposes. In contrast, irreversible and pseudo-reversible inhibitors are often used in pesticides and biowarfare (nerve agents).
