Macrocytic anemia that is megaloblastic contains hypersegmented neutrophils and macro-ovalocytes on peripheral blood smear (PBS) (figure "macrocytic anemia"). Anisocytosis and poikilocytosis are not uncommon due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Bone marrow evaluation will demonstrate hypercellularity with abnormal maturation and proliferation of myeloid cell lines, particularly the erythroid lineage.

Nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia will not have hypersegmented neutrophils; instead, its PBS will show round macrocytes or macro reticulocytes, in addition to other cells representative of the underlying etiology (acanthocytes from liver disease, myeloid dysplasia or immaturity in primary bone marrow disease, polychromatophilic RBCs with reticulocytosis, schistocytes from hemolysis, or spherocytes in inherited hemolytic anemias such as hereditary spherocytosis).
