Suspected bowel obstruction requires the practitioner to obtain a detailed medical history inquiring about significant risk factors related to bowel obstruction. Small and large bowel obstruction have many overlapping symptoms. However, quality, timing, and presentation differ. Commonly in SBO, abdominal pain is described as intermittent and colicky but improves with vomiting, while the pain associated with LBO is continuous. The vomiting in SBO tends to be more frequent, in larger volumes, and bilious, which is in contrast to vomiting during an LBO, which typically presents as intermittent and feculent when present. Tenderness to palpation is present in both conditions, but with SBO, it is more focal, and with LBO, it is more diffuse.

Additionally, distention is marked in LBO with obstipation more commonly present. It is important to note that in certain situations, an LBO will mimic an SBO if the ileocecal valve is incompetent. An incompetent ileocecal valve can allow for the insufflation of air from the large bowel into the small bowel producingÂ symptoms of an SBO.
