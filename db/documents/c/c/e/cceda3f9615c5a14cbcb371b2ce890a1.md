Surgical intervention with a replacement of the ruptured implant is recommended if rupture is suspected or documented on radiographic studies or clinical exam, and the patient wishes to maintain her breast volume. If she does not, explant alone may be considered, and in some cases, mastopexy may be needed to produce the best outcome possible.Â  Deflated saline shells may be left in the breast as long as not problematic or symptomatic, and consideration must be given to repairing muscle origins of the pectoralis major if a submuscular placement was originally done in attempts to minimize or resolve the animation that resulted from submuscular placement.
