**Initial Assessment/Start of A****ntiretroviral Therapy**

- CD4 Count

- HIV viral load

- Resistance testing

- HLA-B 5701 testing

- Tropism testing

- Hepatitis B serology

- Hepatitis C screening

- Complete blood count (CBC) with differential

- Basic chemistry

- ASL/AST/bilirubin

- Fasting lipid profile

- Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C

- Urinalysis

- Pregnancy Test

**Every 3 to 6 Months**

- CD4 count for the first two years of antiretroviral therapy or if viremia develops

- HIV viral load

- Basic chemistry

- ALT/AST/ bilirubin

- CBC with differential if on zidovudine

- Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C if abnormal before

**EveryÂ 6 Months**

- CBC with differential

- Urinalysis if on (bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide) or (efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate

**Every 12 Months**

- After two years, if the CD4 count is 300 to 500, then every 12 months; if CD4 is greater than 500, monitoring is optional.

- Hepatitis B serology may get repeated unless immunized

- Hepatitis C screen if the patient is at risk

- Fasting lipid profile

- Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C

- Urinalysis

- Quantiferon TB test
