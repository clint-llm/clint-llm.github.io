LMS belongs to the group of STS with complex and unbalanced karyotypes, which result in severe genomic instability. The cytogenetic and molecular changes in LMS are not consistent, which makes it a very heterogeneous disease. Some of the most common changes in LMS occur in the form of loss in chromosomes 10q(PTEN) and 13q (RB1) and gain at 17p (TP53). A few noteworthy points to be noted here are as follows.

- Loss of 13q results in mutation in the RB1 gene (retinoblastoma gene), which is a tumor suppressor gene- identified in 90% of patients with LMS.

- A lower rate of p53 is observable in LMS compared to other STS.

- A higher rate of amplification of MDM2 is present in patients with LMS.

- The deletion of chromosome 10q leads to a mutation in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, which leads to the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/ (protein kinase B) AKT pathway.

- Profiling studies have identified new targets, such as Aurora-A and Aurora-B kinases, which are consistently overexpressed in uterine LMS and can be therapeutic targets in the future.
