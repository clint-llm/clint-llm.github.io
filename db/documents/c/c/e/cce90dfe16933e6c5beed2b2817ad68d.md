Synovial chondromatosis typically presents with large joint effusion(s), and joints may appear deformed due to swelling or synovial hypertrophy. Synovial chondromatosis can result in severe disability and dysfunction. However, most cases are benign, and this condition rarely undergoes malignant transformation. The initial diagnosis of synovial chondromatosis is made through a thorough history, physical examination, and radiological evaluation of an affected joint. Involved joints are painful at rest, and pain is worsened with motion. The range of motion is usually decreased, and x-ray evaluation reveals multiple loose radio-opaque chondroid bodies of varied sizes within the joint. This activity addresses the presentation, evaluation, and management of synovial chondromatosis and examines the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the presentations of the primary and secondary forms of synovial chrondromatosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of synovial chondromatosis.
- Outline the management of the primary and secondary forms of synovial chrondromatosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by synovial chondromatosis.
