Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in between the parietal and visceral pleura, called the pleural cavity. It can occur by itself or can be the result of surrounding parenchymal disease like infection, malignancy, or inflammatory conditions. Pleural effusion is one of the major causes of pulmonary mortality and morbidity. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of pleural effusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the workup of a patient with pleural effusion.
- Describe the causes of pleural effusions.
- Summarize the treatment options for pleural effusions.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pleural effusion.
