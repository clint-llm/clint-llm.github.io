All people do not have equal susceptibility to fungal infection, and there are familial and genetic predispositions possibly mediated by specific defects in innate and adaptive immunity. Patients with low defensin beta 4 may demonstrate a predisposition to all dermatophytes.Â  Some other predisposing factors include underlying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, lymphomas, immunocompromised status, Cushing syndrome, excess sweating, or old age. The currently held view is that a cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the control of dermatophytosis.
