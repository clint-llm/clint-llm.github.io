Determination and understanding of how a particular substance is eliminated are important when administering medications to achieve a therapeutic level and when assessing a patient who ingested a toxic substance. Specifically, in regards to toxicology, if the ingested substance is unknown to the patient and practitioner, routine blood/plasma testing of the substance and analysis of the decline in concentration will aid in the identification of the ingested substance. For example, if the substance follows a zero-order elimination, the amount eliminated will be dependent on time and not the amount ingested, in contrast to first-order kinetics, in which the amount eliminated will be dependent on the maximum blood/plasma concentration and not of time. Furthermore, once the substance and its properties are understood, proper treatment may be given to a patient that ingested a toxic substance.

To achieve a desired therapeutic level of a medication, a clinician must understand the elimination order and utilize the information in subsequent dosing to maintain the therapeutic concentration over a set period. Misunderstanding of kinetic elimination may lead to patients experiencing toxic symptoms and could lead to other iatrogenic adverse effects up to and including death.
