Furrow degeneration is a circumferential thinning of the cornea encompassing the entire peripheral section of the cornea. The thinning does not result in any major morphological changes in the corneaâ€™s prolate shape, subsequently leading to an asymptomatic presentation.

Patients are primarily managed through observation of worsening of thinning, without the need for an increase in the frequency of ocular eye exams or treatment.

Physicians should exclude other corneal degenerative diseases before diagnosing FD due to the different management options for the more malignant pathologies.
