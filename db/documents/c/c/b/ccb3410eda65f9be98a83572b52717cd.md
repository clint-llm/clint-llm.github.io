Ectodermal dysplasias (EDs) are rare genetic cutaneous disorders with multiple variants and include the structures derived from ectoderm. Patients are usually children, so parents should be educated about the disease and its symptoms if a family history of similar conditions is present. Parents must also be reassured that their children can have a normal life span if they are meticulous about routine checkups and immediately consult a doctor in case of any symptoms.
