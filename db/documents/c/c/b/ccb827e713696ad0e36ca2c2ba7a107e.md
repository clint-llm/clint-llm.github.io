The patient will often complain of a foreign body sensation in their eyes and a dry mouth. On eye exam, the absence of tears may be noted in the inferior conjunctival sac, and the eyes may appear injected. However, referral to an ophthalmologist is mandatory for a slit-lamp exam to be performed. This examination in the presence of vital dye staining is necessary to demonstrate KCS (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) which is the most characteristic ophthalmologic lesion of Sjogren. A Schirmer test will also help confirm ocular dryness. The mouth may appear parched, with a smooth tongue, and thin mucosae. Approximately 50% demonstrate enlarged parotid, and/or submandibular glands at some point.  Extraglandular involvement often manifests in polyarthritis, lower extremity purpura, and/or evidence of peripheral neuropathy.
