The cuboid receives its blood supply from the lateral plantar artery, a branch of the posterior tibial artery. The lateral plantar artery anastomosis with the medial plantar artery, which allows for adequate blood supply and bone consolidation following a cuboid fracture.

The lymphatic flow follows the vasculature and flows up the lower extremity to gather in popliteal and femoral collectors.
