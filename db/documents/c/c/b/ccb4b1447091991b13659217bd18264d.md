Progressive fibrosis around intrahepatic bile ducts leads to concentric and circumferential laminations called "onion skin" fibrosis. This leads to the displacement of the pre-biliary capillary plexus and creates a barrier to oxygenationÂ and maintenance of cholehepatic countercurrent circulation between the artery and the bile duct. Arterial or capillary ischemia is involved in the pathogenesis of stricturing and circumferential pre-biliary fibrosis. The secretion of chemokines and cytokines by innate immune cells and inflammatory and fibrotic response to toxic bile leaking between inured cholangiocytes leads to periductal fibrosis.
