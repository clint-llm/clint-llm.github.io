There is a significant body of literature that discusses the anatomical variations in the origin and termination of the profunda brachii artery.  The most common physiologic variant is the anomalous origin of the profunda brachii artery from the axillary artery rather than the brachial artery.  However, there is a great variation amongst studies in regards to the prevalence of this variant; ranging from 2% to 16.6%.
