Measuring the effects of nitrogen narcosis have been studied and have been broken down into looking at cognition and behavior as well as neurophysiological changes that occur during narcosis. One study on simple arithmetic and reaction time showed the qualitative progressive decline in the participant’s ability to complete the test’s tasks with increasing pressures while breathing compressed air. Another study designed to see the difference between nitrogen narcosis in a laboratory setting versus in an open water setting. It reported that "divers were tested at 3 and 30 meters at a shore base and in the open sea. Intellectual functions, as assessed by memory test, sentence comprehension, and simple arithmetic, showed evidence of narcosis in both 30-meter dives but the decrement was greater in the ocean dives. This may be due to the greater psychological stress in the open sea," hinting at a greater impairment from narcosis when the diver is also experiencing anxiety from other factors outside of the narcosis.

Neurophysiological testing has been done using an electroencephalogram to measure brain wave activity. Studies have found decreased voltages in the basal rhythm of the brain and the appearance of low voltage theta waves. Cortical evoked potentials were also studied. These evoked potentials are differences on electroencephalogram readings that show a response in the brain to sensory stimuli, such as visual images. US Navy divers were studied using these visual evoked responses and showed that reliable and significant differences in visual evoked responses were apparent in the divers when they were breathing compressed air at depth, and these differences were not apparent when breathing compressed helium-oxygen mixtures.
