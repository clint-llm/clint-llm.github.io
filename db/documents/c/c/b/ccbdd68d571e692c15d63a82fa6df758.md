Simple anal fistulas are thought to be due to glandular obstruction resulting in an anorectal abscess and, ultimately, a fistula. Characteristics of a simple fistula include a single tract, subcutaneous tract, and those that involve less than 30% of the external sphincter. A simple fistula is the easiest to treat and has the lowest recurrence and complication rates.

Complex fistulas include those that involve more than 30% of the external sphincter, fistulas with multiple tracts, recurrent fistulas, and those associated with other predisposing factors, including Crohn disease and radiation treatment.
