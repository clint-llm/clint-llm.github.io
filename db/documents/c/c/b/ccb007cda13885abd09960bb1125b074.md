As with most other psychiatric pathologies, the diagnosis, treatment, and management of brief psychotic disorder require the coordinated efforts of a strong interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, mental health nurse, psychologist, and psychiatrist. It is paramount to develop and follow a patient-centered approach with a particular focus on psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, given how disruptive such a disease process can be to the patient and his/her family. Working on the biopsychosocial aspect of well-being will ensure that the patient is well supported all-around and help curtail the overall negative impact of this disorder on the life and functioning of the individual.
