M. chelonae are uniformly resistant to cefoxitin, imipenem is preferred instead. Tobramycin appears to be more active than amikacin. Isolates are susceptible to tobramycin (100%), clarithromycin (100%), linezolid (90%), imipenem (60%), amikacin (50%), clofazimine, doxycycline (25%), and ciprofloxacin (20%). Clarithromycin monotherapy can be sufficient for localized skin infections. However, there are cases of development of resistance during therapy, which occurs due to a single point mutation at position 2058 of 23S rRNA. For lung disease, disseminated disease and invasive disease with bone and soft tissues involvement, atleast six months of therapy is recommended with atleast two drugs, including a macrolide, and a second agent based on susceptibility. Surgical debridement, removal of foreign body, and catheters are an important adjunct to successful therapy. Optimal therapy for lung infection is unknown but most likely similar to other NTM, which results in 12 months of sputum culture negativity. In many published cases of M. chelonae infections in immunosuppressed patients, dual therapy with macrolide and amikacin was successful. Corneal infections should be treated with topical agents as well as systemic agents. Treatment should be based on susceptibilities whenever possible. Eye drops containing macrolides, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones are useful.
