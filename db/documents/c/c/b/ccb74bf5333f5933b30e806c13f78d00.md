Baseline monitoring parameters include creatine, then ECG and vital signs should be monitored continuously.

When using fentanyl citrate injections along with medications such as CYP3A4 inhibitors or stopping the CYP3A4 inducers in patients treated with fentanyl injections, the patients should receive frequent and close monitoring. Also, consider lowering the dose of fentanyl. Similarly, when using fentanyl citrate injectionÂ in conjunction with CYP3A4 inducer medications or stopping the CYP3A4 inhibitors, an undesirable reduction in fentanyl plasma concentrations may occur, thereby decreasing its systemic efficacy. The use of fentanyl citrate injection with CYP3A4 inducers or stopping the CYP3A4 inhibitor will require close and repetitive monitoring of the patient. Also, consider augmenting the dose of fentanyl as needed.
