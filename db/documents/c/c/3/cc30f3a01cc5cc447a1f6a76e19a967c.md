The TNM system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is used to stage these cancers. The diagnosis is established with endoscopic ultrasound / Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). If a patient presents with obstructive jaundice, these modalities could allow therapeutic intervention will be done at the time of diagnostic evaluation with biliary stent placement. As most of the patients undergo surgery, temporary plastic stents are preferred to metallic stents. All patients diagnosed with ampullary cancers need staging evaluation with computerized tomography (CT) of chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Often clear differentiation of primary ampullary cancers from other periampullary malignancies such as those arising in the pancreas, biliary duct, or intestine is challenging at the time of diagnostic evaluation.
