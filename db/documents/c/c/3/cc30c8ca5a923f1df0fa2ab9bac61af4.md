The splanchnic nerves are paired, autonomic nerves that carry both visceral sympathetic and sensory fibers, except for the pelvic splanchnic nerves which carry parasympathetic fibers. There are five types of splanchnic nerves on both sides of the spinal vertebrae, including cardiopulmonary, thoracic splanchnic, lumbar splanchnic, sacral splanchnic, and pelvic splanchnic nerves. The splanchnic nerves arise from within the sympathetic thoracic trunk to innervate the abdomen. Their principal clinical significance is in splanchnicectomy, in which denervation of splanchnic nerves is mainly done to manage the intractable visceral pain. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of anatomy and clinical variations of the splanchnic nerves is essential to achieve precision in splanchnicectomies.
