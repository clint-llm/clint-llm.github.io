The two major academic societies, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES), present conflicting guidelines for screening at-risk infants and the management of neonatal hypoglycemia. The most recent AAP guidelines recommend screening for late preterm and term infants that experience symptoms of hypoglycemia, and asymptomatic infants at highest risk for hypoglycemia in the first 12 to 24 hours of life. "At risk" infants include late preterm (34-36.6 weeks gestation), term infants who are small for gestational age, infants of diabetic mothers, and large for gestational age infants.

The Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) recommends screening all infants with risk factors for prolonged or pathologic hypoglycemia, including

- Symptomatic hypoglycemia

- Large for gestational age

- Perinatal stress

- Perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, fetal distress
- Maternal pre-eclampsia/eclampsia
- Meconium aspiration syndrome, erythroblastosis fetalis, polycythemia, hypothermia

- Premature or post-term delivery

- Infant of diabetic mother

- Family history of genetic hypoglycemia

- Congenital syndrome (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedermann), abnormal physical features (e.g., midline facial malformations)

Per the PES guidelines, infants unable to maintain pre-prandial blood glucose values >50 mg/dL in the first 48 hours of life or >60 mg/dL thereafter are at risk for persistent hypoglycemia and require further workup prior to discharge home.after the first 48 hours of life, to exclude those infants experiencing transient low glucose levels (i.e., transitional neonatal hypoglycemia).

The PES recommends evaluation of the following infants to exclude persistent causes of hypoglycemia

- Symptomatic hypoglycemia or severe hypoglycemia requiring treatment with intravenous dextrose

- Infants unable to maintain blood glucose concentrations >50 mg/dL in the first 48 hours of life and >60 after 48 hours of age

- Family history of a genetic form of hypoglycemia

- Congenital syndrome (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedermann), abnormal physical features (e.g., midline facial malformations)

Point-of-care testing (POCT) offers a quick and cost-effective method for screening for hypoglycemia.

More recently, the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the detection and management of neonatal hypoglycemia is under investigation. A study published in 2010 by Harris et al. looked at the usefulness of continuous glucose monitoring in 102 infants >32 weeks gestation at risk of hypoglycemia during the first 7 days of life.

In infants with persistent hypoglycemia suspected of having an underlying disorder, measuring bicarbonate, lactic acid, beta-hydroxybutyrate, free fatty acids, insulin and carnitine levels during hypoglycemia (blood glucose <50 mg/dL) is useful in differentiating between the metabolic causes of persistent hypoglycemia and aids in the diagnosis of hyperinsulinism and disorders of fatty acid oxidation.
