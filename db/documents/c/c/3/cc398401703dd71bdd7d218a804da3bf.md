The heart comprises four chambers; the two upper chambers are referred to as the atria, and the two lower chambers are referred to as the ventricles. The inter-atrial septum divides the atrium into the right and the left atria. Similarly, a septum separates the ventricles into the right and left and is called the inter-ventricular septum. Embryologically the inter-atrial septum is derived from the septum primum and the septum secundum. The septum primum arises from the roof of the atrium and develops towards the endocardial cushions covering the ostium primum. This is followed by degeneration of the septum primum towards the roof of the atria creating the ostium secundum. Next, the septum secundum arises from the atrial roof on the right atrial side and grows caudally to cover the ostium secundum.
