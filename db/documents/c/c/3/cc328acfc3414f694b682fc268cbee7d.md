Extraocular complications of white dot syndromes are rare. Patients may present with a viral prodrome that is typically self-limiting. In patients with APMPPE, symptoms of a viral prodrome may include meningeal features.

Associated ocular complications include those inherent to chorioretinopathy, such as cystoid macular edema (CME) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The development of choroidal neovascular membranes is a prominent complication seen in patients with PIC, with estimates of 40% to 75% in some cases series.
