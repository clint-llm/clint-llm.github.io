Life expectancy is usually normal in patients with EPP unless hepatopathy develops due to hepatotoxic effects of protoporphyrins that lead to liver dysfunction. EPP generally does not decrease life expectancy but does have a great influence on the quality of life. Since the pain after photosensitivity is intense and acute, it is necessary for the patient to modify lifestyle and employment.
