Most patients with Parkinson disease will be identified in the community by their primary care physician, but ongoing care should involve the efforts of an entire interprofessional healthcare team. Once identified, patients should receive a referral to a neurologic specialist for further workup and diagnosis. Primary care clinicians and neurologists need to maintain communication to improve care coordination and patient-centered care.Â Pharmacists are also a vital resource for medication management and ensuring patient safety with medications. Medication regimens can become complex in Parkinson disease, so it is important to avoid drug-drug interactions and adverse events, which can be alleviated with the help of a pharmacist. Nursing staff can also provide patient counseling, coordinate with other providers, and act as a primary point of contact for patients and other team members.

Occupational therapists may also be beneficial in patient care depending on symptoms patients experience and their ability to perform everyday activities. Since Parkinson disease is progressive, other specialists who may need to consult in the care of the patient include gastroenterologists, urologists, ophthalmologists, and psychiatrists. The patient should also be actively involved with their care to ensure an interprofessional patient-centered care model.
