Treatment depends on the stage of the tumor. See staging."

- For stage I renal cell cancer measuring less than 7 centimeters and confined to the kidney, nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy is the treatment of choice and is usually curative. Radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy is an option in patients with bilateral tumors and small cortical tumors. Imaging surveillance is an option in elderly patients with a short life expectancy who are not good surgical candidates, as many renal cell cancers are slow growing.

- For stage II renal cell cancer, laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is the treatment of choice.

- For stage III renal cell cancer, open radical nephrectomy is the standard of care. Adrenalectomy or extensive lymph node dissection is only recommended when abdominal CT shows evidence of adrenal or lymph node invasion.

- Stage IV renal cell cancer is not curable. Treatment is palliative. Treatment may include tumor embolization, external-beam radiation therapy, and nephrectomy, but these treatments are not aimed at cure, rather prolonged survival and palliation. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy can prolong survival. Drugs that may be used to reduce the risk of complications from bone metastases include bisphosphonates and Xgeva.
