Fluorescein angiography is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is classified as a category C drug. There is a lack of well-controlled studies assessing the safety of intravenous fluorescein in pregnancy. Therefore it is usually avoided in pregnant females, especially in the first trimester.

The risk of phototoxicity with the dye is due to the generation of a superoxide anion after exposure to light at a wavelength of 480 nm.

A history of severe allergic reactions is an absolute contraindication for fluorescein administration. In patients with a history of moderate allergic reactions to fluorescein, pretreatment with an antihistaminic agent or corticosteroid can be done.

A history of cardiovascular or renal disease is not a contraindication for FFA. However, the healthcare team should be aware of this history, especially for managing allergic reactions in these patients.
