Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a relatively rare autosomal recessive disorder, but the diagnosis carries significant mental and physical morbidity and mortality. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, endocrinologist, pediatrician, nurse, and a mental health counselor.  Prenatal diagnosis and treatment of affected females is very important to minimize genital virilization. Because 21-hydroxylase deficiency is often undiagnosed in affected males until they have severe adrenal insufficiency, all US states and many other countries have instituted newborn screening programs that measure 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration). Newborn screening can detect almost all infants with classic CAH and some infants with nonclassic CAH.
