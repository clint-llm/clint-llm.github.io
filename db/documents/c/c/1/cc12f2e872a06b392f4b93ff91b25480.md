The outcome of poikilocytosis depends on the type of poikilocytosis, its cause, and how quickly the underlying disease is diagnosed and managed. It requires a well-planned interprofessional team approach with a primary clinician, a hematologist, a hematopathologist, a pharmacist, and a nurse, all working together as a healthcare team to bring the best outcome to the patients. The patients should be educated about the cause, prognosis, and different treatment options available. It is essential to identify and diagnose the condition early. Red blood cell morphology can be likened to a trail, a track, from which, with other current data, the proper diagnosis can be pursued and found.
