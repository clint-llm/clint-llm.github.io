The etiology of XGP remains unknown. However, most of the cases result fromÂ chronic urinary obstruction and infection. The organisms most commonly associated with XGP are Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus faecalis, and Klebsiella, etc. Urinary obstruction occurs as a result of calculus, most commonly, staghorn calculus (in almost 80% of patients), which serves as a nidus for infection resulting in the destruction of the renal parenchyma. However, in children, congenital ureteropelvic abnormalities may result in chronic urinary obstruction.

Risk factors for XGP:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Hypertension

- Immunocompromised individuals

- Abnormal lipid metabolism

- Renal transplantation

- Brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome in children
