Studies at the molecular level have demonstrated that various paracrine signaling molecules mediate the communication between the ectoderm and ectomesenchyme during tooth development. The molecules include members of the transforming growth factor (TGF-), FGF, SHH, and wingless/int1 family of secreted signaling molecules (WNT).  When the epithelial budding starts, a signaling molecule in the tumor necrosis factor termed ectodysplasin appears in the dental placodes. Thereafter, during the transition phase from bud to cap stage, another molecule termed the enamel knot signaling center appears, one for each future cusp of the tooth. These molecules regulate morph differentiation of the tooth crown and also regulate the initiation of the secondary enamel knots responsible for the determination of the future epithelial cusp formations.

Additionally, the role of transcription factors including homeobox 9 gene (PAX9), MSX1, MSX2, DLX3, DLX5, DLX6, DLX7, BARX1, PITX2, LHX6, and LHX7 in tooth development have also been implicated.  These transcription factors appear to have an inductive interaction with the growth factors resulting in tooth patterning, formation, and division of the jaws into different regions corresponding to each tooth’s position.
