It is not recommended to screen asymptomatic individuals for vitamin-D deficiency. High-risk individuals shall be evaluated. Vitamin D sufficiency or deficiency is evaluated by the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Optimal serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is still a matter of controversy.  There are substantial differences in mineral metabolism amongst different races.  African Americans, for example, have higher bone density and low fracture risk compared to other races.  Further, the effects of calcium and vitamin-D supplementation in the non-Caucasian population have not yet been completely evaluated or reported.  The International Society for Clinical Densitometry and International Osteoporosis Foundation recommend minimum serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 30 ng/mL to minimize the risk of fall and fractures in older individuals.
