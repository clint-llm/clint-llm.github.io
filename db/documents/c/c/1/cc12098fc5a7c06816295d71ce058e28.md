The operating surgeon will need at least one assistant to provide traction or gentle approximation of surrounding tissues in most of the techniques described below.  Even in the case of negative pressure wound therapy, the assistant can help reapproximate fascial edges with a smaller surface sponge to prevent further lateral retraction. No additional patient preparation is required for temporary abdominal closure.
