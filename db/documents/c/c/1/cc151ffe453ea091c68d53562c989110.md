The presenilin-1 gene is located on chromosome 14 and encodes the presenilin-1 protein. The presenilin-2 gene is located on chromosome 1 and encodes the presenilin-2 protein. Both presenilin proteins have nine helical transmembrane domains. There are two catalytic aspartyl residues; one is on the transmembrane domain 6, and one is on the transmembrane domain 7 in each protein.

Presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 form a heterotetrameric complex with protein cofactors nicastrin, presenilin-enhancer-2, and anterior-pharynx-defective-1, creating what is called the gamma-secretase complex. The presenilin proteins form the catalytic subunit. The complex becomes destabilized and degraded if one of these components is missing. Presenilin-1 is mainly present in the Golgi, plasma membrane, and endosomes. Presenilin-2, on the other hand, is primarily found in endosomes and lysosomes.
