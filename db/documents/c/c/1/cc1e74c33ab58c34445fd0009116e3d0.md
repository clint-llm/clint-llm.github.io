A vaginal discharge sample can help to diagnose vaginal candidiasis by examining it under a microscope or by fungal culture in a laboratory. Under the microscope, budding yeast is visible. Oral thrush is mostly a clinical diagnosis but can also be confirmed by looking at the scrapings of the rash under the microscope. For systemic candidiasis, a blood culture is a diagnostic tool.
