A perturbation of the gut, oral, or urinary microbiome or mycobiome is the underlying condition that allows fermenting microbes to over-colonize. Such disturbances are caused by a diet high in carbohydrates and refined foods and the overuse of antibiotic and non-antibiotic drugs in food and medicine.

Other underlying conditions may contribute to the pathogenesis of auto-brewery syndrome:

- Auto-brewery syndrome occurred in several patients with short bowel syndrome, pseudoobstruction, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) who exhibited signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication.

- Researchers compared patients with auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) (N=28; 16 male and 12 female) to an asymptomatic group (N=18) regarding lifestyle and health, diet, and medical history. The data show significant differences between the groups. The ABS group reported poorer overall health and more food sensitivities. They consume more water, less tea, coffee, dairy, and candy; they eat out less, cook more at home, and have more aversion to starch. The ABS members also report bad breath, diarrhea, and bowel changes. Most importantly, patients with auto-brewery syndrome report using antibiotics for a longer time. While not statistically significant, the people in the ABS group also report more diagnosed GI disorders.

- Researchers compared patients with auto-brewery syndrome (ABS) (N=28; 16 male and 12 female) to a cohort of the American Gut Project (AGP N=11,237) on a survey of 30 questions about lifestyle and health, diet, and medical history. The data show that patients with ABS and their household members are more likely than participants of the AGP to own a pet, get less sleep, and have a lesser quality of bowel movements. Also, the ABS participants drink more water and less alcohol, eat at home more often, and report eating fewer sweets. Most significantly, the ABS group has a higher presence of non-food allergies compared to the AGP group.

- Measurements of endogenous ethanol have been made, and in one instance, a patient registered an ethanol concentration of greater than 400 mg/dL. In these individuals, endogenous ethanol appears after the consumption of a high carbohydrate diet. Stress and skipping meals may also exacerbate these high ethanol levels.

- A genetic polymorphism that results in reduced activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases enzymes involved in the hepatic metabolism of ethanol and a first-pass metabolism might explain the ethnic differences in rates of endogenous ethanol production and clearance.
