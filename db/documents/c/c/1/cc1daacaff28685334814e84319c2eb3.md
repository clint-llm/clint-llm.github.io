Patients experience anoxic brain injury due to decreased oxygen delivery to the various regions of the brain; this may be due to cardiac arrest, where global hypoxia is a common observation, or vascular injury or insult, where a more localized area may be affected. In the case of post-arrest patients, an increase in body temperature, which may be neurologically mediated, beyond 37 degrees Celsius is associated with less favorable neurologic outcomes and appears to also worsen with every degree beyond 37 degrees Celsius.
