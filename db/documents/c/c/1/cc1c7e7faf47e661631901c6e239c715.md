Aortopulmonary window has a similar presentation as truncus arteriosus, large VSD, and large PDA. A diastolic reversal of flow can also be present with truncus arteriosus and large PDA. 2D-echocardiography can identify and differentiate between a variety of these defects. Large pulse pressures are present in the aortic pressure estimation due to diastolic runoff. Angiograms identify the defect between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Pulmonary vaso-reactivity testing should take place to identify suitable surgical candidates.
