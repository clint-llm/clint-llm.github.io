Dopamine (DA) is a peripheral vasostimulant used to treat low blood pressure, low heart rate, and cardiac arrest, especially in acute neonatal cases via a continuous intravenous drip.

Indications for DA include maintenance of blood pressure for chronic congestive heart failure, trauma, renal failure, and even open-heart surgery and shock from myocardial infarction or septicemia. DA administration in low doses may also be beneficial to manage hypotension, low cardiac output, and inadequate organ perfusion (often indicated by low urine production). DA gained significant clinical importance in the central nervous system (CNS) after Hornykiewicz's experiments showed its reduction within the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson disease. Furthermore, the intravenous administration of its amino acid precursor, L-DOPA (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine), attenuated the Parkinsonian symptoms.
