The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is the most commonly dislocated joint in the body and accounts for approximately 50% of all major dislocations seen in the emergency department. While anterior dislocations are very common and frequently seen in presentation, inferior shoulder dislocations have an incidence of about 1 in 200 (0.5%) of all dislocations. This is not subtle, and diagnosis usually can be made from the doorway of an exam room.
