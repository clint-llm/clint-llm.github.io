The initial treatment of amblyopia depends on the underlying cause. Deprivation amblyopia should first be treated by removing the obstructive pathology. This may be cataract surgery, retinal detachment repair, corneal surgery, or treatment for a variety of other ocular pathologies. Refractive amblyopia often is the most amenable to treatment. Treatment of the patientâ€™s entire refractive error with corrective lenses may be treatment enough to reverse the amblyopia. In strabismic amblyopia, strabismus repair may realign the eyes; however, this rarely is enough to reverse amblyopia completely.

All forms of amblyopia often need to utilize visual penalization of the non-amblyopic eye to force visual development in the amblyopic eye. The most common form of visual penalization is patching the non-amblyopic eye. The amount of time the non-amblyopic eye is patched per day varies with the severity of the amblyopia. Practitioners often patch for two hours, six hours, or sometimes even full-time.

The older the patient gets, the more likely the plasticity of the brain to reverse amblyopia is no longer present. The exact age at which amblyopia treatment becomes futile is not uniformly agreed upon. However, The Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group found that patients from seven to twelve showed at least some benefit from amblyopia treatment, compared to patients thirteen and older, who showed minimal improvement with treatment.
