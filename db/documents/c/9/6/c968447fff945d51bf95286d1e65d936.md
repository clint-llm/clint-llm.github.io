On gross as well as microscopic appearance, telangiectatic osteosarcoma very closely resembles aneurysmal bone cysts.

**Macroscopic Findings**

Macroscopic examination reveals a hemorrhagic multicystic lesion filled with blood clots. Telangiectatic osteosarcomas have the classic description as ''a bag of blood.'' They are, by definition, composed of approximately 90% cystic components before treatment.

**Microscopic Findings**

Histologically, telangiectatic osteosarcoma is composed of blood-filled or empty cystic spaces resembling aneurysmal bone cysts. The septa are populated by pleomorphic cells with important nuclear hyperchromasia and also contain osteoclast-like giant cells. Osteoid formation is usually focal and confluent. Because telangiectatic osteosarcoma is sometimes notÂ adequately sampled by core-needle biopsy due to its lytic and cystic nature, cellular atypia and osteoid formation may be absent, which may lead to misdiagnosis.

**Immunochemistry**

No immunohistochemical studies are useful in the diagnosis of telangiectatic osteosarcoma.
