Niacin (vitamin B), also known as nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, is an essential water-soluble vitamin. It is important for the metabolism of macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) due to being part of the NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) coenzymes.

Dietary deficiency of niacin results in pellagra. Pellagra was first described 250 years ago by the Spanish physician Don Gaspar Casal in 1763.
