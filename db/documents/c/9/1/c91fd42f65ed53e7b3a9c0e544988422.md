The exact etiology of hypospadias is unknown but is believed to include genetic, endocrine, and environmental factors.

Inheritance is believed to be polygenic, and it has been noticed more often in males with a family history of hypospadias.

Hypospadias is commonly seen in males with decreased androgens or with receptors that have decreased sensitivity to androgens. Recent studies also suggest that in-utero exposure to estrogens found in pesticides used in fruits and vegetables as well as in plastic linings can have an antiandrogenic activity.

Hypospadias are classified by the location of the abnormal urethral meatus. One of the most commonly used classifications is as follows:

- Anterior (subcoronal and glandular)

- Middle (distal penile, proximal penile and midshaft)

- Posterior (scrotal, penoscrotal and perineal)

In nearly 50% of cases, the location is anterior, 20% of cases have a middle location and the rest are posterior. Overall, the subcoronal position is the most common abnormal location.
