An interprofessional team approach is required to prevent the outbreak of a surgical fire. Good communication between all the OR members is a must. Surgical time-out is the most critical time-point of detailing all the sources of fuels, oxidizers, and specific ignition sources within a procedure.

- Surgeons are required to have detailed knowledge about the mechanics of all the energy devices used in the OR. Awareness and assessment of these devices and their specific risks is a necessary component for the prevention of surgical fire.

- The part played by an anesthesiologist in surgical fire safety is critical. He has to ensure that unnecessary increased levels of oxygen are not provided to the patient as it reduces the ignition point temperature. A thorough knowledge about anesthetics that reduces the risk of surgical fire (e.g. halogenated anesthetics) is also required in their part.

- The nurse shall ensure the appropriate skin preparation techniques, including following manufacturer specifications for dry time on alcohol-based skin prep and preventing preparation fluid pooling.

- OR technician shall remain cautious about the proper use of surgical devices, such as re-holstering the cautery, re-holstering the lasers and light cords used in endoscopic and laparoscopic cases, etc.
