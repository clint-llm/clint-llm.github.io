As tinea barbae is a relatively rare dermatophyte infection, knowledge about the disease, and taking a good history will helpÂ to make a prompt diagnosis of the condition. Zoophilic fungi predominantly cause tinea barbae; hence occupational history, contact with pets, and domestic animals will help in narrowing the differential diagnosis. Factors like diabetes mellitus, local trauma, steroid use, and immunosuppressive therapy can suppress local defense mechanisms and predispose them to infections with dermatophytes.

Clinically tinea barbae presents as two different morphologies, inflammatory and noninflammatory.

The classic inflammatory form of tinea barbae develops a characteristic lesion called kerion. Kerion is an erythematous, boggy, tender, often sterile, weeping nodule or plaque with pustules and draining sinuses.

Noninflammatory tinea barbae is a pruriginous superficial dermatophytosis, which presents as a diffusely erythematous squamous plaque with perifollicular pustules and papules.
