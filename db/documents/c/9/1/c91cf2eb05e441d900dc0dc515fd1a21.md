- Host defense against parasitic infections, such as Trichinella spiralis and Schistosoma mansoni.

- Activation of mast cells, basophils, and neutrophils during inflammation.

- Complement activation through alternative and classical pathways.

- Platelet agonist

- Antibacterial activity

- Natural protein inhibitor of heparanase - heparanase has been implicated in inflammation and inflammation-associated cancer due to its ability to degrade the extracellular matrix scaffold and potentially assist with penetration of eosinophils into other tissues.

Additional functions more closely associated with pathologic activity, such as fibrosis, bronchospasm, and epithelial remodeling, are detailed in subsequent sections.
