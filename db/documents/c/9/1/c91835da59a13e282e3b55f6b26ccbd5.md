Adhesive capsulitis can be classified as either primary or secondary. The primary disease typically has an insidious onset, is idiopathic, and is often associated with other diseases such as diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, drugs, hypertriglyceridemia, or cervical spondylosis.

The secondary disease typically follows trauma or injuries to the shoulder. Common injuries include rotator cuff tears, fractures, surgery, or immobilization.
