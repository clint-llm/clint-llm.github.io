Heat loss occurs through four mechanisms: evaporation, convection, conduction, and radiation. The heat generated by the core body tissues travels to the vasodilated skin surface capillaries, and the temperature gradient between the limbs and environment drives transfer of heat to the surrounding air, mainly by radiation. Radiation is the most significant source accounting for approximately 60% of heat loss. Core body tissues transfer heat in subcutaneous blood vessels which emit infrared rays from the skin surface to lose heat by radiation. Evaporation is the next major source accounting for about 22% of heat loss. Water vaporization requires energy and consumes heat facilitating heat loss. This process occurs even when the body is not sweating. The body depends on evaporation for heat dissipation when the environmental temperature is warmer than the skin or when convection and radiation are insufficient. Finally, conduction and convection contribute roughly 15% of heat loss. Conduction is the loss of molecular kinetic energy in the form of heat from the skin to the surroundings. Different mediums transfer heat by conduction at different rates. For example, the conductive transfer of water is 100 times that of air. Radiation and conduction can facilitate heat loss as long as skin temperature is greater than the surroundings. At extremely high skin temperature (over 43Â°C), evaporation is the only mechanism of heat dissipation.
