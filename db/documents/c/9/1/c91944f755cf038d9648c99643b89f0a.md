A significant yet underrecognized heart muscle complication after non-cardiac surgery is perioperative myocardial injury (PMI), which is distinct from myocardial infarction. Risk factors for PMI before and after surgery include an age greater than or equal to 65 years and a preexisting history of atherosclerotic disease. PMI is an acute increase in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTn) plasma concentrations.
