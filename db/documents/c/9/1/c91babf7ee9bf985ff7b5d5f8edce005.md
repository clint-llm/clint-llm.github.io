Any patient presenting with intraocular hemorrhage should not only receive treatment solely by an ophthalmologist in isolation, but it also requires a multispecialty evaluation by an endocrinologist, nephrologist, cardiologist, and neurologist. Interprofessional communication can lead to better patient management. The patient will most often present to the primary health care provider or nurse practitioner, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable. Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary.

These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians and should ensure correct dosing on the medication management aspect of the condition. Nursing will be the first department to come in contact with the patients on follow-up and can assess the treatment progress as well as evaluate the compliance with both medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issue to the primary care physician. This collaborative, interprofessional team approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
