The stages of parapneumonic effusion are:

- Exudative stage, in which there is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to increased capillary permeability that results from proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). The pleural fluid in this early stage is usually clear exudative fluid with a predominance of neutrophils. Pleural fluid in this stage is simple parapneumonic effusion that usually resolves with adequate antibiotic treatment of pneumonia without the need for drainage. This stage takes approximately 2 to 5 days from the onset of pneumonia.

- Fibrinopurulent stage, which can develop if adequate treatment is not provided. In this stage there is a deposition of fibrin clots and fibrin membranes in the pleural cavity, leading to fluid loculations. This stage takes about 5 to 10 days after pneumonia onset.

- Organizing stage, in which fibrin membranes are transformed by fibroblast into a thick nonelastic pleural peel, resulting in the trapped lung with restrictive respiratory dysfunction. This stage may take about 2 to 3 weeks to develop.

The clinical course varies from spontaneous healing to chronic empyema and fibro-thorax with trapped restricted lung.
