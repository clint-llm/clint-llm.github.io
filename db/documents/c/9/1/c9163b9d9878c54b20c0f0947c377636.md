Reye syndrome is most commonly precipitated by viral pathogens such as influenza A and B as well as varicella. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance data between 1980 and 1997 found that cases of Reye syndrome were preceded by influenza infection 73%, varicella infection 21%, and gastroenteritis infections 14% of the time. Serum salicylate concentrations were detectable in 82% of cases. Less commonly associated viral associations are seen with coxsackie, parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus and hepatitis. Bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia, Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma, and Shigella have also been associated with the development of Reye syndrome. Epidemiologic studies found a link between use of salicylate and development of Reye syndrome. While less than 0.1% of children who took aspirin developed Reye syndrome, more than 80% of children diagnosed with Reye syndrome had taken aspirin in the preceding 3 weeks. This data led to recommendations against the use of aspirin in children in 1980. The number of reported cases of Reye syndrome fell dramatically following the widespread warnings against the use of aspirin in children.
