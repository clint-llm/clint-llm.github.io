Prognosis has improved significantly since the advent of early detection due to awareness of the disease in endemic regions, and initiation of early antibiotic therapy. Fatality rates have fallen from nearly 20% in 1949 to less than 5% at present. Treatment should not be delayed awaiting confirmation of diagnosis fromÂ serologic testing or culture. It is well documented that recognition and treatment early on in the clinical course are crucial to improved outcomes.
