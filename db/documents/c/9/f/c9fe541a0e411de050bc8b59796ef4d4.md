Pernicious anemia is a relatively rare condition, with a prevalence of less than 1% in populations of European ancestry. Worldwide, pernicious anemia is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia; it affects people of all ages, particularly those over 60-70 (~2% prevalence); it affects both sexes with a varying geographical female-to-male ratio; and the prevalence is lower in those of Asian descent compared to other studied populations.
