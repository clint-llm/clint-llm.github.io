For patients presenting with conjunctivitis concerning for possible GC, further diagnostics are suggested to confirm the diagnosis. A sampling of conjunctival scrapings or exudative fluid can be sent for the following:

- Gram stain, which may reveal gram-negative intracellular diplococci

- Culture on Thayer-Martin media and/or chocolate agar for N. gonorrhoeae and blood agar for non-gonococcal species

- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can also be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae as well as Chlamydia trachomatis

- Screening for other STIs such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is also recommended in mothers and non-neonatal cases due to co-infections that can occur with STIs

- Consideration should also be given to taking genital and throat swabs in patients with risk factors.
