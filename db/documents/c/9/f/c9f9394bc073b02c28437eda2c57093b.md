Patients should understand that while tachycardia can be a normal physiologic response, it can be one of the first signs of serious medical illness. Patient education focused on the underlying etiology of tachycardia (particularly the associated symptoms) is essential to ensure proper management and follow up.

If any concerns regarding the presence of tachycardia with any associated symptoms (including chest pain or dyspnea), the patient should be advised to seek immediate medical attention.
