As the ictal-interictal continuum refers to electrographic patterns rather than a specific disease entity, its true incidence and prevalence are unknown. Gender distinctions likely parallel those observed in the underlying cause of the pattern. Investigation of these measures has been further complicated because various patterns have been added to, or excluded from, the IIC umbrella as insights into the clinical significance of these patterns has evolved.   While there is uncertainty about the epidemiological footprint of the IIC, seizure burden in the setting of these patterns has been investigated with highly variable results that rely heavily upon the type of pattern under scrutiny. Seizure incidence in critically ill patients has been demonstrated to range from 45 to 95% in patients with LPDs and as high as 43 to 78% in patients with BIPDs, but appears to be lower in patients with GPDs (11 to 89%) and LRDA (35 to 63%).

Morphology has been implicated as a risk factor for seizures, with “plus features” such as rhythmicity or fast frequencies superimposed on periodicity implicated in increased odds of developing discrete seizures and status epilepticus.
