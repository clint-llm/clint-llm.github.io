The primary lesion of crescentic GN is the destruction of a glomerular capillary wall along with the accumulation of parietal and visceral epithelial cells in Bowmenâ€™s space, forming a crescent. There is an accompanying accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages, and myofibroblasts with the proliferation of podocytes. That leads to diffuse, proliferative, necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescent formation. ANCA lesions can be found in various stages of crescents (cellular, fibrocellular, or fibrous) at the time of the biopsy, whereas all lesions in anti-GBM disease are in the same GN stage. Interstitial inflammation is also found mainly in the periglomerular region. In the later stage, fibrosis developed rapidly over a few days to weeks manifesting as glomerular sclerosis and obliteration. The immunofluorescence of the anti-GBM disease would show linear IgG deposition along the capillary wall and lesions on the same stage. While in immune complex deposition disease, there is the granular deposition of IgG, IgM, or IgA along the capillary wall, and lesions are in different stages. Pauci-immune disorder: There are no deposits, or very scant deposits of IgG or IgM or C3 is seen on immunofluorescent; the ANCA-associated GN lesions are also in various stages, and sometimes fibrinoid necrosis is found along with the other lesions.
