Diabetic neuropathy is a form of nerve pathology that may occur for those with diabetes. High blood sugar not only interferes with a nerve's ability to send signals but can also weaken the walls of the vasa nervorum blood vessels that supply nerves with oxygen and nutrients. Diabetic neuropathy can affect the nerves of the autonomic system, especially GVA fibers, which can result in decreased blood pressure regulation and gastroparesis.

General knowledge says that referred pain occurs because multiple primary sensory neurons converge on a single ascending tract in the spinal cord. When painful stimuli appear from visceral receptors, the brain is not able to distinguish between the visceral signals and signals that come from somatic receptors, which causes the brain to interpret that the pain is coming from somatic regions (i.e., skin, skeletal musculature, and bones) of the body rather than the visceral regions (i.e., spleen, kidney, and heart). For example, patients with angina pectoris, a type of cardiac pain, experience referred pain to the chest and upper left arm.
