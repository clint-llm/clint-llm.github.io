Contraindications to pediatric regional anesthesia are similar to those in adults.

Hemodynamic instability might be a limiting factor for performing a neuraxial technique. The risk of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) after trauma surgeries of extremities has been considered a relative contraindication to regional block, as a nerve block can mask pain, which is the most common presenting symptom of ACS. But this is not true, and there is evidence to the contrary.

When low concentration LA is used for the block, progressive increase in pain and increasing analgesic requirements can still point towards ACS. Other symptoms include paresthesia, swelling, and reduced perfusion. Major vertebral anomalies can frequently be present in children undergoing major urology, lower limb orthopedic reconstruction procedures. Therefore, caution is necessary when a neuraxial block is considered for these children. In addition, pre-existing neurological deficits might be considered a relative contraindication due to concern for the progressive deficit. Children with these conditions should be assessed on a case-by-case basis to evaluate the benefits and risks of performing the block.
