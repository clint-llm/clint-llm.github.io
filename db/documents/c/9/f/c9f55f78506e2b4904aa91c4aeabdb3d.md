Patients with insufficient sleep usually complain of sleep deprivation and excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue, which may affect their daytime functioning. Other symptoms, such as sleep paralysis and hypnogogic hallucinations, may be noted.

Patients may also report neuropsychological symptoms such as mood changes, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and decreased motivation. A thorough history usually reveals that these patients have a reduced time in bed due to reduced sleep opportunities. In contrastÂ to insomnia, in sleep insufficiency, there is no difficulty in the ability to initiate and maintain sleep naturally. An alarm or a bed partner can disrupt sleep, and in the absence of these disruptions, patients can usually sleep for adequate hours with improvement in daytime symptoms.

Patients may or may not be aware of the discrepancy between the hours of sleep needed and the hours achieved. A good history is essential to formulate an initial provisional diagnosis and to help differentiate it from other causes of disrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Physical examination in patients with insufficient sleep is generally unremarkable and is not explanatory of the patient's presenting complaints. A thorough clinical analysis, nevertheless, must be performed for signs of other sleep disorders.
