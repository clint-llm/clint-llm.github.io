**Benefits of Hospice Care**

Hospice care offers numerous benefits, including greater patient and family control of medical care, familiar surroundings for patients, decreased isolation of patients, and better access to loved ones. Hospice care does not require patients to accept their terminal prognosis or have a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. Instead, hospice works with each patient and family member to provide support and education to help them come to terms with approaching death. At the crux of hospice care is the interprofessional hospice team.

**Hospice Interprofessional Team**

The core hospice team is comprised of the hospice nurse, social worker, and chaplain. Medicare requires the core team members to be employed by the hospice agency. The core hospice team provides every level of hospice care, with the nurse being at the forefront of coordinating all the care the patient receives. The hospice medical director is also required to be a part of the interprofessional team (IDT). Together these comprise a hospice IDT, which develops an individualized plan of care for each patient-family unit. The plan of care is designed to meet the patient’s physical needs as well as the psychological, social, and even spiritual needs of the patient and family.

The interprofessional hospice team serves numerous roles. It manages the patient’s pain and other symptoms, assists the patient and family members with the psychosocial, emotional, and spiritual aspects of dying; it provides medications and medical equipment, instructs the family on how to care for the patient, and provides grief support and counseling both to the patient, surviving family, and friends after the patient’s death. Additionally, it makes short-term inpatient care available when pain or symptoms become unmanageable at home or when the caregiver needs respite time. When available, an IDT can provide specialized services like speech and physical therapy.

**Role of the Physician**

A physician can serve in one of three roles in hospice care; either the Hospice Medical Director (HMD), the attending physician, or the consultant physician. As the HMD, the physician assumes overall responsibility for the medical component of the care plans for all hospice patients, certifies and re-certifies a patient’s terminal illness, reviews, and updates a patient’s plan of care, participates in hospice’s quality improvement initiatives and educates members of the IDT on evidence-based symptom management and communication techniques.

The HMD also collaborates closely with the patient’s attending physician—the physician with the most significant role in determining and delivering the patient’s medical care. In most cases, the patient’s usual attending physician is a primary care physician but can also be a sub-specialist. The intent is for the attending physician to be the clinician who knows the patient best, likely from a previous provider-patient relationship. The patient/family must choose the hospice attending if they are able to identify one.  The attending physician can then continue to serve in a similar collaborative capacity when the patient is admitted for hospice care.

A consultant physician must be contracted with the hospice and is typically a sub-specialist who provides a particular service related to a hospice patient’s terminal condition (e.g., a single fraction palliative radiation treatment for a painful metastatic lesion administered by a consulting radiation oncologist). The Hospice can bill Medicare part A for these services and any medically indicated services provided by the HMD. These physician charges get reimbursed in addition to the per diem hospice rates paid by Medicare.  The hospice per diem rate includes all of the administrative responsibilities of the Hospice Medical Director. The hospice attending physician typically bills Medicare directly for their services under Part B, using a hospice modifier to indicate if service was 'related' or 'unrelated' to the terminal hospice diagnosis.
