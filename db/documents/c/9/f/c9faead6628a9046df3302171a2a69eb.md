The prognosis is good with appropriate treatment. To have the best prognosis, follow-up care with an ophthalmologist within 24 hours is imperative. Monitoring should include repeat slit-lamp and intraocular pressure checks every few days. When the condition is stable, monitoring can be every 1Â to 6 months. If not diagnosed and treated on time and neglected cases usually develop complications like cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and macular edema, and the prognosis is guarded in these cases.
