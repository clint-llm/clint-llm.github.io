The virulence and invasiveness depend on viral as well as host immune factors.HSV-1 encephalitis is not more common among the immunosuppressed, which explains that much of the HSV-1 infection may be immune-mediated.

Studies in the pre-acyclovir era have documented a rapidly evolving viral infection within the limbic system spreading to both sides of the brain with resultant inflammation and necrosis of the involved areas within three weeks.

There is no evidence of increased incidence of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in immunocompromised hosts though the mortality and morbidity are significantly higher. More diffuse involvement with the predominance of extratemporal lobe areas is often noted in such patients.
