History and careful observation of an episode are valuable in evaluating a patient with dystonic movements as part of an uncommon presentation of GERD. The initial symptoms are vital in making a correct diagnosis. One of the presentations of Sandifer syndrome is the exacerbation of the abnormal posturing immediately after eating and improvement in between feeds. Some parents describe intermittent episodes of torticollis that change from one side to another with feeds. It is important to note that the sternocleidomastoid muscle is normal, unlike true torticollis, where the muscle has spasms and has shortened. Hence these episodes of torticollis with GERD will not respond to physical therapy. This clinical picture can be easily confusing as seizures; however, during the paroxysmal events, patients are conscious, and these positions and movements do not occur during sleep.

The neurological exam is usually normal in these patients, making Sandifer syndrome a more likely diagnosis than epilepsy.

Patients present with excessive crying, fussiness, irritability, emesis, gagging, or choking during and after feeding with these episodes. If the symptoms continue, patients can develop anemia, weight loss, failure to thrive, and dental erosions. Providers need to be aware of complications of GERD, not only SS, but BRUE, apnea, recurrent pneumonia, chronic stridor, or wheezing.
