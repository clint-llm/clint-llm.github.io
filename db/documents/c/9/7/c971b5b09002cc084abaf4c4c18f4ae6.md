Consider tetanus prophylaxis. Obtain appropriate radiologic studies. Determine the appropriate setting for repair, such as operating room (OR) versus bedside.

Indications for OR repair include nasolacrimal system involvement, levator aponeurosis/superior rectus involvement, violation of orbital septum/visible orbital fat, canthal tendon avulsion, extensive tissue loss (more than one-third of the eyelid).

- Position the patient in the supine position.

- Instill topical anesthetic in each eye. Place a protective scleral shell over the affected eye. Irrigate the surrounding skin and clean it with a full-strength povidone-iodine solution. Ensure any foreign body or particulate matter is evacuated from the wound. Isolate the area with sterile drapes.

- If the canalicular system is involved, pack the nasal cavity with oxymetazoline and 4% lidocaine-soaked neuro sponges.

- Administer local subcutaneous anesthetic (2% lidocaine with 1 in 100,000 epinephrine) using the minimal amount necessary for adequate anesthesia.
