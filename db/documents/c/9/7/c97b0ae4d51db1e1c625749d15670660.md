The end of life is never a pleasant experience for the family or the clinicians. Nurses play a vital role in relieving anxiety in the caregivers/family members and developing a relationship with them. Nurses continually monitor the patient's level of impairment, physical limitations, and cognitive decline. When the patient has abnormal behavior, this has to be explained to the patient. Nurses should also educate the family that it is normal to feel guilty, but no one is at fault. The family has to be educated on all the medications and ways to make the patient comfortable.Â  The key is not to erode the quality of life of the patient and family.
