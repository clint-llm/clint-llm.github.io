Any patient presenting with dizziness or imbalance requires evaluation, looking at both systemic conditions such as hypoglycemia, transient ischemic attack, or end-organ damage such as vestibular damage or trauma to limbs, etc. Simple bedside tests such as the caloric reflex test, along with auditory symptoms such as tinnitus or hearing defects, act as a pointer towards a defect in vestibulo-ocular reflex. Vestibular rehabilitation with or without medication can help the patient depending upon the underlying condition.
