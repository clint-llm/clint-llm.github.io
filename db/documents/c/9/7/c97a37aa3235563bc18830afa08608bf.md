While historically not required for SVG harvest, imaging modalities may augment and decrease complications arising from excessive dissection. Historically, the GSV and less commonly the SSV may be identified and dissected using anatomic landmarks intraoperatively, with veins from both limbs available for dissection until encountering a suitable vein segment. More recently, ultrasonography and pre-operative vein mapping have shown utility in identifying suitable vein segments in a non-invasive manner and may decrease unnecessary vein exposure and dissection.
