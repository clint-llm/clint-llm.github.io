Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo often present with recurrent symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, or vomiting. The following article describes the use of the Epley maneuver (or canalith repositioning maneuver) to treat benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This activity outlines the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating BPPV with a low-cost, bedside solution.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and the treatment with the Epley maneuver.
- Outline the typical presentation of patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo needing Epley maneuver.
- Review the process to properly perform the Epley maneuver.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the proper diagnosis and treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
