Thoracolumbar traumatic injury was most commonly reported in the 15-29 year age group before 2000, but now the median age is 35. Approximately 27% of the patients with thoracolumbar junction injuries had neurological deficits, which results in detrimental effects on society due to lifelong disability and loss of productive economic years.

According to the United States National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, in approximately 54 cases per million people, 17,000 new spinal cord injury cases occur each year.

The incidence of thoracolumbar junction fractures after motor vehicle accidents is approximately 2.4%, but it has been increasing over the years.

A report from China found a thoracolumbar junction fracture incidence rate of 2.4 patients per million with a mean age of 49 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.4:1.

In children, thoracolumbar fractures are rare, with a reported incidence as low as 2% of all spine fractures. However, other series have reported an incidence of 5%-34%.
