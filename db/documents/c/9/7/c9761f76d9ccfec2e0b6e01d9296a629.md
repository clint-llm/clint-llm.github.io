The management of lymphedema is with an interprofessional team that consists of a primary care provider, nurse practitioner, vascular surgeon and an internist. However, these healthcare professionals need to be aware that in some patients with lymphedema, a lymphangiosarcoma may arise. It may arise in post operative mastectomy patients or in those with chronic lymphedema. In most cases, the tumor has spread by the time diagnosis is made. Only earyly diagnosis can improve survival. While survival rates have improved over the past 3 decades, still at least 50% of patients do not make it past 3 years.
