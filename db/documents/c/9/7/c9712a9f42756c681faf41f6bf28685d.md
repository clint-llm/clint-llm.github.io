A thorough physical exam and flexible fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation, complemented with both contrast-enhanced CT scan and MR imaging, are key in the diagnostic workup.

**Physical exam:**

Any patient with a history that is suspicious for a sinonasal tumor requires a thorough neurologic, ophthalmologic, and head and neck examination.

**Computed tomography (CT) scan:**

Radiographic assessment of esthesioneuroblastoma begins with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. Sinus disease and bony erosion depict well with CT scans.

**Magnetic resonance imaging:**

Esthesioneuroblastoma is most typically hypointense compared with brain gray matter on T1-weighted MRI and should enhance with gadolinium. T2-weighted images show an isointense or hyperintense mass. MRI provides better discrimination between tumor and secretions and optimal evaluation of orbital and intracranial or brain parenchymal involvement.

**Nuclear medicine scan:**

Most of these tumors are MIBG-avid, which can be used to differentiate them from anterior cranial fossa meningiomas.

**Biopsy of the tumor:**

Intraoperative biopsy under general anesthesia for the sinonasal mass is recommended. The biopsy is preferably performed after imaging studies have been reviewed to determine the vascularity of the mass.
