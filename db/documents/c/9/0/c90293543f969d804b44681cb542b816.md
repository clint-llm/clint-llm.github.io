The condition is caused by injury or entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) andÂ is classified as spontaneous or iatrogenic. Spontaneous causes include diabetes mellitus, lead poisoning, alcohol use disorder, and hypothyroidism resulting in an isolated neuropathy of the LFCN. Mechanical causes due to pressure on the LFCN include external direct pressure from tight seat belts, belts, or restrictive clothing. Additional mechanical causes include increased intra-abdominal pressure from obesity, pregnancy, or tumors. Leg length discrepancy, degenerative defects of the pubic symphysis, or possibly a rare bone tumor located at the iliac crests near the anterior superior iliac spine may also contribute.

Iatrogenic causes due to surgical intervention or direct nerve injury include hip replacement surgery, spine surgery, laparoscopic inguinal repair, pelvic osteotomy, surgery in the area of the anterior superior iliac spine, iliac crest bone graft harvesting, acetabular fracture surgery, laparoscopic myomectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, vein harvesting for coronary bypass surgeries, or bariatric surgery.
