Although the majority of ovarian cysts are incidental findings on physical exam or at the time of pelvic imaging, a detailed medical history with particular attention placed on gynecological history, family history, and physical examination should still be performed at each visit. Ovarian cysts can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptoms that women may experience include unilateral pain or pressure in the lower abdomen. Pain may be intermittent or constant and characterized as sharp or dull. If an ovarian cyst ruptures or ovarian torsion is present, the patient may experience a sudden onset of acute severe pain, possibly associated with nausea and vomiting. The menstrual cycle can become irregular, and abnormal vaginal bleed may occur.

On physical examination, palpation of the ovaries on the bimanual exam should help determine location, shape (regular or irregular), size, consistency, level of tenderness, and mobility. The ovaries can be difficult to palpate depending on the patientâ€™s body habitus, provider experience, and pelvic anatomy; therefore, the pelvic examination has limited ability to diagnose ovarian cysts.
