Patients who develop abducens nerve palsy often present with binocular horizontal diplopia, which is double vision when looking at objects side by side. There will be a notable weakness of the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle leading to a deficit in eye abduction on the affected side. Some patients may present with a constant head-turning movement to maintain binocular fusion and to lessen the degree of diplopia. Other findings in the clinical history may include vision loss, headache, vomiting, trauma, hearing loss, recent lumbar puncture, and recent viral illness.
