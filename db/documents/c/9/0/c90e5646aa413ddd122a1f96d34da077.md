**Cautions**

- May cause postrenal obstruction, which can lead to urinary retention and thus decreased glomerular filtration rate. If acute kidney injuryÂ develops, discontinue diphenhydramine and begin supportive care for acute kidney injury if needed.

- May cause CNS depression, which can impair driving or operating heavy machinery.

- May potentiate the effects of sedatives, including alcohol.

- Considered high-risk medication for elderly patients because of increased fall risk from dizziness, sedation, and hypotension.

- Inhibition of fast sodium channels and repolarizing potassium channels (Ikr) can prolong the action potential and the QT interval, leading to QTc prolongation.

- Use caution in patients with asthma, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or increased ocular pressure.
