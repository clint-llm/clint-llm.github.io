Physicians involved in acute patient care can expect to manage patients with EAC foreign bodies at some point in their careers. As such, it is crucial to recognize bothÂ clinician skill and equipment limitations. The type and location of the object in the EAC, along with the patient's ability to cooperate, are the key factors in determining whether an attempt at removal should be made. Referral to a specialist or a location where sedation can be performed is recommended if the initial evaluation indicates that removal is not practical. In general, complications tend to be minor and easily managed.
