Toxicity to the drug, while rare, should be carefully monitored. Common toxicity manifestations include severe gastrointestinal reactions, allergic cutaneous reactions, and central nervous system effects. All cutaneous reactions due to usage of the patch should prompt immediate removal of the patch for at least 48 hours before reapplying in a new area. Therapy should be discontinued if symptoms last longer than 48 hours or a severe cutaneous reaction occurs.

In addition to serious manifestations of common side effects, clinical staff members should always look for cholinergic crises whenever prescribing anticholinergic medications. Classic manifestations of a patient in crisis can be remembered by the mnemonic DUMBELS -Â **d**iarrhea,**u**rination,**m**iosis,**b**radycardia,**e**xcitability,**l**acrimation,**s**alivation/excessive sweating before treatment. Patients experiencing a cholinergic crisis should have atropine followed by pralidoxime to reverse the anticholinergic effects of rivastigmine. While the usual treatment of the crisis involves giving atropine before pralidoxime, a case study done in 2009 showed a successful reversal of cholinergic crisis with just pralidoxime without atropine pretreatment.
