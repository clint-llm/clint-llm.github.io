Congenital megalocornea may be associated with other underlying genetic malformations, and patients, or their parents in the case of infants and young children, should be appropriately advised. As nearly all causes of megalocornea are rare, testing (including genetic testing), may be appropriate for the proper diagnosis. Additionally, providers should limit unnecessary testing where possible. Patients and families should be informed about potential additional ocular effects that may occur later in life, and genetic counseling should be offered in many cases as appropriate.
