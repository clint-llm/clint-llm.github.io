The myocardium is divided into 17 segments on the basis of a short axis and a long axis slice. On the short-axis view, there is a septal, anterior,  lateral, and inferior wall. On the horizontal long axis, there are septal wall and lateral wall. On vertical long-axis view, there is an anterior and inferior wall.

The anterior and septal wall is supplied by the left anterior descending artery, the lateral wall is supplied by the left circumflex artery, and the inferior wall is supplied by the right coronary artery. Perfusion is graded from 0-normal uptake, 1-mildly reduced uptake, 2-moderately reduced uptake, 3-severely reduced uptake, and 4-no uptake. If there is no defect in both stress and rest images, it is normal myocardium. If there is a defect on stress images and normal rest images, it is ischemic myocardium. If there is a defect both on rest and stress, it is either scar or hibernating myocardium. Stress-induced cavity dilation on scan indicates severe and extensive coronary artery disease, either multivessel or left main involved.
