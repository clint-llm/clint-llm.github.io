Multiple transcatheter aortic valves are available on the market. However, the only two currently FDA-approved for use in the United States are the SAPIEN valves (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) and the CORE valves (Medtronic Fridley, MN). The SAPIEN valves are composed of bovine pericardial tissue and a chromium cobalt alloy frame. The SAPIEN valves are balloon expandable. The newest generation Medtronic valve is the EVOLUT-R. It is composed of porcine tissue and a nitinol frame. This valve has the advantage of being self-expandable (not requiring balloon expansion) and has the ability for repositioning after deployment. To date, there have not been any head-to-head trials comparing these two TAVR valves.

The procedure is typically done in a hybrid room with both operating room and cath lab capabilities. The team consists of interventional cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, and anesthesiologist. The procedure is done under direct visualization with fluoroscopy and occasionally transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) guidance. The most preferred and least invasive approach is the transfemoral approach. If not feasible, an alternate an often more invasive method may need to be used (subclavian, apical, trans-aortic).
