Intensive hemodynamic monitoring is critical when administering nitroprusside. As a result, SNP has classically been restricted to highly monitored settings such as the ICU or operating theater. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is required using an indwelling arterial line. With prolonged infusions or high infusion rates, close attention should also be paid to acid-base balance and mixed venous oxygen concentration, as unexplained acidemia and/or hypoxemia are often early signs of cyanide toxicity. However, It should be noted that these laboratory measures may not always provide reliable guidance. In most settings, serum cyanide concentrations are not of practical useÂ due to long turnaround times. Thiocyanate levels can be monitored in high-risk patients (those with renal dysfunction and/or infusions >3 days).
