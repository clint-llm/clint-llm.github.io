Familial hypercholesterolemia is a group of inherited genetic defects that lead to the severe elevation of serum cholesterol concentrations. Clinically familial hypercholesterolemia is diagnosed by a high serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and genetically is characterized into two subgroups: (1) autosomal dominant (AD), (2) codominant transmission with 90% or higher penetrance. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of familial hypercholesterolemia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of familial hypercholesterolemia.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of familial hypercholesterolemia.
- Review the treatment options available for familial hypercholesterolemia.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to optimize the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia and improve its outcomes.
