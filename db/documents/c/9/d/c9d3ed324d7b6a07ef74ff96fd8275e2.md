Differential diagnoses of DRS include disorders that cause or may appear to cause abduction deficits, such as sixth nerve palsy, infantile esotropia, Mobius syndrome, and congenital ocular motor apraxia. Most of these conditions can be differentiated from DRS on the basis of associated clinical features. For example, in infantile esotropia, abduction saccades and cross fixation are usually present; patients with Mobius syndrome may have associated feeding and speech difficulties; in congenital ocular motor apraxia, there is an inability to generate horizontal saccades. However, there is full retention of eye movements, and gradual improvement with time occurs.

Esotropic DRS and congenital sixth nerve palsy may be differentiated based on the following clues: 1) globe retraction in adduction is present in cases of DRS, while it is absent in sixth nerve palsy, 2) the esotropic angle is usually smaller in DRS patients compared with sixth nerve palsy patients who have the same limitation of abduction, and 3) the amount of abduction deficit varies in upgaze and downgaze in patients with DRS, whereas it is similar in patients with sixth nerve palsy.

Duane et al. described certain mechanical and neurogenic conditions that lead to globe retraction in adduction and limitation of abduction but are etiologically distinct from classical DRS. These conditions are collectively termed “Acquired retraction syndrome.”
