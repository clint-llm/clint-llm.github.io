High and low-risk stress fractures require the same basic plan for rehabilitation. They both require a period of immobilization to allow the fracture to heal. In general, high-risk injuries will require surgical fixation. The rehabilitation will require two phases of rehab. Phase one would be considered active rest. As the injured site is protected from further injury during a period of immobilization, aerobic fitness can be maintained using no-impact activities like cycling, deep water running, swimming and zero-gravity running. Once the patient has been pain-free for one to two weeks, then phase two can be started. During phase two, rehabilitation beings to strengthen the muscles of the injured extremity, improve proprioception, strengthen the core and pelvic girdle muscles, and return the patient to pre-injury levels of fitness.
