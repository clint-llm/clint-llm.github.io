The most commonly encountered complications involve maintaining a patent airway and/or managing a compromised airway. Examples include respiratory depression-related hypoxia, emesis and aspiration, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and allergic reactions/anaphylaxis. Other less common but severe complications include seizures, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and stroke. All providers must have the skills, equipment, and knowledge to manage these conditions emergently and transfer to a higher level of care when appropriate. A comprehensive knowledge base in pre-operative assessment/patient selection, airway management, ACLS, PALS, and anesthesia is critical in mitigating and managing the complications of OAPS. In addition, monthly reviews of emergency scenarios and their management can reduce adverse outcomes to airway-related complications.

For example, one should know the signs and symptoms of laryngospasm, including inspiratory stridor, loss of end-tidal CO2 waveform, and hypoxia. It should be managed algorithmically to ensure the patient maintains adequate oxygenation and recovers ventilation. This is done by delivering continuous positive airway pressure by Bag Valve Mask (BVM), increasing the depth of anesthesia, and finally administering an initial partial dose of succinylcholine (0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg IV) and, ultimately, a full dose (1 to 1.5 mg/kg IV) for attempted intubation.
