First described by E. Wagner in the late 18th century and later seen in patients with known tuberculous infections, peliosis hepatis is now associated with a wide range of conditions from medications, infections, hematologic conditions, transplants, malignancy, and autoimmune conditions. Of the medications, many toxic therapies, including immunosuppressants such as 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and tamoxifen, have demonstrated an association with the condition. Infectious causes include tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and bacillus infections. The prevalence of the disease in patients with known associated conditions ranges from 0.2% to 22%. Although rarely documented, patients with known X-linked myotubular myopathy seem to have a genetic predisposition to the condition, demonstrating that there is likely a genetic component as well.
