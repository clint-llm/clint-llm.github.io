Bisphosphonate use is becoming a cornerstone in the management of metastatic bone disease and osteoporosis. As with any medication, bisphosphonate use can cause toxicity. Clinicians need to be mindful of these toxic side effects. Regular check-ups and routine physical examinations, as well as frequent blood tests, are key in the ongoing management of patients receiving bisphosphonates. This is best achieved with an interprofessional team approach. Prompt recognition of toxicities is important in improving outcomes. Providing education to patients and families before and during treatment with bisphosphonates can also improve patient outcomes by early detection of toxicities. Interprofessional team input is essential in managing toxicities once they occur.
