Open tracheostomy is generally carried out in the operating suite by a surgeon and complimentary staff, as outlined above. Usually, the patient is intubated and under general anesthesia, but in situations such as Ludwig angina, a local anesthetic can be utilized, and the tracheostomy performed with the patient awake. Initially, a cuffed non-fenestrated tracheostomy tube is used. In situations where aerosolization of respiratory secretions is a concern, appropriate specialized personal protective equipment is necessary for the team, and the procedure should be performed in a negative-pressure room.
