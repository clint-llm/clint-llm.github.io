Renal calculi are a common cause of blood in the urine (hematuria) and pain in the abdomen, flank, or groin. They occur in one in 11 people at some time in their lifetimes, with men affected 2 to 1 over women. Development of the stones is related to decreased urine volume or increased excretion of stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, uric acid, cystine, xanthine, and phosphate. Calculi may also be caused by low urinary citrate levels or excessive urinary acidity. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of renal calculi and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the types of renal calculi.
- Review the presentation of renal calculi.
- Summarize the treatment options for renal calculi.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by renal calculi.
