Proteus mirabilis is a gram-negative facultative anaerobe with swarming motility and an ability to self-elongate and secrete a polysaccharide which allows it to attach to and move along surfaces like catheters, intravenous lines, and other medical equipment. The most definitive form of evaluation for an acute P. mirabilis infection is a culture. However, positive culture results must be considered in conjunction with a patient's presentation for an accurate diagnosis to be made. This activity describes the presentation and evaluation of Proteus infections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of infected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of proteus infections in non-hospitalized versus hospitalized patients.
- Describe the clinical manifestations of Proteus infections. 
- Outline the treatment considerations for Proteus infections in hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients. 
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with Proteus infections.
