There is no specific treatment for simple or complex febrile seizures other than appropriate treatment for underlying etiologies driving the ongoing febrile illness.  Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent a recurrence of febrile seizures.  In patients who have a frequent recurrence of febrile seizures such as seizures with a majority of febrile illnesses, studies have examined treatment with benzodiazepines as a bridging measure for a few days during subsequent febrile events.

Febrile status epilepticus can occur in less than 10% of children during the first febrile seizure. Rectal diazepam is used to abort this disorder if it lasts more than 5 minutes. There are also recommendations for intranasal midazolam. Patients with febrile status epilepticus are at risk for future episodes of the same event.
