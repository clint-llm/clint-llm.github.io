A carotid bruit is a vascular sound usually heard with a stethoscope over the carotid artery because of turbulent, non-laminar blood flow through a stenotic area. A carotid bruit may point to an underlying arterial occlusive pathology that can lead to stroke. Stroke is a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and loss of physical mobility. A large portion of ischemic strokes is due to carotid atherosclerotic plaque; therefore, early detection of carotid disease is central to minimizing stroke incidence. Since auscultation for a carotid bruit is non-invasive, it has been routinely performed during physical exams, especially in patients deemed high risk for cerebrovascular diseases, such as the elderly. This activity addresses interprofessional strategies for evaluation and potentially treating clinically significant carotid bruits.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of carotid bruit.
- Outline the evaluation of carotid bruit.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for a carotid bruit.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination for the evaluation of a carotid bruit to improve outcomes.
