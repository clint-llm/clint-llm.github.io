**General Treatment**

- Provide immediate supplemental oxygen at highest normobaric FiO2 available.

- Consult ophthalmology but do not delay treatment if readily available.

- Baseline complete blood count (CBC), ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), INR if on coumadin

- ECG

- Carotid ultrasound, MRI, and echocardiogram can be done later. These are not urgent studies for these patients but are part of the complete assessment for risk factor modification, just as in stroke.

- If the onset of symptoms is within 24 hours of presentation, and the patient has no response to normobaric hyperoxia after 15 minutes, refer for emergency hyperbaric medicine consultation.

**Hyperbaric Oxygen Treatment Protocol**

Indicated for central retinal artery occlusion****(UHMS Hyperbaric Oxygen Indications, 13th Ed., Weaver)

Initial treatment:

- Compress to 2 atmosphere absolute (ATA).

- If vision improves significantly at 2 ATA, then remain at this depth for 90 minutes.

- If vision fails to improve after 30 minutes at 2 ATA, then compress to 2.4 ATA, and if vision improves at this depth, treat at this depth for 90 minutes. If there is no improvement at 2.4 ATA, compress to 2.8 ATA and perform the US Navy Treatment Table No. 6.

If no improvement after initial US Navy Table No. 6, options are:

- Discontinue treatment

- Continue with normobaric oxygen therapy

- Give 2 additional treatments at 2.8 ATA for 90 minutes with 5-minute air breaks every 30 minutes 2 times per day and reassess after 4 to 6 days. Most patients will reach a plateau after which they will not experience any further improvement in visual acuity and treatment can then be discontinued. Some patients require 8 treatments before having an improvement in visual acuity, but few if any patients will respond beyond this point.
