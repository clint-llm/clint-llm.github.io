A neurology consult is a must for expert evaluation and management. An infectious disease consult is ideal if no cause for encephalitis can be established after the initial workup, especially if the patient is not adequately improving or is deteriorating. Neurosurgeons may need to be involved if significant brain involvement with midline shift occurs or a brain biopsy is planned (rarely indicated or performed currently). A rehabilitation consultÂ is necessary for short-term and long-term neurorehabilitation. Psychologist/psychiatrist referral may be required for patients and family members to cope with long-term neuropsychiatric issues.

Similarly, in children, apart from neonatology or pediatrician involvement for patients belonging to this age group, pediatric infectious disease and neurology experts may have to be involved.
