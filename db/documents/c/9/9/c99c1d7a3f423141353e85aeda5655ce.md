As with the various classifications for aphasias, there are many classification schemas to categorize agraphias. One such clinical neurological schema is used in this article. However, neuropsychological or psycholinguistic schemas to classify agraphia are also commonly used.

Similarly, definitions and terminology in the study of neurologic language impairment can frequently be ambiguous or contradictory, with certain trends appearing in the literature over time. This is likely due partly to an understanding of agraphia that has evolved alongside technological advances.

In assessing agraphia, it is essential to consider a patient's education level. Illiteracy, in which written ability is never acquired, must be distinguished from agraphia. Literacy rates may vary depending on the practice setting. The patient's primary language should be considered, especially if it is different from the working language of the examiner. In-person or video-based professional language interpretation may be necessary for adequate assessment.

In our increasingly digitized world, the investigation of typing and texting--forms of non-motor writing--warrants consideration for inclusion in the standard clinical assessment of language.
