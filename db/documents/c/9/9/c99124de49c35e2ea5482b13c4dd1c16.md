Data on the prognosis of tumor lysis syndrome, whether before the start of chemotherapy or after successful completion, is limited. However, using a recombinant urate oxidase has significantly decreased the incidence of acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.

An increase in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of tumor lysis syndrome has led to better outcomes.

Management protocol and treatment are being modified based on a better understanding of the disease process. This has led to a significant decrease in poor outcomes with tumor lysis syndrome.
