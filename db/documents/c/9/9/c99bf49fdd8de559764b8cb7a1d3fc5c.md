Radiographic imaging is necessary for all patients with acute or chronic shoulder pain.

**Radiographs**

Clinicians should obtain a true anteroposterior (AP) image of the glenohumeral joint (also known as the “Grashey” view). The true AP image is taken with the patient rotated between 30 and 45 degrees offset the cassette in the coronal plane. The beam can otherwise be rotated while the patient is neutral in the coronal plane. Other standard views include the axillary lateral view and “scapular Y”/outlet views.

**Advanced Imaging**

MRI and MR arthrography (MRA) are commonly used imaging modalities to detect a SLAP lesion. Intra-articular contrast media and articular effusion, as well as arm traction and external rotation, improve the sensitivity of the MRI to determine a SLAP lesion.  Clinicians should keep in mind the utilization of MRA may promote the overdiagnosis of asymptomatic (or clinically irrelevant) SLAP lesions and thus exercise best clinical judgment in ordering specific advanced imaging modalities. The endemic rate of variations of labral anatomy visible on MRI in asymptomatic overhead throwers should prompt caution before concluding that the labrum is the source of the patient’s pain.

Schwartzberg reported MRI documented SLAP lesions can be present in up to 72% of middle-aged, asymptomatic patients.
