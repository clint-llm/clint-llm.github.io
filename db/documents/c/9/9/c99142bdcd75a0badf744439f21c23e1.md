Complex partial seizures, also known as focal impaired awareness seizures or focal onset impaired awareness seizures, refer to focal seizures that start in one hemisphere of the brain and are associated with an impairment in consciousness. These seizures involve an epileptiform activity that starts in a particular focal region of the brain and impairment in a patient's level of consciousness occurring at some point during the seizure. Typically, consciousness is maximally impaired toward the beginning of a seizure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of focal impaired awareness seizures.
- Outline the testing that should be done in patients who present with a history of impaired consciousness.
- Describe the management considerations for focal impaired awareness seizures.
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with focal impaired awareness seizures.
