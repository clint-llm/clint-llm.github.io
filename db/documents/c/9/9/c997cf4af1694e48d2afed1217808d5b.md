The recurrent artery of Heubner can be affected by various pathologies such as:

- Large artery disease due to greater than 50% stenosis of large vessels such as the carotid artery

- Small vessel disease secondary to hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia

- Cardiac emboli following atrial fibrillation, cardiac hypokinesis, mural thrombus, and dilated cardiomyopathies

- Trauma predisposing to the dissection of the vessel as well as the microthrombi formation

- Vasospasm following a ruptured aneurysm

- Inadvertent clipping during microsurgical clipping of anterior communicating artery aneurysm

- Dissecting aneurysm of the recurrent artery of Heubner (e.g., in a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta)

- Vascular malformations like cavernoma

There are varied clinical spectra of presentation ina patient following diminished blood supply owing to damage to the recurrent artery of Heubner and are categorizable into:

- Hemiparesis with fasciobrachiocrural predominance

- Dysarthria due to the involvement of the corticolingual and the corticostriatocerebellar pathways

- Choreoathetosis

- Behavioral changes like abulia or hyperactivity due to interruptions between the associative cortex with the deep cortical regions

- Aphasia in left-sided involvement

- Left visual neglect in right-sided involvement

The  neurological abnormalities analyzed in one study following vascular lesions in the caudate region,  in the decreasing order of frequency in one study were

- Abulia

- Frontal lobe abnormalities

- Speech deficits in patients with left-sided lesions and

- Neglect syndromes in those with right-sided lesions

The diagnosis of the involvement of the recurrent artery of Heubner is diagnosable with the aid of plain computerized tomography of head revealing hypodensity in the caudate region in cases of infarction and hyperdensity in cases with hemorrhage. The ultra-early diagnosis of the infarction in the caudate region due to the involvement of the recurrent artery of Heubner can be facilitated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with special sequences such as diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

The endovascular approach has a dual advantage in that it can diagnose the vasospasm in the selected vessels as well have the benefits of simultaneous therapeutic benefits through the application of stents and vasodilators.
