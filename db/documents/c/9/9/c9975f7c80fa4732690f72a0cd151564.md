Coccidioides is endemic to California, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico. Coccidioidomycosis is a reportable disease. For unknown reasons, the incidence rates in Arizona have increased lately. In 2011, the incidence of coccidioidomycosis was 42.6 cases per 100,000 population and highest among persons aged 60 to 79 years (69.1/100,000). In some areas within the endemic region, Valley fever can cause an estimated 15% to nearly 30% of community-acquired cases of pneumonia. C. immitis can cause disease in non-endemic regions due to wind carrying the infectious particles over long distances.
