The key feature of organophosphate insecticides is the inhibition of carboxyl ester hydrolases, chiefly inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This enzyme plays a vital role in the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is found in both the peripheral and central nervous systems.

The organophosphate insecticide inactivates AChE by phosphorylating the serine hydroxyl group on the enzyme. This is followed by the accumulation of acetylcholine which then overstimulates the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors.
