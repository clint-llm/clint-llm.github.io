**Responsibilities of Employers**

In the past, the majority of workplaces in the United States had no plans for dealing with active shooter incidents.  However, the number of shooting incidents has promoted most healthcare facilities to initiate measures to prevent or decrease the risk of active shooter incidents. Plus, in all government and healthcare facilities, OSHA also has made recommendations for employers.

- The workplace has to offer employees a place which is safe and free from physical hazards

- The workplace should employ best practices and industry standards to ensure worker safety

- The workplace must follow all state and federal guidelines when it comes to safety

- Educate and create awareness among healthcare workers about the possibility of an active shooter

- Incorporate preventive measures from past shooting events

Finally, it is important to be aware that health care facilities that are not compliant with OSHA recommendations can be held legally liable for any injuries or deaths that occur during an active shooter incident.  Several lawsuits have already been filed in court that have accused the facilities of inadequate security or negligence.
