The natural history and prognosis of ventricular aneurysms are not well defined because most of the reports are based on retrospective data and autopsy studies. In two autopsy studies, in which the age of the aneurysm had to be estimated from a retrospective analysis of case notes, the 5-year mortality rates were 30 and 80%. The most common cause of death was recurrent myocardial infarction and not congestive heart failure. In clinical studies, the prognosis depends on the size of the aneurysm and the presence of symptoms. In the study of Mourdjinis et al., the 5-year mortality was 50% overall, but only 10% in patients with small aneurysms.

In the prospective CASS study, the cumulative 4-year survival rate in patients with angiographic LV aneurysms is 71%. The mortality was dependent on the extent of coronary disease and the degree of LV dysfunction. The presence of an aneurysm per se did not add to the risk of death. Whether surgical intervention with aneurysmectomy alters the natural history or outcome of the condition remains controversial. Large-scale prospective studies comparing conservative and surgical approaches are lacking.

The most recent reported 5-year survival figures following surgery range from 68 to 79%, with only 10% operative mortality. For conservatively treated patients, the survival data at five years is slightly different, ranging from 66.7 to 70%. In the CASS study, the comparison of patients with medically or surgically treated improved survival with surgery was reported only in selected high-risk subgroups, for example, those with triple-vessel disease. This study suggests that survival is determined primarily by revascularization and not aneurysmectomy. Cosgrove et al. demonstrated that the 7-year survival of patients undergoing aneurysmectomy was 65% in those undergoing complete revascularization, compared with 50% for those in whom revascularization was incomplete.

The prospective, randomized STICH (Surgical Treatments for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial may provide more definitive data regarding the effect of surgery for ventricular restoration on survival, ventricular size and function, quality of life, and exercise capacity.
