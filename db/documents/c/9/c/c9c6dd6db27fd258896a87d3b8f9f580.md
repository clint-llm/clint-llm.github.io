It is important for the healthcare team to work together to ensure the appropriate DEXA test is ordered and that the test is done correctly.  According to ACR Appropriateness Criteria Osteoporosis and Bone Mineral Density, there are specific cases in which Quantitative CT (QCT) is considered superior to DEXA.  These include 1. Extremes in body height (i.e. very large and very small patients) 2.  Patients with extensive degenerative disease of the spine 3. Severely obese patients (body mass index > 35 kg/meters squared). 4. A clinical scenario that requires increased sensitivity to small changes in trabecular bone density (parathyroid hormone and glucocorticoid treatment monitoring).

Pitfalls in DEXA are common and errors can be categorized as patient positioning, data analysis, artifacts, and/or demographics.  Structural changes, such as osteophytes, calcifications, or fractures are more common in the lumbar spine than proximal femur
