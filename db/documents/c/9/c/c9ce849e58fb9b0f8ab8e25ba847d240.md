Enterobacter infections are associated with an extensive range of clinical manifestations. The most common clinical syndromes are bacteremia, lower respiratory tract infections, UTIs, surgical site infections, and intravascular device-associated infections. Less commonly occurring infections are nosocomial meningitis, sinusitis, and osteomyelitis. Enterobacter infections can have very similar clinical presentations as other facultative anaerobic gram-negative rod bacterial infections,Â to the point that they can often be indistinguishable.

Enterobacter bacteremia has been widely studied. Fever is the most common presentation in this syndrome, as well as systemic inflammatory response (SIRS), hypotension, shock, and leukocytosis, as seen in many other bloodstream presentations.

Enterobacter pneumonia commonly presents with cough, shortness of breath, and consolidations found on a chest x-ray. Enterobacter UTI can present with dysuria, frequency, urgency, and positive leukocyte esterase or nitrites on urinalysis.

Risk factors that predispose to infection include the following:

- Prolonged recent use of antimicrobial treatment

- Immunocompromised states, particularly malignancy and diabetes

- Presence of invasive medical devices

- Admission to the ICU

- Recent hospitalization or invasive procedure
