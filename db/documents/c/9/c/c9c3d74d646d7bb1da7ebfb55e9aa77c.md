# Continuing Education Activity

Tricyclic antidepressants are a class of medications used in the management and treatment of major depressive disorder. This activity reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications for tricyclic antidepressants as a valuable agent in treating major depressive disorder. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, monitoring, relevant interactions, off-label uses, and other key elements of tricyclic antidepressant therapy pertinent for interprofessional team members in the management of patients with major depressive disorder and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common adverse effects associated with tricyclic antidepressant therapy.
- Outline the indications of tricyclic antidepressant therapy.
- Review the mechanism of action of tricyclic antidepressant therapy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients receiving tricyclic antidepressant therapy.

# Indications

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a drug class that was first released to the market in 1959 as a pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD).

In treating major depressive disorder, TCAs display equivocal efficacy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but TCAs cause more significant adverse effects due to their anticholinergic activity and a lower threshold for overdose.

# Mechanism of Action

Tricyclic antidepressants act on approximately five different neurotransmitter pathways to achieve their effects. They block the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in presynaptic terminals, which leads to increased concentration of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The increased concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin in the synapse likely contribute to its anti-depressive effect. Additionally, they act as competitive antagonists on post-synaptic alpha cholinergic (alpha1 and alpha2), muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors (H1).

The chemical structure of a TCA consists of a three-ringed structure with an attached secondary or tertiary amine. Secondary amines include desipramine, nortriptyline, and protriptyline, while tertiary amines consist of amitryptiline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine. Tertiary amines tend to have greater blockage of serotonin reuptake, while secondary amines have greater blockage of norepinephrine uptake.

# Administration

TCAs are available in the form of oral tablets, capsules, and solutions. Although intravenous (IV) use of some TCAs, such as clomipramine, has taken place in clinical trials, IV is not a routine route of administration for the administration of TCAs.

# Adverse Effects

TCAs have varying degrees of receptor affinities, leading to several adverse effects. The most common adverse effects include constipation, dizziness, and xerostomia.

TCAs may also cause cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, such as QTc prolongation, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death in patients with preexisting ischemic heart disease.

TCA use has been shown to lead to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in individuals age 24 or less. Therefore, individuals started on TCAs of age 24 or less should be followed closely to assess for thoughts and behaviors related to suicide.

The use of TCAs during pregnancy has correlated with congenital eye, ear, face, and neck defects.

# Contraindications

Tricyclic antidepressants are contraindicated in several populations and with the concomitant use of various medications. TCAs should not be prescribed if there is a family history of QTc interval prolongation or sudden cardiac death. Hypersensitivity reactions to a TCA drug are considered an absolute contraindication. However, patients with a hypersensitivity reaction to a particular TCA drug may be prescribed a different member of the class with caution. TCAs should not be used concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), e.g., phenelzine, due to the risk of developing serotonin syndrome.

TCA use requires caution in individuals with angle-closure glaucoma as its anticholinergic effects may increase the risk of an acute ocular crisis.

# Monitoring

Overall, the therapeutic index of TCAs is narrow, and the therapeutic range for each specific TCA is dependent on the drug prescribed. Because of the narrow therapeutic index of TCAs, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of toxicity, i.e., QRS-widening on electrocardiogram (ECG), tremors, confusion, muscle rigidity, and coma.

All patients starting a TCA need screening for pre-existing cardiac conditions, including prolonged QTc intervals, heart disease, and a family history of arrhythmias. Patients who test positive for pre-existing heart conditions may need additional evaluation by a cardiologist before initiating treatment. Additionally, these patients require regular monitoring for the presence of new cardiac symptoms. Patients with low potassium blood concentrations should have periodical monitoring to reduce the risk of arrhythmias.

All patients starting a TCA or presently taking a TCA should be monitored for worsening depressive symptoms or new-onset suicidal thoughts or behaviors. It may be helpful to monitor the blood concentrations of TCAs in non-adherent patients, have decreased tolerability or little response to the drug. However, there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of blood concentration monitoring on clinical outcomes.

# Toxicity

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) generally have a narrow therapeutic index and, therefore, are prone to induce toxicity if intentional overdose occurs. They have demonstrated higher rates of death per one million prescriptions when compared to other antidepressants due to higher rates of suicide by deliberate overdose.

Overdose symptoms include ECG abnormalities such as QTc prolongation and widened QRS complex, hypotension, seizures, tremors, coma, xerostomia, urinary retention, and respiratory depression.

TCAs should not be used concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) due to the risk of developing serotonin syndrome.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of antidepressants that are commonly prescribed for off-label use today. Although TCAs may be prescribed for MDD, they are seldom prescribed as a first-line treatment due to their unfavorable adverse effect profile, i.e., anticholinergic, antihistamine, and antiadrenergic effects, and because there are many safer alternatives available, such as SSRIs. However, TCAs may be prescribed for MDD if more conservative antidepressant pharmacotherapy has failed. Regardless of the indications for TCAs, patients who require treatment with TCAs need the involvement of an interprofessional team to help maintain patient safety.

Coordination between a patient's primary care physician, psychiatrist, and possibly cardiologist if cardiac function abnormalities are present is essential for maintaining patient stability and preventing adverse outcomes. Patient monitoring for suicidal intent is necessary to avoid toxicity and overdose.

Pharmacists should have involvement in the care of patients prescribed TCAs. Pharmacists can confirm the appropriate dosage and can recognize critical drug-drug interactions. Also, TCAs primarily undergo metabolism in the liver, so pharmacists can reduce the risk of interaction with other drugs by identifying the concomitant drugs that influence hepatic metabolism.
