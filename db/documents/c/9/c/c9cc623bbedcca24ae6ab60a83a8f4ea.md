Multiple theories and models exist which speak to the possible etiology of the panic disorder itself. Most indicate the potential role of chemical imbalance as a major factor, including abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid, cortisol, and serotonin. It is believed that a genetic and environmental factor plays a role in the pathogenesis of panic disorder. Several studies show that adverse childhood conditions may lead to panic disorder in adulthood. Newer research indicates that neural circuitry may have a greater role in panic disorder whereby certain areas of the brain are hyperexcitable in individuals and that would make them prone to developing the disorder.

Some studies show that genetic factors may play a role in the etiology of panic disorder. First-degree relatives have a 40% risk of developing the syndrome if someone in the family already has been diagnosed with the disorder. In addition, patients with panic disorder also have a high risk of developing other mental health disorders.
