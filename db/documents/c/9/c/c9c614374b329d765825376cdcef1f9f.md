Newer pacemakers have made it possible that patients can be monitored remotely, and malfunctioning or arrhythmic episodes are identified in real-time. In the case of pacemaker mediated tachycardia, it is important thatÂ an interprofessional team consisting of the cardiac electrophysiologist, cardiac nurses, and the device company all work together in identifying this arrhythmia and informing the responsible clinician. The fact that it is easily treatable and can be prevented with simple device programming makes it more important to be identified early.
