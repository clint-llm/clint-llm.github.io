Growth plate or physeal fractures are common injuries in skeletally immature children and adolescents. Most fractures in skeletally immature individuals involve the physis as this cartilaginous growth center is the weakest part of the bone and, therefore, more susceptible to injury. Triplane ankle fractures are complex traumatic Salter-Harris IV fractures involving the metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis. The term “triplane” refers to the different orientations of the fracture lines in the distal tibia and represents a frequent diagnostic challenge. The epiphysis is fractured in the sagittal plane and is visible on the anteroposterior (AP) radiograph. The posterior aspect of the metaphysis is fractured in the coronal plane and appreciated on the lateral radiograph. The physis becomes separated in the axial plane. Treatment is closed reduction or surgical fixation depending on the degree of fracture displacement and articular step-off. The prognosis is excellent, given the triplane ankle fracture is identified and appropriately treated.
