Patient education is critical in the treatment of allodynia, to manage the goals and expectations of medical therapy. As mentioned above, often patients hope for complete and immediate resolution of their pain, which is rarely achievable. Allodynia often becomes persistent, no matter how much medical and alternative therapy a patient receives. Healthcare practitioners need to clearly communicate that the goal of medical therapy is not to completely alleviate allodynia, but to decrease the pain to an acceptable level and to improve functioning.

Many patients erroneously believe opioids are effective for chronic neuropathic pain. Clinicians should educate patients that opioids are considered by the IASP as third-line agents for neuropathic pain as they are not very effective and can cause addiction and worsen long-term pain; the recommendation is to defer starting opioids if possible.
