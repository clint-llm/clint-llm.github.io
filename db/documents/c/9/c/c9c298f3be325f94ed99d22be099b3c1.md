**Mechanism**

Olmesartan functions as an angiotensin-II receptor blocker to undermine the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.****lowers blood pressure. Olmesartan competitively blocks the binding of AT-II to its receptor, thus inhibiting the release of aldosterone****from the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex.****The reduction in serumÂ aldosterone, in turn, results in reduced expression of ENaC channels within the distal collecting tubule of the nephron leading to decreased sodium reabsorption.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption**

- Gastrointestinal absorption of an oral pill

- The bioavailability is about 26% and unaltered with the consumption of food.

**Distribution**

- The volume of distribution is approximately 17 L as it has a high affinity for plasma proteins.

- It does not enter red blood cells; animal studies also show poor blood-brain barrier penetration.

**Metabolism**

- Ester hydrolysis in the gastrointestinal tract activates olmesartan upon digestion.

**Clearance**

- Total plasma clearance is 1.3 Liters/hour

- Renal clearance is 0.6 Liters/hour

**Elimination**

- Biphasic elimination

- Half-life (T1/2) = 10 to 15 hours

- Route = 35 to 50% eliminated unchanged in the urine, remainder eliminated in the feces.

- Olmesartan exhibits linear pharmacokinetics following multiple oral doses of up to 80 mg and single oral doses of up to 320 mg. Steady-state levels of olmesartan are attained in 3 to 5 days.
