Dental agenesis may arise from intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors. In non-syndromic cases, 7 discreet genes (AXIN2, EDA, LRP6, MSX1, PAX9, WNT10A, and WNT10B) have been identified in association with dental agenesis. These genes displaying several mutations were detected in 91.9% of all molecular analyses in patients. The majority of cases showed a mutation in the PAX9 and WNT10A genes.

There are numerous theories to the development of hyperdontia or supernumerary teeth, as it is not fully understood.
