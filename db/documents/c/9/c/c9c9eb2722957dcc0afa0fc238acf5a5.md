This histopathology has several defining features. These include papillomatosis (circumscribed epidermal elevations that resemble church spires), acanthosis (epidermal thickening), hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum), and hypergranulosis (thickening of the stratum granulosum).

Cytologically, AKV has overlapping features with Darier disease, stemming from the fact that the diseases originate from mutations in the same gene.
