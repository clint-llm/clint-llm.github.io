Traditionally, staging has its basis on the extent of guttata and presence of corneal edema

**Krachmer Scale 
**



**:
**

- Grade 0 (G0): Negative; no apparent disease

- Grade 1 (G1): definitive onset of the disease 0-12 central, non-confluent guttata in at least one eye; typically asymptomatic

- Grade 2 (G2): more than 12 central nonconfluent guttata in at least one eye

- Grade 3 (G3): zone of central confluent central guttata 1-2mm in the horizontal plane

- Grade 4 (G4): zone of central confluent central guttata 2-5mm in the horizontal plane

- Grade 5 (G5): zone of central confluent central guttata >5mm with or without edema of the corneal stroma and/or epithelium layer

Additionally, four distinct stages have been defined that span the FED course by two to three decades.

A description of the **four stages** appears below:

- Stage 1: asymptomatic; however, slit-lamp examination exhibits central nonconfluent guttata and a thickened Descemetâ€™s membrane

- Stage 2: guttata coalesce; corneal endothelial polymegathism (variation in cell size), pleomorphism (variation in cell shape), and cell loss are present; symptoms of blurry vision and glare, especially when awakening

- Stage 3: dysfunction of the endothelial pump; formation of bullae in epithelial and subepithelial layers; development of corneal edema

- Stage 4: corneal edema results in haziness, scarring, and decreased vision

These staging scales may be losing clinical relevance due to the advent of non-surgical treatments and techniques, allowing for earlier surgical intervention.
