Hypothyroidism is an endocrine disorder with resultant under-production of thyroid hormone. Common symptoms of hypothyroidism include cold intolerance and weight gain due to decreased basal metabolic rate and thermogenesis, depression, fatigue, decreased peripheral reflexes, and constipation, due to decreased stimulation of the central and peripheral nervous system. Many other consequences of hypothyroidism can manifest secondary to the lack of activated thyroid hormone on various tissues and organs of the body.

Hyperthyroidism is an endocrine disorder with excess thyroid hormone production. In contrast to hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism often causes heat intolerance, weight loss, anxiety, hyperreflexia, and diarrhea, as well as palpitations. Increased stimulation of basal metabolic rate, thermogenesis, resting heart rate, and cardiac output, and central and peripheral nervous systems result in the most common symptoms. However, a multitude of symptoms can present, including brittle hair, dry skin, and pretibial myxedema.
