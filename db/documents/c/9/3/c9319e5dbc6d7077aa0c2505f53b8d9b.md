Benign mesotheliomas are a rare entity and, as such, require a cautious approach. Close collaboration between treating clinicians and surgeons and the operating team of nurses, technicians, anesthesiology staff, and radiologists and pathologists, is necessary to arrive at the correct diagnosis and treatment plan. Proper collaboration should aim for maximal treatment and limit unnecessary morbidity and/or mortality associated with the treatment of benign mesotheliomas. Unfortunately, benign versus malignant mesothelial proliferations and neoplasms can be quite difficult to distinguish from one another, such that even experts in these fields may disagree on their classification on a case by case basis. Upcoming and developing molecular analysis methods may be able to aid the classification of benign vs. malignant mesotheliomas.
