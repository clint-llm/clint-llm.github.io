When the history and physical examination is indicative of a potential injury to the common peroneal nerve, plain radiography should be part of the initial workup. Because of the proximity of the common peroneal nerve to the fibular neck as well as its superficial location, it is particularly susceptible to direct trauma injury as well as entrapment by soft and bony tissue. In addition to plain radiography, CT scans can be used to evaluate further osseous abnormalities, and MRI/ultrasound can be used to assess soft-tissue sources or masses.

Electrodiagnostic studies, including nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests and electromyography tests (EMG), can be used to diagnose peroneal nerve palsy. These tests help in the evaluation of the motor and sensory axons of the peroneal nerve and its branches. They are also helpful in the localization of nerve injury. These tests are useful in patients presenting with new-onset of peroneal nerve symptoms such as foot drop without a traumatic mechanism in addition to evaluating patients in the postoperative setting of a known traumatic peroneal nerve injury to plan long-term management as well as to provide patient.
