**Ensuring Safety Precautions**

Both the caregiver and the healthcare provider have an important duty in ensuring the safety of the patient with seizures. It is important to understand that although lifestyle changes and safety precautions are needed, one should avoid becoming too controlling and rigid. People with epilepsy also need to live a good-quality life that offers independence.

**During the Seizure**

- First, ensure adequate ventilation and place patients on the floor on their left side

- Loosen clothing around the neck and ensure the airway is patent. If the patient is clenching the teeth, do not force the mouth open with any object as this can cause severe damage

- Remove all items from the surrounding that can be hazardous. The patient may be oblivious to what's happening and may not even know what he or she is doing.

- If the patient is confused and wandering, either gently guide him/her away and block access to outside areas

- Reassure the individual and be comforting

- Call 911. In most cases, the seizure ends before EMS arrives. However, there are cases when seizures may last over 3 to 5 minutes. Or the individual may have developed breathing difficulties or severe injuries. If a pregnant patient or a person with diabetes develops a seizure, it is prudent to call an ambulance.

- Finally, if the patient does not regain full consciousness, then call EMS. Most patients will remain confused for about 45 to 90 minutes after a seizure, so you must use judgment in calling for help.

- Avoid restraints but make sure the patient is in a bed with padded side rails

- Place the individual in a lateral position with the neck slightly flexed; this will help the saliva drain from the mouth and prevent the tongue from falling backward

- Remove all nearby furniture and other hazards from the area

- Provide verbal assurance as the individual is regaining consciousness

- Provide the patient with privacy if possible

- Call for help and start treatment as ordered by the caregiver

When a seizure occurs, it is important to note:

- Date, time, and duration of the seizures

- Level of activity at the time of the seizure

- Level of mental status (confused, excited, dazzled, unresponsive or conscious)

- Presence of aura

- What type of body movements, which part?

- How did the seizure progress? Symmetrical, unilateral or bilateral?

- What type of motor activity? Myoclonic, clonic, tonic, posturing, dystonic

- Eye movements, deviation, open/closed, flickering of eyelids, nystagmus

- Twitching

- Head-turning

- Respiratory, rate rhythm

- Heart rate and rhythm

- Skin temperature: cold, warm, cyanosis

- Diaphoresis

- Gastrointestinal (GI) vomiting, nausea, diarrhea

- Eyes pupillary size, symmetry, reaction to light

- Sensation, hallucinations

- Any other unusual behavior

**After the Seizure (Postictal Stage)**

After a seizure, most patients experience confusion, fatigue, muscle pain and/or a headache. Thus, one should permit the individual to sleep. For the next few days, reassurance is essential. Being calm and helping reorient the person is also of importance.

Most seizures are painless and end spontaneously. Seizures are not harmful to others but can lead to complications such as stress on the lungs, brain and the heart. Individuals with prior lung problems may develop labored breathing and respiratory distress. Thus, one may need to administer oxygen.

Once the seizure has stopped, record the following:

- Vital signs

- Presence of gag reflex

- Presence of a headache, character, location duration and severity

- Bowel or bladder incontinence

- Any visible injury to the skin, joints or face

- Any residual neurological deficits

- Change in behavior

- Mental status, confused, anxious

- Disturbance in speech

- Coordination of movements

- Weakness

- Level of consciousness

Conduct a Postictal Exam

- Ask what the individual was doing before the seizure

- Was this the first seizure

- Ask for the presence of any other illness

- Determine any trigger factors

- Ask if the patient had an excess consumption of coffee, alcohol

- Excessive hydration

- Fever

- Any recent head trauma

- Concurrent infection

- Overexertion

- Sleep deprivation

- Mood alterations (anger, anxiety, depression, stress)

Check Blood Work for the Following Triggers

- Hypoglycemia

- Hyponatremia

- Hypocalcemia

- Hypomagnesemia

- Dehydration

**Medication-Related Triggers**

- A recent change in dose, the frequency of anti-seizure medication

- Alcohol or sedative withdrawal

- Use of CNS stimulants including caffeine

- Use of antidopaminergic agents

- Use of atypical antipsychotics like clozapine

- Use of antidepressants like bupropion

- Use of cyclosporine

- Use of quinolone or imipenem/cilastatin

- Exposure to any toxins

**Environmental and Hormonal Triggers**

- Exposure to loud music

- Flashing lights

- Pregnancy (more likely to be protective)

- Menstruation

- Olfactory stimuli: Specific odors

- Ovulation

**Changes in Activity, Lifestyle, and Restrictions**

One of the major problems with recommending seizure precautions is the unpredictability of the seizure recurrence. The onus is on the healthcare provider to discuss the following seizure precautions in patients diagnosed with seizures:

- Working at heights

- Climbing tall structures

- Driving

- Cooking using the oven or a fire

- Using heavy machinery and other power tools

- Taking a bath unsupervised

- Swimming unattended

Providers must discuss and document these seizure precautions to prevent any issues including future litigation by the family members. The problem with seizure precautions is that not all seizure patients are alike. Some may only have nocturnal epilepsy, and thus one needs to use judgment in recommending safety maneuvers. For example, patients who practice certain sports like biking and skiing among others should wear a helmet to prevent head traumas.
