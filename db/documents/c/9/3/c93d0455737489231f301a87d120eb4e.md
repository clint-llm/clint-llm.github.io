There are approximately 3.9 million deliveries in the United States every year. Fortunately, most of these deliveries are appropriately anticipated and occur in the hospital with trained staff. Because deliveries occur so infrequently in the prehospital setting, initial effort should be directed toward getting the mother quickly to a hospital with obstetric and gynecological care. This activity describes prehospital deliveries, their indications, contraindications, and potential complications.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indication for prehospital delivery.
- Describe the contraindications to prehospital delivery.
- Summarize the complications of prehospital delivery.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance prehospital delivery and improve outcomes.
