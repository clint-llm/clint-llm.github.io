After surgical excision, there is a recurrence rate of 2%, but only if excision includes the stalk of the cyst. If the cyst is removed without the stalk, the recurrence rate can be as high as 25 to 50%.  The recurrence rate has been as high as 68-100% after corticosteroid injection into the cyst. If aspiration is attempted, there is a 50% chance of recurrence. Arthrodesis can also be performed if the patient is experiencing pain from underlying degenerate joint disease of the DIP joint of the involved finger.
