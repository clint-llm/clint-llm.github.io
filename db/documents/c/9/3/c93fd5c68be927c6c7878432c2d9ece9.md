The internal urethral sphincter is located inferiorly, in the neck of the bladder. In males, the inferior vesical artery supplies blood to the neck and fundus of the bladder. However, in females, the vaginal artery replaces the inferior vesical artery to supply the neck and fundus of the bladder. In females, the blood supply to the external urethral sphincter is the internal pudendal artery from the internal iliac artery. In males, the external urethral sphincter is in the same area as the membranous urethra which is supplied by the bulbourethral artery. The vessels of the internal pudendal which supply the area of the external urethral sphincter and the internal urethral sphincter drain into the internal iliac lymph nodes.
