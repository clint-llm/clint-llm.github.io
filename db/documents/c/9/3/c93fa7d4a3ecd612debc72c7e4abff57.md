Biotinidase deficiency is a rare disorder with an incidence ranging from 1 per 40,000 to 1 per 60,000 births worldwide. In 2006, the incidence of profound cases was 1:80,000, and the incidence of partial cases was from 1 per 31,000 to 1 per 40,000 in the US. The estimated carrier frequency is 1 in 123 individuals. The rates vary from country to country.

In populations with more consanguinity, the incidence of biotinidase deficiency tends to be higher. This is observed in countries such as Turkey and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Cowan et al. observed a higher incidence in Hispanic babies born in the western United States.

Profound biotinidase deficiency typically manifests in the first six months of life, although there can be variation in the age of onset.
