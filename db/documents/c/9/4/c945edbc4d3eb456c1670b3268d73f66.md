**Cricopharyngeal achalasia**

Cricopharyngeal achalasia is when the cricopharyngeal muscle fails to open adequately enough to allow the passage of bolus into the esophagus. The patient can present with symptoms of choking, regurgitation, coughing, and recurrent pneumonia. A patient diagnosed with cricopharyngeal achalasia can have it treated with cricopharyngeal myotomy or with botulinum toxin injection.

**Glossopharyngeal neuralgia**

Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a disorder presenting with the repeated episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to minutes in the tongue, throat, ear, and tonsils and is usually unilateral. The pain can worsen or triggered by swallowing, speaking, and chewing. The etiology is thought to be due to irritation of the glossopharyngeal nerve, but the source of irritation is often not found. Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is often misdiagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia since the presentation of pain can overlap and looks similar.
