The leg is the region of the lower limb between the knee and the foot. It comprises two bones: the tibia and the fibula. The role of these two bones is to provide stability and support to the rest of the body, and through articulations with the femur and foot/ankle and the muscles attached to these bones, provide mobility and the ability to ambulate in an upright position. The tibia articulates with the femur at the knee joint.  The knee joint consists of three compartments.

- Medial tibiofemoral compartment

- Lateral tibiofemoral compartment

- Patellofemoral compartment

At the ankle, the tibia and fibula create the articular surface for the talus.  The ankle mortise is a specialized articulation providing support and optimizing motion and function through the ankle joint.  A normal ankle joint ultimately optimizes and allows for physiologic mobility of the foot and its associated joints and articulations. The bones and fascia also divide the lower leg into four compartments

- Anterior compartment

- Lateral compartment

- Posterior compartment, superficial

- Posterior compartment, deep
