The biliary tract provides an outlet to transport bile into the gastrointestinal tract, which facilitates the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. In general, acute obstruction of the biliary tract can lead to steatorrhea, while chronic obstruction can cause fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). Proximal to the site of obstruction also harbors an opportunity for bacterial infection, as in the case of ascending cholangitis.

Congenital anomalies associated with the biliary tract include biliary atresia, choledochal cysts, and congenital biliary ectasia. Â Biliary atresia is the most common cause of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in young infants.

Cholelithiasis, commonly known as gallstones, is a common disease in western populations.
