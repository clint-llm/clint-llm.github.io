The gastroepiploic artery is innervated by the periarterial sympathetic nerve, which allows the artery to contract, stimulating the endothelial and smooth muscle. The contraction of the artery can be slow (if stimulated by alpha2-adrenoceptors) or faster (if stimulated by alpha1-adrenoceptors). The production of nitric oxide (NO) influences the presence of arterial tone modulation.

COnversely, C-type natriuretic peptide influences vasodilation. C-type natriuretic peptide relaxes the arterial tone through the activation of some channels, including large-conductance calcium-activated K+ channel and G-protein-gated inwardly-rectifying potassium channel.
