Infantile acne characterized by a relatively rapid onset, determined to be subjectively severe in nature, or accompanied by any physical findings suggestive of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, abnormal presence of pubic hair, testicular enlargement or clitoromegaly) could indicate the presence of an underlying androgen-secreting (or corticosteroid-secreting) disorder. As such, further evaluation is reasonable and often warranted, along with a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. Additional investigations may include, but are not limited to, assessment of bone age and measurement of serologic levels of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and free testosterone.
