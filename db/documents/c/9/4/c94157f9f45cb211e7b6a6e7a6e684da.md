Os peroneum is one of several accessory ossicles of the foot and ankle, located lateral to the cuboid within the distal peroneus longus tendon. Painful os peroneum syndrome is a general term referring to conditions presenting as lateral midfoot pain associated with the os peroneum, such as acute fracture, stress fracture associated with chronic repetitive trauma, contusion, avascular necrosis, or tendinosis, tenosynovitis, tendon tears, and subluxation involving the peroneal tendons. Abnormalities in the morphology and location of the os peroneum can easily be identified on radiographs, specifically the oblique view, thereby elevating clinical suspicion for a peroneus longus tendon injury. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of os peroneum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the cause of os peroneum.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with os peroneum.
- Summarize the treatment options for os peroneum.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by os peroneum.
