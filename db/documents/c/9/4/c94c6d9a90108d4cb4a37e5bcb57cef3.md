Coarctation of the aorta causes an increase in the upper extremity blood pressure, resulting in two common presentations. The first is the neonatal presentation that is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and shock from the neonatal myocardium's intolerance of the sudden increase in afterload that occurs with closure of the ductus arteriosus. This presentation often occurs within the first one to two weeks after birth. In patients with neonatal coarctation evolving while the patent ductus arteriosus is closing, the lower extremity saturation can be low as perfusion to the lower body can be maintained by ductal patency. In the era of lower extremity pulse oximetry screening in newborns, a neonate could often pass with an acceptable saturation as it is less common for the ductus to contribute significantlyÂ unless other left heart structures are hypoplastic. The second presentation occurs in older children and adults. Coarctation of the aorta in this scenario results in upper extremity hypertension, leading to early coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysm, and cerebrovascular disease.
