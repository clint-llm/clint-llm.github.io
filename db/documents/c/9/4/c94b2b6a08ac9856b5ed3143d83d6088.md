Lumbar puncture is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the emergency department. It is used in the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening diseases such as meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. A thorough understanding of anatomy, potential complications, and various techniques helps to ensure a successful and safe lumbar puncture. Maintaining open communication with the patient throughout the procedure may decrease patient anxiety and assist in first attempt success.
