Corneal abrasion, aggravation of globe rupture, the transmission of infection, and reaction to ocular drugs are potential complications of tonometry. The risk of these complications is considerably low (less than 1%). Non-contact methods and rebound tonometry can be considered in special cases, even if GAT remains the gold standard approach to tonometry.
