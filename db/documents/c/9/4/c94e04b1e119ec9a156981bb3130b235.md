1. Benign adrenal adenoma: These are the commonest adrenal incidentalomas. They are well-circumscribed, homogenous masses that have an attenuation value of less than 10 HU in most cases. This low attenuation is due to the fatty tissue present in the adenoma. Occasionally, lipid-poor adenomas are observed, which have an attenuation value of greater than 10 HU.

2. Adrenal carcinoma: These are big lobulated tumors with a heterogeneous appearance due to hemorrhage and necrosis. They have irregular margins and invade the surrounding structures, inferior vena cava, kidney, and liver. They have an attenuation value of greater than 10 HU and show increased uptake on the PET scan.

3. Retroperitoneal liposarcoma: This is a slow-growing tumor of the retroperitoneal region which is composed of adipocytes and radiologically appears similar to an adrenal myelolipoma.

4. Renal angiomyolipoma: Angiomyolipomas are tumors comprised of fat, blood vessels, and muscle cells. These are large, heterogeneous appearing tumors that can invade through the renal capsule. The radiological appearance is similar to that of an adrenal myelolipoma with negative attenuation values; however, this is seen to arise from the kidney.
