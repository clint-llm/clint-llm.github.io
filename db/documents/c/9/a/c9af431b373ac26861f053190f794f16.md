An intact mineralocorticoid production with primary adrenal insufficiency is the unique feature of Allgrove syndrome, but 15% of cases reported impaired mineralocorticoid production.

Allgrove syndrome is also known as 4A syndrome if there are neurological findings such as autonomic dysfunctions or mental retardation, in addition to achalasia, adrenal insufficiency, and alacrima.
