Initial pathological changes include a reduction in the cortical gray matter and brain atrophy. Autopsy examination of affected patients' brain tissue may show perivascular macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, multinucleated giant cells, myelin loss, and white matter astrogliosis. The basal ganglia are most commonly affected.
