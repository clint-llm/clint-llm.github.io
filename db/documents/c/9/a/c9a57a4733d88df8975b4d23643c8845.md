Vesicovaginal fistula is a distressing condition in which abnormal communication develops between the bladder and vagina, leading to urinary incontinence. This condition occurs most commonly after obstetrical and gynecological injury. In the developed world, the most common cause of vesicovaginal fistula is gynecological surgery. The majority of vesicovaginal fistula require definitive surgical management; however, some can be successfully managed conservatively. Despite an optimistic prognosis for patients receiving proper treatment, efforts should be focused on the prevention of vesicovaginal formation. This includes prioritizing women’s reproductive health, emergency obstetric services, and properly trained pelvic surgeons in the global medical community. An effort should also be made to educate the general public on the prevalence and prevention of this devastating problem.
