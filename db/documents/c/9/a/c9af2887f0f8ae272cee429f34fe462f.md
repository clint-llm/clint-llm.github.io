Normal levels of ammonia vary according to age, being higher in newborns compared to older children or adults. In newborns, gestational and postnatal ages also affect the levels of ammonia.

**Healthy term infants:**45±9 micromol/L; 80 to 90 micromol/L is considered to be the upper limit of normal.

**Preterm infants:**71±26 micromol/L, decreasing to term levels in approximately seven days

**Children older than 1 month:**less than 50 micromol/L

**Adults:**less than 30 micromol/L

In the neonatal period, hyperammonemia presents with non-specific signs and symptoms, and thus important tests to rule out sepsis, meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, and GI bleed should be considered. Raised levels of ammonia should prompt specific investigations including arterial blood gases, blood glucose, lactate and citrulline levels, plasma and urinary amino acids, urinary ketones, etc. Some additional tests that can be done for diagnosing urea cycle defects include specific enzyme assays on liver biopsy specimens or red blood cells and DNA mutation.

In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, liver function tests, including levels of liver enzymes and bilirubin and prothrombin time, are helpful to gauge the synthetic function of the liver. Specific tests to diagnose the underlying etiology of non-cirrhotic hyperammonemia should be considered if reasonable clinical suspicion is present.

Neuroimaging with CT scan or MRI can be helpful for diagnosis, although it will only show the effects ammonia has on the brain. In hyperammonemic encephalopathy, MRI shows diffusion restriction in the insular cortex and cingulate gyrus.
