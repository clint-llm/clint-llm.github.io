When considering venepuncture, one of the most commonly used sites is the median cubital vein. It lies very superficially within the roof of the cubital fossa, making it an easily accessible vein.

When assessing manual blood pressure, a stethoscope is placed over the cubital fossa to auscultate the brachial artery for Korotkoff sounds.

An important pathology to note is cubital tunnel syndrome. While not directly involving the cubital fossa itself, it is an ulnar neuropathy that occurs at the level of the cubital fossa. The ulnar nerve runs posteriorly to the medial epicondyle of the humerus, within a structure named the cubital tunnel. The ulnar nerve can become compressed within this tunnel, either acutely or chronically. The syndrome typically presents with sensory paraesthesia in the ulnar distribution of the hand (the medial aspect of the hand and medial one and a half digits) and can present with motor symptoms, such as clumsiness with intrinsic hand movements. Treatment of the condition can be conservative, including education and elbow splinting or surgical decompression.
