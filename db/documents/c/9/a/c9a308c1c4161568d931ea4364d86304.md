There is no standard testing performed to identify the bites from bedbugs. While one may suspect bedbug bites from an infestation based on the typical presenting signs and history, one cannot confirm the source of the bite without the capture and identification of a bedbug. There have been studies in recent years searching for a method to identify potential bedbug bites from clinical testing, such as Western blot testing, where it is unfeasible or impossible to capture a specimen. For example, an international traveler who was bitten while staying in a hotel; however, the tests are expensive and limited to specific laboratories.
