Single-lung ventilation is used to maintain adequate oxygenation, lung isolation, and lung protection. The challenges faced by an anesthesiologist in performing single-lung ventilation arise from a combination of lateral decubitus positioning, open pneumothorax, and the anesthetic technique.

The lateral decubitus position brings about physiological changes in ventilation-perfusion matching. This is subsequently altered under anesthesia by the effects of neuromuscular blockade, open thorax, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, surgical retraction, and differential blood flow to the dependent and the nondependent lungs.

All interprofessional team members, including clinicians and nurses, must be very familiar with the parameters, procedures, and monitoring of patients receiving single-lung ventilation; this will yield optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
