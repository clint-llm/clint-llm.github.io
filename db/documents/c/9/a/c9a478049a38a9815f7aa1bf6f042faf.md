Adrenergic receptors, otherwise known as adreno-receptors, are classified as either alpha or beta receptors. Those two classes are further subdivided into alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3. Alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors both have three subtypes. These receptors are all G-protein-coupled receptors.

Alpha-1 receptors are Gq-coupled receptors, whereas alpha-2 receptors are Gi-coupled receptors. Beta-2 and beta-3 are also Gi-coupled receptors. All beta receptors are also Gs-coupled receptors.

Agonist binding to the adrenergic receptors induces the following cellular mechanisms:

**Alpha-1 Receptor**

Phospholipase C is activated, which leads to the formation of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). As a result, intracellular calcium rises.

**Alpha-2 Receptor**

Adenylate cyclase is inactivated, which leads to a decrease in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).

**Beta-1 Receptor**

Adenylate cyclase is activated, and intracellular cAMP increases.

**Beta-2 Receptor**

The adenylate cycle becomes activated through the Gs-protein-coupled receptors, and there is an increase in intracellular cAMP. Gi protein-coupled receptors are also activated, and this will decrease intracellular cAMP.

Investigators screened several cardiovascular drugs (e.g., methyldopa, amiodarone, doxazosin) and found that these affected in vitro Schistosoma mansoni viability.
