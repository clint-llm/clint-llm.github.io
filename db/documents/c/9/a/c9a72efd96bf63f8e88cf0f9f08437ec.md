The term mushroom refers to the fungal fruiting body. Anatomically, the prototypical mushroom comprises the stem and a cap with gills on the underside. However, the term may refer to many stemless gilled fungi with varying forms such as the "morel," "puffball," or "stinkhorn." The gills of the mushroom produces spores which aid in the propagation of the fungus itself. Mushroom toxicity has also been known for millennia and is implicated in the death of several historical figures, including the Roman Emperor Claudius. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of mushroom toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mushroom toxicity.
- Review the presentation of a patient with mushroom toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options for mushroom toxicity.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by mushroom toxicity.
