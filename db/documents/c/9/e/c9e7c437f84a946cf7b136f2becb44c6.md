Multiple myeloma constitutes 1.8% of all new cancer cases and 2.1% of all cancer deaths yearly in the United States, with an incidence of 4.5 to 6 per 100,000 annually. The median age of diagnosis is 70 years.

Conversely, mortality has decreased by 14% in the US but increased by 94% globally. With the advent of new advanced therapies, the 5-year survival rate in the US has more than doubled in the past few decades.

According to an analysis carried out at an institution in 2016, the outcomes for 511 multiple myeloma patients treated with novel therapies between 2006 and 2014 showed a total of 82 patients (16%) developed early relapse within 8 months of initiation of the treatment vs 429 patients ( 84%) who either relapsed after a year or had a continued response to therapy for the duration of the study. The median overall survival rate was worse in these patients than in those with late relapse. Median overall survival in patients who received autologous stem cell transplantation and relapsed within 12 months was 23.1 months, compared to 122.2 months in the remaining patients indicating early relapse as a poor prognostic factor.

With each subsequent line of therapy and the successive relapse, the response rate decreases along with a shorter time interval to progression. The proportion of patients achieving complete response decreased from 32% at the first-line to 2% at the fifth-line treatment.
