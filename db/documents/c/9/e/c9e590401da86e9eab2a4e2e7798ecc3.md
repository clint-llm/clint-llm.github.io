Holter monitoring continuously records an Electrocardiogram (EKG) tracing on three channels for 12–48 hours. The patient activates a button to correlate the timing of symptoms with the EKG. Cardiac technician and skilled physician examine entire recorded EKG for abnormalities

In children, Holter monitor use is limited because of wires and cables. In 2011, the Federal Drug Administration approved a device which is wireless, water-resistant and allows for up to 14 days of continuous single-channel rhythm monitoring. The patients can trigger symptoms by pressing a button to start the recording and correlate symptoms with concurrent rhythm. A study which compared new wireless device with standard Holter monitor found that new wireless adhesive monitoring patch diagnosed more arrhythmic events than the Holter monitor.
