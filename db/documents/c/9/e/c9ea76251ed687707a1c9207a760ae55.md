Once a cerebral aneurysm has ruptured or started to leak, blood may be found in the CSF in varying quantities. Over time this blood is degraded by macrophages and broken down into its byproducts containing bilirubin.Â The process of conversion from heme to bilirubin in the CSF takes 6 to 12 hours and can only happen in vivo. Therefore, xanthochromia is best identified 6 to 12 hours after the onset of a bleed. Even though CT scan in the investigative modality of choice for subarachnoid hemorrhage, nearly 5% of cases will have no CT evidence of hemorrhage during the first 24 hours. This percentage increases to 50% by the first week and is about 30% at 2 weeks. On the other hand, xanthochromic is seen in all patients for up to 14 days and can be present in 75% of patients for at least 21 days.
