The most commonly used DLT is the left-sided DLT, irrespective of which side requires the isolation because placing a left-sided DLT is less challenging than the right-sided one. This comparative ease is partly due to the short take-off of the right upper bronchus, which leads to higher chances of dislodgement and impaired ventilation of the right upper bronchus.

**DLT-placement technique:**After inducing the patient with general anesthesia and confirming complete neuromuscular blockade, the following steps are taken to place a left-sided DLT:

- A direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh blade is used for laryngoscopy as the DLT is a large tube, and this technique provides the maximum space for its insertion.

- The DLT is introduced with a rigid stylet with the endobronchial curvature facing anteriorly.

- The rigid stylet ensures passage through the vocal cords. After the DLT passes through the vocal cords, the stylet is removed.

- The tube is then rotated by a 90-degree angle anticlockwise to the left until the blue bronchial lumen faces left and the tracheal lumen faces right.

- The next step involves either advancing the tube further until resistance is met or using a fibreoptic bronchoscope to guide further placement. The tracheal cuff may be inflated at this moment, and the connector is attached to start ventilation.

- The shape of the left-sided DLT facilitates the bronchial cuff to be positioned in the left bronchus when advanced; the DLT position should be confirmed with a fibreoptic bronchoscope to ensure the tracheal lumen opening is above the carina and bronchial lumen is in the left bronchus. The bronchial cuff can now be inflated with 1 to 2 mL of air.

- Bilateral ventilation confirmation is by auscultation. Air entry should be audible in bilateral lungs at this point.

- Next, lung isolation is confirmed with selective tracheal and bronchial lumens clamping.

- Only the left lung should be inflated when ventilation through the bronchial lumen completes.

- Only the right lung should inflate when clamping the bronchial lumen and ventilating through the tracheal lumen.

The inability to perform a direct laryngoscopy is a contraindication to using a DLT. In such a situation, a bronchial blocker may be a suitable alternative.
