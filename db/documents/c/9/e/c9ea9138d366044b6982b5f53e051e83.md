The actual treatment of hypertrophic scarring is done by a plastic surgeon and/or a dermatologist. Once the hypertrophic scar or keloid scar has formed there are a variety of treatment modalities that may be used. Corticosteroid injection is a mainstay of therapy for hypertrophic scars, as is silicone sheeting, or various other topical preparations. Surgical excision may be used to treat hypertrophic scars or keloid scars, though this carries the risk of recurrence of the hypertrophic scar or keloid (much more common in the latter). Cryotherapy and laser therapy, including long-pulsed Nd:YAG laser or pulsed dye laser, have proven benefit in treating hypertrophic scars. These lasers target blood vessels and therefore are very helpful in reducing the color changes seen in hypertrophic scars.  Despite the plethora of treatments, the results of most treatments are suboptimal; this is a challenging condition to treat.
