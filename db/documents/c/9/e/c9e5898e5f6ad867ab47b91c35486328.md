The pelvic skeleton forms via mesenchymal condensation and endochondral ossification. The first ossification center develops in the ilium in the early-fetal period. Multiple sites ossify and continue to develop after birth until adolescence.

The fetal pelvis, including subpubic angle, width, and depth of the sciatic notch, varies with biological sex. However, the growth of the ischium and pubis and the ischiopubic indices do not change with age. Sex differences in pelvic morphology may be recognized in fetuses at nine weeks from fertilization (or 11 weeks from the last menstrual period) after the sex chromosomes were activated.

The connections and articulations of the cartilage in the pelvis are essential for pelvic ring formation in a limited period: between 54 to 60 days after fertilization, at around eight weeks embryonic period, or ten weeks gestation. The normal period is necessary to initiate effective fetal movements that may induce mechanical forces and affect normal skeletal development. Fetal movement may also explain some variations in pelvic shape observed later. Observations done later during the fetal period have shown that the most frequent shape of the pelvic inlet is similar between sexes: android type in 56% of male fetuses and 54% of female fetuses. It seems to indicate the importance of environmental factors in defining pelvic shape.
