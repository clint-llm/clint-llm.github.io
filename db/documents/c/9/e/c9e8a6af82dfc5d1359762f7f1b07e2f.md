Syncope is a common presenting complaint. It refers to a transient or passing loss of consciousness resulting from a reduction in cerebral blood flow and is usually associated with a loss in postural tone but with spontaneous recovery

Classic orthostatic hypotension occurs when there is a persistent reduction in blood pressure of at least 20mmHg systolic or 10mmHg diastolic within 3 minutes of standing or being upright to 60 degrees on the head-up tilt table.
