Non-surgical intervention includes modification of the activity that may have exacerbated the pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), physical therapy, stretching, and occasionally using a lumbosacral orthosis. A 2009 meta-analysis evaluating spondylolysis and grade 1 spondylolisthesis showed almost 84% of adolescent patients treated nonoperatively had a successful clinical outcome at one year.

While most patients improve with nonoperative treatment alone, those failing a conservative treatment course have three options- continued pain, complete avoidance of activities that elicit pain, or surgical intervention. Again, the surgical options for spondylolysis (as well as low-grade spondylolisthesis) should be reserved for those with either neurologic deficits, the progression of a slip, or pain limiting daily functions.
