Healthcare outcomes can be optimized through the use of IPSS or AUA scoring systems. These can help stratify patients according to disease severity and guide physician decision making. Adherence to lifestyle factors affecting BPH may also be addressed through diet advice, weight loss, and glycaemic control. The role of primary care/endocrine/diabetic nurse specialists can help address these areas, and early referral to these areas can help ensure medical conditions are optimized. Optimizing these factors prior to surgery can also be beneficial in reducing the risk of co-morbidity and the risk of post-operative complications.

Catheter-care is an important process for those performing intermittent self-catheterization due to symptoms or with long-term catheters. This can be addressed by specialist nurses who can help educate the patient in order to ensure adequate training, support, and follow-up in the community. In the UK, the department of health advocates accesses to integrated continence services for those with long-term bladder problems.

Pharmacists are of particular importance due to the increasing incidence of BPH with age and increasing polypharmacy associated (multiple medications) with these patients. It is therefore important that any drug interactions are identified, further to this, the use of concomitant anticoagulants should be recognized to ensure that they may be held before surgery or other treatments offered to the patient depending on co-morbidity.

Overall close interplay is needed between primary care clinicians/urologists/nephrologists/nurses and pharmacists to ensure patients are managed and referred appropriately. The use of specialist urology/bladder care specialists can help improve patient compliance with both lifestyle modification, medications, and interventions such as catheters. This ensures the patient can be managed in a multi-disciplinary manner and achieve the best outcomes.Â [Level 5]
