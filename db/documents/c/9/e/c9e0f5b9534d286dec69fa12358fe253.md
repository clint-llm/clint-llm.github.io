LNs are not seen in normal individuals and are present in almost 90% to 100% of adult patients with NF1 over the age of 20 years. These nodules are more likely to occur in younger patients than are neurofibromas and are therefore helpful in clinching the diagnosis in younger patients. Multiple, bilateral LNs are specific for NF1. There is no association between LN and the overall clinical severity of NF1 in these patients.
