**Osteosarcoma**

Osteosarcoma is of mesenchymal origin and exhibits proliferation of osteoblastic precursors, which produce osteoid and immature bone. Neoplastic cells will show anaplasia, filling of marrows space, and erosion of trabecular bone. They can be histologically classified depending on the extracellular matrix cells produced: osteoblastic, chondroblastic, and fibroblastic. The osteoblastic subtype is most commonly observed in the jaws.

**Fibrous Dysplasia**

It must be noted that fibrous dysplasia is indistinct from ossifying fibroma histologically and, therefore, may only be commented on as a ‘fibro-osseous lesion.’

**Central Giant Cell Granuloma**

Histology shows these lesions to be localized, lobulated, and have osteolytic proliferations. Vascular connective tissue is observed, with a patchy distribution of multinucleated giant cells in the surrounding stoma. Extravasated erythrocytes and hemosiderin deposits are frequently seen, highlighting multifocal hemorrhage.

**Osteoma**

Histology can divide osteomas into compact or cancellous. Compact osteomas, also known as ‘ivory’ osteomas, will exhibit a mature, dense lamellar with minimal fibrous marrow tissue. Cancellous osteomas, however, will exhibit trabecular bone with intervening fibrous fatty marrow and a peripheral cortex.

**Osteochondroma**

Histology shows a bony lesion with a hyaline and fibrous cartilaginous coverage, commonly described as a cap. At the cartilage-to-bone interface, endochondral ossification is commonly observed.

**Osteoblastoma**

The histology of osteoblastoma causes a significant degree of debate, specifically in distinguishing it from low-grade osteosarcoma.
