Some reports suggest that the neuropathology of essential tremorÂ is localized in the brainstem (locus coeruleus) and cerebellum, but the presence of cerebellar pathology is controversial. However, it is believed that essential tremor is a risk factor for the development of Parkinson disease. In addition, there has also been an association between essential tremors and dystonic movements.
