High-frequency ultrasound has improved over the past decade with standard linear frequency probes ranging from 7.5 MHz to 23 MHz, with high density or single crystal probe components, which improves lateral resolution. Tissue harmonic imaging (THI) is also a standard feature of most entry-level ultrasound units for a reduction in reverberation and near field artifacts. Real-time compound scanning aids in improved contrast resolution.

Panoramic imaging provides an increased longitudinal imaging perspective of breast lesions in relation to the surrounding breast tissue.

The latest technology from ultrasound vendors now also boasts stand-alone linear frequency probes connecting wirelessly to mobile imaging application software.

Most ultrasound software allows computer-aided detection (CAD) to assist in the segmentation and identification of suspicious mass lesions. This technology allows for increased improvement in diagnostic proficiency.

Proper technical consideration is required to produce quality ultrasound images such as the depth of the focal zone, time gain compensation measures, and overall gain used during mass lesion assessment.
