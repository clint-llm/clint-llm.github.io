The pterygopalatine ganglion is theorized to be a component for a group of headache disorders classified as trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (TACs) which present as unilateral headaches with ipsilateral autonomic features (lacrimation, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, eyelid edema, and ptosis).

A systematic review conducted by Ho et al. found that there is substantial evidence to support the targeting of the pterygopalatine ganglion via pterygopalatine ganglion blockade, radiofrequency ablation, or neurostimulation for the treatment of cluster headaches.et al. detail other studies that have investigated therapeutic interventions aimed at the pterygopalatine ganglion to treat other conditions, such as postherpetic neuralgia and post-dural puncture headache, but these studies lack sufficient evidence or dismissed previous claims for the usage of such interventions.et al. argue that larger, double-blinded, randomized-controlled studies pertaining to therapeutic interventions targeting the pterygopalatine ganglion need to be conducted to establish the validity of these interventions in the treatment of cluster headaches, migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, and other pathologies of the head region.
