Patients should be warned about the possibility of post-tubal ligation syndrome. There is some controversy whether post tubal ligation syndrome is a real entity. For many decades patients undergoing tubal ligation have presented with menorrhagia, pelvic discomfort, and ovarian cystic changes. It is not known whether these symptoms are due to damage to the blood supply or a result of oral contraceptives that the women were taking prior to the procedure. Fortunately, the number of cases are few, and the pattern of symptoms is not always consistent.
