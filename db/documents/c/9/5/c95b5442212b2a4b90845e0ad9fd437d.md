Motor development begins early in embryonic development and continues throughout childhood into adulthood. All spinal motor neurons develop in the ventral region of the ventral-dorsal axis during the 4th week of development via spinal progenitor motor neurons. Various transcriptionÂ factors must be present for both initial development and the further specification of all motor neurons.
