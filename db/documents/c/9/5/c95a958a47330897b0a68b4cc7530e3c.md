Through therapeutic communication, the healthcare team can provide holistic monitoring of the patient’s adherence, treatment response, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction, and identification of barriers to treatment. The biopsychosocial model of care provides a guide to approaching patients, and therapeutic communication techniques integrate well in identifying biopsychosocial contributors to health and illness in the patient.

Interprofessional approaches to monitoring for and identifying these contributors to health and illness can also provide a powerful tool for approaching patient care. Monitoring the patient’s emotional states from an interprofessional standpoint can also prove beneficial. In particular, monitoring these emotional states can allow for early identification of reactions a patient may be having towards a treatment or provider. In this way, one provider may provide liaison between these potential disruptions to care, address them early and directly with the patient, and simultaneously alert other team members to help patients work through these issues. Fostering therapeutic communication amongst interdisciplinary teams contributes to improving patient experience and enhancing health care outcomes.
