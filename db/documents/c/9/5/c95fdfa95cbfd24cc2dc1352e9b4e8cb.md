Asthma can severely limit the ability to engage in normal daily activities, including sports and outdoor activities. While asthma is a treatable disease, some of those treatments have side effects. For example, inhalers may cause hoarse voice, and inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk for fungal infections. Oral steroids increase the chance of developing Cushing syndrome, including weight gain and metabolic dysfunction. However, poorly controlled asthma can lead to airway remodeling and chronic obstruction, increase the risk of obstructive sleep apnea, pneumonia, or gastroesophageal reflux.
