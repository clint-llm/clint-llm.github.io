Several nerves are relevant and proximal to the scalp veins, with varying relationships anatomically to these structures.

- The supratrochlear nerve is located medially to the supratrochlear vein, whereas the medial branch of the supraorbital nerve is just deep in the supratrochlear vein.

- The lateral branch of the supraorbital nerve is just medial and deep to the supraorbital vein.

- The temporal branches of the facial nerve are located between the zygomatic orbital vein (a non-scalp vein) inferiorly and the frontal branch of the superficial temporal vein superiorly and posteriorly.

- The auriculotemporal nerve runs just anterior and deep to the superficial temporal artery and vein.

- The posterior auricular artery and vein are sandwiched between the posterior auricular nerve anteriorly and the great auricular nerve just deep and posteroinferiorly.

- Sandwiching the occipital artery and vein are the lesser and greater occipital nerve branches, superficially and anteriorly, and posteriorly, respectively.
