In most cases, a predisposing arterial disease association or cause is identified. However, up to 20% cases are labeled as idiopathic.

- Predisposing factors include fibromuscular dysplasia, pregnancy, early post-partum state, multiparity, mechanical stressors (e.g., vomiting, coughing, heavy lifting and Valsalva type maneuvers), emotional stressors, connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan, Ehler-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz) and systemic inflammatory conditions.

- All the above factors in some way increase the coronary artery wall stress, resulting in weakening of the arterial wall and predisposing to spontaneous dissections.
