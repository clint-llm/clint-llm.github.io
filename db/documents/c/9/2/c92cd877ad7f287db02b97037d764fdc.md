**Hallux****valgus**(HV), also known as a bunion, is one of the most common forefoot deformities. HV manifests with the proximal phalanx deviating laterally and the first metatarsal head deviating medially and due to the adduction of the first metatarsus, called metatarsus primus varus. However, the precise etiology is not fully understood. HV tends to occur more commonly in women than in men, with a ratio as high as 15:1 in one study, and occurs more in those who wear tight shoes or heels.

Hallux valgus deformity is typically diagnosable through a physical exam, and imaging is important as it can evaluate whether there is damage to the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Treatment centers upon first trialing non-surgical approaches such as wider shoes, use of orthotics, and night splinting. If conservative treatment proves ineffective, surgical management is the next recommended course of action. Patients tolerate the surgery well, with bony union usually occurring around 6 to 7 weeks postoperatively.
