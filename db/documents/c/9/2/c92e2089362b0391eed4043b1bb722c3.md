Plica syndrome manifests as anterior knee pain and is diagnosed by history and physical exam. Imaging techniques are most helpful to rule out other conditions on the differential diagnosis although MRI is potentially useful in pre-operative planning as well. Initial treatment should be conservative management unless cartilage damage is suspected, in which case performing arthroscopy before completingÂ conservative management is reasonable. The prognosis for plica syndrome is favorable when treated promptly before the potential complication of cartilage damage becomes too advanced. One pitfall with plica syndrome may occur if practitioners obtain radiographs and attribute pain to osteoarthritis, when there may also be symptomatic plicae present.
