Patients with spinal dysraphism, such as myelomeningocele, require interdisciplinary evaluation and treatments to provide patient-centered care and prevent complications related to the disease process. Interdisciplinary evaluation, including pediatric specialists in rehabilitation, neurosurgery, urology, and orthopedic surgery, is indicated. Interprofessional approaches have shown to have a significant impact on the outcome of these patients. Prevention is the most important and key element; therefore, state and country health departments, obstetricians, social workers, and prenatal nurses play an enormous role in the management of these conditions.
