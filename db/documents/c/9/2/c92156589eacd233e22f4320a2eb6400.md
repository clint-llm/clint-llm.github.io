The most common indication for a point-of-care ultrasound of the urinary tract in the emergency department is flank pain, which is responsible for approximately 2 million emergency department visits in the United States annually. About 20 percent of patients presenting with flank pain have nephrolithiasis, or kidney stones. While computed tomography (CT) imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing urinary tract stones, point-of-care ultrasound is increasingly being recognized as a primary initial imaging modality. This activity describe the indications for the use of ultrasound to evaluate for pathology of the urinary tract and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in management of patients with urinary tract pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for using ultrasound to evaluate the urinary tract.
- Explain the technique for performing an ultrasound of the urinary tract.
- Review the clinical utility of ultrasound evaluation of the urinary tract.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with urinary tract pathology.
