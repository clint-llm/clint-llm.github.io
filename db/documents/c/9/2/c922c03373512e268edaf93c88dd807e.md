The histology is that of a foreign-body granuloma with isolated areas of microabscess formation. In the organized granuloma, mainly within giant cells, groups of fungal cells may be seen. They are chestnut or golden brown, and therefore can be easily distinguished in the infiltrate. The cells characteristically divide into several planes of division by thick septa and are termed muriform or sclerotic cells. There is marked pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis. In some areas, apparent transepidermal elimination of fungal cells, which are in the stratum corneum The tissue between the granulomatous nodules shows chronic fibrosis. When ulceration has occurred, there is usually a secondary bacterial infection.
