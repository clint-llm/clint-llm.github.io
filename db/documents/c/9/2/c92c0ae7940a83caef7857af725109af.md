An appropriate means of controlling pain should be selected. Typically, general anesthesia or dissociative anesthesia is used for full facial CO2 laser resurfacing. For smaller areas or fractional resurfacing, a series of topical anesthetic applications followed by a local anesthetic block or infiltration may be sufficient to provide patient comfort. Occlusive inserts, eyewear, or laser goggles may be chosen for patient ocular safety depending upon the area being treated, and caution should be exercised regarding the potential of light to be reflected onto the cornea.

The general standard of practice is to initiate antiviral therapy for all patients. Most patients have been exposed to the herpes simplex virus, and antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduces the risk of infectious complications. Antibiotics such as cefadroxil, dicloxacillin, doxycycline, or ciprofloxacin are often prescribed after the procedure.

To achieve successful ablation of the skin without causing excessive thermal damage, a fluence of 5 J/cm^2 is applied with a pulse duration of less than 1 millisecond.

Re-epithelialization typically occurs 6 to 7 days after treatment. Following the procedure, crusting and serous exudate may develop over denuded skin in the treated area. Post-procedure care includes using bio-occlusive films, petroleum-based ointments, or hydrogels for the first 48 hours to decrease the formation of crusting over the treated area, which can facilitate appropriate healing.
