Evaluating mitochondrial function involves evaluating the Krebs cycle. For example, in nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD), there is a mitochondrial malfunction, and it is one of the diagnostic cornerstones. Some authors suggest comparing the plasma values of isocitrate and citrate for a finding of mitochondrial alteration.

The search for plasma values of mitochondrial metabolites can be used to understand how mitochondria are working.
