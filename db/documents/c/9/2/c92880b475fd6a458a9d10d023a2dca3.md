The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary nerve, which is the second division of the trigeminal nerve. The maxillary nerve exits the infraorbital foramen, where it terminates as the infraorbital nerve. The infraorbital nerve provides sensory innervation to the lower eyelid, lateral aspect of the nose, upper lip, upper incisor, canine, premolars, and mesiobuccal root of the first molar on the ipsilateral side of the face. The infraorbital nerve block anesthetizes the anterior and middle maxillary alveolar nerves, inferior palpebral, lateral nasal, and superior labial. This also includes the maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars, as well as their vestibular osseous support and the soft tissues which cover them. Finally, it includes the mesiovestibular root of the maxillary first molar, part of the maxillary sinus and nose.
