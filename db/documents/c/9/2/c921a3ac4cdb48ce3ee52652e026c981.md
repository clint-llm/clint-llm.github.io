Diseases of the nasal cavity can be due to a wide variety of etiologies. Viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens can cause an infection within the nasal cavity or the surrounding sinuses. Particular consideration is necessary for those infections that can spread from the nasal cavity to surrounding or connected structures. Because the Eustachian tube enters into the nasal cavity, an infection can spread through the tube to the middle ear. For patients with persistent otitis media, often children, tympanostomy tubes should be considered. Diabetes patients with poorly controlled glucose levels are also at risk for serious but rare infection mucormycosis. If untreated, this infection can quickly spread from the nasal cavity to the CNS. Many viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia are spread through nasal inhalation and initially infect the nasopharynx.

Anatomic abnormalities can also cause complications requiring evaluation. Concerning symptoms include repeated sinus infections, sleep apnea, difficulty breathing, and loss of olfaction, among others.

Nasal cavity tumors are more often malignant than benign, and the development of any mass within the nasal cavity warrants further evaluation.
