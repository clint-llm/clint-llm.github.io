Group A streptococcus is a Gram-positive, non-motile bacteria that is the most common etiology for acute pharyngitis accounting for 5 to 15 percent of all adult cases and 20 to 30 percent of all pediatric cases. Patient history may include an abrupt onset of fever, sore throat, and exposure to someone with the disease within the previous two weeks. The following activity emphasizes the essential knowledge necessary for interprofessional team members to have while treating patients with streptococcal pharyngitis.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of a patient with suspected streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Summarize the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Describe the complications of streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Describe the value of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to educate patients on proper hand hygiene to prevent the spread of infection.
