Approximately 2% to 3% of all patients presenting with disorders of the pancreas present with pancreatic panniculitis. This condition isÂ 4 times more common in men than women.

A recent meta-analysis of global trends of acute pancreatitis found that, overall, pancreatitis is increasing, especially alcohol-associated pancreatitis, due to the increased alcohol consumption in developing nations and Asian countries. Areas of the United States might be experiencing stabilizing plateaus of pancreatitis numbers, indicating incidence peaks.

As acute pancreatitis increases worldwide, pancreatic panniculitis may be observed in more cases. However, this is difficult to determine as these studies regarding acute pancreatitis do not include accompanying numbers for pancreatic panniculitis. While systematic retrospective reviews of case studies reporting pancreatic panniculitis have been done, it is difficult to determine its presentation's exact incidence and prevalence, mainly when various etiologies exist for this panniculitis.
