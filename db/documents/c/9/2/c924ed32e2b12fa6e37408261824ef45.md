- Hookworm infections are currently considered one of the most underfunded neglected tropical diseases.

- Millions of people get infected with the parasite around the world, especially in poorer tropical countries.

- Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus are the main species that infect humans. A. ceylanicum, A. caninum, and A. braziliense are other minor causes.

- Hookworm infections are usually asymptomatic; symptoms vary depending on the stage of the life cycle, from cutaneous ground itch to respiratory symptoms until the main feature of iron deficiency anemia and, on rare occasions, intestinal bleeding.

- Diagnosis depends on both epidemiological, clinical, and microscopic evaluation.

- Management is mainly by either single-dose albendazole or multi-dose mebendazole. Mass treatment is useful in endemic areas.

- Health education and sanitation are the mainstays of preventing the disease. The vaccine is not available currently but under ongoing research and development.
