A Cochlear Implant (CI) is a medical device that uses electricity to stimulate the spiral ganglion cells of the auditory nerve to restore sensorineural hearing loss. The purpose of this device is to transmit sound to an electrical signal and deliver this to the hearing nerve, which bypasses the damaged hearing apparatus. The challenge in cochlear implants is to select patients who will benefit from this technology appropriately; this is a newer technology in medicine and continues to evolve rapidly. These devices are surgically placed by otolaryngologists who workly closely with audiologists to make this device effective for patients. This device is arguably the most successful device to replace sensory deprivation. The FDA regulates its production in the United States. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications of the cochlear implant, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with deafness.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the up to date indications for cochlear implants.
- Outline the advantages and disadvantages of cochlear implants.
- Explain the clinical significance of cochlear implants.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cochlear implants and improve outcomes.
