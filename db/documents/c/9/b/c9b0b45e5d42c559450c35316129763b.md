Tricuspid regurgitation is the most common indication requiring tricuspid valve repair. Untreated tricuspid regurgitation leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Severe tricuspid regurgitation is associated with a poor prognosis, independent of age, biventricular function, and right ventricular size. Surgical mortality of tricuspid valve replacement is 3-4 times higher, compared to other single valve open procedures. Functional tricuspid regurgitation frequently coexists with left-sided valve disease, and most of the tricuspid valve procedures are performed secondarily with other primary cardiac surgical procedures. The most common indication for tricuspid repair is secondary (functional) tricuspid regurgitation. Complications of tricuspid valve repair include heart blocks, infections, bleeding, prosthetic valve dysfunction, stroke, and death.

An interprofessional team should include cardiologists, anesthesiologists, cardiac surgeons, and intensivists. Preoperative echocardiographic evaluation of the tricuspid valve requires coordination between the sonographer and the cardiologist. In the intraoperative environment, closed-loop communication between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, circulating nurse, and srub technician is vital for successful tricuspid valve repair. A detailed handoff to the receiving critical care team is essential in improving the outcomes and minimizing adverse events.
