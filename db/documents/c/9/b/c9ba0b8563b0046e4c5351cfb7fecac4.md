The basic principle of ABO typing is that the forward grouping reaction, which detects the antigen present on the surface of the RBCs of the patient, should match the results of the reverse grouping reaction, which detects the antibodies present in the patient’s serum. The Anti-A and Anti-B, universally occurring antibodies are expected to be detected in the serum of all persons who lack those antigens on the surface of red blood cells. Both the forward and reverse grouping reactions are expected to be strong (3+ or 4+) reactions.

If there are any unmatched results between the two grouping reactions, ABO discrepancies arise. It is essential for patient safety that no ABO discrepancies are ignored. All discrepancies should be investigated and explained before determining the patient’s blood group and issuing group-compatible blood products.

Expected normal ABO typing results appear in the following table.
