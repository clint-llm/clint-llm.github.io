During fetal development, GnRH producing neurons develop from the epithelium of the medial olfactory pit and then migrate to the hypothalamus.

InÂ the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, as well during the first 3 to 6 months of infancy, the pituitary gland secretes LH and FSH.

- In males, FSH stimulates Sertoli cell proliferation, which is the most significant contributor to testicular volume in children.

Clinical correlation of the early infancy LH and FSH surge:

- The lack of the normal infancy peak of LH and FSH might identify and diagnose infants, especially males, who have hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

- Girls with monosomy Turner syndrome (45, XO) have an elevation of FSH up to 6 years old due to lack of negative feedback from nonfunctional ovaries, while girls with mosaicism (45, X/46, XX) have a much lower FSH elevation due to partial ovarian function.

During puberty, the hypothalamus secretes GnRH in a pulsatile manner, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to increase secretion of LH and FSH.
