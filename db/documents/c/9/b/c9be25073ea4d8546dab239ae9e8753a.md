Delayed sampling (beyond 60 minutes from a doubly clamped umbilical segment and beyond 20 minutes from an unclamped segment) renders the measurement of pH, pCO2, and pO2 unreliable.

Delayed cord clamping may alter blood gas analysis. Sampling should be done soon after birth from the unclamped cord to obtain the most accurate information. Delay in clamping the cord after delivery also decreases the reliability of measurements.

Other factors that may influence cord blood values include the mode of delivery and fetal presentation. Uterine contractions cause metabolic stress and a lower cord pH, whereas infants born by elective C-section without labor have a higher cord pH.
