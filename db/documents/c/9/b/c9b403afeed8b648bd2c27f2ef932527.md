Little League shoulder is most common in youth baseball players. One study looked at 2055 baseball players between the ages of 9 and 12. They found that 13.4% reported shoulder pain in their throwing arm. Of those patients with pain, 41 agreed to have x-rays taken of his or her shoulder. Of these 41, 36.6% had findings of Little League shoulder on x-ray. While this is a small sample size, this places the prevalence of Little League shoulder among all baseball players in this study, with and without pain, at 4.9%.

Another study of 1563 youth baseball players found that 15.9% had shoulder pain, although this was not specific to Little League shoulder.
