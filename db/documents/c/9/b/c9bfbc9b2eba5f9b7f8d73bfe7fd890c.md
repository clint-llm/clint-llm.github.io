Management of a patient with paraneoplastic syndrome is based on the type, severity, and location of the paraneoplastic syndrome. If occult malignancy is diagnosed, then the first step is to treat the underlying malignancy with chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery when possible. A paraneoplastic syndrome is an auto-immune process; patients may benefit from immunosuppression with high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, plasma exchange, or plasmapheresis.

Tumor-related hypercalcemia: Patients with calcium levels>14mg/dl (3.5mmol/L) require aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids. If they develop fluid overload, consider intravenous Lasix. If calcium is still high, consider giving intravenous calcitonin with Bisphosphonates (Subcutaneous Zolendronic acid or intravenous pamidronate). Calcitonin will decrease the calcium levels acutely, but there is a risk of developing tachyphylaxis. Bisphosphonates will take 1 to 2 days to decrease calcium levels.
