PTLD is a proliferative B-cell disorder that is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).Â It can be acquired either as a result of primary infection (frequently), from the donor or environmental exposure. EBV-negative PTLD occurs in approximately 23% of patients. Solid organ transplant recipients are more commonly affected when compared to recipients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
