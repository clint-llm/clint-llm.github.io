Quinapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor developed in the 1980s. ResearchersÂ determined that quinapril had a lower incidence of adverse events than other ACE inhibitors like captopril and enalapril, as well as the thiazide diuretic chlorthalidone.

- The FDA approved quinapril for the treatment of hypertension in 1989.

- Quinapril is used off labeled (non-FDA-approved) for chronic heart failure (CHF) and slowing the progression of renal disease in patients with diabetes. According to the SOLVD trial, as a class, ACE inhibitors have shown to be beneficial in chronic heart failure (CHF).

- As a class, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce proteinuria in diabetic patients. More importantly, research has demonstrated quinapril to be an agent that reduces microalbuminuria in essential hypertension and diabetic patients without significantly affecting insulin effectiveness or lipid levels.
