PD offers autonomy, dialysis therapy in the comfort of patients home, outcomes of patients are equivalent to those using HD as a dialysis modality and is considerably cheaper to the system. Patient education and utilization of a PD first approach in all patients initiating dialysis can not only save financial resources in an evergrowing cost of ESRD care but improve patient experience and mortality. Despite these benefits, the utilization of PD remains poor in the United States. There are no RCTs comparing outcomes of PD versus HD, and such a study will perhaps never be done. USRDS data suggests the outcomes of PD and HD are equivalent and risk of death in ESRD patient initiating dialysis with TDC higher in the first year of dialysis compared to PD patient.
