# Continuing Education Activity

Chronic coronary occlusion or chronic total occlusion (CTO) has a wide spectrum ranging from subtotal to total coronary involvement. The diagnosis is made by clinical/laboratory findings and angiography. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of the disease, which includes lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of chronic coronary occlusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chronic coronary occlusion.
- Review the appropriate steps for the evaluation of chronic coronary occlusion.
- Outline the management options available for chronic coronary occlusion.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of chronic coronary occlusion and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Chronic coronary occlusion or chronic total occlusion (CTO) refers to complete luminal diameter stenosis with resultant thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) grade flow 0 or 1.

# Etiology

Chronic total occlusions arise from a coronary thrombus that later becomes organized and fibrotic.

# Epidemiology

The prevalence of total coronary occlusion seems to range from 18% to 35% of patients with coronary artery stenosis.

# Pathophysiology

CTO is due to complete or near-complete occlusion of a coronary artery, which is characterized by atherosclerotic plaque burden. Though such patients have collaterals, the collaterals are insufficient to sustain myocardial perfusion. This insufficiency leads to angina and ischemic symptoms.

# Histopathology

Autopsy findings indicate that the total occlusion of coronary arteries happens due to the thrombus. The thrombus later gets reorganized with collagen dense fibrous tissues at the proximal and the distal end. As the lesion ages, the plaque becomes calcified and loses its previous microchannels.

# History and Physical

In general, history findings depend on the stage of coronary artery occlusion. The symptoms are related to myocardial ischemia or myocardial contractibility.

Physical examination includes a complete general physical examination to look for xanthomas and general assessment of blood circulation followed by a detailed cardiovascular examination.

# Evaluation

Electrocardiogram (EKG) can show ischemic changes in patients with chronic coronary occlusion. However, these findings are non-specific for diagnosis.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment mainly depends on the extent and severity of the disease and includes lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, and procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Subtotal coronary occlusion is usually managed medically along the line of stable angina. Beta-blockers are preferred for initial treatment for the prevention of anginal symptoms.

Total coronary occlusion or subtotal occlusion refractory to medical therapy is managed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting.

In single-vessel disease, PCI is preferred over CABG. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves an incision in the groin or wrist area. A wire is passed through the main blood vessel to the blocked artery in the heart. An opening is created in the blocked region with the help of guidewire. After this, a catheter is passed over the wire, then a balloon is inflated at the site of blockage to displace the plaque, and a stent is placed to normalize the blood flow and keep the artery open. In multivessel disease, CABG is the preferred.

# Differential Diagnosis

Many diseases presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath may resemble chronic coronary occlusion.

Most common of these are:

- Atherosclerosis

- Angina pectoris

- Unstable angina

- Coronary artery vasospasm

- Myocardial infarction

- Hypertensive heart disease

- Isolated coronary artery anomalies

# Prognosis

Prognosis mainly depends on the severity of the disease. Those with subtotal chronic coronary occlusion have a better prognosis than with total chronic coronary occlusion. Total coronary occlusion is associated with a worse overall prognosis, with higher rates of death and non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events in several populations.

Patients with un-revascularized CTOs have been found to have higher mortality and a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including death from myocardial infarction compared to patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who are completely revascularized.

# Complications

The complications of the disease itself include a higher risk of cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and death. Complications can also occur during PCI, which includes major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, significant Ellis grade ≥3 perforation, bleeding requiring treatment, acute kidney injury, and death and graft rejection in CABG.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Successful revascularization improves long term survival, reduced need for coronary artery bypass graft, and an improvement in left ventricular systolic function in patients with CTO.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Chronic coronary occlusion has a wide spectrum, ranging from subtotal to total coronary involvement. Management of CTO should involve an interprofessional team that includes interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, radiology, primary care, nursing staff, and pharmacists. The diagnosis is made by clinical/laboratory findings and angiography. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of the disease, which includes lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting.
