Swimmer's shoulder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the orthopedic nurse. The shoulder provides the greatest range of motion of all joints in the body but also possesses the greatest inherent instability. As a result of the complexities, combinations, and variations encountered when examining the painful swimmer’s shoulder, a correct diagnosis can be challenging. A range of provocative tests and imaging studies is critical in identifying the source of the pain and in determining the appropriate treatment. Although some pathology may be managed symptomatically by ice and NSAIDs, athletes with persistent pain should seek evaluation by a sports medicine physician who may be able to offer more aggressive treatments. Physical therapy can be especially helpful in balancing muscle groups, reducing in-season symptoms, and potentially preventing future injuries.

Most swimmers do have a good outcome with treatment, but recurrence is not uncommon. Hence, the efforts of a strong interprofessional team for ongoing management will yield the best patient results.
