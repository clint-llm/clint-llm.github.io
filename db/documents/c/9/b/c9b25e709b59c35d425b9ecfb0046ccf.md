MFS and GBS are thought to result from an aberrant acute autoimmune response to a preceding infection (e.g., Campylobacter jejuni, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A cross-reaction between peripheral nerve antigens and microbial/viral components through molecular mimicry is thought to drive the inflammatory process of this illness.

MFS is associated mainly with dysfunction of the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. Documented cases have been reported, however, for most of the other cranial nerves. Antibodies against the GQ1b ganglioside are a typical serological finding as described in the pathophysiology section of this article, but the absence of antibodies does not rule out the disease completely. Other risk factors associated with the disease include the use of certain drugs (heroin, suramin, streptokinase, and isotretinoin), use of TNF-alpha antagonist therapy, other concurrent autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus, Hodgkin disease, and sarcoidosis), surgery, epidural anesthesia, bone marrow transplant, and immunizations.
