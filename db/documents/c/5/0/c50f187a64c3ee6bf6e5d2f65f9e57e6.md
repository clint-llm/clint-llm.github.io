HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are lipid-lowering medications used in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Atorvastatin competitively inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. By preventing the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, statin medications decrease cholesterol production in the liver. Atorvastatin also increases the number of LDL receptors on the surface of hepatic cells. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and mechanism of action of atorvastatin to manage coronary heart disease and familial dyslipidemias, covering the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of atorvastatin therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for atorvastatin therapy.
- Identify potential adverse events when using therapy with atorvastatin.
- Outline the appropriate follow-up and monitoring of lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance patient adherence to atorvastatin in treating coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia.
