The diagnosis of PMS is challenging due to the lack of explicit signs on physical examination and lack of diagnostic testing. Hence it requires the involvement of the patient, nurses, and physician to make a diagnosis. The role of the patients can include maintaining a diary which elaborates their symptoms and yield in early diagnosis whereas the nurses can be extremely helpful if they help in collecting a filled-in questionnaire from the patients during the monthly visit. Physicians on the other hand can use these tools in excluding other differentials which may produce better outcomes.
