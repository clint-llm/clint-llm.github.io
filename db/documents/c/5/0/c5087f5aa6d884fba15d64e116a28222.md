Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) occurs due to complex interactions between multiple pathological processes, including diminished respiratory drive, structural and functional respiratory impairment, and sleep-related breathing alterations. Chronic steady-state hypercapnia occurs due to the failure of compensatory ventilatory mechanisms.

**Obesity**

Respiratory system mechanics are affected significantly by obesity and fat distribution.

**Excessive Load on Respiratory System**

**Respiratory Muscles**

The maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures are reduced in patients with OHS while normal in morbidly obese patients with eucapnic or mild OHS.

**Respiratory Mechanics**

Due to reduced pulmonary distensibility, obese patients suffer reduced ventilation in the lower pulmonary lobes. The alveoli close before the expiration, thus producing a characteristic breathing pattern of low tidal volume and an increased respiratory rate, causing an increase in the dead ventilation space. Decreased ventilation of the lower lobes causes alterations in the ventilation-perfusion (V/Q), thus triggering hypoxemia. Total lung capacity (TLC), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), and residual functional capacity (RFC) are reduced in patients with OHS as opposed to eucapnic obese patients.

**Respiratory Drive**

Patients with OHS have a blunted respiratory drive in response to a hypercapnic challenge. Multiple possible pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the blunted respiratory response, including possible leptin resistance, genetic predisposition, and sleep-disordered breathing.

Intrinsically diminished chemosensitivity to CO2 retention has been reported in OHS patients. It is possible that this diminished hypoxic and hypercapnic chemosensitivity could be the underlying reason for hypoventilation in patients with idiopathic obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

**Leptin**

Leptin is a 16-kDa protein encoded by the ob gene discovered in 1994.

**OSA**

An estimated 90% of patients with OHS have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (defined by an apnea-hypopnea index-AHI ≥ five events/hour), and the majority (approximately 70%) are severe (AHI ≥ 30 events/hour).

The PaCO2 increase is secondary to the cessation of ventilation during apneic events and the continued metabolic production of CO2. Eucapnic patients can normalize the PaCO2 levels via compensatory augmentation of alveolar ventilation, which increases CO2 clearance. However, in OHS patients, the compensatory mechanism is disrupted, causing the retention of CO2.

**Sleep Hypoventilation**

Almost 5% to 10 % of patients with OHS have sleep hypoventilation and a PaCO2 elevation during sleep of 10 mm Hg or higher. These patients are clinically indistinguishable from those with concomitant OSA. Sustained hypoxia significantly delays the warning signals of decreased ventilation and could potentially contribute to hypoventilation.

Given its extensive magnitude, addressing the associated metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory complications is paramount.
