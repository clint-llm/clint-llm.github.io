Radon toxicity is one of the leading causes of lung cancers in non-smokers. It is a radioactive gas that is naturally occurring in the environment and can be found in homes. Since it is a tasteless, odorless, colorless gas, and causes no obvious symptoms of exposure, it is important to understand proper diagnosis and treatment methods. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of radon toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients who are exposed to radon.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radon toxicity.
- Review the risk factors for developing radon toxicity. 
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with radon toxicity. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by radon toxicity.
