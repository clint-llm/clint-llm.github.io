Spinal osteotomy is an umbrella term for techniques used by spinal surgeons to correct spinal deformity. They can be performed on pediatric or adult patients. The purpose is to establish normal range spinal curvature, relieve pain, and improve quality of life. These can be broken down into posterior column osteotomy (PCO), including Ponte osteotomy and Smith-Petersen osteotomy (SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), or vertebral column resection (VSR). The SRS-Schwab classification nomenclature grades osteotomies from 1 to 6 by the amount of bone or disc removal. This activity describes the technique, indications, contraindications of spinal osteotomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the preoperative workup of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technical aspects of spinal osteotomy.
- Describe the indications for spinal osteotomy.
- Review the preoperative workup of a patient needing spinal osteotomy.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes undergoing spinal osteotomy.
