Since most pediatric patients are asymptomatic, medical therapy has no role in the treatment of subvalvular aortic stenosis. As it is progressive, intervention is needed at some point to relieve the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Surgical correction of the obstruction is the definitive therapy for the subvalvular aortic stenosis. This may range from simple removal of the membrane to extensive ring resection, with or without myectomy. However, if the patient develops heart failure or clinically significant left ventricular dysfunction, the patient is started on medical treatment until the surgery can be performed.

**Indications for Intervention**

The criteria and timing of intervention for subvalvular aortic stenosis are controversial. Early intervention in these patients is counterbalanced by the high postoperative incidence of recurrence, late reoperation and development of aortic regurgitation after relieving the obstruction.

- In children and adolescents with Doppler mean gradient of less than 30 mm Hg and no left ventricular hypertrophy, the management of subvalvular aortic stenosis is nonintervention and medical follow up.[17]

- In children and adolescents with Doppler mean gradient of 50 mm of Hg or more should be surgically treated

- In children and adolescents with Doppler mean gradients of 30 to 50 mm Hg, may be considered for surgery if they are symptomatic with angina, syncope, or dyspnea on exertion if they are asymptomatic but develop changes on ECG at rest or with exercise or older age at diagnosis.[17],[18],

- Prevention of aortic regurgitation alone is generally not a criterion for surgery. However, the progression and worsening of regurgitation to a significant grade is an indication for surgery.

**Interventional Procedures**

Surgery requires the use of the heart-lung machine. The subaortic membrane is usually resected via the aorta (myomectomy). Some children with subvalvular aortic stenosis may require an aortic valve repair or replacement at the same time. In infants who are too ill to undergo open-heart surgery, percutaneous balloon dilatation can be performed. If successful it will reduce the aortic gradient and symptoms. This palliative procedure will last for a few months or even years, and the child can undergo formal surgery when stable.

Discrete fibromuscular subvalvular aortic stenosis is treated surgically by complete resection with myotomy, with or without myomectomy through an aortotomy. Clinically significant aortic regurgitation may require aortic valve repair or replacement.

In tunnel-type subvalvular aortic stenosis with a small LV-aortic junction, Konno procedure (aortoventriculoplasty) may be needed. This includes excision and replacement of the aortic valve with a prosthesis, and patch augmentation of ventricular septum to enlarge the left ventricular outflow tract, and then pericardial patch closure of the right ventriculotomy used to gain access to the left ventricular outflow tract.

In cases of recurrent subvalvular aortic stenosis and tunnel-type subvalvular aortic stenosis with the normal LV-aortic junction and aortic valve, modified Konno procedure, in other words, without aortic valve excision and replacement may be performed.

**Endocarditis Prophylaxis**

In the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines, antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bacterial endocarditis is no longer recommended in patients with subvalvular aortic stenosis, except in those with a prior history of endocarditis or with a repair that required prosthetic material or device.

In the latter case, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for the first 6 months after repair. However, if a residual defect is present, prophylactic antibiotics are continued beyond the 6-month period.
