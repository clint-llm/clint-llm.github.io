Once a detailed medical history and clinical inspection suggest tinea manuum, mycological confirmation must be obtained.Â Some authors suggest that the gold standard for detecting a fungal infection must be a triple confirmation that includes: clinical exam, KOH, and culture.

- **Direct microscopy**is a simple and inexpensive method to find the presence of fungal hyphae. Classically, a swab of pustular or wet inflammatory lesions or a scraping of dry, scaly lesions might be the first step. Nail clippings should be included if the onychomycosis is also suspected.

- **Fluorescent staining**with optical brighteners might be used to increase the fungal detection rate. This stain selectively bids to chitin of the fungal cell wall and then gives an apple-green fluorescence when visualized under fluorescent microscopy.

- **Histopathology**might be necessary, especially when other skin diseases are suspected in the differential diagnosis.

- **Dermoscopy**has also been described recently as a useful and non-invasive tool that could assist in the diagnosis of tinea manuum. Typical localization and distribution of the scales in the furrows and dermatoglyphics seem to be unique to this entity.

Other methods of dermatophyte differentiation, such as PCR, real-time PCR, and newer molecular methods, are being used in large institutions and for research purposes.
