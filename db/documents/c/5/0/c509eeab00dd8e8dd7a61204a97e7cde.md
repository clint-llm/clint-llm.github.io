Despite pharmacotherapy advances for treating psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, OCD, and depression, many patients become refractory. Neuromodulation provides an alternative, and many times, an effective treatment in these patients.

The medical and patient community needs to evaluate the new modulatory treatments for these unresponsive psychiatric disorders. Each procedure must be given credit bases on evidence-based information, and not on their tainted history. The use of all these neuromodulatory treatments should be evaluated in blind trials and systematic randomized trials. Still, the optimal patient selection and surgical targeting areas need to be explored.

In many patients, DBS indications are limited to intractable OCD, major affective disorders GTS, TS, and AN. Still, sometimes, it is used to treat drug addiction and certain forms of severe aggression or auto aggression.
