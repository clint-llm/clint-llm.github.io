Pain arising from the intercostal nerves has been termed intercostal neuralgia. Intercostal neuralgia is a common pathology that can occur due to nerve entrapment, traumatic causes, persistent nerve irritation, and herpes zoster. Patients describe pain from intercostal neuralgia as a shooting, burning, or sharp pain. The location of the pain usually begins at the posterior axillary line and radiates anteriorly into the distribution territory of the intercostal nerve. The pain is reproducible during deep inspiration or other chest wall movements, which creates a complication for those who do not take adequate breaths. Upon diagnosing intercostal neuralgia, treatment can vary from pharmacological therapy with tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsants, non-somatic treatment, and interventional pain treatment. It is important to note that intercostal nerve blocks are a viable option for providing analgesia; however, their proximity to the pleural space makes careful attention to technique and anatomy mandatory.
