Surgical excision with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for all salivary gland malignancies. Despite preoperative attempts to obtain a diagnosis through a needle biopsy, sometimes histological diagnosis may sometimes not be available until at the time of surgery when frozen specimens can be obtained for analysis. The extent of surgery and the need for neck dissection or adjuvant radiotherapy will be dependent on the subtype, grade, and stage of the malignancy.

Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is recommended after surgical excision to improve locoregional control in cases with positive margins, cervical metastases, advanced cancer stage, aggressive histology or grade, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, or extra-glandular extension.

Primary RT is usually reserved for patients with unresectable disease, metastatic disease, or poor surgical candidacy.
