BRFSS prevalence data concerning chronic diseases, health risk behaviors, and preventive practices are used by all 50 states and 3 U.S. territories to track and monitor the health of U.S. residents.Â Policymakers, scientists, governmental municipalities, and agencies use this data to implement public health policies, research, programs, and resources to target the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. It helps to support public health planning and policies such as legislation concerning drinking and driving, air pollution, and the usage of seat belts.
