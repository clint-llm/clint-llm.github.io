Any patient who presents with an isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft should be carefully evaluated for concomitant injuries, such as a Monteggia fracture pattern where the radial head is no longer in continuity with the capitellum. Therefore it is imperative to obtain a perfect lateral x-ray of the elbow to ensure appropriate positioning of the radial head in relation to the capitellum. Monteggia fractures do require semi-urgent operative intervention, with the restoration of the length of the ulna being critical to achieving a stable reduction of the radial head.

Practitioners should also be aware of the risk of concomitant fractures and dislocations at the wrist when evaluating ulnar shaft fractures of any degree of displacement. Contralateral films are very useful in the evaluation of ulnar variance and distal radial/ulnar stability. Intraoperatively, compare fluoroscopic views of the wrist compared to contralateral with the same amount of pronation/supination before securing fixation to ensure appropriate ulnar length. Clinicians should routinely perform a "shuck test" on the wrist joint to test the stability of the DRUJ. If unstable, K-wires can provide temporary stabilization of the DRUJ, maximizing the long-term functional outcomes of the wrist.
