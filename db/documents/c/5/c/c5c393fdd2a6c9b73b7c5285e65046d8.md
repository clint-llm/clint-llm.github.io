Results of the pathergy test have been known to vary widely between populations and even between different investigators studying the same population. The positivity rate for pathergy tests in BD is highest in countries along the Silk Route, which includes the Middle East, Far East, and Mediterranean Basin.

One of the major interfering factors affecting results of pathergy testing is thought to be related to the materials and methods used to conduct the test. Various studies revealed that using a blunt (sterilized, reusable) needle increases the intensity and frequency of positive pathergy tests.

Another possible interfering factor with pathergy testing is thought to be the use of corticosteroids by BD patients, which can increase the false-negative results according to some studies.
