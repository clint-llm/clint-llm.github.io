Initially described in 1939 by Henri Mondor, Mondor disease classically describes a syndrome of sclerosing superficial thrombophlebitis of the veins of the anterior thoracic wall. The most commonly involved vessel is the superior epigastric vein producing a palpable cord in the inferior outer quadrant of the breast. Also known as Mondor cord, this rare clinical entity has also been reported as affecting the superficial penile veins. This activity reviews Mondor disease and stresses the importance of an interprofessional approach to care.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the cause of Mondor disease.
- Review the presentation of Mondor disease.
- Summarize the treatment of Mondor disease.
- Review the importance of care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with Mondor disease.
