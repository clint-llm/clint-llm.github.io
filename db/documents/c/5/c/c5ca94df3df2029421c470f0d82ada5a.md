Many times, PACs have no adverse effect on a patient’s lifestyle or outcome and may be monitored by the primary care provider. Consultations for PACs should be made based on clinical suspicion for underlying morbid etiologies or when symptoms are obstructive and overwhelming. Referral to cardiology services can assist in diagnosing underlying structural or electrical conduction abnormalities and for initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapies when appropriate.
