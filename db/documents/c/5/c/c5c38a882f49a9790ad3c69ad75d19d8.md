Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an immune-mediated neuroinflammatory disease characterized by autoantibodies against the GluN1 subunit 2B (NR2B)/NMDA subunit 2A (NR2A) subunits of the NDMA receptor in the hippocampus causing the symptoms. Initially, it was diagnosed as a paraneoplastic disease most commonly associated with ovarian teratoma.

Another confirmed association has been seen with herpes simplex encephalitis.

In the California encephalitis project, it was found out that anti-NMDAR antibodies were produced in children post-infection with mycoplasma.
