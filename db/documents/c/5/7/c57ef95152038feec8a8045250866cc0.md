The pathophysiology of a thyroid nodule will vary depending on the lesion. Several disorders may cause thyroid nodules. The most common type is benign macrofollicular nodules, representing either monoclonal adenomas or colloid nodules in multinodular goiter. The latter represents the expansion of relatively monoclonal cells replicating in a nodular fashion.

Follicular neoplasms may represent a diagnostic problem as these only differ from follicular carcinomas by lack of vascular or capsular invasion.

The association between thyroid irradiation and tumorigenesis is well-known. Radiation may cause a wide range of somatic mutations that increase the risk of cancer, particularly in radiation-sensitive organs such as the thyroid. Compared to adults, children have a higher risk of thyroid cancer after irradiation; this is most likely due to the higher proliferative activity of the thyroid tissue in younger individuals.

RET proto-oncogene translocations have been found in thyroid malignancies associated with ionizing irradiation. The presence of RET/PCT translocations has been described in follicular adenomas presenting after irradiation.
