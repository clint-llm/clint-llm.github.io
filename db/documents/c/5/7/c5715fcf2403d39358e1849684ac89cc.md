The drug emicizumab is a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody that restores the function of missing activated FVIII by bridging FIXa and FX, mimicking activated Factor VIIIa independently of Factor VIII levels. Consequently, emicizumab promotes effective hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A.

**Pharmacokinetics****Absorption:**After subcutaneous administration, the absorption half-life is 1.6±1 days. The bioavailability following subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg ranged between 80.4% and 93.1%. Similar pharmacokinetic profiles are noted following SC administration in the abdomen, thigh, and upper arm. Following subcutaneous administrations of a loading dose of 3 mg/kg emicizumab once weekly for the first four weeks,  trough plasma concentrations of 52.6 ± 13.6 μg/mL(mean (± SD)) are achieved at week 5. Steady-state concentrations with the recommended maintenance doses vary according to the regimen. (Ctrough = trough concentration at steady state)

- 1.5 mg/kg once every week: Ctrough 51.2+/- 15.2(µg/mL)

- 3 mg/kg once every two weeks: Ctrough 46.9 +/- 14.8(µg/mL)

- 6 mg/kg once every four weeks: Ctrough 38.5 +/- 14.2(µg/mL)

**Distribution:**The mean apparent volume of distribution is 10.4 L.

**Elimination:**The mean apparent clearance is 0.27 L/day, and the mean elimination apparent half-life is 26.9 +/- 9.1 days.
