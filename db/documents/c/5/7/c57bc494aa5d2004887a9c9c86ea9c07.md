The differential diagnosis of spontaneous abortion can be constructed by considering the pelvic organs that could be responsible for vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy.

- Ectopic pregnancy can also cause cramping, vaginal bleeding, and a plateau or decline in the natural rise of beta-hCG in early pregnancy.

- Sub-chorionic hematoma is another common cause of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy.

- Gestational trophoblastic disease, although rare, is a feared differential diagnosis of early pregnancy loss.

- Cervical pathologies that should be considered include friability more than that typically encountered in pregnancy, infectious cervicitis, cervical polyps, ectropion, and dysplasia. These etiologies should be high on the differential in the setting of post-coital bleeding.

- Implantation and idiopathic bleeding of pregnancy are other vital considerations.

- Cervical and vaginal trauma must also be considered.

These differential diagnoses can usually be sufficiently evaluated through history, physical exam, and pelvic ultrasound.
