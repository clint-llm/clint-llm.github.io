Steroid 17-hydroxylase is a cytochrome p-450 enzyme.

Patients with a 17-hydroxylase deficiency cannot synthesize cortisol or sex hormones effectively. The deficiency in cortisol production results in a disruption of the feedback loop to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and a resultant overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn leads to hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex. The inability to effectively synthesize sex hormones results in a range of defects in sexual maturation.Â There is a resultant excess in 11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone. Aldosterone levels may vary and can range from low to high.
