- Acute anemia occurs when there is an abrupt drop in RBCs; hemolysis or acute hemorrhage are the most common causes.

- Prioritize the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and starting resuscitation

- Immediately send a blood sample to be typed and cross-matched; obtain serial CBCs to assess the hemoglobin and hematocrit

- Initial management: supplemental oxygen, obtaining large bore IV access, intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation (crystalloid is the initial fluid of choice), and applying direct pressure to a hemorrhage

- Packed red blood cells (pRBCs): transfuse when hemoglobin is less than 7 or clinically indicated

- Each unit of pRBCs is expected to raise the hematocrit by 3 points
