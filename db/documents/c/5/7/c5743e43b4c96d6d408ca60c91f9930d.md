The treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum requires an interprofessional approach. The skin lesions take a long time to heal, frequently breakdown despite adequate treatment and are very painful. Besides the physician, a wound care nurse is necessary. The wound care nurse has to educate the patient on adequate wound management, avoidance of trauma and also maintain physical activity. The pharmacist should encourage the patient to avoid smoking and be compliant with the medications, as relapses are common.  Because the pain is often severe, prescription-strength opioids are often required but these drugs should be tapered quickly to avoid physical dependence. A pain consultation should be made to help manage the pain without opioids. All patients should be told to avoid surgery as this often results in poor wound healing and development of pathergy.

Outcomes

In the majority of patients, the prognosis is good but the skin disorder does recur. In addition, most people are left some residual scar. The acute disorder is also associated with moderate-to-severe pain that often requires prescription-strength opioids. Despite the use of immunosuppressive agents, relapses are common and long-term care is required. The skin lesions breakdown from minimal trauma.
