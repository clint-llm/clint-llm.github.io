All patients undergoing lens aspiration, cataract surgery, and IOL implantation should be started on steroids and adjuvant drugs to manage surgery-induced inflammation. The patient should be evaluated on postoperative day one and day 30. In case of any untoward complication or reduced visual acuity postoperatively, the patient can have a more frequent evaluation in the first and second week postoperatively. The patient should be told to avoid water splashes in the eyes for at least a month post-surgery. Counseling should be stressed.
