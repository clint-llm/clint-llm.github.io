Most patients with hypophosphatemia are asymptomatic, and it is an incidental finding. Those with mild hypophosphatemia may complain of generalized mild to moderate weakness. The history of presenting illness will rarely indicate possible hypophosphatemia. For this reason, a clinician should have suspicion for phosphate abnormalities whenever an etiology is present that is associated with hypophosphatemia.Â Conditions to consider possible hypophosphatemia include poor nutritional status, symptoms or history of intestinal malabsorption, history of antacid use, frequent or recurrent bone pain, fractures, history of or suspicion for multiple myeloma, parenteral nutrition supplementation, medication use including chronic glucocorticoids, cisplatin, or pamidronate, current treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis, and any hospitalization requiring an Intensive care unit setting.

Mild hypophosphatemia will not be clinically apparent. However, severe hypophosphatemia may have the clinical presence of altered mental status, neurological instability including seizures, and focal neurologic findings such as numbness or reflexive weakness, a cardiac manifestation of possible heart failure, muscle pain, and muscular weakness.
