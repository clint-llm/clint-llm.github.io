UV solar radiation is the most common cause of squamous cell carcinoma. However, long-term exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, such as tar in cigarettes, can also lead to the development of squamous cell carcinoma. Other possible causes include a site of a severe burn scar, and ulcer or sore present for many years and some types of human papillomavirus (HPV), especially in the genital area.
