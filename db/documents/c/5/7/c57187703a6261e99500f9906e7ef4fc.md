The biliary system is made up of intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts. The liver secretes bile into small intrahepatic ducts which coalesce to form the left and right hepatic ducts. These ducts unite to form the common hepatic duct, which then merges with the gallbladder cystic duct to form the common bile duct. The common bile duct courses to join the pancreatic duct which enters the second portion of the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater, or hepato-biliary ampulla. The circular muscle surrounding the ampulla of Vater is the sphincter of Oddi which opens and closes the ampulla.
