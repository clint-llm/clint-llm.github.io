Negative IIF result, i.e., ANCA is not detected: Normal.

Positive IIF result, i.e., ANCA is detected: Abnormal (In this case, the fluorescence pattern is also given to show whether c-ANCA or p-ANCA is present).

**MPO Antibody (p-ANCA) Levels**

- >5.0 IU/ml = Positive

- 3.5-5 IU/ml = Equivocal

- <3.5 IU/ml = Negative

**PR3 Antibody (c-ANCA) Levels**

- >3.0 IU/ml = Positive

- 2-3.0 IU/ml = Equivocal

- <2.0 IU/ml = Negative

**Interpretation**

Positive results for c-ANCA are mostly consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA or Wegener granulomatosis). Whereas positive results with p-ANCA mostly occur in microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA or Churg-Strauss syndrome). Monitoring the titers of ANCAs are useful in monitoring the clinical course of diseases.
