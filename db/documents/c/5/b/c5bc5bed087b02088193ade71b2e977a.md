Humans are highly aerobic organisms consuming oxygen per metabolic demand.

- Barometric pressure (BP)

- Climatological conditions (temperature, latitude, relative humidity, altitude)

- Physiological, pathological, and physical-chemical processes

Oxygenation of tissues is one of the essential processes in the human body. Without proper oxygenation of tissues, metabolic processes cannot function efficiently, and cellular functions falter. With such importance for the survival of an organism, it is understandable that the process of extracting oxygen from environmental air is tightly regulated physiologically. All gases follow chemical laws that, when mixed, willÂ each have a partial pressure equal to the hypothetical pressure when the same gas homogeneously occupies the same volume at the same temperature as the original mixture.
