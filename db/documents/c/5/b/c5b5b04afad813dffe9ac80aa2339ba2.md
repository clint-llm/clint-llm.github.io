Radiographs help guide the classification and surgical management of cleft hand deformities. Before undergoing any surgical treatment, surgeons must develop a plan that specifically addresses the patient's unique abnormality. In particular, surgeons must assess for the presence or absence of metacarpals in the central rays, the degree of symbrachydactyly that may be present, and especially the vascular supply to the hand. If the cleft hand is due to vascular insufficiency, as is the case in Poland syndrome, a staged surgical correction will be necessary.
