**TAVR**

The advent of the transcatheter approach in managing aortic valve disease was a monumental turning point in the field of cardiovascular disease. TAVR has provided a treatment option for those deemed prohibitive risk for traditional SAVR, and offers a much less invasive and morbid option for those at lower surgical risk.

**BAV**

The BAV was the first transcatheter intervention introduced for the treatment of severe aortic valve disease. Although it is no longer recommended as monotherapy, except as a palliative measure, it opened the door for more advanced therapies to be developed such as the formerly discussed TAVR. BAV is still performed today on patients as a bridge therapy for TAVR or SAVR and for palliative care as no long term survival benefit post-procedure has been established.
