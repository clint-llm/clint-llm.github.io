Rituximab is an anti CD20 chimeric antibody with human IgG1 immunoglobulin constant regions and variable regions from an anti CD20 murine antibody. CD20 is a surface transmembrane protein marker expressed on B cells during differentiation from the pre-B cell until the plasma cell stage. CD20 is believed to function as a calcium channel and play a role in the maturation and activation of B cells.

Once rituximab is bound to CD20 positive cells, cell death is induced by various mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-mediated-cytotoxicity(CDC) antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP), and direct effects of binding of rituximab to CD20.

The combination of rituximab and hyaluronidase (rituximab-hyaluronidase human) is used in the subcutaneous form. Hyaluronidase causes a reversible increase in permeability of subcutaneous tissue by causing depolymerization of hyaluronan, which leads to an increase in the absorption rate of rituximab.
