Given limited published data on this new clinical entity, the precise pathophysiology of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is unknown and is likely multifactorial especially considering the involvement of multiple organ systems. Following any severe infection or trauma, the human body reacts with an overwhelming immune response called systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), followed by a prolonged compensatory, counterbalancing anti-inflammatory cascade called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS).

A delicate balance between SIRS and CARS determines the immediate clinical outcome and, eventually, the prognosis associated with the infection.Â SARS CoV 2 infection in patients with underlying comorbidities or immunocompetent settings may lead to excessive cytokine release called "cytokine storm." Persistent cytokine release results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulable state, maladaptation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway, hypoperfusion to end-organs, septic shock, multiorgan failure, and eventually death. Immunologic hemostasis between immune activation and immunosuppression will result in either clinical recovery or viral reactivation, secondary infections, and death.
