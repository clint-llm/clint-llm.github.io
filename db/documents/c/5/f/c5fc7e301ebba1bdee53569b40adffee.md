Utilize CRC screening guidelines to guide and avoid repeating other screening modalities after a high-quality colonoscopy for ten years or with less than ten years of life expectancy.

Do not use epidermal growth factor targeted-therapy against colorectal cancer unless the patient has a tumor biomarker (RAS/BRAF or MMR/MSI) that predicts effective response, advanced non-surgical stage, and satisfactory performance status.

Offer early palliative care for all CRC patients with uncontrolled physical symptoms or psychosocial stress even during oncological disease treatment, and encourage early conversations of the end of life of those with the metastatic stage.

All CRC patients should be supported for survivorship care after completion of treatment. A discussion on lifestyle changes, including following a healthy diet, obtain and maintain ideal body weight, establish an active exercise routine, minimize alcohol consumption, and quitÂ smoking, should be encouraged.

Establish a route for preventing and detecting new or recurrent CRC to minimize psychological stress, offer genetic risk assessment when appropriate, and manage long-term effects of cancer treatment.
