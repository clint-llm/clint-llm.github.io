The use of lumbrical flaps has been described in cases of carpal tunnel syndrome and other median nerve injuries, such as neuromas in continuity.

Another study used intrinsic muscles of the hand as flaps for painful neuromas in continuity. In half of the patients, the authors used lumbrical flaps to cover the injured nerve after neurolysis, with all patients reporting relief of their pain.
