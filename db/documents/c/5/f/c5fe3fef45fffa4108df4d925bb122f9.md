The spleen is susceptible to injury if the trauma involves the lower left chest or the upper left abdomen.

The following are three mechanisms of injury:

- Penetrating trauma, for example, abdominal gunshot wounds occur in 7% to 9% of total penetrating trauma cases

- Blunt trauma, for example, a direct blow to the left upper quadrant

- Indirect trauma, for example, a tear in the splenic capsule during colonoscopy or traction on the splenocolic ligament

The most common cause is a motor vehicle accident, followed by direct trauma and fall.
