As a clinician, it is crucial to work with parents, schools, and caregivers to identify patients with dyslexia early. However, most treatment is provided at school and at home. Early intervention will focus on vocabulary, comprehension, and necessary skills such as phonics. As students progress through their education, the intervention will move to improve understanding of word meanings, improved comprehension, more challenging reading, and strategies to excel.
