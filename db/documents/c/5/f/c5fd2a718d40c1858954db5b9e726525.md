The tooth bud, an aggregation of cells that eventually forms a tooth, is organized into three parts: enamel organ, dental papilla, and dental follicle.

The enamel organ comprises four layers; the inner and outer enamel epithelium, the stratum intermedium, and the stellate reticulum. The enamel is made before a tooth erupts into the mouth by the enamel organ, which contains cells called ameloblasts. These cells die once the tooth erupts, which means that the ability to make enamel is forever lost once eruption occurs.

The dental papilla is a fusion of ectomesenchymal cells, termed odontoblasts, which form dentin, the yellow substance that forms the bulk of the teeth. Dentin consists of calcium, phosphorous, and hydroxyapatite crystals bound together in a hard crystalline substance.

The dental follicle gives rise to three major cell types: cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts. Cementoblasts form the cementum (calcified material covering teeth roots), osteoblasts give rise to the alveolar bone around the roots of the teeth, and fibroblasts develop the periodontal ligaments which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through the cementum.
