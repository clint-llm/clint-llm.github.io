Patient education on salivary tumors can be challenging due to the heterogeneous array of histologies and the need for multidisciplinary and multimodal management. Patients and their families should be educated on the different treatment options and timeline, including surgical resection, radiation therapy if indicated, and long-term follow-up for recurrence. Patients and parents should be counseled on the possible risks and complications of all treatment modalities and their comorbidities fully assessed by their primary care physicians to determine if they will be candidates for surgical resection. Long-term follow-up is crucial for benign salivary tumors and must be emphasized to patients, given the risk of recurrence and malignant transformation of certain histologies.
