Physicians and nurse practitioners need to investigate the cause of anemia in patients with cancer. There have been reports of patients been misdiagnosed owing to their different presenting signs and symptoms.  Khan MH et al. reported a case of a 57-year-old female with stage four lobular breast carcinoma who was initially misdiagnosed as having thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

The management of all anemias, including myelophthisic anemia, requires the coordination of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and oncologic pharmacists. This approach guarantees proper diagnosis and optimal care leading to the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
