The prognosis of elevated hemidiaphragm depends on the severity and cause of elevated hemidiaphragm. If etiology is related to subdiaphragmatic organ pathology, surgical removal or repair can resolve the elevated hemidiaphragm.  A patient with traumatic injury to the phrenic nerve will often have a better prognosis than those with bilateral diaphragm weakness caused by neuromuscular diseases. The most common cause of mortality in patients with neuromuscular disorders such as ALS, MS, or myasthenia gravis is respiratory failure secondary to diaphragm paralysis.
