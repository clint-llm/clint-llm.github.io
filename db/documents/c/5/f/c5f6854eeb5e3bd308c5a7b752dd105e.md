Contraindications to circumcisions include an unhealthy infant, anatomic pathology, and bleeding disorders. The general health of the infant should be assessed before the procedure. In most cases, circumcision is an elective procedure and can be delayed. The procedure should be postponed if the infant is found to have electrolyte or metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypoglycemia), a bacterial infection, has yet to urinate, or to has a hypoxic cardiac disorder. The penis should be evaluated for anatomical anomalies such as micropenis, concealed penis, swelling of the foreskin, and hypospadias. Any infant with a bleeding disorder or a strong family history of bleeding disorders should only undergo the circumcision at a healthcare facility with the proper subspecialist.
