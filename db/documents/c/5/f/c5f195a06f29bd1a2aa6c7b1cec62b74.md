Brainstem surgery remains challenging but can be a useful treatment strategy for lesions such as brainstem gliomas. Aiding the surgical approach is intraoperative monitoring of auditory, motor, and somatosensory evoked potentials as well as cranial nerve mapping. These features aid in determining the safest entry area for surgery. For lesions in the tegmentum of the pons near the raphe nuclei, an infratentorial supracerebellar approach provides good access with minimal disruption to surrounding structures such as the raphe nuclei.

In recent studies, electrical stimulation of the raphe magnus increased myelination and reduced symptoms in a multiple sclerosis model mouse. In the future, surgeons may implant deep brain stimulators in the raphe nuclei to treat disease states such as multiple sclerosis.
