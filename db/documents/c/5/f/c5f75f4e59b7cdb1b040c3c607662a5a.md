Symptom onset is typically abrupt, with a significant variation of symptom presentation dependent on the location and size of the hemorrhage. Some patients with smaller cerebellar hemorrhage remain awake and may complain of headache, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, or ataxia. If the hemorrhage is large, patients may present with an altered level of consciousness or even unresponsiveness. Symptoms may change suddenly, correlating with hematoma expansion. Symptoms may also occur during stressful situations or strenuous activity. A detailed history is critical, noting any of the following: a history of hypertension, coagulopathy including chemically induced, head trauma, known history of an intracranial aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation (AVM), history of malignancy, and use of sympathomimetic drugs (cocaine and amphetamines). Symptom presentation in descending order of frequency include the following:

- Abrupt onset headache

- Nausea and vomiting

- Difficulty with ambulation (truncal ataxia)

- Vertigo and dizziness

- Dysarthria

- Neck pain or nuchal rigidity

- Loss of consciousness or altered mental status

Physical examination is also variable and dependent on hemorrhage location, with some patients awake and others unresponsive. Cerebellar signs may include any combination of the following:

- Limb ataxia

- Dysarthria

- Nystagmus

- Abnormal gaze or facial weakness (cranial nerve palsy ipsilateral to the hematoma)

- Abnormal gait
