Treatment is conservative management with rest and activity modification. Corticosteroid injection has shown significant improvement and is a known next best step if little or no improvement has been made with other conservative treatment.

Anti-inflammatory medications are maybe useful for acute injury and pain relief. Common medications are ibuprofen, naproxen, meloxicam or diclofenac.

When conservative measures are not effective corticosteroid injection under ultrasound guidance can be utilized. Using the ultrasound visualization technique noted in the evaluation process; confirm the diagnosis. The typical injection is a one to one mixture of a corticosteroid and anesthetic (0.5ml to 1ml of steroid, commonly used is triamcinolone 40mg/1ml along with a local anesthetic of choice at 0.5ml to 1ml). A 23 to 25 gauge needle at a length of 1 to 1.5 inch is preferred.

In rare, recalcitrant cases surgical debridement and release is indicated.
