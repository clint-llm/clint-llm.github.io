At the time of this writing, a great deal of educational and investigative literature has been developed using in situ simulation for identifying latent safety threats. Some notable in situ simulation environments have included acute care settings, labor and delivery, pediatric care, and low-frequency high-risk scenarios.

To provide some concrete examples of simulation programs geared to exposing LSTs, the authors of this paper draw on individual experience conducting and gathering information from in situ simulations performed in a high volume urban emergency department. In the process of transitioning towards a formal Trauma designation, multiple in situ trauma simulations took place with interprofessional staff.  Simulations activated all levels of the system to mirror a real event (e.g., the use of the overhead hospital-wide paging system after a pre-hospital notification, formal patient registration into the electronic medical record, and involvement of ancillary services such as radiology to ensure our capacity to expedite diagnostic imaging). Debriefs revealed LSTs in various domains, including protocols, equipment, and organization of the clinical environment. The ultimate result was the implementation of multiple solutions. A few examples included codifying the massive transfusion protocol and adjusting the positioning of equipment within the room to make them more readily available for providers performing emergent resuscitative procedures. There was an enhancement of team dynamics by adding sticker role-identifiers for personal responding to the trauma notification, redesigning the trauma bay floor tiles to designate positions of resuscitation team members, and creating an illustration of team roles posted to the trauma bay wall. Regular inter-disciplinary team training exercises were developed to improve the ability of teams assembled on an ad hoc basis were prepared to perform highly reliable resuscitations. As the literature suggests, we found that frequent and goal-directed in situ simulations in coordination with operational, administrative committee meetings created an effective iterative process to diagnose and address LSTs.
