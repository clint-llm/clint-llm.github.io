If the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion of diphenhydramine, decontamination techniques may be considered. Single-dose activated charcoal may benefit, especially as anticholinergic effects may result in decreased gastrointestinal motility leading to delayed absorption of diphenhydramine. However, the use of charcoal is avoided in patients with altered mental status unless the airway is protected.

There is currently no antidote that specifically works to reverse the effects of diphenhydramine toxicity. The mainstay of therapy for diphenhydramine toxicity is supportive management that addresses the symptomatology of intoxication/overdose. Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) for seizures or convulsions, sodium bicarbonate for ventricular arrhythmia, and VA-ECMO for hemodynamic support can be used for the management of the clinical manifestations of diphenhydramine toxicity. Physostigmine has been used for acetylcholinesterase inhibition, but it is not currently available. There is growing support for the utilization of intravenous lipid emulsion therapy; however, its efficacy in this setting remains controversial. Diphenhydramine is minimally dialyzable, and thus, there is little support for hemodialysis in the management of diphenhydramine toxicity.

In pediatric cases, ingested diphenhydramine dose less than 7.5 mg/kg is safe for home observation. However, patients demonstrating any behavioral changes other than mild drowsiness or mild stimulation should be referred to an emergency department. Pediatric ingestions of diphenhydramine more than 7.5 mg/kgÂ require referral to a healthcare facility.
