The stellate ganglion is a collection of sympathetic nerves found anterior to the neck of the first rib. It may occasionally extend to being anterior to the transverse process of the C7 cervical vertebra. It measures about 2.5 cm x1 cm x 0.5 cm in dimension. As referred to in its name, it is star-shaped ("stellate" meaning star-shaped). However, the shape and size of this ganglion may be variable in the population.

The stellate ganglion lies anterolateral to the longus colli muscle, medial to the scalene muscles, anterior to the transverse process, and the prevertebral fascia. The ganglion is structurally separated from the posterior aspect of the cervical pleura by the suprapleural membrane. It is bounded medially by the trachea, esophagus, and vertebral column.

Concerning the relevant vasculature, the vertebral vessels are anterolateral in location. The carotid artery is anterior to the ganglion. The superior intercostal artery lies laterally, and the costocervical trunk of the subclavian artery branches out near the lower pole of the stellate ganglion.
