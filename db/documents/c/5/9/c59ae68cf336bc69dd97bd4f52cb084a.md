Sertoli cell-only syndrome is most often a multifactorial, idiopathic condition that leads to germ cell aplasia and azoospermia. Like maturation arrest, patients are sexually normal but have significantly impaired spermatogenesis.

- There is an infertility problem as 15% of all couples encounter some degree of infertility, with the male being responsible about 50% of the time.

- In general, small testes associated with azoospermia are highly likely to have poor outcomes.

- Overall, sperm retrieval rates with Sertoli cell-only syndrome or maturation arrest are likely achievable <50% of the time, even with modern assisted reproductive technologies.

- Successful pregnancies are even more uncommon, with an average overall success rate of <25%.

- If no sperm can be retrieved by micro-TESE, then there is no chance.

- Families should also understand thatÂ there is a likelihood of passing on genetic infertility factors, particularly to any male offspring. This has to be considered and discussed.

- Alternatives such as adoption, donor insemination, and donated sperm for ICSI should be carefully considered before patients spend their time, money, and resources on increasingly expensive fertility treatments, which are not generally covered by insurance and have such limited reported overall success rates.
