Creatine kinase activity is one of the oldest markers of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Elevated levels of CK-MB have long been used to diagnose a case of AMI. Although many centers are now going by troponin levels instead of CK-MB, there is a newer, more specific CK-MB method.

Serum CK activity is greatly elevated in all types of muscular dystrophy.

CPK levels also elevate in patients with rhabdomyolysis

Patients on statins such as simvastatin may have an adverse effect of significantly elevated CPK levels, potentially leading to rhabdomyolysis.

Serum CK activity demonstrates an inverse relationship with thyroid activity. About 60% of hypothyroid subjects show an average elevation of CK activity fivefold more than the upper reference limit.

Plasma creatine kinase activity is significantly associated with blood pressure in the general population and is thought to contribute to hypertension by increasing vascular contractility and renal sodium retention.
