Serum gentamicin concentration monitoring is often unnecessary for a brief treatment duration (less than six days) in non-critical patients with suitable renal function. On the other hand, in case of long periods of treatment or high risk for aminoglycoside toxicity (e.g., older age, concomitant use of other nephrotoxins, preexisting renal disease), serum monitoring is well indicated. In traditional dosing, the concentration measurement should occur after the patient has received at least three maintenance doses; trough concentration is measured within 30 minutes before the next dose, and peak concentration after 30 minutes of the end of intravenous infusion (in case of intramuscular injection, 60 minutes after the application). For extended-interval dosing, a single serum concentration obtained between 6 to 14 hours after the first administration is sufficient for assessing and readjusting subsequent doses through a nomogram-based evaluation.

Renal function should be evaluated twice-weekly in patients without previous renal disease through serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Periodic microscopic urinalysis is also vital to detect proteinuria and casts, which may indicate kidney injury. Hearing tests must be considered in patients with a high risk for toxicity or those receiving prolonged therapy. Patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders or undergoing anesthetic procedures should have monitoring due to the risk of neuromuscular blockade.
