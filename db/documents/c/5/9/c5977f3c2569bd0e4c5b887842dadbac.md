Parathyroidectomy is the definitive therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism but may also beÂ necessary in secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Bilateral neck exploration is the standard operation, especially optimal for patients who have multiple gland disease or non-localizing preoperative imaging studies. With improved preoperative localization techniques and intraoperative PTH monitoring, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is widely used in unilateral exploration. Even a four-gland exploration can be performed in a minimally invasive fashion.
