**Importance of the Chain of Custody**

The chain of custody proves the integrity of a piece of evidence.

A record of the chain of evidence must be maintained and established in the court whenever presenting evidence as an exhibit.

Evidence requires conscientious handling to avert tampering. The chain of custody is said to be the sequential documentation or trail that accounts for the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence. The goal is to establish that the evidence is related to the alleged crime, was collected from the scene, and was in its original/unaltered condition rather than having been tampered with or "planted" deceitfully to make someone seem guilty. The chain of custody maintains the integrity of the sample. The traceability of the record of the control, transfer, and analysis of samples indicates the transparency to the procedure.

Maintaining the chain of custody is critical in forensic practice.
