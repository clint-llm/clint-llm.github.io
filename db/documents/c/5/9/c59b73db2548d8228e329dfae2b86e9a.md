Bladder trauma occurs in the setting of motor vehicle collisions (MVC), work-related instances, and violent crimes, but also can be iatrogenic. Two main mechanisms of blunt bladder injury are high energy blow to the lower abdomen while the bladder is distended, which usually results in an IP injury, and trauma causing pelvic fractures, which usually results in an EP bladder injury. As such, bladder trauma commonly occurs with concomitant orthopedic and abdominopelvic visceral injuries. Researchers found traumatic bladder rupture accounts for 1.6% of blunt abdominopelvic trauma cases.
