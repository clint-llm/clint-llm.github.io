No prospective trials have assessed treatment efficacy in patients with calciphylaxis. Evidence of successful interventions predominantly derives from case reports, case series, and retrospective analyses. Lesions are challenging to treat and are often refractory to isolated therapies. Therefore, an interprofessional and multimodal approach should be employed. A calciphylaxis team approach may include input from a nephrologist, dermatologist, dietician, wound surgeon, wound nurse, pain management specialist, palliative care team, and hyperbaric oxygen provider

The outlook for most patients with calciphylaxis is poor. Most patients have a poor quality of life and suffer from excruciating pain, which is often not responsive to conventional analgesics.
