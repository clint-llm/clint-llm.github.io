Major depressive disorder can be managed with various treatment modalities, including pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, interventional, and lifestyle modification. The initial treatment of MDD includes medications or/and psychotherapy. Combination treatment, including both medications and psychotherapy, has been found to be more effective than either of these treatments alone.

**FDA-approved medications for the treatment of MDD are as follows:**All antidepressants are equally effective but differ in side-effect profiles.

- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors****(SSRIs)**include fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. They are usually the first line of treatment and the most widely prescribed antidepressants.

- **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors****(SNRIs)**include venlafaxine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, and milnacipran. They are often used for depressed patients with comorbid pain disorders.

- **Serotonin modulators**are trazodone, vilazodone, and vortioxetine.

- **Atypical antidepressants**include bupropion and mirtazapine. They are often prescribed as monotherapy or as augmenting agents when patients develop sexual side-effects due to SSRIs or SNRIs.

- **Tricyclic antidepressants****(TCAs)**are amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, doxepin, nortriptyline, and desipramine.

- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**available are tranylcypromine, phenelzine, selegiline, and isocarboxazid. MAOIs and TCAs are not commonly used due to the high incidence of side-effects and lethality in overdose.
