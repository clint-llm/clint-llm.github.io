In-hospital mortality of anterior cerebral artery stroke patients can range between 0 and 7.8%. This is lower than the 17.3% found for patients with MCA stroke in one of the studies evaluating patients with ACA stroke. Case series show a favorable prognosis for patients, with up to 68% of patients in one series having a modified Rankin scale score of 2 or less at discharge.

With regards to specific deficits, studies suggest that aphasias from ACA infarcts tend toÂ improve within a short period, in contrast with those resulting from MCA territory lesions. Infarct size has been found to show a poor correlation with functional recovery.

One case of akinetic mutism reversal with L-dopa therapy has been reported.

Generally, patients with major neurological deficits have a high risk of poor outcomes, regardless of whether or not alteplase is administered.
