An interprofessional team of healthcare professionals includes a pediatric neurosurgeon, craniofacial surgeon, plastic surgeon, psychologists, geneticists, and a pediatric intensivist to work together to obtain the best possible outcomes. It is essential to educate parents about diagnosis, prognosis, complications, potential treatment options, and follow-up. It is important to differentiate between patients and individualize the treatment selection concerning age, weight, degree of deformity, and associated symptoms. Every patient is different, and making the proper selection to obtain the best possible outcome is essential. The identification of genetic mutations is necessary for prognosis and parental counseling. Nursing roles include direct patient care, physician-family liaison, and family educator.
