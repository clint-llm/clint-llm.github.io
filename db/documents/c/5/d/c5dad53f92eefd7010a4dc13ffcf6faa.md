Counsel the patient and family regarding stroke that the risk of a stroke can be decreased by appropriately treating diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cardiac diseases, and obesity, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, and staying physically active. Discuss the BE-FAST (balance loss, eyesight, facial droop, arm weakness, slurry speech, time) symptoms awareness on all the media and public education channels and campaigns. Time is of the essence if they notice symptomatic onset.

As mentioned above, the risk of a stroke can be decreased by treating hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, and staying physically active. Time is of the essence. It is essential to seek treatment within 3 to 4.5 hours of the start of symptoms because, during that time, thrombolytic drugs are an option. Even if one does not know when symptoms began, get treatment as soon as possible. After the 4.5-hour window has passed, treatment may include rest, oxygen, intravenous (IV) fluids, and medicines to thin the blood (anticoagulants). Treatment of stroke depends on the duration, severity, and cause of one's symptoms. Medications and diet may be used to address diabetes, high blood pressure, and other risk factors.

Physical, speech, and occupational therapists will assess and work to improve any functions impaired by the stroke. Measures will be taken to prevent short-term and long-term complications, including infection from breathing foreign material into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia), blood clots in the legs, bedsores, and falls. Rarely, surgery may be necessary to remove large blood clots or to open up blocked arteries.
