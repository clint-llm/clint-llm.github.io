Precocious puberty is traditionally defined as the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of eight years in girls and nine years in boys. Peripheral precocious puberty, also known as precocious pseudo puberty, is gonadotropin independent and occurs due to excess production of sex hormones from the gonads, the adrenal glands, or exogenous sources. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of precocious pseudopuberty and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.
