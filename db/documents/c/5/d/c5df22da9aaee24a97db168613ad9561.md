Atypical squamous cells that are related to an underlying SIL are associated with HPV infection. Following the initial acquisition of hrHPV, there is an inflammatory response that resolves after a short time. The chronic cases progress to more severe persistent infection associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic changes. In the presence of hrHPV 16 and 18, the viral genes E6 and E7 are thought to encode viral proteins in the infected squamous cells that promote the degradation of tumor suppressor gene proteins p53 and Rb respectively, resulting in malignant transformation.
