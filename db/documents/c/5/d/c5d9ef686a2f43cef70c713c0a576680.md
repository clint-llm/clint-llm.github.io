Patients should be provided with approved UV protective eyewear. Factors that can lead to inadvertent burning should be discussed with each patient. Obese patients may require a modified treatment protocol, i.e. a lower starting dose, as areas such as the breasts, buttocks, and abdomen are closer to the lamps.
