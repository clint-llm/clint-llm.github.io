Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), according to recent studies, could be caused by an alteration during the development of the semaphorin3d glycoprotein (Sema3d). The latter regulates the excessive formation of cells of the parathyroid gland. If Sema3d is ineffective, it could be an important cause of PHPT development; glycoprotein works by inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Erb-B2 (receptor tyrosine kinase 2 or also known as HER2/neu).

Isolated parathyroid aplasia is caused by a mutation in the Glial cells missing (Drosophila) homolog b (GCM2) gene or by a mutation in the SRY-Box Transcription Factor 3 (SOX3) protein.

DiGeorge syndrome comes from a 22q11 chromosome aberration (chromosome 22q11.2123), from a loss of the Tbox transcription factor gene 1 (TBX1), an alteration of chromosome 10p13 containing the nebulette gene (NEBL) gene.

Hypoparathyroidism comes from an alteration of chromosome 8q12.2 with a lack of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein type 7 (CDH7) gene and the aberration of the gene encoding the semaphorin 3E protein (SEMA3E). Other variations of hypothyroidism concern an anomaly of chromosome 10p14-15, which will cause a haploinsufficiency of the GATA binding protein-3 gene (GATA3); an anomaly of chromosome 1q42â€“43 which contains the gene for the tubulin-specific protein chaperone E (TBCE); an aberration of the family with sequence similarity 111, member A (FAM111A) gene for DNA replication. Mutation of chromosome 11p15.3-p15.1 alters the function of the parathyroid hormone, as well as in the chromosomal area p.S23P and p.S23X. Other causes result from a mutation of mitochondrial development.
