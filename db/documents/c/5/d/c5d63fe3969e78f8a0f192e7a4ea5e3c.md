Tobacco and alcohol are proven carcinogens and can be synergistic causes for the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

The etiology of minor salivary gland malignancies such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA), low-grade papillary adenocarcinoma (LGPA), and acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) remains unknown but is theorized to be due to specific gene mutations with input from advancing age and hormonal influences.

Mucosal melanoma comprises a rare and aggressive form of palatal malignancies. It is thought to arise from melanocytes found in the basal layer of the oral mucosa.

Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is linked to the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The risk factors for developing Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) is multifactorial, including immunosuppression (HIV, congenital immunodeficiency, organ transplant, chemotherapy, and radiation), viral infections (EBV, HTLV-1, Herpes, Hepatitis C), bacterial infections (such as Helicobacter pylori gastritis and Lyme disease), tobacco, animal fat consumption, obesity, hair dyes, ultraviolet radiation, pesticides, occupational toxin exposure, and genetic predisposition for B-cell survival and growth.
