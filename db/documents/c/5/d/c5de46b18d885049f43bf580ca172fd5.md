A high myopia-patient may commonly present to a primary healthcare provider, so the patient must be counseled appropriately about the various treatment options available. The patient should be evaluated completely by an optometrist and efficiently worked up by an ophthalmic technician as the success of the procedure largely depends on the preoperative measurements.

Proper consideration needs to be given to any medical condition the patient may be having and should receive treatment for the same. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family as well as compliance on follow up. Pharmacists can ensure appropriate postoperative dosing of medication. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
