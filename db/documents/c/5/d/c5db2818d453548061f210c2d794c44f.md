The barium swallow test is usually performed by a radiologist. However, the ordering of the test may be done by a nurse practitioner, primary physician gastroenterologist, surgeon, neurologist or speech therapist. The test is primarily used to assess structural characteristics of the entirety of the esophagus. It may be used in the diagnosis of a wide range of pathologies including esophageal motility disorders, strictures, and perforations. It may also be used to characterize more distal issues such as a hiatal hernia or gastric volvulus. It may also be used in some capacity to evaluate swallowing at the pharyngeal level, but that is a function that is often served by a Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (modified barium swallow study).

The barium esophagogram is noninvasive and readily performed, requiring only radiographic still-image capability and contrast medium. As such, it is still a useful exam despite the current wide availability of CT imaging. The use of barium, specifically, barium sulfate, is considered to result in a more sensitive study when compared to those utilizing water-soluble agents such as Gastrografin/diatrizoate.
