The lumbar spine consists of 5 lumbar vertebral bodies. However, there are many anatomical variants; however, identifying a transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction as lumbarization of S1 or sacralization of L5 clinically helps during surgical management. The attachment of the iliolumbar ligament and the size of the vertebral body helps in identifying the L5 vertebral body; the ligament extends from the L5 transverse process to the iliac crest. The spinal cord ends approximately at the level of L1-L2. The group of nerve roots caudal to this forms the cauda equina, which consists of free-floating nerve roots in the central canal as they exit at the corresponding levels in the lumbosacral spine.

The disc spaces are composed of the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosis. The standardized spine nomenclature is based on the recommendations from the American Society for Spine Radiology, American Society for Neuroradiology, and North American Spine Society. In 2014, Lumbar Disc Nomenclature: version 2.0 was released, updating the original version from 2001.
