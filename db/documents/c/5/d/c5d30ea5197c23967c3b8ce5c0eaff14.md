- Mild discomfort, tenderness, or bruising at the site of study is most common.

- Infection at the site of needle insertion has rarely been reported.

- Serious bleeding and hematoma are very rarely reported. However, in anticoagulated patients, coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT) are recommended.

- Complications during pregnancy have not been reported in electrodiagnostic studies.

- There are no known reported cases of neural injury directly due to EMG/NCS.

- Pneumothorax is the most serious complication of truncal muscle EMG but is very rarely reported.

- Implanted deep brain stimulators and vagal nerve stimulators produce electrical activity that renders EMG studies useless. Prior planning with primary providers is necessary in order to have these devices turned off during EMG.
