Wallenberg syndrome is a stroke of the brainstem due to obstruction of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. In most cases, it is due to vertebral artery occlusion. Nucleus solitarius is affected in Wallenberg syndrome, leading to altered taste sensation and a decrease in the intensity of the reflexes mediated by the nucleus solitarius, forming the pathophysiology of vomiting in the syndrome.

The brainstem is the main site triggering vomiting response, in particular, the central pattern generator, the nucleus solitarius, and the area postrema. The nucleus solitarius is part of the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Since it is outside of the blood-brain barrier, it is accessible to the emetic stimuli found in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. It receives parasympathetic and sympathetic stimuli for the vomiting response via various receptors:

- Muscarinic (M1) receptors, which are the basis for using scopolamine (M1 receptor antagonist) used to prevent motion sickness

- Neurokinin receptors (NK1) that led to the discovery of new antiemetics like aprepitant

- Histamine receptors (H1) which is why the antihistamine diphenhydramine is useful for motion sickness)

- Serotonin receptor 5-HT3 which are targeted by antiemetics like ondansetron

- Dopamine (D2 receptors) which are targeted by antagonist drugs, categorized into three groups:

- Phenothiazines like prochlorperazine.
- Butyrophenones like droperidol.
- Benzamides like metoclopramide.

The nucleus solitarius sends its afferents to the central pattern generator-formerly known as the vomiting center.
