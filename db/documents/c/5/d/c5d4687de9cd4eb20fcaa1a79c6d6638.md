A thorough history can help to parse through several possible etiologies of back pain. Patients with Bertolotti syndrome complain of back pain, which may be nonspecific, though other etiologies for pain may confound this. The patient must be specifically probed to determine whether they may be otherwise or adjunctively suffering from concomitant discogenic back pain, facet pain, sacroiliac pain, or radicular pain.

A full spine exam should be performed in patients suspected of having Bertolotti syndrome to rule out other syndromes such as lumbar spondylosis, degenerative disc disease, lumbar radiculopathy, and neurogenic claudication.  Physical examination may reveal nonspecific tenderness or may also be focally tender to touch. They may also demonstrate a decreased range of motion in the office as well. Provocative maneuvers, reflexes, sensation, and muscle strength should be comprehensively evaluated to rule out other neurological causes of pain.
