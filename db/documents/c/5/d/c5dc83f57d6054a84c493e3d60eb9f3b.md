In the United States, lung cancers comprise about 14 percent of all new cancers, and lung cancer is the number one cancer killer in both men and women. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80 to 90 percent of all lung cancers. Trials are now comparing surgery versus radiation therapy for early lung cancer.
This activity reviews non-small cell lung cancer and it's management and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Distinguish the types of non-small cell lung carcinoma. 
- Describe the presenting features of non-small cell lung carcinoma. 
- Describe the management strategies for non-small cell lung carcinoma. 
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can improve prevention of lung cancer by educating patients about modifiable risk factors and offering strategies to assist in smoking cessation, in turn leading to fewer cases of lung cancer and better patient outcomes.
