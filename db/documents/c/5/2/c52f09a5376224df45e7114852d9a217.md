Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia involving dream enactmentÂ behavior associated with loss of atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These symptoms may bring serious harm to the individual themselves and their sleeping partners. RBD has been associated with antidepressant use as well as narcolepsy. The strongest correlation exists between RBD and comorbid neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies (i.e., Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy). Symptoms of RBD may precede neurodegenerative disorders by decades; therefore, a careful history is significant in assessing these patients.
