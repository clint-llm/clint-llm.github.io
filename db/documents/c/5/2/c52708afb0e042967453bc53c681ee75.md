The epidural space is identified in the standard fashion using loss-of-resistance to air or saline. In particularly difficult instances the use of C-arm radiography or ultrasound guidance may be used. Once the placement of the needle tip of the 17-gauge epidural needle is confirmed, approximately 20 mL of autologous blood is drawn from the patient in a sterile fashion. The blood is injected slowly (30 to 60 seconds) to create a blood patch. The introduction of blood into the epidural space may produce discomfort and cramping occasionally limiting the volume of injected blood. Smaller injected volumes will often work in creating a blood patch. Reports have indicated successful EBP for PDPH with as little as 5 mL of autologous blood (range 5 to 25 mL); however, most practitioners will use approximately 20 mL if possible.
