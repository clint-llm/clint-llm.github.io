Pediatric facial soft tissue trauma is common, and mild cases are often handled at home or by a general pediatrician or family medicine provider. However, more complex trauma, especially if lacerations or additional bodily sites of injury are involved, is typically managed in and discharged from an emergency department or urgent care. The team consists of the emergency department provider and nurses. If available, a child specialist, additional specialist consultants, as well as social workers may be involved depending on the injury type. Facial injuries are rarely dangerous, but a cohesive team approach is necessary to ensure that no subtle lesions indicative of more severe injuries are missed. So that preventable sequelae such as infections are avoided.

Much of the data presented above is derived from small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or extensive cohort studies [Oxford CEBM Level of Evidence: Level 2-3]
