Fluid (blood/saline) in the angiographic catheter must be purged to prevent vessel dissection from explosive delivery of fluid during CO2 angiography. One technique, the "stopcock and waste syringe technique," is as follows:

- A 3-way stopcock is applied such that one end is connected to the CO2 source, one end is connected to a waste syringe, and one end is connected to the catheter.

- The stopcock is turned off to CO2 to allow blood to flow retrograde from the patient into the waste syringe.

- The stopcock is closed to the waste syringe.

- CO2 is injected slowly until it completely fills the catheter, at which time there is usually a palpable sensation of decreased resistance to injection.

If the injection is performed by hand power, then using a larger syringe (20-30 cc) is less likely to result in CO2 compression in the syringe followed by explosive delivery into the artery or organ than using a 10 cc syringe as more typically used for hand injecting liquid contrast.

An end-hole catheter for CO2 injection yields the best results, even in the aorta, IVC, and pulmonary arteries where pigtail catheters are traditionally used performing flush arteriograms with liquid contrast.
