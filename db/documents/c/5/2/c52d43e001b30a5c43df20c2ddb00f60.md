**Parathyroid Gland**

Currently, there is no specific guidance with regards to the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN4. Indication for surgery (parathyroidectomy) remains similar to the MEN1 guidelines.

**Pituitary Gland**

Management of pituitary adenoma in MEN4 is similar to that of non-MEN4 pituitary tumors. Transsphenoidal surgery is undertaken if the pituitary tumor is functional or causing a visual field defect. Medical treatment includes somatostatin receptor analogs (octreotide or lanreotide) for acromegaly and dopamine agonists (cabergoline or bromocriptine) prolactinomas. Radiotherapy can be considered if the pituitary tumor has aggressive features on radiological or histological examination.

**Neuroendocrine Gastropancreatic Tumors**

The management approach for nonfunctional or functional neuroendocrine gastropancreatic tumors is similar to MEN1. These tumors can cause peptic ulceration due to excess secretion of gastric acid. The clinical syndrome is known as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Surgical resection may be curative if the tumor is fully excised and nonmetastatic. Medical treatment includes proton-pump inhibitors and somatostatin analogs. Currently, there are no reported cases of insulinoma, VIPoma, glucagonoma, or ectopic ACTH secreting neuroendocrine tumors in MEN4.

**Others**

The management approach for other clinical manifestations (adrenal tumor, thyroid, testicular cancer, carcinoid, meningioma, colon cancer) is based on the organ affected. There is no specific guidance due to the paucity of literature.
