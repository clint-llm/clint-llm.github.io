The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) in 1999 released a guideline focusing on the prevention of stress ulcer in medical, surgical, respiratory, and pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Since then, and in recent years, the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis in a non-ICU setting, particularly in the general medical setting, have increased despite little to no evidence supporting its use. The use of acid-suppressive therapy (AST) is overused in hospital patients, with as many asÂ 71% of patient's receiving treatment without an appropriate indication in the general medicine ward. Furthermore, a significant number of patients continue on acid-suppressive therapy when discharged from the hospital which can lead to increased medical cost and the risk of adverse drug reactions for patients. Health care professionals play an important role in enhancing patient's safety by minimizing the inappropriate use of AST. Physicians should carefully consider the need for AST in patients in the general medicine ward and pharmacist can communicate with physicians and ask about the unnecessary use of acid-suppressive therapy. Education about the proper use of acid-suppressive therapy in ICU settings per ASHP recommendations will help reduce its inappropriate use significantly.
