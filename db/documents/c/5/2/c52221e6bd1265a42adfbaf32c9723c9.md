In almost all affected individuals, the earliest manifestation is a weak or hoarse cry in early life due to hyaline-like deposits on the vocal cords.

Cutaneous abnormalities also present early in the disease course, usually beginning with vesicles or bullae and hemorrhagic crusts on sites of friction or trauma, most notably the face and around the mouth.

Other notable features of LP reflect the infiltrating hyaline-like material throughout the mouth and upper aerodigestive tract. Cobblestone appearance of the oral mucosa, yellow lip nodules, lip eversion, and vegetative lesions and fissures at the lateral commissures can be seen in patients with extensive disease.

As a result of deposits obstructing Stenson’s duct and secondary xerostomia, patients with LP are prone to frequent upper respiratory tract infections, recurrent parotitis, and dental caries. The submandibular gland can become similarly obstructed and inflamed.

Neurologic manifestations of LP can be severe, including epilepsy, dystonia, progressive neuropsychiatric disorders (memory loss and other cognitive impairment, behavioral changes, hallucination, schizophreniform illness), and spontaneous central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage.

Bilateral, symmetric comma-shaped calcification of the amygdala is a pathognomonic radiologic finding. Calcification has also been reported in the hippocampus, basal ganglia, parahippocampal gyrus, uncinate gyrus, striatum, pineal gland, and perirhinal and parietal cortices.

One study of 10 patients with LP radiographically identified six with amygdaloid complex calcification and degeneration and three with decreased perfusion to the medial temporal lobe, suspicious for underlying calcification. Though these nine patients did not differ from healthy controls for cognitive tasks (memory, attention, executive function), they differed from recognizing facial expression, emotional processing, and odor-associative learning and recognition.

Focal seizures were the most common subtype, as demonstrated by video electroencephalography. Patients with certain mutations tended to be resistant to anti-epileptic therapy while others attained seizure-control with levetiracetam and clobazam.

Finally, there have been rare reports of hyaline-like deposits throughout the digestive tract, some of which regressed with time.
