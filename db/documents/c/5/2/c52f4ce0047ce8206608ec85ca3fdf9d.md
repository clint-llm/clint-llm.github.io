The treatment of this common condition can be tailored according to the patient's underlying cause, and monitoring of treatment plays a crucial role in a successful response. After identifying the term, it should ideally be treated early, preferably no later than age 6 years.

By a slight difference over desmopressin, the most effective therapeutic modality is the alarm system.

Pharmacologic therapy is used to help treat the disorder while awaiting natural resolution rather than as a curative measure.

The initial choice is desmopressin acetate,

Also, combining the desmopressin and alarm system can lead to response rates close to 100%.

Anticholinergic agents are suggested as an add-on therapy to non-responders to desmopressin.

Furthermore, imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is another pharmacological option that should be reserved for older non-responders to first and second-line treatments. Its mechanism of action has been proposed to involve a central effect at the brainstem level promoting arousal and inhibiting urination, a weak anticholinergic and detrusor antispasmodic effect, increasing ADH release, and suppressing REM sleep.
