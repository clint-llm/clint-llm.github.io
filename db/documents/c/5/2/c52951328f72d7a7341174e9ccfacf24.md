Histologically, the thick inflammatory meningeal exudate is granulomatous, with epithelioid macrophages, Langhans' giant cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, along with fibroblasts. Tuberculomas are bigger encapsulated epithelioid granulomas with similar pleocytosis arranged in layers but a necrotic caseous center, which does not contain pus. A tuberculous abscess has a thick wall with a liquefied pus core containing viable MTB bacilli.
