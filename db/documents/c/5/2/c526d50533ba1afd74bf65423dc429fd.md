Transgender patients often require multidisciplinary care that includes behavioral health, endocrinology, and various surgical specialties. Surgical interventions are typically focused on the chest, genital, and facial areas. Head and neck surgery for gender affirmation can consist of multiple procedures performed by different surgical subspecialists in the same patient, more commonly in patients transitioning from male to female. This activity reviews the evaluation of transgender patients and the technical aspects of facial feminization by highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with gender dysphoria.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the differences between male and female facial features.
- Describe the healthcare and social disparities often experienced by transgender patients.
- Outline the surgical options available for facial feminization.
