Evaluation of the maternal patient must be done efficiently to determine the timing of loss of circulation. A vital part of the evaluation includes monitoring vital signs.  If time and resuscitative efforts permit, then fetal tocometry should be initiated rapidly. Early on, obstetrics should be advised and prepared. The procedure must be initiated no more than 4 minutes from loss of pulse for a maximum beneficial outcome.
