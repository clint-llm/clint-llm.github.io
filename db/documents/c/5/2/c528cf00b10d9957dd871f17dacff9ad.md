Interprofessional care is fundamental to the treatment of patients with elbow dislocation. If an elbow dislocation occurs on the field of a sporting event, a member of the healthcare team may be able to reduce it immediately.

Plain radiographs of the elbow are needed to understand the direction of the dislocation, including anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views.

Closed reduction is often the initial management, and likely to occur in the emergency department (ED).

A quality improvement study from Boston Children's Hospital looked at ways to reduce this, including meetings involving clinical assistants, emergency department physicians, orthopedic physicians, and nurses. They initiated new strategies, roles, and checklists to attempt to improve efficiency. They found a 5.8% decrease in length of stay in patients requiring sedation for long bone fracture reduction; this also allowed the engagement of interprofessional personnel to help increase efficiency together.
