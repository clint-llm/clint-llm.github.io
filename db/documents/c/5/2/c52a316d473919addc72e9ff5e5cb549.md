Diagnosis of KS is typically made by prenatal or postnatal karyotype or chromosomal microarray. Non-invasive prenatal testing for cell-free DNA can identify sex chromosome abnormalities. Published positive predictive values in the detection of KS via NIPT are 67%. Additional prenatal testing or postnatal testing is suggested to confirm any suspected case.

The initial evaluation of KS may include a workup for hypogonadism or infertility. In KS, gonadotropins are usually elevated when testicular hyalinization and fibrosis are present, though this may evolve over adolescence. The finding of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism indicates primary gonadal failure. FSH elevation typically predominates over LH, though both are elevated above normal. Testosterone concentrations are usually low or low-normal in both adolescents and adults. A minority of children may demonstrate low inhibin B and elevated AMH, reflecting abnormal Sertoli cell function. Still, it is unclear whether identifying these differences is predictive of future gonadal failure.
