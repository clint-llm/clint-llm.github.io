Helicobacter pylori are one of the most common chronic infections, with an estimated 50% of the world’s population having been infected or previously infected by the bacteria. H. pylori are present in up to 90% of patients with gastric MALT Lymphoma. Untreated H. pylori lead to chronic inflammation and proliferation of T-cells and B-cells in the gastric mucosa. Gastric mucosa does not typically have lymphoid tissue but can develop mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue in response to longstanding inflammation. This aberrant tissue can lead to malignant transformation, commonly known as gastric MALT lymphoma. In most cases, the lymphoid tissue resolves with the eradication of H. pylori. Cases refractory to H. pylori eradication are more likely to contain a genetic mutation; the highest prevalence seen with t(11;18) (q21;q21).
