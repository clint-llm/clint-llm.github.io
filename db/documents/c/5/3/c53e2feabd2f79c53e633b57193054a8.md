Clinicians need to educate their patients about the use of vasodilators. As described above, many adverse side effects exist with vasodilator treatment. It is the healthcare provider's responsibility to make sure the patient understands the importance of taking their vasodilator medication as prescribed. Undertreatment and/or non-compliance can cause severe hypertension, and this can lead to catastrophic events such as stroke, hypertensive emergency, aortic dissection, and many other preventable diseases. Also, it is crucial to educate patients regarding healthy lifestyle habits and dietary modifications. Regular exercise, a healthy and well-balanced diet, and healthy lifestyle habits (such as avoidance of smoking, excessive drinking, or using recreational drugs) can all help a patient's longevity. Nursing will often administer these drugs and need to be familiar with monitoring treatment progress as well as checking on adverse events, reporting any concerns to the clinician. Pharmacists, particularly board-certified cardiology pharmacists, can assist the clinician in agent selection as well as dosing, medication reconciliation, and patient education. These types of interprofessional team actions will improve outcomes with vasodilator therapy. [Level 5]
