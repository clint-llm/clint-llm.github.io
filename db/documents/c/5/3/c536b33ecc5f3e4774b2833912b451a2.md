The adrenal gland is made up of the cortex and medulla. The cortex produces steroid hormones including glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens, and the medulla produces the catecholamines, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. This brief article reviews the physiology of the adrenal gland and highlights the relevance of understanding the clinical syndromes of excess and deficiency.
