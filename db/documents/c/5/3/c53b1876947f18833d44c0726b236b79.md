More than 95% of cases of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis are sporadic.

Intrauterine deformational forces include a fetus's odd position, irregular uterus shape, compression of the fetus' head when descends into the pelvis, or due to multiple fetus pregnancy. Postnatal deformational forces most commonly occur due to prolonged position of the head for long periods. The etiology of craniosynostosis can be multifactorial due to intrinsic bone abnormalities, genetic mutations, and environmental factors.

The incidence of deformational plagiocephaly increased after the "Back to Sleep" campaign started in 1992, which promoted a supine position to prevent sleep-related infant deaths; however, the incidence of sudden infant death syndrome has decreased.
