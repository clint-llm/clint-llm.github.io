Wernicke area receivesÂ its vascular supply from the inferior temporal branch of the middle cerebral artery. The temporal lobe drains blood via 2 primary routes.

The first involves the anterior drainage of the temporal lobe via the superficial middle cerebral vein. As it is drained, it progresses toward the vein of Labbe which eventually empties into the transverse sinus.

The second route involves drainage of the inferior temporal love into the posterior choroidal vein. From there, it moves posteriorly behind the interventricular foramen to join with the thalamostriate vein and form the internal cerebral vein. The internal cerebral vein then joins the basal veins to form the great cerebral vein.
