Individuals who display the characteristic features of BPES can undergo gene-targeted testing to detect mutations in the FOXL2 gene of chromosome three. If no variant is detected, comprehensive genomic testing can be pursued to detect deletions or duplications in the FOXL2 region. In some cases, cytogenetic testing is completed to further evaluate for balanced translocations or other interruptions of the FOXL2 region.

Female individuals with BPES type I develop primary ovarian insufficiency—manifesting as pubertal delay, primary amenorrhea, secondary amenorrhea, or oligomenorrhea. Endocrinologic laboratory testing can aid in diagnosis. Follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone, will be elevated. The serum concentration of estrogen and progesterone will be depressed. Transvaginal ultrasound with antral follicular count can determine ovarian reserve and aid discussions regarding poor fertility.
