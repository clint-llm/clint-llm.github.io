The primary objective in treating lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) is to minimize the mechanical stress exerted on the lid wiper region during blinking. Since LWE primarily stems from mechanical inflammation, reducing friction on the ocular surface becomes crucial. Treatment strategies focus on measures to achieve this goal.

Key treatment modalities include the application of warm compresses, lid scrubs, artificial tears, topical corticosteroids, and bandage contact lenses. These interventions help alleviate symptoms and promote healing by mitigating ocular surface friction. Additionally, addressing any associated ocular surface diseases, such as dry eye, meibomian gland dysfunction, and allergic conjunctivitis, is essential due to their frequent coexistence with LWE.

Furthermore, it is essential to co-manage any underlying systemic conditions that contribute to ocular surface diseases, such as Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. A comprehensive approach encompassing the treatment of local ocular surface conditions and systemic factors is critical for achieving therapeutic success in LWE.

When conservative measures such as regular lid hygiene and palliative treatments do not reduce lid friction on the ocular surface, alternative treatment options can be considered. These approaches aim to alleviate symptoms and reduce inflammation associated with tear film abnormalities.

One approach involves punctal occlusion, which consists of blocking tear drainage channels to enhance tear retention on the ocular surface. This technique helps maintain a more stable tear film and reduces friction between the lid and the ocular surface. In addition, medications that target tear film inflammation can be employed. Topical steroids such as loteprednol, fluorometholone, prednisolone, and dexamethasone can be used to reduce inflammation within the tear film. Topical immunomodulators such as cyclosporine and lifitegrast can also be beneficial in managing tear film-related inflammation. Furthermore, oral antibiotics with antiinflammatory properties, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, can be utilized as adjunctive therapy. These medications help alleviate inflammation and modulate the ocular surface microenvironment, improving symptoms and managing lid wiper epitheliopathy.

Procedure-based treatments can provide effective interventions specifically targeting lid margin pathology in cases of lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), particularly when there is evident lid margin staining (referred to as the "Line of Marx") on lissamine green or rose bengal staining.

Microblepharoexfoliation is a procedure that utilizes an electronic rotary sponge soaked in an antimicrobial foaming cleanser. This technique enables mechanical exfoliation of the lash follicle base and the lid margin itself, directly addressing the underlying pathology in the lid wiper region of LWE. This approach focuses on anterior blepharitis and LWE. Other procedure-based treatments, such as thermal pulsation and intense pulsed light, are more specifically designed for posterior blepharitis, particularly in cases of meibomian gland dysfunction. While these treatments may benefit some aspects of LWE, microblepharoexfoliation is better suited for directly addressing anterior blepharitis and LWE pathology.

It is important to note that all procedure outcomes are never curative. The time between treatments depends on various factors, including comorbid ocular surface disease and systemic conditions and patient compliance with home maintenance of warm compresses, lid scrubs, lubrication, and medications. Furthermore, discontinuation of contact lens use has not been shown to result in the resolution of clinical signs.
