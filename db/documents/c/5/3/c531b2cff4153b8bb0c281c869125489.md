Worldwide, the highest incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases are seen in Northern Europe and North America. Inflammatory bowel disease is closely linked to a westernized environment and lifestyle. Ulcerative colitis has an incidence of 9 to 20 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Its prevalence is 156 to 291 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Compared to Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis has a greater prevalence in adults. When considering the pediatric population; however, ulcerative colitis is less prevalent than Crohn disease.

Ulcerative colitis has a bimodal pattern of incidence. The main onset peaks between the age of 15 and 30 years. A second, and the smaller peak of incidence occurs between the age of 50 and 70 years. Though some studies show a slight predilection for men, most studies note no preference regarding sex. There is an increased prevalence of ulcerative colitis in nonsmokers or those who recently quit smoking. Additionally, smokers diagnosed with ulcerative colitis tend to have milder disease, fewer hospitalizations, and need for less medication. There is evidence, though weak, that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with the onset or relapse of ulcerative colitis.

There is also an association of inflammatory bowel disease with the removal of an inflamed appendix. Appendectomy before the age of twenty is associated with a decreased incidence of ulcerative colitis; whereas the opposite is true for Crohn disease. In fact, appendectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of developing ulcerative colitis by 69%.
