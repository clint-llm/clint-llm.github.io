Some significant issues when it comes to weight-bearing are obesity, limited mobility due to disease, or bearing weight too early following a fracture or orthopedic surgery. When circumstances limit the ability to ambulate and bear weight, the risk of obtaining osteoarthritis or osteoporosis increases. Mechanical loading with weight-bearing activities have been shown to inhibit bone loss and may reduce arthritis-mediated bone loss.
