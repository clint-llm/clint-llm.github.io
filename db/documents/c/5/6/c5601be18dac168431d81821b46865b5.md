The slit lamp is a biomicroscope. It emits a beam of light that can be varied in height and width. It allows visualization of the anterior segment of the eye. With auxiliary lenses, the examiner can also view the posterior segment. These lenses are simple, affordable, and portable. Although high-end devices like fundus cameras and optical coherence tomography have revolutionized how practitioners detect eye diseases, they can never replace these handheld lenses. This article discusses the different types of diagnostic and therapeutic slit lamp lenses. The indications of these lenses and the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients are discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different auxiliary lenses for slit lamp evaluation of the retina.
- Explain the typical features of each lens.
- Review the magnification and special indications of various lenses available for slit lamp evaluation of the retina.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve the outcome of patients.
