Although the diagnosis of a snake bite is clinical, and there is no diagnostic test to diagnose or identify the species causing the envenomation, laboratory bloodwork is helpful to guide management. Bloodwork should be performed for all snake bites and should include:

- CBC

- Serum Chemistry

- Coagulation Panel

- Fibrinogen

- Creatine Kinase

A urinalysis can be helpful to evaluate for myoglobinuria, which can help assess for rhabdomyolysis if a creatine kinase value is not readily available. While an x-ray of the bite wound is not necessary, it may be prudent if there is a suspicion of a foreign body or a fracture that may have occurred while escaping the snake. Upon initial evaluation, the leading edge of the swelling and redness surrounding the bite site should be marked. Limbs should be evaluated for neurovascular status. Frequent reassessments for progressive swelling should be performed.

Grading the envenomation can help with the decision to administer antivenin.

**Minimal Envenomation (no antivenin indicated)**

- Swelling, pain, and ecchymosis limited to the site of the bite

- No systemic signs

- Normal coagulation parameters or isolate mild alterations without clinically relevant bleeding

**Moderate Envenomation**

- Swelling, pain, and ecchymosis involving less than full extremity or extending < 50 cm in adults

- Systemic symptoms present, such as vomiting, mild hypotension, mild tachycardia

- Abnormal coagulation parameters without clinically relevant bleeding

**Severe Envenomation**

- Swelling, pain, and ecchymosis involving an entire extremity (or more) or threatening airway

- Systemic signs including altered mental status and hemodynamic instability

- Abnormal coagulation parameters with clinically relevant bleeding
