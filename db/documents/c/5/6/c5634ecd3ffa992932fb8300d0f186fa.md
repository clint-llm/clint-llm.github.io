Evaluation and treatment of HPV infection vary by body site and disease manifestation. For a more in-depth examination of each disease entity, please visit those specific topics.

**History**

- Cutaneous warts (verruca vulgaris, verruca plantaris): Ask about potential infectious contacts and hygiene habits (e.g., "Do you wear shower shoes when showering at the gym?" or "Are the lesions painful and/or prone to bleeding?")

- Anogenital warts (condyloma acuminatum): Providers should ask about:

- Sexual history/infectious contacts

- Duration and location of the wart(s)

- Prior vaccination for HPV (Gardasil, Cervarix)

- History of wart removal/treatment

- History of diseases or medications that may cause them to be immunocompromised.

- Pap smears (cervical for females, anal Pap smear for males), HPV testing, and sexually transmitted infections.

- Cervical dysplasia (squamous and glandular): Providers should ask about:

- Menses/prior Pap smears/HPV testing,

- Sexually transmitted infections/sexual history/infectious contacts,

- Prior vaccination for HPV (Gardasil, Cervarix), and

- Associated symptoms, such as bleeding/spotting outside of menses, pelvic or genital pain, pain/bleeding during intercourse, and/or palpable lesions felt on the cervix.

**Physical examination**

- Cutaneous warts (verruca vulgaris, verruca plantaris): Examine hands and feet thoroughly, including between digits and the underside of the toes.

- Anogenital warts (condyloma acuminatum): Examine the anogenital region. Patients may additionally require a speculum examination of the vaginal walls and/or anus. Men may require an examination of the urethra, depending on signs and symptoms. Depending on the history of sexual practices, an oropharyngeal examination may be prudent.

- Cervical dysplasia (squamous and glandular): Perform a speculum examination of the cervix. Depending on the patient’s age and Pap smear history, an initial or repeat Pap smear may be warranted.
