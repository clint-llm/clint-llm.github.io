Patients are having tufted hair folliculitis note pain, itching, and/or swelling of the scalp with slowly progressive hair loss. Perifollicular crusting and scaling are also frequently reported. The process usually starts in a specific portion of the scalp which enlarges gradually.

The predominant clinical finding in tufted hair folliculitis is clusters of anagen hairs emerging from the scalp, and having a pattern of "doll's hair." Circumscribed areas of scarring alopecia containing no hair follicles alternate and are mixed with the tufts of hair. Parietal and occipital areas are involved with predilection in tufted hair folliculitis, but the entire scalp may be affected. The beard is rarely involved. Though pustules are not present, it may be possible to express purulent exudate from the dilated follicular openings. Depending on the duration of the condition and the underlying cause of the tufting, there may be erythema, edema, tenderness, and/or bogginess of the scalp. A case of tufted hair folliculitis having a linear pattern has been reported.
