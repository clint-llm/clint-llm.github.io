The Morel-Lavallee lesion results in the development of a cavity in the pre-fascial plane, which occurs due to the generation of shearing effect in between underlying fascial layers and superficial subcutaneous tissues.

These avulsed channels lead to the leakage of blood and lymph into this cavity and result in the collection of a hemolymphatic fluid, and its rate of formation depends on the flow into the cavity and the number of vessels disrupted. With time, the blood components within the cavity start reabsorbing, and hence only the serosanguinous fluid remains in the cavity surrounded by a haemosiderin layer. This haemosiderin layer induces a cascade of inflammation in the surrounding peripheral tissues and results in the formation of a fibrous capsule which prevents the further reabsorption of fluid and leads to the development of a chronic Morel-Lavallee lesion.
