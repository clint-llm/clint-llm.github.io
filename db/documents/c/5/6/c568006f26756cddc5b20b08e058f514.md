The assessment and care of children with hearing loss are best accomplished through a multi-disciplinary team. They should include an audiologist skilled in the audiometric techniques used in children, an otolaryngologist, and a pediatrician. A geneticist should be consulted in cases where ANSD or a hereditary etiology is suspected, as 50% of cases of ANSD have been shown to have a genetic component.

Additionally, patients with known genetic abnormalities such as sickle cell disease should undergo comprehensive audiometric testing, as these patients are known to have an elevated risk of hearing loss.
