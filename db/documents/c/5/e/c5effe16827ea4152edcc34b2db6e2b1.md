There is a diverse range of renal pathology in PLWHIV, such as lesions resulting directly from intrarenal HIV gene expression and injuries secondary to comorbidities, drug-induced nephrotoxicity, and immune dysregulation, among others. Renal disease associated with HIV infection is primarily a glomerular dominant disease that is further classified into two main categories: podocytopathies and immune complex-mediated disease. The major subtypes of podocytopathy that have been described in the setting of HIV infection are classic HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis not otherwise specified, and the far less common, minimal change disease and diffuse mesangial hypercellularity. These are characterized by extensive podocyte foot process effacement and proteinuria mediated by direct HIV infection of renal epithelial cells, intrarenal viral gene expression, and dysregulation of host genes. Several forms of immune complex-mediated disease have been reported in PLWHIV. The causal relation is not well established yet, and secondary causes should be sought out in cases of post-infectious glomerulonephritis, lupus-like nephritis, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, among others.
