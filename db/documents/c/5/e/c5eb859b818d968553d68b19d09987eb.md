Osmoregulation and the maintenance of body fluid levels are critical to our metabolic activities as organisms. As mentioned earlier, this is the result of ensuring adequate organ perfusion, proper thermoregulation, excretion of toxic waste and electrolyte balance.

On a cellular level, the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid impacts the passage of water in and out of a cell. Isotonic fluids contain the same concentration as the intracellular milieu, whereas hypertonic fluids (higher concentration than inside the cell) lead to cell shrinkage and hypotonic fluids lead to cell swelling (lower concentration than inside the cell). Exaggerated amounts of solute changes result in osmotic stress, which is damaging to cells.
