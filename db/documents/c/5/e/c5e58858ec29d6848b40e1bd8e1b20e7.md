No significant difference in clinical outcomes was observed with screening for testicular cancer in men with a family history of testicular cancer. Routine screening (with ultrasonography) should not be performed in men with no palpable testicular mass. The risk of testicular cancer can be lowered by prepubertal orchiopexy in men with cryptorchidism. In such individuals, aÂ twofold to a sixfold higher risk of developing testicular cancer has been observed in men who undergo orchiopexy after age 12 when compared to orchiopexy before age 12.
