Respiratory control in normal physiologic situations involves incoming messaging from various peripheral receptors: proprioceptors and mechanoreceptors in the musculature, joints of the chest wall; pulmonary stretch receptors; receptors in the airways; and trigeminal skin receptors. These signals combine with the signals from chemoreceptors in the aortic and carotid bodies and are then transmitted centrally to the pons and medulla via the vagus, glossopharyngeal, spinal, and phrenic nerves.

Voluntary input from the motor cortex via the limbic system contributes protective and emotional influences to motor control of breathing. Outgoing messaging travels back to the motor units via the vagus and other nerves and results in adjustments to the depth and rate of respiration.

Generally speaking, the sensation of dyspnea arises from the awareness of a respiratory supply-and-demand mismatch. Such a mismatch can result from the perception of increased demand, decreased capacity, or a combination of both.

There are 2 theories to explain how supply-and-demand imbalances generate the sensation of dyspnea. “Efferent-reafferent dissociation” occurs when the respiratory center sends a motor command in response to the peripheral messages received. In certain states, the respiratory muscles are unable to match the motor demands. As a result, additional feedback from the periphery communicates to the respiratory center this discrepancy between the output command sent and the subsequent inadequate response it generated. The severity of the experience of dyspnea is thought to correlate to the degree of this discrepancy.

The second theory involves central corollary discharges. Copies of the descending motor commands sent from the central respiratory motor centers to the periphery are simultaneously sent to the sensory/perceptual areas of the brain. These corollary discharges, which serve to keep the sensory areas informed of the motor commands and impart a conscious awareness of respiratory effort, are thought to contribute to the sensation of dyspnea as well.

Inputs from the cortical and limbic system, much like other homeostatic stimuli like hunger, thirst, and pain, contribute to the subjective intensity and unpleasantness of the overall experience.

Receptors in the lung parenchyma, when undergoing abnormal stimulation, produce sensations of chest tightness. This perception of chest tightness in bronchoconstriction is stimulated through pulmonary afferents rather than the increased work requirements.

A sense of air hunger from exercise, hypoxia, or hypercapnia can result from chemoreceptor signaling when mismatched with the motor drive. However, signaling of the pulmonary vagal stretch and chest wall receptors can inhibit (and therefore reduce) this sense of air hunger.

Specific pathologic and age-related changes contribute to pulmonary dysfunction and the experience of dyspnea. Respiratory muscles weaken, lung elasticity decreases, lung tissue shrinks, and the chest wall stiffens, all of which can result in impairment of efficient gas exchange.

Anxiety caused by the experience of dyspnea can lead to increased respiratory and heart rate, worsening dyspnea.
