Treatment of patients with pica should utilize an interprofessional team approach. A team consisting of a physician, psychiatrist/psychologist, behavioral therapist, social worker, and dietitian. Patients should be treated inÂ a nonjudgmental manner, with particular attention to their cultural and social background.

Patient education is vital. Failure to educate patients on healthy eating habits is a common reason why pica can be prevalent in some populations. Parents need to be educated about the harms of ingesting nonnutritive substances by their children and the need for limiting such exposure. In some jurisdictions, landlords have to ensure that lead-based painting is removed. A dietary consult may benefit some families. Close follow-up by the nurse practitioner may be required to ensure that the pica behavior is not continuing.

Clinicians should communicate with each other so that the same message is sent to the parent or caregiver.
