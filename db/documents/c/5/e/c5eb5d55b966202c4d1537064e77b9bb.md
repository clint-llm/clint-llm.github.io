Menarche is an indicator of the onset of fertility and reproductive ability, and its absence should signal the provider to evaluate for pathology.

Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the functional layer of the uterine endometrial lining that occurs when ovulation is not followed by fertilization. It occurs approximately every 28 days, ranging from every 21 to 45 days, with a mean cycle interval of 32.2 days in the first gynecologic year. Most menstrual periods last between three and seven days, with menses lasting more than ten days considered abnormal.
