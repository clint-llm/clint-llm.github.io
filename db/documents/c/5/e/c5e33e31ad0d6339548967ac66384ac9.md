Both techniques, the suboccipital puncture, and the cervical C1-C2 puncture should be well known.

On some occasions, one procedure can be used as an alternative to the other.

These procedures, although rarely performed, offer an alternative to obtaining CSF when a lumbar puncture is contraindicated.

The overall rate of adverse reactions with a cervical puncture (4.9%) is slightly higher than that of a lumbar puncture approach (3.4%).

Cervical myelograms performed via lateral C1–C2 puncture produces major complications in less than 0.05%, most commonly associated with cervical spine hyperextension during positioning.

All C1-2 punctures should be monitored with lateral fluoroscopy for accurate needle positioning and prevention of contrast medium injection into the spinal cord.

The frequency of headache after C1–C2 puncture is lower than that after lumbar puncture, and, in most cases, last less than 24 hours. It occurs in approximately 10% to 25% of patients.
