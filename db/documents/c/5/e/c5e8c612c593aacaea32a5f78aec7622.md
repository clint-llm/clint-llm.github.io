Before the hip arthrogram procedure, informed consent is obtained from the parents in this pediatric scenario. Informed consent includes discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure. The specific joint and laterality should be confirmed before the procedure. The patientâ€™s allergies and reactions should be reviewed.

An injection into the hip joint is performed under ultrasound, fluoroscopic, or CT guidance if a patient is undergoing arthrography. Patients commonly undergo direct arthrography performed under fluoroscopy for developmental dysplasia of the hip. The contrast agent used for arthrography is generally physician-directed. The universal agents of choice are low-osmolar nonionic monomer contrast media.

For pediatric patients, a 2 mg/kg dose of contrast is frequently used for contrast-enhanced CT studies.
