GPA is a multisystemic disease that requires an interprofessional team to cover the broad spectrum of organ involvement. Rheumatologists, pulmonologists, otolaryngologists, pathologists, radiologists, pharmacists, cardiologists, and nephrologists play an important role. Good communication amongst the team members is key in management. Nurses play an important role in vital checks and measuring urine output. They also provide immediate care to the patient and monitor them closely during infusions for side effects. Of note, many patients have stated that they see a doctor for every organ, which emphasizes the importance of a collaborative effort.
