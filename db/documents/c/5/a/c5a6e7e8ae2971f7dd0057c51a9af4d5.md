Fractures of the frontal sinus are most commonly seen in the emergency department after motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), falls, assaults, falling objects, and penetrating trauma. Patients can present with obvious lacerations, deformations, and other local trauma, which can markedly impact their facial functioning and reduce their quality of life. Depending on the damage to the local anatomy, surgical intervention by different subspecialists may be necessary to correct any anatomic deficiencies and ameliorate complications. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of frontal sinus fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of frontal sinus fractures.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of frontal sinus fractures.
- Review the treatment and management options available for frontal sinus fractures.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance frontal sinus fractures and improve outcomes.
