There is no definitive way to treat congenitally acquired CMV in utero. For fetuses with positive isolation of the virus, termination of the pregnancy can be offered to parents.  This offer must be accompanied with thorough counseling to enable the parents to make an informed decision.  If the parents opt to continue the pregnancy, close follow up with regular ultrasound exams is essential. The use of CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMV HIG) as a method of prevention, could reduce the number of congenitally infected newborns compared to no treatment.

At birth, the newborn must be tested within 3 weeks of delivery via saliva or urine PCR or culture.  If the diagnosis is confirmed, close follow up should be ensured for symptomatic neonates. Asymptomatic neonates also required to follow up, in particular, regular hearing screens. Pediatric subspecialists that have a role to play in the care of congenitally infected neonates include audiologists, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, development/behavior specialists, infectious disease specialists, and physical/occupational therapists.

Neonates with symptomatic CCMV should receive oral valganciclovir for 6 months. This therapy has been shown to preserve normal hearing or prevent the progression of hearing loss, and also correlates with improved long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
