**Clinal Evaluation and Static Hemodynamic Measures**

Clinical signs, such as hypotension, tachycardia, and dry oral membranes, along with laboratory findings, such as blood urea nitrogen, serum and urine sodium, hematocrit, and blood gas measurements, help to elucidate the underlying etiology of hypovolemia. The simplest and fastest means of evaluating hypovolemia remains arterial blood pressure measuring. Advanced hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac filling pressures, such as CVP, and volumetric preload parameters such as intrathoracic blood volume index, ITBVI have been used to approximate cardiac preload and to appropriately guide fluid resuscitation.

**Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS)**

Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is a safe, non-invasive, and readily available means of estimating volume status. Central venous pressure can be estimated by assessing the inferior vena cava or internal jugular vein diameter and collapsibility. Hypotension has a broad differential diagnosis and poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. POCUS can rapidly assess volume status and measure specific parameters that aid in the diagnosis of the etiology underlying the patient's hypovolemia. Also, POCUS can serve as a measure of response to fluid resuscitation and guide treatment. One way this can be done is by measuring the respiratory variation in the inferior vena cava. However, this has not been validated in patients without spontaneous breaths or arrhythmias and should not be used as the only means of assessing volume status and response to fluid resuscitation.

**Dynamic Hemodynamic Measures**

Dynamic hemodynamic parameters are more precise in determining the etiology of hypovolemia and response to fluid replacement. Using changes in preload and right atrium pressure, arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure, or stroke volume we can calculate the systolic pressure variation, pulse pressure variation, and stroke volume variation. It is important to specify some conditions that may decrease the reliability of these calculations:

- Arrhythmias

- Pulmonary hypertension

- Increased intraabdominal pressure

- Heart failure

- Vasopressors

Of importance is that these indices are of clinical value only if the patient is mechanically ventilated. The mechanism of breathing induced fluctuations in stroke volume and blood pressure are different during spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, which results in inaccurate measurements.
