PCA is a WHO grade I tumor. There are case series of anaplastic PCA, with uncertain behavior.

Microscopic features

PCA gets its name from the microscopic appearance of cells with long, thin bipolar processes that resemble hairs (henceÂ pilocytic).

Though they are radiologically described as well-circumscribed, nearly two-thirds infiltrate the surrounding brain parenchyma.

Microscopically, it can be challenging to differentiate between PCA and low-grade diffuse astrocytoma.

Molecular features

The most common genetic abnormality found in 70% to 75% of PCAs is BRAF gene alterations.
