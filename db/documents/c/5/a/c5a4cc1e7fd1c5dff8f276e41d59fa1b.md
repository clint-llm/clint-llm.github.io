Because Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare X-linked disorder seen in males, its management is best with an interprofessional team approach including consultation with hematology, dermatology, pathology, infectious disease expert, geneticist, nursing staff, and pharmacist. The diagnosis is made by clinical/laboratory findings and genetic testing. Disease treatment is by conventional and supportive care including the use of prophylactic antibiotics and platelet transfusions to stop life-threatening hemorrhages. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is indicated in patients with antibody deficiency. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only curative treatment available.
