In the production of gaze shifts, various oculomotor and neck muscles ultimately receive stimulation by the activity of the superior colliculus. As stated above, the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nuclei all receive projections from the superior colliculus. Thus, the six extraocular muscles innervated by these nerves are all implicated in the motor actions of the superior colliculus. Additionally, the contralateral deep neck muscles are stimulated by the superior colliculus during a gaze shift. These muscles are ipsilateral to the visual field being stimulated and function to turn the head and eyes towards the stimulus.
