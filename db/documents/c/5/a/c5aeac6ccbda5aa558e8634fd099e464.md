Maternal diabetes has several adverse effects on embryogenesis and fetal development and causes multiple congenital anomalies, and secondary medical complications collectively referred to as diabetic embryopathy. A diabetic mother has 2 to 3 times more chances of having a gestation affected with a birth defect than a nondiabetic mother. This activity focuses on the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of diabetic embryopathy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of diabetic embryopathy. 
- Outline the evaluation of patients affected by diabetic embryopathy.
- Review the management options available for diabetic embryopathy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving the care of patients with diabetic embryopathy.
