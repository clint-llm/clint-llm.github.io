Carotid artery dissections occur in all age groups. They account for 2.5% of all strokes.

Carotid artery dissection has been found to occur more during the autumn, with literature noting that peak incidence occurs in October. Since seasonal variation in blood pressure has been previously described, it has been proposed that weather-related factors affect blood pressure, coagulation, blood flow, physical activities, and diet. Air pollution contributes to vascular changes leading to carotid artery dissection. Migraine has been reported as an independent risk factor for dissection.
