Hematuria often occurs as a result of structural alterations due to an injury, infection or a mass. The integrity of the glomerular basement membrane may be damaged by immunological and/or inflammatory processes. Some drugs, calculi, and chemicals may cause erosion of the mucosal surface of the urinary tract, leading to hematuria.
