The retina is the neurosensory part of the eye where light impulses from an object are converted to electoral impulses that travel to the brain, and the person receives the details of the object. The imaging of the retina poses difficulty because the retina must be illuminated and imaged simultaneously through a narrow pathway, i.e., the pupil.

The retina is a minimally reflective surface; hence, the back reflections from the retinal surface are lesser than the combined reflections from the illuminating and imaging systems. The fundus camera uses the principle of reflex-free indirect ophthalmoscopy. Traditional fundus cameras use the rim of the pupillary aperture for illumination and the center of the pupil for imaging (Figure-1). With this, the overlapping reflections are minimized.
