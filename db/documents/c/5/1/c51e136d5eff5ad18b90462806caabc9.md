Despite the primary action of secretin being the bicarbonate secretion and production of pancreatic fluid

Similar to other intestinal peptides, secretin displays satiety-inducing features when administered.

Abnormalities in secretin release parallel abnormalities in underlying pathologies, such as Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Patients with SIADH have normal vasopressin function, but undergo translocation of aquaporin 2; therefore, without the release of secretin from the posterior pituitary, no vasopressin release would occur due to lack of stimulation on the hypothalamus.
