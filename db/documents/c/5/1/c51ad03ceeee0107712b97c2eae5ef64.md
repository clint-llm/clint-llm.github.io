Paraphimosis is a common urologic emergency that occurs in uncircumcised males when the foreskin becomes trapped behind the corona of the glans penis. This can lead to strangulation of the glans and painful vascular compromise, distal venous engorgement, edema, and even necrosis. This activity describes the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of paraphimosis and highlights interprofessional teams' role in improving outcomes for such patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of patients with paraphimosis.
- Outline the evaluation in patients with paraphimosis.
- Review the conservative and surgical treatment options available for patients with paraphimosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to facilitate rapid diagnosis and management of patients with paraphimosis.
