Negative prognostic indicators – These include the bulbar onset or respiratory onset disease, presence of executive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, and weight loss, worsening respiratory function indicated by a reduction in serially assessed forced vital capacity, and also sniff nasal inspiratory pressure.

Symptoms such as speech and swallowing problems, weight loss, reduced respiratory function, older age, lower amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale, shorter time from developing first symptoms to time of diagnosis have been identified as factors that might indicate a poor prognosis.

King’s criteria that include the number of body regions affected and the presence of respiratory/nutritional failure and Milano-Torino system (records changes in domains of bulbar, fine motor, gross motor, and respiratory function), are used in clinical staging. While the King’s system has been shown to be sensitive to changes early in the trajectory of the disease, the MITOS system has been shown to be more sensitive to detect changes in the late stages of the disease).

These staging systems have come under criticism for not including the domains of cognitive and affective function within their purview. However, scales such as the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral functional (ALS) stream (ECAS), the detection of affective and cognitive dysfunction is vital as the presence of executive impairment has been associated with a more progressive downward disease trajectory while being shown to be related to specific needs that have the impact on increasing caregiver burden.
