Lymph nodes are tan white to brown bean-shaped organs distributed throughout the body. They have a delicate capsule through which multiple afferent lymphatics drain into it. The cortex contains lymphoid follicles that are primary in na√Øve lymph nodes and secondary in activated lymph nodes. Secondary lymph nodes have a reactive germinal center in response to stimulation by antigen-presenting cells. A single efferent lymphatic from each lymph node drains into lymphatic trunks that eventually drain into veins.
