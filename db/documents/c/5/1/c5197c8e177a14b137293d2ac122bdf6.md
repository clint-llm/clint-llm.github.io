If a nasogastric tube is placed after flushing with normal saline, the return may be blood-tinged. An upper gastrointestinal bleed often can be ruled out after nasogastric tube placement, and the gastric lavage returns bilious content. A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is also performed. Endoscopy is used to make a definitive diagnosis. Stress gastritis is seen as small superficial mucosal erosions or erythematous lesions in the gastric body and fundus. Testing for H. pylori infection like urease breath test or stool antigen test can also be undertaken.
