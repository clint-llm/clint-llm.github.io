In genetically predisposed individuals with dysregulated immune responses, GI infections may increase the risk of ulcerative proctitis (UP). Appendectomy and smoking appeared to act as protective factors from UP. CRP occurs secondary to ischemic and fibrotic changes. In the case of DP, proximal fecal diversion causes increased nitrate-reducing bacteria and decreased obligate anaerobes resulting in short-chain fatty acids deficiency. Rectal intercourse in women or MSM can result in proctocolitis. Radiation injury occurs with doses 8 Gy or higher causing damage to intestinal cell DNA with helical breaks and inability to replicate and undergo normal cellular repair.
