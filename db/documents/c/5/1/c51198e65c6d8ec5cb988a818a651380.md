A lung abscess is a microbial infection of the lung that results in necrosis of the pulmonary parenchyma. Depending on the duration, it can be classified as acute (less than four weeks) or chronic (more than four weeks). Based on their etiology, they can be classified as secondary if they occur in the presence of underlying pulmonary lesions, or as primary if they occur in the absence of underlying pulmonary lesions. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, presentation of lung abscess, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of lung abscess.
- Review the presentation of a patient with lung abscess.
- Summarize the treatment options for lung abscess.
-  Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lung abscess.
