The blood supply to the femoral head is variable. Three main arteries supply the femoral head. The lateral epiphyseal branch of the medial femoral circumflex and the ascending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex both ascend from the deep femoral artery. This leaves the femoral head vulnerable to avascular necrosis in the presence of a femoral neck fracture since these vessels are easily ruptured with this injury. The ligamentum teres artery descends from the posterior branch of the obturator artery and attaches at the fovea. This artery is commonly disrupted with dislocations. It is the main blood supply to the femoral head in children. As an anatomical variant, the inferior gluteal artery is the main blood supply to the femoral head in a small portion of patients
