The prognosis for both UC and CD depends on the extent of the disease and treatment response. The stool markers lactoferrin and calprotectin are useful in determining postoperative recurrence of CD. Some evidence exists that these can also be used to predict future flares. However, patients with IBD tend to have much higher mortality compared to the general population. Causes of death include primary disease, infections, and respiratory illness. Heart disease is not a risk factor for death in IBD. Finally, psychological morbidity is very high in IBD patients and the quality of life is poor.

Continued surveillance for dysplasia is critical for long-standing UC patients. The cumulative risk of colorectal cancer is estimated to be as high as 30% for those with the disease of 30 years or more. The extraintestinal manifestation of primary sclerosing cholangitis leads to liver failure.
