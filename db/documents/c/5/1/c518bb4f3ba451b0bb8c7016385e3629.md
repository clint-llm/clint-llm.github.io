It is essential to exercise prudence on when to test for thrombophilia. Considering the negative implications of a positive test for the individual (anxiety, bleeding risk) and costs should be balanced with the benefit of avoiding adverse effects from thrombotic events or miscarriage through anticoagulation.

Prognostication implicates the question for the risks of recurrent thrombosis or bleeding as a side effect of anticoagulation. Patients with one VTE event have a 30% risk of recurrence in 10 years. Different scoring systems are available to predict the risk of recurrence. Thrombosis carries a high in-hospital mortality and is the second most common cause of death in cancer patients.

an interprofessional approach involving nurses and physicians in the evaluation and treatment of these patients results in the best outcomes. [Level V]
