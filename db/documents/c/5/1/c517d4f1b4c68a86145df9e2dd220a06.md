The diagnosis and management of PTLD require a multi-professional team of oncologists, radiation specialists, hematologists, surgeons, nurse practitioners, and primary care providers.

TreatmentÂ strategies for PTLD are different from the management of lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompetent patients. The mainstay of the management strategy includes a reduction in immunosuppression followed by surgical excision of the localized lesion, radiation therapy, rituximab monotherapy, immunochemotherapy, chemotherapy, stem-cell transplantation, and immunotherapy.

The better understanding of the pathophysiology of PTLD, improvements in immunosuppressive strategies for solid organ transplantation, advances in the diagnosis and treatment of PTLD have led to improved clinical outcomes and overall prognosis for patients with PTLD.
