**Absorption**

The toxic effects of mercury depend on the form of mercury, age of the individual, route of exposure, biotransformation, accumulation in the target organs, and comorbidities. The vaporized form of elemental mercury is more readily absorbed as compared to the oral or intravenous route. The elemental mercury can be volatile at room temperatures, and the volatility increases with the rise in temperatures and aerosolization.

**Distribution and Biotransformation**

After absorption, mercury gets widely distributed in the various body tissues, mainly the kidneys, liver, kidney, and central nervous system. The vaporized form of elemental mercury has a high affinity of accumulation in the nervous system due to its lipid affinity. The toxicity of elemental mercury eventually depends on its conversion to ionic mercury by catalase enzyme.Â  The inorganic forms of mercury have an affinity for renal tissue, in particular the renal tubules.

**Elimination**

The elemental and inorganic forms of mercury are primarily excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Lungs, skin, and feces eliminate a small amount of elemental and inorganic forms of mercury. The biological half-life of both these forms is estimated at nearly 30 to 60 days.
