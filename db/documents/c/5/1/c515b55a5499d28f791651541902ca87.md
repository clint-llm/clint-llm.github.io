It is easy to confuse mycosis fungoides for common skin disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, parapsoriasis, photodermatitis, or drug reactions. The important differentials to keep in mind include:

- Atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug eruptions, or erythrodermic psoriasis, all of which may cause pruritis and erythroderma resembling mycosis fungoides

- Psoriasis

- Sezary syndrome which may resemble erythrodermic mycosis fungoides

- Other lymphomas such as subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma, primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, cutaneous gamma/delta T cell lymphoma, or cutaneous B cell lymphoma.
