Clinicians should consider pseudomonal infections in all at-risk patient groups and exert a high level of suspicion in severe infections leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or any ICU admission. Hot tub folliculitis is generally self-limited, and no intervention is required, although antipseudomonal antibiotics may be needed.Pseudomonas infections should be considered upon presentation. The local antibiogram is extremely important to guide empiric therapy until sensitivity results are available. In addition to broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, double pseudomonal coverage may be needed in cases of septic shock, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, ICU admissions, and the presence of one or more risk factors for multi-drug resistant organisms.
