The incidence and prevalence of amantadine keratopathy in the general population are not known as the majority of studies exclude patients with ocular comorbidities (e.g., glaucoma, prior history of corneal edema) where amantadine keratopathy may have an increased prevalence. Amantadine keratopathy has an equal preponderance in males and females.

There is an increased incidence of amantadine keratopathy within months of treatment initiation, but cases have been reported as late as 6 years after starting therapy, so the relative risk is likely greater than this.
