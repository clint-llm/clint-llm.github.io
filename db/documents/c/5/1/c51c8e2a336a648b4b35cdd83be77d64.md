The diagnosis ofÂ erosive lichen planus (ELP) is typically made by history and clinical exam. However, biopsy helps to confirm the diagnosis and rule out the potential for malignancy. On histopathology, typical findings include hyperkeratosis without parakeratosis, liquefaction of the basal layer, saw-toothed rete ridges, Civatte bodies (eosinophilic masses representing apoptotic keratinocytes), and a band-like lymphohistiocytic infiltrate near the dermal-epidermal border.
