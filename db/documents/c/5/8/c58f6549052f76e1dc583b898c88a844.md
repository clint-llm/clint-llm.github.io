PRS is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Various investigation modalities can be employed to rule out any overlap with similarly presenting syndromes.

**Ocular Evaluation**

- Best-corrected visual acuity, refraction, and pupillary reaction assessment

- General examination for symmetry of the face, head posture, extra-ocular muscle movements, and strabismus workup

- Orbit examination, evaluation of lid abnormalities, and ptosis workup

- Meticulous slit-lamp examination

- IOP measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometry

- Detailed fundus examination

- **Orbital ultrasound:**In cases with media opacity due to vitritis, cataract, or corneal opacity, this modality helps diagnose the associated posterior segment pathology. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is used to look for ciliary body changes.

- **Orbital imaging:**Orbital computed tomography (CT) scan is used to evaluate the changes in bony orbit.

**Neurology Evaluation**

- **Electroencephalogram:**For workup of epilepsy cases, to localize the cerebral lesions

- **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis:**CSF examination is usually found normal. The oligoclonal bands and raised IgG index are associated with T2 hyperintense lesions on MRI.

- **Neuro-imaging:**CT scan delineates the cranial bony deformity, thinning of diploe, and intracranial calcifications. MRI T1 sequence localizes the patches of cerebral atrophy. MRI T2 sequence pinpoints the hyperintense foci in the subcortical region. MR angiogram demonstrates the extent and location of vascular malformations. Brain spectral photoemission CT (SPECT) scan can detect subclinical CNS lesions in PRS cases.

**Rheumatology Evaluation**

- **Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA):**The most commonly associated serology finding in 25 to 52% of cases.

- **Rheumatoid factor:**Elevated titers in localized scleroderma and LSCS cases.

- **Other serology tests:**C-reactive protein, HLA-B27 typing, extractable nuclear antigen,Â Anti-Scl-70, Anti-cardiolipin, and Anti-dsDNA antibodies are of limited value

**Dental Evaluation**

- To****monitor progressive deformity of the jaw bones and teeth abnormalities by serial orthopantomograms and photographs.

**Dermatology Evaluation**

- Skin biopsy is not performed routinely. However, the histopathological findings help differentiate PRS from LSCS.
