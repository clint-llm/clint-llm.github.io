ATL is uniformly associated with HTLV-I infection of CD4-positive T cells that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ATL.

Tax and HTLV-1 B-zip protein (HBZ) are the viral regulatory proteins associated with neoplastic transformation and proliferation. HTLV-1 can escape from the host immune response by reducing Tax and activating HBZ expression. HBZ inhibits Tax-dependent viral transcription and induces its own expression. Therefore, it maintains chronic infection. HBZ viral protein is the only one continuously expressed in ATL. It has been reported that clones of ATL cells with the same proviral integration site can have different T cell receptor rearrangements, raising the possibility that ATL may arise from immature HTLV-1 infected hematopoietic progenitors.

ATL is frequently associated with hypercalcemia, which can be severe. The hypercalcemia seen in ATL is thought to arise from cytokines released from the malignant cells. There are several proposed mechanisms, including the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-RP), tumor necrosis factor-beta, or interleukin-1, increased RANKL expression (receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand). These factors may also contribute to the genesis of the lytic bone lesions, increased bone turnover, increased serum alkaline phosphatase.
