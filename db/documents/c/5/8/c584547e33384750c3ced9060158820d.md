Intraepidermal or squamous cell carcinoma in situ was first attributed to exposure of unprotected body parts to ionizing radiation in the year 1920. However, population studies today show that the most common cause of carcinoma is long-term exposure of the skin and dermal layers to sunlight. Ultraviolet radiation damages the skin cell nucleic acids, leading to the mutation and cloning of the p53 gene. The resulting exposure to ultraviolet UV radiation leads to a geometric growth of skin cells. Auto function cell repairs also are impeded by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) from sunlight. Diseases or drugs capable of suppressing immune responses to skin damage also can trigger the mutation of squamous cells. Other causatives attributed to intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma include arsenic ingestion and some viral infections.
