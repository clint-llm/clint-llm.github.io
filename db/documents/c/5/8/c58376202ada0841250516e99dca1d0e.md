In the United States, there are about 3000 cases per year. Infections can be categorized as post-traumatic, post-surgical, or spontaneous. Post-traumatic gas gangrene accounts for about 60% of cases overall, usually involving automobile collisions. The infection has no sexual bias, although there are rare reports of gynecological infection and clostridial endometritis after amniocentesis, cordocentesis, molar pregnancy, vaginal delivery, cesarean section, medical/spontaneous abortion, ablation, and cervical procedures.
