The exact prevalence of SR is not known; however, studies have shown that more than 30% of individuals show a moderate rise of IOP (6 to 15 mmHg) after topical cortisone use, while about 5% are highly responsive (IOP elevations >16 mmHg).

Based on the IOP response to the topical administration of betamethasone and dexamethasone, Armaly and Becker

- High responders (4 to 6% of the population): developed an IOP greater than 31 mmHg or a rise of more than 15 mmHg from baseline.

- Moderate responders (about 1/3 of the population): developed an IOP between 25 to 31 mmHg or a rise of 6 to 15 mmHg from baseline.

- Non-responders (about 2/3 of the population): most individuals had an IOP of less than 20 mmHg or a rise of less than 6 mmHg from baseline.

Studies have shown that there are numerous risk factors for the development of high responsiveness, which include: diagnosis or family history of primary open-angle glaucoma (possibly due to the different expression of steroid receptors and isoforms in the TM), diabetes mellitus, high myopia, and, connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.
