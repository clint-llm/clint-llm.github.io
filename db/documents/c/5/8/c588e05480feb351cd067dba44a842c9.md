An atrioventricular septal defect is a complex congenital cardiac malformation, which requires a multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach in order to optimize medical treatment, decrease surgical mortality, and improve long term outcomes. A multidisciplinary team is the cornerstone of a multi-professional approach, which may include a pediatric cardiologist, a cardiac imaging expert, a pediatric cardiac surgeon, a cardiac anesthesiologist, a cardiac nurse, a nutritionist, and a cardiac pharmacist.

During fetal life and early infancy, a detailed screening for congenital cardiac malformations is mandatory in order to make an early diagnosis of the atrioventricular septal defect. After an early diagnosis, it is essential to institute appropriate medical therapy and plan surgical repair.Â  Assessment of imaging and hemodynamic data is essential for planning a surgical repair.

In the postoperative period, wound care, appropriate nutrition, and nursing care are important to reduce the duration of hospitalization and promote early postoperative recovery. Meticulous postoperative follow up is required to monitor and assess the long-term complications of surgical repair and the need for recurrent surgery.
