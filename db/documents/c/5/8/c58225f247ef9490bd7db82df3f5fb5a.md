The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) for emesis, also commonly known as the area postrema (AP), is located within the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata, on the floor of the fourth ventricle of the brain. The CTZ contains receptors that detect emetic agents in the blood and relays that information to the vomiting center, which is responsible for inducing the vomiting reflex.
