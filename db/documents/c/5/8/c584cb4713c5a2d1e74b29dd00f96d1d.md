Although most with enterohemorrhagic diarrhea-associated HUS recover from the acute illness episode, these patients have the potential for persistent, long-term renal dysfunction and extrarenal complications, including seizures, diabetes, chronic colitis, and hypertension. HUS, the most frequent, severe complication of E. coli O157: H7 colitis, occurs most commonly in children, especially young children less than 5 years old, and in the elderly. HUS manifests 5 to 10 days following the onset of hemorrhagic diarrhea and presents with the triad: hemolytic anemia, acute kidney failure, and thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of children with an E. coli O157: H7 infection will develop HUS, which carries an annual 5% mortality rate, and those who survive have an increased risk for developing chronic kidney disease. Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic-induced HUS in the elderly causes significant morbidity and mortality.Â E. coli 0157:H7 infections result in healthcare costs in the United States of over US$ 400 million annually. As 10% of E. coli 0157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis cases progress to HUS with worsened prognosis, prevention of Shiga toxin enterohemorrhagic infections would improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures.
