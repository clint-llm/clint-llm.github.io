Early in the disease course, histologic examination reveals a normal total number of hair follicles. Anagen hairs often have lymphocytic inflammation clustered around the bulbar portion of the follicle, said to resemble a “swarm of bees.” Eosinophils may be seen as well. In longstanding disease, histologic examination reveals mostly catagen and telogen hair follicles, often displaying miniaturization. Fibrous tract remnants known as “follicular streamers” may be seen, but these can also be a finding in scarring alopecias.
