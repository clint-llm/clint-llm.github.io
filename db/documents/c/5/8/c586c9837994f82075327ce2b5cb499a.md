IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by painful and pruritic vesiculopustular eruptions. These eruptions form as a result of circulating IgA antibodies against keratinocyte cell surface components responsible for cell to cell adherence. While the disease has been associated with several malignancies and chronic conditions, the exact etiology is unclear. This activity reviews the presentation of IgA pemphigus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of IgA pemphigus.
- Summarize the treatment of IgA pemphigus.
- Describe the workup of a patient with IgA pemphigus.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by IgA pemphigus.
