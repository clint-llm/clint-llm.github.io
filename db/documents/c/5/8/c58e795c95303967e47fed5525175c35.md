Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid with agonistic properties on mu, kappa, and delta-type opioid receptors, with the strongest affinity being for mu-type receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- The onset of action is 10 to 30 minutes for the immediate-release formulation and about 1 hour for controlled-release.

- Duration range is from 3 to 6 hours for immediate-release or 12 hours in controlled-release formulations.

- The plasma half-life is 3 to 5 hours, and stable plasma levels are reached within 24 to 36 hours.

- Oxycodone is metabolized by the hepatic enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, producing the metabolites noroxycodone and oxymorphone, respectively. These metabolites get excreted from the body via the kidneys.
