Insertion and care should always be performed under sterile conditions with appropriate hand hygiene, draping, and sterile materials.

The start of any procedure where the catheter dressings are exposed should begin with skin cleansing. The majority of catheter-associated infections have been shown to be related to skin colonization.

Dressings are an essential item to contribute to keeping CVCs and their insertion site clean and dry. The most commonly used dressings comprise an adherent transparent polyurethane film. These have the clear advantage of allowing constant inspection of the site to identify local infection, pressure damage, or other complications visible at the insertion site without the need for a dressing change.

Crystalloid fluids are routinely continuously infused into central lines used in the intensive care environment; this allows the lumen to be flushed regularly and is necessary to provide pressure above a transducer to measure central venous pressure. Central venous pressure monitoring is recommended both as a physiological measure and also to allow identification of when the catheter has migrated or been misplaced.
