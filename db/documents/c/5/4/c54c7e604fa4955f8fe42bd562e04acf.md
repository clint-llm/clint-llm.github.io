Areas of the midface able to be addressed by the deep-plane facelift technique

- Malar fat pad descent

- Nasolabial folds

- Jowling: a result of pseudo-herniated buccal fat and descent of the mobile, medial SMAS

- Festoons (malar mounds): hammocks of lax skin and orbicularis muscle that form large bags typically resting below the orbital rim

- Facial dimples: caused by fascial bands from the zygomatic major muscle (minor dimple) or a bifid zygomaticus major muscle (major dimple)
