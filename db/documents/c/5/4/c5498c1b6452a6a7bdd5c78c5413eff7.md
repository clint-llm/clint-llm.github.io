Identification of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis clinically is important because of its potential life-threatening and limb depriving complications.

Type 1 cryoglobulinemia has frequent manifestations of skin like Raynaud’s phenomenon, ulcers, gangrene, and rarely involves kidneys.

In mixed cryoglobulinemia, the skin, musculoskeletal system, and kidneys are frequently affected. Historically, Meltzer has described the triad of arthralgias, purpura, and weakness.

- Cutaneous lesions include palpable purpura in dependent areas, digital ulcers, gangrene.

- Musculoskeletal manifestations are arthralgias in hands and knees with no arthritis.

- Neurological symptoms are commonly bilateral and symmetrical. It can be distal sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy.

- Renal involvement generally means worse prognosis and presents with hematuria, proteinuria, worsening renal function.

Other rare manifestations are:

- CNS vasculitis which can present with hemiplegia, coma, encephalopathy, or seizures.

- Gastrointestinal - mesenteric vasculitis, duodenal vasculitis, or pancreatitis which present with abdominal pain.

- Pulmonary hemorrhage can also be a rare presentation with hemoptysis, dyspnea, or respiratory failure as first signs.

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presents with dyspnea on exertion.

- Pericarditis, coronary vasculitis, and heart failure.

- Hyperviscosity syndrome

- Dry eyes and dry mouth

- Parotitis, which is usually bilateral
