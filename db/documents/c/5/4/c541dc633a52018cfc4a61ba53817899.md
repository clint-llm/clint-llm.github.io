Medication use is common in pregnancy, with multiple studies showing that 75-97% of pregnant individuals take at least one over-the-counter (OTC) medication during their pregnancy.

The increase in renal clearance during pregnancy can increase the elimination of renally cleared medications. For example, lithium, a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, is renally cleared. Lithium clearance is doubled during the third trimester of pregnancy, leading to sub-therapeutic levels.

As soon as pregnancy is confirmed, hypothyroid patients requiring levothyroxine should increase their dose by 30%, andÂ serum thyrotropin levels should be closely monitored.

Whether family medicine, cardiology, or obstetric anesthesia, clinicians in every medical specialty should understand the physiologic changes pregnant individuals undergo and adapt accordingly within their practice and care of that patient.
