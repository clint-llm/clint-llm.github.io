Adverse effects of thermal lesioning can include bleeding, infection, needle placement induced nerve damage, placement, and burns caused by incorrect grounding pad placement. The most common complication is post-procedural discomfort, and auspiciously, is transient. Although there is a lowered risk of neuroma formation and nerve regeneration after cryoneurolysis, the most significantly reported complication is neuropathic pain. Alopecia and pigmentation changes have also been reported and are particularly concerning when thermal lesions are performed in proximity to the face. Fortunately, adverse effects and complications of thermal neurolytic therapy are exceedingly rare. Risk and incidence can be mitigated by proper technique, radiographic guidance, sterile technique, appropriate pre-procedural checklists, and increased procedural skill.
