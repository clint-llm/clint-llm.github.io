While cases of isolated DRS can be managed by ophthalmologists alone, a thorough systemic evaluation by other healthcare professionals such as the pediatrician, family clinician, and ENT specialist, operating as an interprofessional healthcare team, is necessary to rule out systemic anomalies which are not uncommon in DRS. Also, pedigree analysis, MRI, and genetic studies play a role in enhancing understanding of the clinical condition, thus improving the quality of life for these patients and their families. Opthalmology nurses will also play a significant roleÂ by assisting in surgery and providing post-procedural care and counseling for the patient. These interprofessional activities will drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
