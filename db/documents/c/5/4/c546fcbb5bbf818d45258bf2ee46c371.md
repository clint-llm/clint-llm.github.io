Apocrine hidrocystoma is most often a solitary tumor, although practitioners have also documented multiple lesions. Apocrine hidrocystoma is typically intradermal, moderately firm, dome-shaped, translucent, blue, bluish-black, grayish, or purple cystic nodule. Its size ranges from 3 mm to 15 mm in diameter

Apocrine hidrocystoma is usually found on the head, face and neck. This is probably because apocrine glands are frequent in these locations

The main differential diagnosis of the rare cases of multiples apocrine hidrocystomas is multiple eccrine hidrocystomas. Eccrine hidrocystomas are smaller, with a diameter ranging from 1 mm to 6 mm
