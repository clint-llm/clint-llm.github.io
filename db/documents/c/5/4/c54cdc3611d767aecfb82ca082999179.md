Isopropanol, or isopropyl alcohol, is a clear, colorless liquid that emits an odor that resembles acetone. It is a commercially available product that mainly is found as a 70% solution in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Unlike the other toxic alcohols, isopropanol rarely causes death and is associated with ketosis without acidosis. Treatment of isopropanol ingestions typically consists of supportive therapy. Ingestions are rarely lethal. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of isopropanol toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the basic pathophysiology and toxicokinetics of isopropyl alcohol toxicity.
- Describe the presenting signs and symptoms of a patient suffering from isopropanol toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment strategies available for patients with isopropyl alcohol toxicity.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with the management of isopropanol toxicity.
