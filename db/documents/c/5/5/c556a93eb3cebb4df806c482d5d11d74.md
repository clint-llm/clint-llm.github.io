Because avian influenza, like many viral illnesses, can present with a variety of symptoms that may be like other disease processes, a broad differential is necessary. For instance, for patients presenting with a headache with or without fever, a differential should include meningitis, intracranial bleeds, migraines, and other headache syndromes. For patients presenting with respiratory symptoms, other infectious upper and lower airway etiologies should be considered, including but not limited to:

- Bacterial pneumonia

- Streptococcal pharyngitis

- Asthma

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Pulmonary embolism

Additionally, in patients with shortness of breath or other possible cardiac involvement, pericarditis and myocarditis should be considered.
