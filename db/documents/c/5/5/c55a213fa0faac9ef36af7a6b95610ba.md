The signs and symptoms of CAS toxicity can be similar in both acute and chronic CAS toxicity, although it can be more subtle and challenging with chronic CAS toxicity. The clinical manifestations divide into cardiac and non-cardiac.

**Non-cardiac Manifestations**

In acute toxicity, there may be an asymptomatic period of minutes to hours. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, are often the earliest symptoms to occur. Neurological symptoms may range from generalized weakness to overt confusion. In chronic toxicity, the symptoms are more insidious and neurological symptoms, including lethargy, disorientation, drowsiness, headache, hallucinations, and rarely convulsions may occur. Visual symptoms like diplopia, photophobia, scotomata, photopsia, and color vision disturbances such as xanthopsia may also be an indicator of chronic toxicity.

While acute toxicity may cause electrolyte disturbance, hyperkalemia has prognostic implications in CAS toxicity. Potassium levels of over 5.5 mEq/L demonstrate 100% mortality, while levels between 5.0 to 5.5 have links with 50% mortality.

**Cardiac Manifestations**

With CAS poisoning, virtually any arrhythmia can occur because of the AV node blocking properties of CAS. Increased automaticity combined with impaired conduction through SA or AV node should lead a physician to suspect CAS toxicity. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia with alternating QRS axis is almost pathognomic for CAS toxicity, although it may also occur with aconitine toxicity and familial catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.

In younger, healthier individuals, accentuation of vagal effects manifesting as bradydysrhythmias is more common. In older people with cardiac disease, however, ventricular dysrhythmias and ectopy are more common. AV junctional blockade combined with increased ventricular automaticity is the most commonly seen arrhythmia in CAS toxicity.

In patients on chronic digoxin therapy, ECG may show scooped ST-segment depression, also known as Salvador Dali's mustache appearance, T-wave inversions or flattening, QT shortening, and increased U wave amplitude. These features suggest long-term digoxin use rather than acute toxicity.
