The indications for sleeve gastrectomy are mainly for bariatric procedures.  The classic criteria for a patient to be a candidate for any bariatric surgery are:

1) **BMI greater than or equal to 40 or  BMI greater than or equal to 35 with at least one obesity-related comorbid conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or severely limiting musculoskeletal issues)**

2) Unsuccessful nonoperative weight loss attempts

3) Mental health clearance

4) No medical contraindication to surgery

Recent updates have included patients with a BMI of **30-35 with uncontrollable type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome**as an indication for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.
