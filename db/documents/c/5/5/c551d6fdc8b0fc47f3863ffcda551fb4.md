Not many complications have been reported in patients who develop the milk-alkali syndrome. One reason for this is that the syndrome is reversible. Withdrawing the offending agent, which is calcium carbonate in most cases, serves as a cure. Some studies, however, have reported the development of permanent renal damage, even after the discontinuation of the supplement in the diet. Several case reports have mentioned that patients had elevated creatinine levels (more than 1.5 mg/dL) in follow-up investigations. Renal function improvement is variable after treatment. There have been reports of status-epilepticus secondary to hypercalcemia in patients with milk-alkali syndrome.

Neurological impairment, including obtundation and coma, has been reported in patients with calcium levels greater than 15 mg/dL. Older age, patients with a history of chronic kidney disease, and patients on dialysis are at high risk of complications.
