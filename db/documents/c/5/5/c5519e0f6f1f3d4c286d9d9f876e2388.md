Long-term outcomes following spinal cord untethering are favorable.

If bladder dysfunction is present, this continues into the immediate postoperative period in most children due to temporary neurapraxia.

A subsequent spinal cord untethering was required in about 30% of patients who had previously undergone tethered spinal cord release.

An interesting phenomenon following spinal cord untethering is a statistically significant gain in height-for-age percentiles, which may be more significant in older children (≥ 5 years of age).
