In the postoperative period, monitoring for CSF leak is vital. Some patients may develop a pseudomeningocele, which may require drainage.

Patients can also be evaluated postoperatively with the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale for a more subjective evaluation of postoperative improvement.

Exercise and heavy liftingÂ should not be done for at least 3 to 4 weeks after the procedure.

Most patients require 6 to 8 weeks to recover from surgery and reverse any major neurological deficit fully. Patients should consider refraining from contact sports following surgery, even after the surgical site is well healed.

Repeat MRI is necessary to ensure that the syrinx has responded to the treatment.
