The etiology of lymphomatoid papulosis is unknown. A viral etiology has been suggested. However, studies searching for an etiologic role for Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses have been consistently negative. The mechanisms involved in the spontaneous regression of skin lesions have not yet been identified. Interactions between CD30 and its ligand (CD30L) may contribute to apoptosis of the neoplastic T cells and the subsequent regression of the skin lesions, but the exact mechanism is as yet unknown.
