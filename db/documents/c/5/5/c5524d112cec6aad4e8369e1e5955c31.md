Adrenal tumors that are more than 4 cm in size, hormonally indeterminate, or suspected to be malignant receive treatment with adrenalectomy. Benign appearing on imaging, less than 4 cm in size adrenal adenomas which are hormonally active on biochemical testing (Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, and pheochromocytoma) are treated with adrenalectomy as well. There is no long-term prospective data available to choose between medical and surgical treatment for patients with subclinical Cushing syndrome.

Patients with hyperaldosteronism who are not good surgical candidates due to advanced age or comorbidities, or the patients who refuse surgery, are treated with aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone.

Hormonally inactive adenomas are initially managed by reimaging in 3 to 6 months, then annually for 1 to 2 years, and they should also have repeat hormonal assessment once a year for 5 years. If the mass grows more than 1 cm or becomes hormonally active, then adrenalectomy is recommended.
