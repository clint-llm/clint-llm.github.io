Consideration for the branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is critical during surgery of the thyroid gland. Because of the proximity of the thyroid gland and the branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, recommendations are for maintaining all nerves in this region unless there is a compromise ofÂ the nerve itself by malignancy.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve may be damaged during a cervical esophagectomy, during the removal of a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum or a gastroesophageal anastomosis after performing the trans-hiatal esophagectomy. In the diverticulum excision and the anastomosis, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is lesioned from pressure applied by retractors in the operating room.

Damage can be done to the external laryngeal nerve at the time of ligation of the superior thyroid artery during a thyroidectomy.
