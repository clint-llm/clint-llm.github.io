Infectious endocarditis is the inflammation of the endocardium, the inner lining of the heart, as well as the valves that separate each of the four chambers within the heart. It is primarily a disease caused by bacteria and has a wide array of manifestations and sequelae. Without early identification and treatment, a myriad of intracardiac and far-reaching extracardiac complications can develop. Therefore, careful evaluation, including a thorough history and physical exam, can help diagnoses cases and guide management, limiting mortality and morbidity.
