Binge eating disorder has the same neurobiology as substance use disorder. Research has proposed several models to explain the pathophysiology of binge eating disorder.

The food addiction hypothesis states that individuals with high impulsivity and reward sensitivity experience an addictive response to certain foods, for example, high sugar and high-fat foods. Still, they do not develop tolerance or show withdrawal symptoms.

An increased volume of the insula of the left orbitofrontal cortex is a known factor in eating disorders. The insula and frontal operculum are the two regions of the brain that are responsible for processing the basic sensory information about food. The ventral striatum, which includes nucleus accumbens and putamen, and caudate are accountable for evaluating and identifying the rewarding nature of food. The dorsal caudate, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, are the regions of the brain responsible for controlling food-related responses.

Polymorphism in the serotonin transporter dopamine receptor D and mu-opioid receptors have links to binge eating disorder.
