All healthcare workers, including nurses who assist physicians and surgeons, should be fully aware of the importance of sterile techniques. Breaks in the technique can lead to infections in the patient, which leads to higher costs of healthcare. An infectious disease team should routinely audit all physicians and nurses involved in sterile procedures to ensure proper protocol is followed.
