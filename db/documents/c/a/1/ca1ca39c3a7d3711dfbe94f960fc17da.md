Dysfunction of the accommodation reflex can be physiological like in aging and presbyopia, pathological or pharmacological. Accommodation deficits can occur in neurological conditions like supranuclear lesions, encephalitis, pineal tumors, or in neuromuscular disorders like myasthenia gravis.

Convergence

Damage to the medial rectus muscle itself can disrupt convergence. Moreover, a cortical or brainstem lesion can impair the neural machinery required to coordinate ocular convergence. Disorders of vergence can be due to organic causes or can be functional. It can be congenital, presenting with strabismus in childhood.

Near reflex insufficiency is a disorder of vergence; it can be mild paresis or complete paralysis. There is convergence or accommodation insufficiency. Mydriasis may present on attempted near fixation. For paresis, treatment involves reading glasses, or base in prisms.

Convergence insufficiency can occur in individuals with the increased use of near work, like in school-age children. It can occur as idiopathic or following viral illness.

Pupillary Constriction

Similarly, a disruption of the parasympathetic pathway can dysregulate the coordination of pupillary constriction.

Lens Accommodation

The most frequently encountered loss of accommodation is from presbyopia.
