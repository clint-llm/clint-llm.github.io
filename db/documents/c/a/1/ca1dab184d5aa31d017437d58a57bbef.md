- Acute sialadenitis: Most cases receive treatment with conservative medical management; this includes hydration, warm compresses, and massage, pain relief with analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs), sialogogues. Empiric antibiotic therapy starts with amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin. Antibiotics selection should be according to culture and sensitivity reports. Intravenous antibiotics may be necessary for severe cases. If soft tissue swelling is significant, and there is no contraindication, corticosteroid therapy is an option. Rarely, acute suppurative sialadenitis can lead to abscess formation; surgical incision and drainage are indicated in these cases.

- Chronic sialadenitis: Medical management is with hydration, oral hygiene, pain relief, sialogogues. In cases of infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics are added. In the case of sialolithiasis, salivary gland stone removal should take place, using interventional sialendoscopy or direct surgical removal.

- Sialadenosis: Sialadenosis requires expectant management. Treatment of underlying cause is the approach taken.
