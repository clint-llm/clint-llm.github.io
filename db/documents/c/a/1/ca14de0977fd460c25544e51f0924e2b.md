Urethritis is the most common sexually transmitted infection in men with gonorrhea and chlamydia representing the primary pathogens. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not publish rates of urethritis as a syndrome. The CDC instead breaks down sexual infection rates down by etiology. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the United States with over 1,500,000 new cases in 2016. Rates of new diagnoses continue to rise annually with an estimated increase of 4.7% from 2015 to 2016. Trends show that rates of chlamydia in females are 2 times higher than that of males. Rates are highest among adolescents and young adults. Racial disparities exist, and blacks are 5.6 times more commonly affected with chlamydia when compared to whites. Gonorrhea cases are more commonly seen in males, and there were an estimated 468,000 new cases of gonorrhea in 2016. Like with chlamydia, infections rates are higher in adolescents and young adults; the African American race is also disproportionately affected.
