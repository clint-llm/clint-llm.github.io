**The Function of Transplantation in Trauma Patients**

Patients who have suffered traumatic injuries should be evaluated and resuscitated according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, developed by the American College of Surgeons (ACS), including a proper primary and secondary survey.

- Phase I - Identification of Potential Organ Donors, Referral to OPO

- Phase II - Declaration of Death, Acquisition of Consent for Organ Donation

- Phase III - Donor Evaluation

- Phase IV - Donor Management

- Phase V - Organ Procurement

Trauma donors are generally younger and have fewer co-morbidities than non-trauma donors. On average, trauma donors are more likely to yield additional (non-kidney) organs and produce more organs per donor, overall.
