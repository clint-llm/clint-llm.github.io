Myocardial protection is a major goal and necessary during any cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.  Its development drove heart surgery progress over the years. Studying the history of myocardial protection is synonymous with studying the history of heart surgery.

All techniques found their place along time and none of which disappeared. There is no single modality free of flaw.  The surgeon's focus should not only be on the steps of the surgery. Instead, protecting the myocardium during the clamp-time should also be the aim of the surgeon. Understanding the various myocardial protection techniques' strengths and weaknesses must be taught to every junior surgeon in training.
