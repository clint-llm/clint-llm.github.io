Although studies have shown that the treatment of IBS-D with alosetron improves IBS symptoms, reduces pain and discomfort, and improves patients' quality of life, healthcare providers need to be mindful of the serious adverse effects that can accompany the use of this medication.

Before receiving the initial prescription for alosetron, the patient must read and sign the patient-physician agreement for alosetron, which helps ensure the patients understand their role and responsibilities regarding their treatment, the conditions under which their treatment may be terminated, and the responsibilities of their physician.Â The prescribing program for alosetron was implemented to reduce gastrointestinal adverse events. This program restricts the prescribing of alosetron to providers enrolled in the program based on their understanding of the risks versus benefits of the medication.
