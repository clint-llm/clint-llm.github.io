Each year in the United States, pediatric trauma causes approximately 12,000 deaths, and at least 8 million ER encounters.

Among all patients with facial fractures, fewer than 15% are children. Most facial injuries in children are limited to soft tissues, with only 10 to 15% of pediatric facial injuries resulting in facial fractures.

Many minor facial traumas are treated at home and maybe underreported; fractures are likely to cause significant pain and swelling and are, therefore, most likely more accurately reported than soft tissue trauma to the face.

Males are more likely to have facial fractures than females, especially during adolescence, when males are approximately twice as likely to present with fractures than females.

Facial fractures are rare below the age of six, wherein skull fractures are more likely to be the result of head or facial trauma.

Fracture location can be age-dependent, both due to activities undertaken affecting the location of likely blunt trauma and differential areas of bone growth and laxity with age.

Nasal fractures are generally thought to be the most common facial fractures, though they are likely underreported as they do not necessitate evaluation at a trauma center from which most pediatric facial trauma data are drawn.

The most common reported fracture across age groups is a mandibular fracture, affecting 40 to 60% of pediatric facial fracture patients and increasing with age.

Fracture patterns described in adults, such as Le Fort injuries, are rare in pediatric patients. The changes made through facial development correspond to different stress points for fracture locations; these patterns are generally only seen in older adolescents and account for less than 2% of fractures.
