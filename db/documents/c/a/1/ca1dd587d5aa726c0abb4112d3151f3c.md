A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a medical emergency. It is defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction due to focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction or tissue injury. Evaluation of TIA should be done urgently with imaging and laboratory studies to decrease the risk of subsequent strokes. Immediate multimodal therapeutic interventions should be initiated. Specific underlying etiology needs to be managed accordingly. This treatment scheme may substantially reduce the risk of recurrent strokes or future TIA by at least 80 percent. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of transient ischemic attacks.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with transient ischemic attacks.
- Summarize the treatment options for transient ischemic attacks.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of transient ischemic attacks.
