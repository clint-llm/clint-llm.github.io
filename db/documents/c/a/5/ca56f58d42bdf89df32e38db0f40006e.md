Nivolumab is a fully human, monoclonal IgG4 antibody which binds to programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor with high specificity and affinity. PD-1 is expressed on T cells and dampens their immune response upon binding ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on APCs. This mechanism is pivotal to regulating central and peripheral tolerance.

However, in cancer, aberrant PD-L1 expression by tumor cells or immune cells in the tumor microenvironment deactivate PD-1 expressing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, thereby allowing tumor cells to escape immune recognition and elimination.
