Chokes, or pulmonary decompression sickness, is a rare but severe manifestation of decompression sickness (DCS) that can be rapidly fatal even with appropriate treatment. Decompression sickness, also called divers' disease, the bends, aerobullosis, and caisson disease is caused by dissolved gases emerging from solution as bubbles inside the body tissues during decompression. Decompression sickness often occurs soon after a decompression ascent from diving, emerging from a caisson, decompression from saturation, flying in an unpressurized aircraft at high altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. This activity describes the evaluation and management of pulmonary decompression sickness and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of pulmonary decompression sickness.
- Explain the pathophysiology of pulmonary decompression sickness.
- Describe the prehospital and in-hospital treatment of a patient with pulmonary decompression sickness.
- Summarize a well-coordinated, interprofessional team approach to effectively care for patients affected by pulmonary decompression sickness.
