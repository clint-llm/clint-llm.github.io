Abnormal genital bleeding is often attributed to the uterus, with postmenopausal women describing bleeding as “having a period” again despite not having had menses for quite some time. Despite this natural inclination, bleeding can arise from the perineum, vulva, vagina, cervix, or fallopian tubes. Bleeding can be related to ovarian pathology. The etiology of bleeding may also be non-gynecologic. Bleeding from the urethra, bladder, or GI tract (anus, rectum, bowel) could be mistaken for vaginal bleeding.

The most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding is atrophy, either of the endometrium or the vaginal mucosa.
