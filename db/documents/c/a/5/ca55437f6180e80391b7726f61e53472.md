Hypercalciuria can be difficult to identify and manage.  Diagnosis usually begins with primary care, the nurse practitioner, nephrology or urology.  It can take time to identify the type of hypercalciuria and its optimal treatment. A high index of suspicion should be maintained by all members of the health care team treating the patient.

The outcomes depend on the cause. For benign causes, the outcomes are excellent but if the cause is a malignancy, the outcomes are guarded. an interprofessional team of a specialty trained urology nurse and clinical for follow up and monitoring will provide the best results. [Level V]
