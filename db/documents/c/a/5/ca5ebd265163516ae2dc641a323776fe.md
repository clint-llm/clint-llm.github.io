The most important initial step in evaluating a patient with suspected retinal migraine is to determine if the visual symptoms are monocular or binocular. Once it is confirmed that it is a monocular visual loss, then the healthcare professional has to rule out all other causes of monocular vision loss because a retinal migraine is a diagnosis of exclusion. The other diagnoses that need to be considered are amaurosis fugax as in embolic phenomena of carotid or cardiac source, increase intracranial pressure, orbital apex mass, optic neuritis, giant cell arteritis, migraine with visual aura, or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
