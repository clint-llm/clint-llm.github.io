Ezetimibe has a long half-life of about 22 hours, which is why it can be administered orally once daily with or without meals with a cholesterol-lowering diet. The dose is 10 mg daily. It may be taken at the same time as fenofibrate or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, but the recommendation is to dose it at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after taking bile acid sequestrants. Due to once-daily dosing and limited adverse effects, compliance should not be of concern.

**Use in Specific Patient Population**

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal disease, according to the manufacturer's product labeling. However, as renal impairment increases the risk of statin-associated myopathy, simvastatin exceeding 20 mg should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with ezetimibe in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**Ezetimibe is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**In preclinical studies, ezetimibe increased the risk of congenital anomalies. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women. Therefore, ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. Ezetimibe comes under FDA former Pregnancy Category C. Additionally,  no well-controlled clinical studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women have been conducted. Therefore,  Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Bile acid sequestrants are currently the preferred drug in pregnancy for managing dyslipidemia.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Information regarding using ezetimibe during breastfeeding is unavailable. It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk. Ezetimibe should be avoided during breastfeeding. An alternate drug is preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Clinicians should avoid ezetimibe and statin (e.g.simvastatin) in nursing mothers.
