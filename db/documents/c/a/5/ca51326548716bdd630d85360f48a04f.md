Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, the primary carrier of oxygen throughout the human body. When hemoglobin levels decrease, anemia results and patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of decreased oxygen delivery to tissues (also known as oxygen debt). The signs and symptoms of oxygen debt may include tachycardia, dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings may include metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is administered to anemic patients who are symptomatic to relieve the signs and symptoms of oxygen debt. However, some patients are unable to receive blood transfusions due to religious beliefs or medical reasons. In these patient populations, hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be administered to increase oxygen delivery to tissues and relieve the signs and symptoms of oxygen debt. This activity highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with anemia who refuse blood transfusions.

**Objectives:**
- Review reasons why some patients cannot accept blood transfusions.
- Summarize the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for anemic patients.
- Describe the adverse effects of hyperbaric oxygen treatments.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by anemia.
