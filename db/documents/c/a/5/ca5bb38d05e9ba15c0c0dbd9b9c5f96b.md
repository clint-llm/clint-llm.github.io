Measures should be taken to prevent short-term and long-term complications, including infection from breathing foreign material into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia), UTI, DVT, PE, bedsores, dysphonia, dysphagia, and falls. Aggressive physical and occupational therapies should treat post-stroke complications like contractures, follow-up in the neurology clinic, and consideration of botox injection may help recover from contractures. Rarely, surgery may be needed to remove large blood clots or to open up blocked arteries. Another significant complication is post-stroke depression; we should be treated with citalopram or fluoxetine, which has been proven beneficial and recent studies for post-stroke depression and motor recovery after stroke.

There is a lot of high-quality evidence regarding the prevention and management of stroke, as described in any organized and comprehensive stroke guidelines in 2018.

- Prehospital systems:

- "Time is brain," hence, time is of crucial importance that prehospital arrangements be made so that patients can be brought to the hospital for treatment as early as possible. There is a need for education like BE-FAST (dependence, eye or vision, facial droop, arm weakness, speech slurring, and time), etc., as well as education programs and awareness campaigns to make the general population aware of the importance of time. Especially, African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and other underserved populations are greatly affected due to the lack of awareness. This issue merits attention in a very systemized, targeted manner and campaign. [COR: I and LOE: B-R]
- Activating stroke alert by calling 9–1–1 for any stroke symptom should be encouraged to the public, including family members, who are bystanders witnessing someone with the symptoms described above. [COR-I and LOE B-NR]
- It is a strong recommendation that due to increased awareness and decreased time to transit to the hospital, more patients are treated, and expand programs for the education of healthcare professionals, including physicians, EMTs, and patients. [COR: I and LOE B-NR]

- Hospital stroke teams:

- There should be stress on very organized emergency and stroke teams in the hospital. For that, there should be a validated protocol for standard procedures established as soon as the hospital is alerted of stroke arrival by EMS so stroke alert can be activated. The stroke team should be readily available in the emergency department to manage the stroke appropriately. In summary, the recommendation is that the clinical staff sees the patient within 15 minutes of ED arrival, CT head without contrast takes place within 25 minutes of ED arrival, and TPA or door-to-needle time should be 60 minutes. [COR-I and LOE B-NR]

- Organization and capacity building:

- In small hospitals or primary stroke centers, realistic measures should be in place so that initial studies, including vascular imaging like CT angiograms, are possible in those hospitals before transferring to the larger centers are comprehensive stroke centers. [COR: IIb and LOE: C-LD]
- Mechanical thrombectomy should be performed in the larger stroke centers, with the capacities and capabilities of stroke teams, neurologists, neuro-interventionists, and the availability of advanced imaging, including perfusion scans, etc. [COR: I and LOE: C-EO]

- Data Repositories:

- It is highly encouraged to build date the repository and research registries in the centers so that adherence to the protocols and guidelines as well as improvement in patient outcomes is done [COR: I and LOE: B-NR]

- Telemedicine and telestroke services [COR: I and LOE: A]

- Use of Stroke Scales like NIH stroke scale [COR: I and LOE: B-NR]

- Quality improvement processes and system for stroke  [COR: I and LOE: B-NR]

- To prevent a recurrence, the primary care providers and the stroke nurse should educate the patient on lowering the risk factors; this means discontinuing smoking, exercising regularly, controlling blood pressure and lipids, and eating a healthy diet.

An interprofessional team approach is necessary for improving outcomes in patients with basilar strokes. In addition to the various clinical specialties already covered, a pharmacist should consult for thrombolytic therapy; this may well be a cardiac board-certified pharmacist. The stroke-certified nursing staff is an invaluable resource, irrespective of which direction therapy takes; they can help evaluate the patient, assist during procedures, and monitor the patient's condition following interventions, charting, and reporting their findings for the clinician staff. These types of interprofessional actions enhance patient outcomes in basilar artery occlusion and other types of strokes. [Level 5]
