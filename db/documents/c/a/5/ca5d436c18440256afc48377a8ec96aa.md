Exposure to birds or occupational exposure is the most important clue in the patient's history. C. psittaci commonly presents in young to middle-aged males who complain of fever (most common symptom), chills, headache, myalgia, and dry cough. Symptoms vary from mild to severe systemic disease. In systemic involvement, the patient may present with hepatosplenomegaly and gastrointestinal symptoms. Endocarditis and myocarditis have also been described, and a minimal percentage of patients present with altered mental status. The incubation period is usually 5 to 19 days but can be as long as 28 days. In the pre-antibiotic era, fatal cases were common. Today, imported bird quarantine, treatment, and improved hygiene measures have rendered psittacosis cases rare.

Pulmonary symptoms include a dry cough, and lung auscultation during physical exam may reveal rales or rhonchi. Uncommonly, a pleural rub may be appreciated. A pulse-temperature dissociation (fever and relative bradycardia) has been described for psittacosis pneumonia. Patients may also show signs of photophobia, epistaxis, tinnitus, deafness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and arthralgia if systemically compromised.
