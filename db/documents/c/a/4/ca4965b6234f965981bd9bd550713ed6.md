Neuropathological findings in SSADH deficiency have been described in a single report.

The other findings included congestion of the vessels in the leptomeninges, globus pallidum, and superior colliculus. Granular perivascular calcifications were present in globus pallidi, cerebellar dentate nuclei, and hippocampus. They have been attributed to chronic progressive excitotoxic injury.
