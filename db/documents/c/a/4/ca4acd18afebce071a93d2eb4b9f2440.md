The strongest evidence for cupping therapy’s benefit is for the treatment of pain, particularly musculoskeletal pain, migraine, or tension headache.

Dry cupping is commonly used for musculoskeletal pain and muscular tension.

Overall, dry cupping showed the most benefit in generalized pain conditions, while wet cupping showed the most benefit in inflammatory-related pain conditions, such as herpes zoster infection (shingles).

There have been studies done that have shown the benefits of cupping therapy beyond pain management. In a German study, traditional wet cupping was shown to be effective in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.

As mentioned in the Introduction, to improve patient outcomes, clinicians should understand that cupping therapy is not a substitute treatment for conventional therapies but a complementary therapy. Health professionals should also be aware evidence to support its use for treating most medical disorders is lacking and that some health professionals may mistake cupping bruises as evidence of abuse.
