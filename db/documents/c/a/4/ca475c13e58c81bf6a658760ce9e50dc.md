Type II hypersensitivity reactions require close collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team involving clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), immunologists, nurses, pharmacists, and laboratory staff. This willÂ provide a patient-centered approach, improve outcomes and patient safety, and enhance team performance. In the case of drug allergy, the pharmacist should check the patient's medication record, and the nursing staff should be vigilant and should have the patient clarify any prior allergic reaction to drugs.

Nurses can serve as patient contact points and coordinate activities between interprofessional team members. All persons on the care team must be able to communicate with any other team member in the event of any concerns or changes in patient status. All interventions and observations must be documented in the patient's health record by every team member so everyone has access to the same updated information regarding the case. This interprofessional approach will help drive the best possible patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
