Although there are many causes of dementia, certain risk factors have been associated with dementia and cognitive decline. Evidence shows that the greatest risk factor for late-onset dementia is age, family history, and genetic susceptibility. However, some modifiable risk factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, mid-life obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and history of traumatic brain injury have been known to also be associated with the development of dementia.
