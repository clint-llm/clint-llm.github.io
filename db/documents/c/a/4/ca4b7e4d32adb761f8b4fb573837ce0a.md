Atrial myxoma is a rare disease but has a broad clinical presentation and complication that involves several systems- heart, lungs, brain, and systemic. An interdisciplinary approach isÂ very important to optimize the outcome in patients with atrial myxomas. A thorough examination by primary care providers is crucial. Then radiologists or cardiologists can help with imaging modalities that can help diagnose and characterize the tumor. Prior to surgical resection by cardiothoracic surgeons, patients need to be evaluated by pulmonologists, cardiologists, and anesthesiologists for preoperative risk stratifications. In patients with neurological complications, pulmonary complications, or infectious endocarditis, input from neurologists, hematologists, infectious disease specialists is essential for patient care. In case antiplatelet/anticoagulation therapy or antibiotic treatment is warranted, pharmacists can provide valuable recommendations. A primary team of physicians, nurses, and case managers is mandatory to coordinate and facilitate care for patients with atrial myxoma.
