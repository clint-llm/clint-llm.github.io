Once established, the progression of the dystonia tends to evolve in a stepwise fashion over months to years, with subsequent involvement of additional body parts. Studies reveal that progression to maximum intensity and distribution occurs within 2 years from onset. More rapid progression has been noted in the population with a younger age at onset.

One study attempted to demarcate outcome groups based upon symptom resolution following treatment. In this study of 107 patients being treated for tardive dystonia, 14% were in remission, 39% were improved, and 50% noted either no improvement or exacerbating symptomatology.
