It is of utmost importance to obtain medication, food, and environmental exposure history with special attention to ACEIs and NSAIDs as possible causative factors. Also, find out if prior similar events have happened in the patient or family members. If no factors can be identified, then HAE/AAE should be considered. Distinguishing AAE from HAE can be challenging. However, there are characteristics in the patient’s history that can help distinguish HAE from AAE. Unlike HAE, AAE can be late onset (older than 40 years old). There will also be no family history of HAE, and there may be signs and symptoms that suggest an underlying malignancy

On physical exam, the hallmark of angioedema is localized, well-demarcated, non-pitting edema that most commonly involves the lips, tongue, face, and eyelids. It may also involve the larynx, genitals, and distal extremities. Urticaria may also be present. Angioedema can also cause recurrent, severe abdominal pains mimicking a surgical abdomen, which can lead to partial bowel resection

It is always important to consider other possible diagnoses, like infection, a local reaction to insect bites, congestive heart failure, and renal or liver disease. Characteristics that suggest angioedema include rapid onset, an asymmetric distribution of edema, and absence of symptoms that point to other possible diagnoses.
