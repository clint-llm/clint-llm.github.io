The major complication of PEG tube replacement is accidental peritoneal placement of the tube. Peritoneal tube placement should be suspected after tube replacement or after resuming feeding through the tube, the patient starts having abdominal pain, fever, and signs of frank peritonitis on the exam. If this happens, a prompt investigation should be performed using a contrast x-ray with water-soluble contrast or with a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen. Tube feeds should be stopped immediately. A surgical consult should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated as soon as possible. The patient is then managed conservatively with close hemodynamic monitoring along with surgical assistance if needed.

Other complications are rare, but the tube replacement site can get infected especially if the balloon is underinflated or not opposingÂ the gastric wall. This can lead to leakage of gastric contents into the track. Bleeding due to trauma during tube replacement is rare but can happen.
