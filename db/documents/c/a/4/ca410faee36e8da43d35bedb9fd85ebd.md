Open-angle glaucoma is a chronic, progressive, and irreversible multifactorial optic neuropathy that is characterized by an open angle of the anterior chamber, optic nerve head changes, progressive loss of peripheral vision, followed by central visual field loss. Elevated intraocular pressure is an important risk factor for open-angle glaucoma and can be a result of primary or secondary causes. Improved knowledge of open-angle glaucoma will allow for the prevention of devastating blindness caused by untreated open-angle glaucoma. This condition is asymptomatic and will slowly and irreversibly erode a patients eyesight. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of open-angle glaucoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional interprofessional team in managing patients with open-angle glaucoma.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for open-angle glaucoma.
- Explain how to diagnose open-angle glaucoma.
- Summarize the treatment options available for patients with open-angle glaucoma.

- Review strategies for improving care coordination and communication amongst interprofessional teams to advance treatment of open-angle glaucoma and improve patient outcomes.
