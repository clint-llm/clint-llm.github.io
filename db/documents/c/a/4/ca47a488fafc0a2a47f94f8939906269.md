**History**

In patients with a new diagnosis of cirrhosis of unknown etiology, history of alcohol use (onset, quantity, and frequency of use), illicit drug use, and family history of liver disorders should be elicited. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis of known etiology, history should be elicited regarding prior or ongoing variceal bleeding (hematemesis, melena, hematochezia), ascites (swelling, discomfort, fullness, lower extremity swelling, dyspnea, orthopnea), hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, excessive sleepiness).In patients without cirrhosis with incidental findings of gastric varices, history should be obtained about any personal history of thrombophilia or family history of thrombophilia and history of pancreatic disorders.

**Physical Exam**

A general examination to assess vital signs that include heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation should be performed on all patients at baseline. A focused systemic examination evaluating clinical signs specifically related to cirrhosis and portal hypertension should be performed as described below**.**

**Ocular**

- Scleral icterus

**Neck**

- Elevated jugular venous pulse (right-sided heart failure)

**Pulmonary**

- Pleural effusion (hepatohydrothorax)

**Abdominal**

- Ascites (abdominal distension, fullness of flanks, fluid thrill, puddle sign, shifting dullness, abdominal tenderness)

- Splenomegaly

- Periumbilical collateral circulation (caput-medusae)

**Skin**

- Spider angiomata

**Musculoskeletal**

- Edema

- Icteric skin

- Asterixis

- Palmar erythema

- Dupuytren contracture

- Terry nails

**Genitourinary**

- Testicular atrophy

- Scrotal edema

**Neurological**

- Overt and covert encephalopathy

- Asterixis

**Miscellaneous**

- Gynecomastia

- Fetor hepaticus

**Clinical Features**

- Unlike esophageal varices, gastric varices uncommonly present with acute variceal bleeding and are routinely discovered on screening EGD for varices in patients with portal hypertension.

- The main risk factors for bleeding are the severity of liver dysfunction, location and size of the varices, and presence of bleeding stigmata.

- Patients present with acute gastric variceal bleeding are critically ill on presentation as gastric variceal bleeding tends to be more severe and life-threatening.

- GOV2 subtype of gastric varices bleed more frequently than GOV1 and carry the worst prognosis.

- Alternatively, the patients with segmental portal hypertension secondary to splenic vein thrombosis in pancreatic disorders are diagnosed with gastric varices incidentally based on cross-sectional imaging.
