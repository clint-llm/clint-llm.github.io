CJD is a progressive, fatal disease. Fortunately, there are very few cases reported in the USA, and the risk of contracting the disease is extremely low. Strategies revolve around prevention, with blood centers not permitting first-degree relatives of people with CJD from donating blood. Hunters who would consume or handle elk or deer meat should consider having the meat tested before eating it.
