The actual incidence of uncal herniation is poorly understood. Since uncal herniation can occur secondary to traumatic brain injury, it is essential to understand the occurrence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to highlight an at-risk population. According to the CDC's 2015 Report to Congress on Traumatic Brain Injury, there are approximately 30 million injury-associated emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths every year in the United States. TBI accounts for 16% of injury-related hospitalizations and one-third of injury-related deaths. Specifically, in 2010, the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) estimated that TBIs accounted for about 2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States, either isolated or in combination with other injuries.
