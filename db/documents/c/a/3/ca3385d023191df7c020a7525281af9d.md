Abducens nerve palsy is a disease that requires careful consideration of the underlying pathology that resulted in the physical finding of lateral rectus paresis. This is best done by using a differential diagnosis that follows the anatomy of the nerve to elucidate the cause. Treatment can then be directed to the underlying cause.
