The adverse effects of the intravenous formulation occur locally as it may irritate the injection site; however, the frequency has not been defined. Most common adverse effects include agitation (infants equal to 14%; adults less than 1%), headache (5%), dizziness (1%), diarrhea (2%), and constipation (1%). Due to central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects, longer dosing intervals or reduced doses may be used instead to adjust for the resulting longer elimination half-life of famotidine.
