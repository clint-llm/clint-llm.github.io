Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal infection caused by a dimorphic fungus endemic in Central and South America. The morbidity and mortality caused by this infection are strongly associated with early recognition, choice of therapy, and medication compliance. This activity describes the etiology, pathophysiology, and evaluation of paracoccidioidomycosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of paracoccidioidomycosis.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of paracoccidioidomycosis.
- Outline the management options for paracoccidioidomycosis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by paracoccidioidomycosis.
