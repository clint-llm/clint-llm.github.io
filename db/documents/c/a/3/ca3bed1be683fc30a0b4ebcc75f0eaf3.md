The metacarpals form the osseous base of the complex lever system of flexor and extensor tendons of the hand. Understandably, fractures of the metacarpals disrupt this mechanism causing significant disability for the active or working patient and can come about from several different mechanisms. Due to the complexity of its form and function, orthopedic surgeons and other clinical providers must be able to recognize metacarpal fractures readily and treat these injuries in a timely fashion to avoid complications. This activity will provide the reader with the basics for identifying, treating, and managing complications of metacarpal fractures. It will also go in-depth on the decision-making behind non-operative versus operative treatment, including its benefits and pitfalls.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of metacarpal fractures.
- Review the proper evaluation of metacarpal fractures.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for metacarpal fractures and when to use non-operative versus operative treatment.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with metacarpal fractures.
