The neurological physical exam evaluates light touch, pinprick, vibration using tuning forks, and proprioceptive senses in the extremities. This examination helps the physician to begin to create a differential diagnosis for any problems in the sensation while eventually narrowing down the site of the neurological lesion. The Romberg sign is a useful physical exam finding that can delineate ataxia due to cerebellar problems versus proprioceptive problems. Proprioception is important for maintaining balance; however, it may not present as poor balance when compensated by visual stimuli. Thus a positive Romberg sign indicating sensory proprioceptive deficit is elicited by asking the patient to stand erect with their feet together, assessing for imbalance or sway. The patient should then close their eyes for a full minute, and the examiner should evaluate for imbalance or sway. When the patient shows sway only when with their eyes closed, this is a positive sign. The initial assessment offered by a neurological physical exam gives a standardized way to appraise the sensory, neurological complaints before proceeding further.

Clinical signs and symptoms related to the sensory cortex often present with strokes. The incidence of stroke is higher in western societies due to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle and atherogenic diets. Based on the distribution of symptoms described earlier sensory deficits in various parts of the body can help to determine sites of potential obstruction due to loss of blood supply to their respective parts of the somatosensory cortex. For example, the ACA supplies the superomedial part of the somatosensory cortex. Considering that this area receives sensory input from the lower extremities, loss of sensation in the lower extremities can help localize the source of the stoke to the ACA. The motor supply of the precentral gyrus is supplied by the ACA and MCA as well and follows a similar distribution, causing an additional motor weakness in the corresponding areas as well. Since the mechanosensory modality carried in the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway crosses the midline, the lesions produce a contralateral loss of sensation.

Watershed infarcts mentioned earlier tend to present with the FAST mnemonic, which stands for facial weakness, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to act. When a stroke does not receive a timely intervention, symptoms can lead to numbness and hyperreflexia in the affected area. The watershed strokes affect more than an ACA or MCA stroke and can present with additional deficits of bilateral vision loss or even proximal limb weakness that does not affect the face, hands, or feet. Watershed infarcts can be caused by congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, thrombi, or carotid artery stenosis, to name a few.

Direct lesions of the parietal lobe can result in a wide variety of somatosensory defects as well. Integrative sensorimotor functions can be affected and lead to presentations based on the severity of the lesion. An example of a loss of integrative sensorimotor function from parietal defects involving the somatosensory cortex is tactile apraxia. Tactile apraxia is a defect in active touch feedback when manipulating objects with our hands that integrate the sensory aspect of digital palpation and spatial features of objects with the brain's motor aspect to manipulate them. It is important to note that movements of the hand without the use of an object, are intact. Motor function without tactile feedback is intact. Lesions that affect the primary somatosensory cortex can result in a loss in the ability to discriminate objects using the touch modality only, such as shape, size, or texture. Lesions that affect the secondary somatosensory cortex affect the recognition of objects based on tactile appraisal over sensory discrimination. An individual with such a lesion will have trouble recognizing an object based on touch, known as tactile apraxia unilaterally and astereognosis bilaterally. It is important to understand that the somatosensory nervous system interconnects with other areas of the brain that require intact sensory input to interact with surrounding stimuli.
