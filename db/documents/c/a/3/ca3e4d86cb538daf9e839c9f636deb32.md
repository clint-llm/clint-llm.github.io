Transconjunctival blepharoplasty is generally performed under sedation in a surgical theatre. Although the procedure may be performed under local anesthesia in the surgical office, many practitioners choose to have proper suction, lighting, cautery, and sedation anesthesia to allow the surgeon to concentrate on the procedure. A good assistant is also vital to allow adequate exposure to the surgical field.
