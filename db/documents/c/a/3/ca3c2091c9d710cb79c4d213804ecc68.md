Early isolated case reports suggested that brachioradial pruritus was more common in males. Later larger studies revealed that brachioradial pruritus is seen more commonly in females than males in a ratio 3:1. The mean age at diagnosis is 59, but wide variations in age have been reported. Brachioradial pruritus is more common in lighter skin types, especially those with Fitzpatrick type I and type II skin, than in darker skin types. This factor further supports the role of UVR in the pathogenesis of brachioradial pruritus.
