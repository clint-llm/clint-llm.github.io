Attempts to reduce chlorine gas exposures focus on three strategies. First, improved transportation safety of a large volume of liquid chlorine, typically transported by rail. Second, development and adherence to strict industrial protocols for the use of chlorine to prevent inadvertent industrial exposure. Third, consumer education about the risk of mixing cleaning chemicals. Providers will need to educate patients exposed to chlorine gas in their homes. Failure to understand the risks of mixing certain solutions may lead to repeated exposures.
