**Hematoxylin and Eosin**

As the name implies, it is two stains done in subsequent steps. The hematoxylin is a basic dye that stains acidic structures. The resulting color is a purple/blue hue, and structures that are targeted with this dye are named Basophilic. Basophilic structures include DNA in cell nuclei, RNA in ribosomes, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Eosin is a counterstain done after hematoxylin and is an acidic dye that targets basic structures. The resulting color is a pink/red hue, and structures that attract eosin are called eosinophilic.

**Gram Stain**

The gram stain is a sequential staining technique invented for differentiating bacterial species. Its major utility lies in determining the causative organism of bacterial infection by staining the cell wall.

**Giemsa Stain**

The Giemsa stain is commonly used in hematology for its superior ability to stain bone marrow, plasma cells, and mast cells. It is also very popular for identifying blood parasites.

**Periodic Acid Schiff Reaction**

The periodic acid Schiff Reaction Stain, often called the PAS stain, is a way to examine structures containing high amounts of carbohydrate molecules, such as the intestinal brush border, renal tubular cells, mucus, and reticular fibers of connective tissue.

**Masson's Trichrome**

Masson's Trichrome Stain is a stain that can yield a multicolor result on the tissue. Even though it has red counterstains, it is popular for its ability to stain collagen fibers blue. Masson's Trichrome can identify cardiac fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, and muscular dystrophy.

**Congo Red**

Congo red is a water-soluble blue dye that produces a red solution at a pH of 3.0-5.0. Its many aromatic rings can stack together through hydrophobic interactions and collect in tissue. Most notably, Congo red can stain amyloid fibers red and orange color, making it a useful study in amyloidosis. When viewed under polarized light in a microscope, Congo-red-stained tissues high in amyloid will show with bright "apple" green birefringence. PMID:

**Prussian Blue**

The Prussian blue stain is useful for identifying iron stores in the body.

**Mucicarmine**

Mucicarmine stains mucin, a secretion produced in epithelial and connective tissue cells.Cryptococcus.

**Sudan Black**

The Sudan Black dye stains lipid-containing structures like triglycerides and lipoproteins, a dark black or brown color.

**Oil Red O**

Similar to the Sudan Black dye, Oil Red O is the most common dye used on hydrophobic fat or lipids, substances that are traditionally difficult to stain. Oil Red O has high utility in visualizing atherosclerotic plaques and hepatic and muscular lipid accumulation.

**Silver Stain**

Silver stains are a larger category of stains used for the histopathological study of accumulation-based diseases in neurology. There are several methods to silver staining, including Bielschowsky, Gallyas, Bodian, and Campbell-Switzer. The staining method chosen is dependent on the neurological lesion in question, as each method speaks to a differing sensitivity and specificity. In general, the methods attach silver ions or salt complexes to the target tissue. Then, they must be reduced in situ, and the subsequent silver particles accumulate and can be analyzed.

The silver stains are very known for detecting amyloid beta-protein (Aß) in Alzheimer's disease and Pick bodies in Picks Disease. When dyed, the amyloid plaques become darker. They can range from yellow to black, depending on the size or amount of amyloid plaques.

**Nissl Stain**

The Nissl Stain, also called the Cresyl Violet Stain, uses basic aniline dye to study neuronal structure in the brain and spinal cord. Neuropil stains blueish purple and granular. The Nissl substance has a high amount of ribosomal RNA, thus attracting the dye, appearing dark blue, and making the cytoplasm appear mottled. The advantage of using a Nissl stain for evaluating neuronal pathology is that it will recognizably stain the neuronal cytoplasm without staining the perikarya of other cell structures, like astrocytes.

**Papanicolaou Stain**

The Papanicolaou stain colloquially referred to as the Pap smear is a cytological staining technique best known for detecting cervical cancer in female patients. The cells to be stained are collected from gynecological smears, sputum samples, brushings, fine needle aspiration materials, and washings. The multichromatic stain involves five dyes: Hematoxylin for the nucleus, Orange G for keratin, eosin for superficial structures, Light Green SF for cytoplasm, and Bismarck Brown.
