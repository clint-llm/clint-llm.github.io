Intraoperative complications include hemorrhage from major vessels, chyle fistula, pneumothorax, and damage to multiple nerves (particularly CN VII, CN X-XII, sympathetic chain, the brachial plexus, phrenic nerve, and lingual nerve). The spinal accessory nerve is commonly at risk, with a reported injury rate of 33% in modified radical neck dissections (and intentionally sacrificed in radical neck dissection) in a recent meta-analysis.

Postoperatively, complications are uncommon. They include wound dehiscence, percutaneous or pharyngocutaneous fistula, infection, hematoma, sialocele, and chyleÂ fistula.
