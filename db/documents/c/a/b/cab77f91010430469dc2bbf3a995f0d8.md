Thrombectomy is a mechanical interventional procedure by which a blood clot or thrombus is removed under image guidance using endovascular devices. Thrombectomy is most commonly used in acute cerebral ischemic stroke, although it is also a procedure used for clot removal in acute myocardial infarction (MI) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Mechanical thrombectomy utilizes various techniques. Most commonly, it uses different catheter-based therapies, including stent-retrieval, direct aspiration, or a combination of both.
