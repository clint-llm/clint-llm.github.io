Brachium is a Latin word meaning the upper arm. This part of the upper limb contains powerful muscles that carry a considerable portion of the upper limb function. Also, vital peripheral nerves pass through the upper limb, namely the brachial plexus neurons. The brachial artery is the single most important blood vessel that gives branches to supply the whole upper limb. Because of the previously mentioned valuable structures, injury to the upper arm can cause severe problems in the entire upper limb.
