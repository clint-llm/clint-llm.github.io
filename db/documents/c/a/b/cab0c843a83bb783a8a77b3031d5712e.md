The multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) is a more recent advancement in electroretinographic testing, which enables a rapid assessment of retinal function from many areas at the same time. The mfERG records multiple retinal responses simultaneously using a contrast-reversing stimulus comprising an array of 64 or 103 black-and-white hexagons over 30Â to 40 degrees of the central visual field. In turn, the mfERG produces a topographic representation of the central retinal function, which provides valuable spatial information for mapping focal deficits in the retina by layer and by region.

Analysis of the mfERG waveform components can provide useful diagnostic information for distinguishing various anterior visual pathway diseases, especially when the etiology of vision dysfunction remains uncertain following standard clinical examination.
