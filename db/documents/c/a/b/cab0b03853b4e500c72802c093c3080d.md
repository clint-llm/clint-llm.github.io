A thorough history should be taken, including prenatal and birth history, maternal medications, and any maternal risk factors, including smoking, alcohol, or drug use. There is an increased risk of TEV with maternal smoking. However, no association has been seen with alcohol use.

On the physical exam of the newborn, the foot will assume a position of equinus and varus. Many times a prenatal ultrasound may indicate the possibility of TEV before the birth of the infant. The acronym CAVE (cavus, adduction, varus, equinus) is useful to recall the position of the affected foot. The midfoot arch is in cavus. The forefoot metatarsals are adducted, while the calcaneus is in varus and equinus.
