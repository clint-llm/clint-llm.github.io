Although found in the upper thorax of the human body, the subclavian arteries are linked closely to some major neuronal pathways. Near the right subclavian the vagus nerve runs vertically anterior to the root of the artery while the recurrent laryngeal nerve, a branch of the vagus nerve, runs vertically posteriorly to the root. These cause a fork inferior to the root of the right subclavian from the branch point of the recurrent nerve from the right vagus nerve. On the left side, both the left vagus and the phrenic nerve run vertically anterior to the subclavian artery. Since the left subclavian artery branches directly off the aortic arch the left recurrent laryngeal nerve does not have theÂ thin brachiocephalic trunk to travel around and must instead course around the aortic arch itself which therefore causes the length of the left recurrent to be significantly longer than its right counterpart.
