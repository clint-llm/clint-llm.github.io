The risk factors for post-transplant malignancy are the patient, transplant, and medication-related.

**Patient-related Risk Factors**

The advanced age of the patient is a well-described risk factor, and it is an established risk factor for the development of skin cancer. Sun exposure, prior history of cancer in a transplant recipient are also strong risk factors. Acuna et al. in their meta-analysis showed that pre-transplant malignancy correlates with an increased risk of cancer-specific mortality and of developing de novo malignancies after transplantation, compared with solid organ transplant recipients without a pretransplant malignancy.

**Transplant-related Risk Factors**

Differences in the type of transplant (living versus deceased) correlate with cancer risk. Patients who receive kidneys from a living donor have a lower risk for genitourinary cancer and PTLD.

**Medication-related Risk Factors**

The immunosuppressive drugs impair immunosurveillance of neoplastic cells and increase the incidence of virally induced malignancies. The type, intensity, and duration of immunosuppressive therapy all influence the rate of carcinogenesis. These immunosuppressive drugs, for example, biologic agents (anti-thymocyte globulin, basiliximab), corticosteroids, antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil), calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), and mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin [sirolimus], everolimus) all have been implicated.
