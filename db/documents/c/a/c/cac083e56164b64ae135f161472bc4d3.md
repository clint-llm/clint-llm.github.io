Platinum-based chemotherapy, along with second active cytotoxic agents, is usually considered in patients who require chemotherapy. The chance of toxicity increases beyond four to six cycles of therapy and is not recommended beyond that. In patients with no optimal response, maintenance therapy can be continued with one or more components, but platinum-based treatment is typically discontinued, given its severe toxicity.
