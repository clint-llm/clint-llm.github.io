Specimen collection uses whole blood(WB) and buccal mucosa swabs. The volume of the sample/specimen should be 7 mL in WB-Lavender-top (EDTA) tube and four buccal swabs (in a sealed buccal swab envelop kit). It is advisable to maintain and dry the specimens at room temperature. Precautions are necessary regarding the prevention of hemolysis or dried specimens that interfere with appropriate test results.
