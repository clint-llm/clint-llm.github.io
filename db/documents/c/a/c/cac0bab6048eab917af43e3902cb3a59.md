The prognosis for abnormal uterine bleeding is favorable but also depends on the etiology. The main goal of evaluating and treating chronic AUB is to rule out serious conditions such as malignancy and improve the patient's quality of life, keeping in mind current and future fertility goals and other comorbid medical conditions that may impact treatment or symptoms. Prognosis also differs based on medical versus surgical treatment. Non-hormonal treatment with anti-fibrinolyticÂ and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications has been shown to reduce blood loss during menstruation by up to 50%.

With the surgical techniques, randomized clinical trials and reviews have shown that endometrial ablation controlled bleeding more effectively at 4 months postoperatively, but at 5 years, there was no difference compared to medical management. When trials have compared hysterectomy versus levonorgestrel-releasing IUD, the hysterectomy group had better results at 1 year. There was no difference in the quality of life seen at 5 and 10 years, but many women in the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD group had undergone a hysterectomy by 10 years.
