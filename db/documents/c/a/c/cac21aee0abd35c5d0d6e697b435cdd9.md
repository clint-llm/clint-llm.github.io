When a meniscal tear is suspected, imaging should begin with radiographs that include AP, lateral, oblique, sunrise, and weight bearing views to assess for concomitant bony pathologies, loose bodies, and osteoarthritis. Using arthroscopy as the gold standard, MRI is the best mode of imaging to diagnose and characterize meniscal tears. Â MR imaging has been found to be 93% sensitive and 88% specific for medial meniscal tears, and 79% sensitive and 96% specific for lateral meniscal tears.
