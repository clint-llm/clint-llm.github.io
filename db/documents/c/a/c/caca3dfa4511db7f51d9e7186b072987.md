Though thrombolysis is administered locally during CDT, there is a risk of systemic effects of thrombolysis therapy. Systemic thrombolytic therapy is the cause of many of the severe CDT complications (i.e., severe bleeding). Therefore, the main contraindication to CDT is a high risk of bleeding.

Any person with a prior ischemic stroke, cerebral bleed, cerebral mass, vascular deformation, recent ulcer in the gastrointestinal tract, recent brain/spine surgery, major abdominal or pelvic surgery,Â or any source of active bleeding are not considered candidates for CDT therapy.

Dose adjustments are made for patients with moderate risk for bleeding to prevent these such complications. Those with contraindications to CDT therapy are usually contraindicated for systemic thrombolysis as well. These patients are treated with anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet therapy, or supportive care only.
