The shoulder is the most regularly dislocated joint in the body; the dislocation may anteriorly, posteriorly, inferiorly, or anterior-superiorly. Anterior locations are the most common. Patients with prior shoulder dislocation are more prone to redislocation. Reoccurance occurs because the tissue does not heal properly or it becomes lax. Younger patients have a much higher frequency of redislocation; most like due to higher activity level. Patients who tear their rotator cuffs or fracture the glenoid also have a higher incidence of redislocation.
