The primary function of the dural venous sinuses is to drain all venous blood within the cranial cavity and deliver it back to the cardiovascular circulation via the internal jugular vein below the jugular foramen, which will further drain into the superior vena cava before reaching the heart. Aside from draining venous blood, superior sagittal sinus also participates in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation by serving as the main location for CSF return after passing through arachnoid granulations.
