The only absolute contraindication to contrast media in fluoroscopy is a previously documented severe allergic reaction to iodinated contrast. However, severe reactions to contrast agents are relatively rare in modern medicine. With the introduction of non-ionic low osmolarity contrast agents, the incidence of anaphylactic reactions significantly decreased.Â  The incidence of severe reactions to non-ionic contrasts agents is estimated to be approximately 0.01% to 0.04%. Mild reactions such as nausea, vomiting, and urticaria occur at an incidence of approximately 3%.
