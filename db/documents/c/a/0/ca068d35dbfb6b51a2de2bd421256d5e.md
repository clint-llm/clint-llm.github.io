Patients with an allergy to any constituent of emtricitabine should avoid taking this drug. Emtricitabine combined with tenofovir as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is contraindicated as monotherapy for patients with a positive HIV status. This monotherapy can lead to HIV drug resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Emtricitabine alone has not demonstrated any significant drug interactions.
