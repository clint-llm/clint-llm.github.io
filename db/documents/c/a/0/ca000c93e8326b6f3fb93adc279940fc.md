Initially, patients get misdiagnosed with bursitis and osteoarthritis (due to presenting complaints of pain in neck and shoulder) and may lead to persistence of symptoms and delay in diagnosis up to 5 to 10 months in some cases.

Adequate pain control measures are important when taking care of patients with superior sulcus tumors, as pain is the most debilitating symptoms about which patients complain.

The overall prognosis of the disease is quite poor, and so the interprofessional team should focus on prevention measures and educating the population at risk (primarily smokers). An interprofessional approach to this disease is best, involving physicians in multiple specialties, nursing, and pharmacy, as well as other ancillary personnel (respiratory and other therapists). Primary prevention education should start at the level of pharmacists, nurses, and primary care physicians. Smokers should be encouraged to quit smoking and have regular guidelines determined, age-appropriate screening (annual low dose CT scan in smokers age 55 to 80 years of age as per USPSTF recommendations). Early diagnosis and treatment have a better prognosis.
