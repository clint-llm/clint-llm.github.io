The exact cause of multiple system atrophy and its subtypes is unknown. However, there are several hypotheses that have been heavily researched and proposed. The vast majority of proposed disease mechanisms encompass the accumulation of intracellular alpha-synuclein. More recently, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation have been suggested in its pathogenesis.

Further studies are ongoing and suggest that the excess alpha-synuclein is either a result of genetic overexpression in oligodendrocytes of affected patients or a result of increased uptake from the surrounding extracellular environment.
