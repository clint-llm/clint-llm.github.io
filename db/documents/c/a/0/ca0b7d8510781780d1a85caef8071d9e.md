Common indications for a bidirectional Glenn or hemi-Fontan include hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), tricuspid atresia, double inlet left or right ventricle, pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, unbalanced atrioventricular canal defects, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, and anatomic variants that cause significant hypoplasia of either ventricle. Based on analyses from the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set, the bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure has its lowest mortality risk if undertaken three to six months following Stage I repair, or the Norwood procedure.

Of the 399 patients who survived to a BDG, the three-year survival rate was 87%, and the overall transplant free-survival was 68%. Analysis from the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative (NPC-QIC) registry revealed that patients who had a BDG performed after 5.1 months of age had higher mortality, suggest a marked benefit for earlier surgical correction.
