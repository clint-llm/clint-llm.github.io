Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that belongs to the dihydropyridine subclass. It is primarily used as an antihypertensive and antianginal medication.

**FDA Approved Indications**[

- **Chronic stable angina**- Nifedipine reduced the frequency of angina and increased the mean exercise time in the IMAGE trial. Reflex tachycardia may limit its effectiveness; the addition of a beta-blocker can overcome this limitation. A long-acting formulation is preferred (extended-release).

- **Vasospastic angina**- It can be used as a second line of treatment.

- **Hypertension**- May be used as monotherapy or in combination with several different medications to manage hypertension (such as ACE inhibitor, ARB, thiazide diuretic).

- Raynaud phenomenon

- Severe hypertension during pregnancy and post-partum hypertension
