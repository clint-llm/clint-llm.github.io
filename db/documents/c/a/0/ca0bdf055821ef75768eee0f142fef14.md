Recompression of patients with arterial gas embolism is a true emergency and outcomes are directly time dependent. Most patients recompressed within 2 hours of the gas embolism due well, with a marked fall off in the percentage of patients recovering with delays to the treatment of 6 hours or more. There have been recorded reversal of symptoms with recompression up to 24 hours after symptom onset, making this a reasonable time window and one generally accepted by expert consensus in the field.Â  For extraordinary circumstances or compassionate therapy reasons, recompression treatment up to 48 hours after the embolization has had limited success.

Recommendations for returning to diving after arterial gas embolism should be tailored to the patient and the situation. Divers who have suffered arterial gas embolism where there is no discernible precipitating event, e.g. loss of buoyancy control, sudden depth change, or rapid or panic ascent, should undergo radiographic evaluation for structural abnormalities of the lung. If abnormalities such as bullae, blebs, or cysts are found, the diver should be counseled against returning to diving and referred to a pulmonologist. If a precipitating event exists, causation can be reasonably inferred, and the diver has no residual symptoms, he or she should be offered counseling on preventive measures, and consideration may be given for returning to diving. Guidelines for recovery periods prior to returning to diving after pulmonary barotrauma vary
