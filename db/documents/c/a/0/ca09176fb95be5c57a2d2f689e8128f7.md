Tympanocentesis is a relatively safe procedure; however, potential complications include:

- Bleeding: This is usually minimal, and hemostasis is easily and quickly achieved. Any question of a high-riding jugular bulb is a contraindication to this procedure.

- Pain: Even with the use of topical anesthetic agents, the medial aspect of the tympanic membrane can still retain some sensitivity and thus causing the patient to experience some pain.

- Chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TM), damage to other intricate middle ear structures such as the ossicles, facial nerve can also occur, however, the chances are very low when tympanocentesis is carefully performed, as it is a needle-hole only.

- Ossicular damage: This is avoided by not instrumenting the posterior superior quadrant of the TM where the ossicles lie.
