# Continuing Education Activity

Gardnerella vaginalis is an anaerobic bacterium that is the causative agent in bacterial vaginosis (BV). This bacteria normally is part of the vaginal flora and any overgrowth can cause BV which is the most common cause of vaginal discharge. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Gardnerella and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of Gardnerella infection.
- Identify the typical patient history in those with Gardnerella infection.
- Review the use of antibiotics in the treatment of Gardnerella infection.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Gardnerella infection.

# Introduction

Gardnerella vaginalis is an anaerobic bacterium that resides in the normal vaginal flora.Lactobacilli species, but when organisms such as Gardnerella begin to overgrow and become the dominant species, this leads to bacterial vaginosis (BV).Gardnerella was named after Hermann L. Gardner, who discovered the bacterium in 1955.

# Etiology

Although Gardnerella is not considered to be contagious, the role of transmissibility is yet to be completely understood.Lactobacilli with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria such as G. vaginalis.

Historically, bacterial vaginosis was called G. vaginitis because it was believed that this bacterium caused the condition.

Factors that may play a role in the development of bacterial vaginosis include frequent tub baths, douching, multiple sex partners, use of over the counter intravaginal hygiene products and increased frequency of sexual intercourse.

# Epidemiology

Studies have detected G. vaginalis in up to 50% of women even without symptoms of BV.Gardnerella may be part of the normal vaginal flora.Gardnerella has consistently been isolated as a key pathogen in BV, suggesting a high overall prevalence of Gardnerella in this population.

BV is most common in African American women compared to Caucasians. The condition rarely develops n males. BV is a condition seen in women of reproductive age.

# Pathophysiology

Although uncertain, it is thought that most BV infections start with a biofilm created by G. vaginalis which then allows other opportunistic bacteria to grow.

G. vaginalis itself produces a pore-forming toxin, vaginolysin, that can only affect human cells.Gardnerella’s virulence.Gardnerella.

# Histopathology

Gardnerella is a non-spore-forming, non-motile Coccobacillus.Gardnerella is colistin-oxolinic acid blood sugar.Gardnerella has a thin gram-positive cell wall but is considered to be gram-variable because it can appear either gram-positive or gram-negative under the microscope due to the varying visibility of this thin cell wall.

# History and Physical

Women colonized with G. vaginalis are typically asymptomatic unless they have bacterial vaginosis.

# Evaluation

Before the identification of the rapid identification method, the only way to isolate Gardnerella was by growing cultures on selective agar medium.Gardnerella were able to be isolated without the need for culture and Gram stain.

Occasionally a Gram stain of the vaginal fluid is still done to examine the predominant strain of bacteria to make a microbiological diagnosis of BV. This technique, referred to as Nugent criteria, has a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 83%, respectively.

# Treatment / Management

Asymptomatic Gardnerella colonization does not need to be treated. It has even been reported that up to 30% of cases of BV may even resolve on its own without treatment.

# Differential Diagnosis

A proper pelvic exam can help to narrow down the differntial diagnosis and exclude other similarly presenting diseases such as herpes simplex virus.

# Prognosis

Most uncomplicated cases of bacterial vaginosis resolve with treatment. However, recurrences are not uncommon. Over time, BV is a risk factor for acquiring HIV. Over the past decade, there have been multiple reports of resistant strains that do not resolve with conventional treatment.

# Complications

BV can lead to the following:

- Increased risk for endometritis and salpingitis

- Increased risk of post-surgery infections

- Adverse outcomes in pregnancy including premature labor, premature rupture of membranes and postpartum endometritis.

- Pelvic inflammatory disease

- Neonatal meningitis

# Pearls and Other Issues

Untreated BV can lead to increased risk of pregnancy complications and STIs, including HIV.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Gardnerella is a common genital infection that is often encountered by the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, internist, and the gynecologist.  Asymptomatic Gardnerella colonization does not need to be treated as nearly 30% of cases resolve spontaneously. All symptomatic patients need treatment but despite treatment, recurrences are common.

Untreated BV can lead to increased risk of pregnancy complications and STIs, including HIV.

These patients need to be followed by the nurse practitioner until all symptoms have disappeared.

Even though BV is not a sexually transmitted infection, the nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the importance of safe sex measures, avoidance of multiple sex partners and use of barrier protection.
