While the role of an experienced thoracic surgeon cannot be overemphasized, it is also crucial to consult with an interdisciplinary team of specialists. The operating team consists of an anesthesiologist, surgical assistants, technical assistant, and the nursing staff. An experienced pulmonologist and radiologist must be engaged in the care of these patients as they play a vital role in preoperative and postoperative management. Patients undergoing decortication for chronic empyema might also require intensive monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the initial postoperative period. Therefore, the involvement of an intensivist is always beneficial. Nurses also play a vital role in the postoperative lung expansion by ensuring periodic chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry. The pharmacist might ensure that the patient is on appropriate formulation and doses of anticholinergic medications. Thus, detailed planning and discussion with the interprofessional team are highly recommended to decrease morbidity and to improve outcomes.
