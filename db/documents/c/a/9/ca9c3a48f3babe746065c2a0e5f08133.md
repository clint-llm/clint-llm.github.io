The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus  every three years starting at age ten years (or at the onset of puberty) for patients who are:

- Obese (body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for age)

- Overweight (BMI greater than or equal to the 85thpercentile) and have at lease two risk factors (positive family history, higher risk race or ethnicity, signs of insulin resistance, maternal history of gestational DM).

Diagnostic criteria:

- Random plasma blood glucose 200 mg/dl or greater with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, or weight loss.

- Fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dl or higher in an asymptomatic patient.

- Oral glucose tolerance test with blood sugar 200 mg/dl or greater at two hours post ingestion.

- Hemoglobin A1c > 6.5%.

If the diagnosis between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is not clear, helpful labs include fasting insulin or c peptide (both usually high or normal in type 2 diabetes mellitus, low in type 1 diabetes mellitus ), and autoantibodies for type 1 diabetes mellitus.
