Both the digestive system and accessory structures have a complex nerve infrastructure that often goes unnoticed. Celiac ganglia are nerve bundles located in the upper abdomen as part of the autonomic nervous system that is functionally responsible for innervating the digestive tract and abdominal visceral tissue. The ganglia serve as integrative centers for coordinating intestinal motility as well as secretion and absorption throughout the digestive tract. The ganglia's close tie with the gastrointestinal tract makes them essential in a variety of clinical scenarios, including pancreatic cancer and gastroparesis.
