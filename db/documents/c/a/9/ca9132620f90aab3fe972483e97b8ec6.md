The formation of the Harrison groove affects the diaphragm and the intercostal musculature significantly. Respiratory illness during infancy and early childhood, occurring before the maturity of these structures, creates a sulcus that lasts throughout childhood as an indicator of a chronic disease or past acute illnesses. The intercostal muscles make the Harrison groove more prominent as they pull the upper ribs upward and forwards. In contrast, the lower ribs move outwards and backward to increase the transverse diameter of the thoracic cavity.
