Posterior shoulder dislocation are often managed by an inter-professional team that includes an orthopedic nurse, emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon and a trauma surgeon. While the diagnosis is relatively simple, sometimes those injuries are missed and present late, and can have a profound impact on the patient's function. Healthcare workers need to be aware of the potential complications which include fracture and neurovascular injury. In addition, patients may developÂ soft tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears, especially in the elderly, and these need to be promptly recognized and addressed to reduce the risk of long-term disability. Recurrence of posterior shoulder dislocation can occur and is often associated with prolonged recovery.

Proper referral to an orthopedist or specialist in shoulder injury should be ensured to avoid the long-term complications that can be associated with posterior shoulder dislocations.
