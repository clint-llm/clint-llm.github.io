**Acute Cholangitis**

One of the most feared complications of biliary obstruction is acute ascending cholangitis, which is an infection of the biliary tree due to obstruction, which can quickly lead to systemic sepsis and resultant multi-organ failure.

Acute cholangitis can present as Charcot’s triad (right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice) or Reynold’s pentad (Charcot's triad with mental status change and hemodynamic shock). Important and helpful laboratory evaluation includes elevated White blood cell count with leukocytosis, Abnormal liver testing with elevated bilirubin levels, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Elevation of bilirubin is generally in the form of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Important diagnostic tests include abdominal ultrasound, CT scan of the abdomen, and MRCP.

Severe cases of cholangitis present with

- Hypotension requiring any vasopressor

- Mental status change

- PaO2/FiO2 less than 300

- Serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL

- INR greater than 1.5

- Platelet count less than 100000/mm^3

**Treatment**

**General Principles**

- Initial management for acute cholangitis requires admission to the hospital for IVF resuscitation and electrolyte replacement, pain control, and antibiotics with activity against enteric streptococci, coliforms, and anaerobes are generally needed.

- Low-risk community-acquired infections can be treated with ertapenem or piperacillin-tazobactam or combination therapy like ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin with metronidazole.

- High-risk community-acquired infections can be treated with imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam or combination therapy such as cefepime or ceftazidime with metronidazole.

**Drainage Procedures**Most patients with cholangitis will eventually require one of the following:

- Decompression procedure with****ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)

- Endoscopic removal of biliary stones with drainage of bile, often with sphincterotomy, PTC (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography)

- Insertion of a needle into the biliary tract percutaneously for drainage, removal of stones, and possible placement of the biliary stent or surgical drainage

- Open or laparoscopic surgical intervention with biliary decompression, removal of the obstruction, and cholecystectomy if warranted and the patient is stable
