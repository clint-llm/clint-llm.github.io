Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin used to manage and treat megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid has FDA approval for treating megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias due to folic deficiency. This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for folic acid as a valuable agent in managing megaloblastic anemia and preventing other disorders. One of the beneficial roles of folate appears to be its ability to reduce homocysteine levels in neural tube defects. In addition, this activity will highlight the adverse event profile and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent to healthcare teams dealing with conditions that can benefit from folic acid.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of folic acid.
- Describe the adverse effects of folic acid.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for folic acid.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care to advance folic acid management and improve outcomes.
