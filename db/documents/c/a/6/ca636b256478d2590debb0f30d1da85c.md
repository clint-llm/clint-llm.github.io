Non-surgical management should include anti-inflammatories, physical therapy, ultrasound modalities, and at times, corticosteroid injections, but these all supply temporary pain relief.

In the setting of progressive symptoms, surgical management should merit strong consideration. The goal of surgery is to increase the canal space, which will lessen/eliminate cord compression. It is now a general recommendation to surgically intervene earlier as opposed to a carefully waiting period. Surgical intervention canÂ involve either an anterior or posterior approach.

A posterior approach is preferable in lordosis deformities and when the pathology occurs at the posterior aspect of the canal. One option is a laminectomy (ideally with preoperative lordosis greater than 10 degrees and absence of instability). Posterior approaches possibly have higher infection rates compared to anterior.

Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is performed via an anterior approach. This can involve up to 3 disc levels. It is reported that 9% to 27% of patients will have a transient sore throat and dysphagia, usually resolving within 12 weeks. The most common neurologic complication is recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in 3% of patients.
