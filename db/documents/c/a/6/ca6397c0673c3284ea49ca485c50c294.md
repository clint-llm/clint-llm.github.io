The penis can be divided into the dorsal surface, ventral surface, base (proximal), shaft (middle) and glans (distal). The dorsal region contains the superficial dorsal vein, deep dorsal vein, dorsal artery, and dorsal nerve. This dorsal nerve is anesthetized during the dorsal nerve block to aid with pain control during circumcisions.

The major components of the penis include the urethra, corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, glans, and the foreskin. The 2 corporaÂ cavernosa lie ventral to the dorsal nerves and vasculature. They become engorged with blood to promote erection. The corpus spongiosum lies ventral to the corpora cavernosa. It houses the urethra. The urethra starts at the bladder and runs through the length of the penis to end at the glans of the penis. The foreskin covers the entire penis and is trimmed distally during circumcision to expose the glans.
