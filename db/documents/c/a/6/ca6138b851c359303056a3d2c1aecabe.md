Direct exposure to gastric acid damages the laryngeal epithelium. Ciliary flow is impeded below a pH of 5.0 and halted at pH 2.0. With decreased ciliary flow, there is also a decrease in infection resistance. Risk factors for LPR parallel those of GERD, including consuming a diet heavy in acidic or fatty foods and caffeine or alcohol, eating large meals before going to sleep, obesity, and smoking - the latter of which is also a risk factor for Reinke's edema, which causes hoarseness and a lowering of the fundamental frequency of the voice, similar to LPR.
