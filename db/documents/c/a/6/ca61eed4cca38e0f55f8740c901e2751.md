Cardiac trauma can be grouped by the method of injury as either blunt or penetrating with outcomes ranging from lethal injuries to spontaneously resolving arrhythmias. Those with lethal injuries often succumb quickly with some documenting over 90% of individuals expiring before arriving at a hospital, and only a 20-75% survival rate of those that make it to the hospital.
