Proper perioperative planning is critical to avoid perioperative complications and to achieve a cosmetically optimal result. Important cutaneous landmarks, cosmetic units, and relaxed skin tension lines should be considered in pre-procedural planning to camouflage the resultant scar. You can provide tension and compression to the skin to alter the tension in the surgical field to identify skin tension lines, as well as ask the patient to move a limb through its range of motion for a lesion close to a joint or to smile/grimace for lesions of the face.
