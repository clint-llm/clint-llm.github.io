Following an episode of serum sickness or serum sickness-like reaction, patients should be counseled to avoid the offending agent indefinitely. The patient should be educated on the generic and brand names of the medication to ensure proper avoidance. Patients should understand that, after a single episode of serum sickness, re-exposure to the same agent can result in a more severe course of illness. It is currently unclear whether or not patients can safely be medicated with agents of the same class following an episode of serum sickness, but some experts argue that structurally-related medications should be avoided.
