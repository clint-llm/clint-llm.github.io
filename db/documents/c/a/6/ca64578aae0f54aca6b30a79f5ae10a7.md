Oncologic surgeries for breast cancer often leave cosmetically significant defects. Several strategies have been developed to reconstruct acquired absence of the breast. These strategies categorized into autologous and implant-based reconstructions.

Transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flaps are one option for autologous breast reconstruction. TRAM flaps can be used as a pedicled or free flap. The pedicled TRAM was first described by Dr. Hartrampf in 1982.
