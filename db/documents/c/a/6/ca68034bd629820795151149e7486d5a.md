Height assessment can be estimated using the patient's wingspan or directly measured with a tape measure or stadiometer. Using wingspan to estimate height or a tape measure for direct measurement yields inaccurate measurements compared to the gold standard method utilizing a stadiometer.

**Commonly Used Instruments for Measuring Height**

- Measuring tape

- A horizontal length scale (HLS) is a flexible horizontal scale used to measure an infant's recumbent length.

- Infantometer. The infantometer measures the recumbent length of an infant with greater accuracy by securely holding the infant in position.

- Anthropometer rod. The anthropometer rod consists of four equal rods and can be used to measure height up to a range of 2 meters.

- Stadiometer. The stadiometer consists of a ruler and a sliding horizontal headpiece which can be fixed above the head to measure height.

- Osteometric board. It is an anthropometric instrument consisting of a flat board with a fixed end and a crosspiece. It is used to measure the length of long bones.

**Growth Charts**

Isolated anthropometric measurements are not useful. The values obtained must be compared to relative standards for the appropriate population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) charts are obtained from children raised in various nutritional conditions in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) charts outline the growth of healthy children under optimal nutritional and environmental conditions, providing a 'goal' standard for optimal growth.

On the CDC charts, the normal growth pattern is identified as growth between the 5th and 95th percentiles. The WHO charts are considered applicable to all children from birth to five years of age regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and type of feeding.

When using growth charts, it is essential to use the correct chart for the patient's age and gender. It is also important to remember that children with disorders that alter the growth pattern need specialized plots to obtain meaningful results. A number of specialized growth charts have been developed for children with Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, cerebral palsy, Williams syndrome, achondroplasia, Prader-Willi syndrome, and Rett syndrome and should be used in place of standardized growth charts when indicated.

**Growth Chart Correction for Prematurity**

It is important to correct growth parameters for gestational age in children with prematurity. This is done by subtracting the number of weeks the infant was born preterm from the postnatal age.

**Newer Technologies**

A portable laser height meter was tested in comparison to a stadiometer in a 2020 study which revealedÂ reproducibility within and between different operators along with acceptable accuracy when compared to a stadiometer.
