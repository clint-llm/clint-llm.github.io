While ear lacerations may appear simple, the unique anatomy and relative hypovascularity of the ear lead to several unique challenges with which the clinician must be familiar. Thus, when patients present to the emergency department, it is important to have a very low threshhold to consult with the plastic surgeon or the otolaryngologist. The emergency department physician and nurse practitioner may irrigate the wound and confirm tetanus status, but if there is any question as to the severity of the wound or potential need fo staged procedures, the wound should not be closed until seen by the specialist. A poorly repaired ear laceration can lead to hematoma formation, nerve damage, flap necrosis, and asymmetry that may be irreversible.
