Careful examination of a neonate is critical and includes evaluating the symmetry and pigmentation of the external genitalia, presence of palpable gonads, and labioscrotal morphology. In addition, measurement of the phallus should be recorded, and the position of the meatal opening and number of perineal openings assessed. After birth, biological sex assignment is an important clinical decision. Biological sex is often assigned at the time of birth based on the appearance of the external genitalia. Examination of the external genitalia is the simplest way to assign sex post-birth but is less reliable than genetic evaluation. The external genitalia is highly prone to variation from sexual differentiation along a typical male or typical female pathway and may present with some degree of ambiguous genitalia. Neonates presenting with any degree of ambiguous genitalia tend to provide a challenge to doctors who manage their care and cause distress to their parents.

Differences of sex development (DSDs), previously known as disorders of sex development or intersex conditions, are a group of conditions associated with atypical development of the gonads, internal genitalia, or external genitalia. In some individuals, there is a conflict between chromosomal sex and sexual differentiation of the gonads, external genitalia, internal genitalia, or (later) secondary sex characteristics. DSDs are sometimes identified in utero due to routine genetic evaluation, at birth due to the presence of ambiguous genitalia, or sometimes well after birth due to virilization, delayed puberty, or infertility.

Differences in sex development can be organized along wide-ranging classification schemes. There are numerous conditions that are classified as DSDs; some of the more common or better understood include:

**46 XX DSD**

This group of DSD conditions impacts individuals with XX sex chromosomes with atypical development of the gonads, internal genitalia, external genitalia, and/or secondary sex characteristics. Some of these conditions include:

**Aberrant Ovarian Development**

**Androgen excess**

- Fetal (21- or 11-hydroxylase deficiency)

- Fetoplacental (aromatase deficiency)

- Maternal (luteoma, exogenous)

**46 XY DSD**

This group of DSD conditions impacts individuals with XY sex chromosomes with atypical development of the gonads, internal genitalia, external genitalia, and/or secondary sex characteristics. Some of these conditions include:

**Abnormal Testicular Development**

- Complete and partial gonadal dysgenesis

- Gonadal regression

**Defects in Androgen Biosynthesis**

- 17-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency

- 5-alpha reductase deficiency

**Defects in Androgen Action**

- Androgen insensitivity syndrome (complete or partial)

**Disorders of AMH and AMH Receptor**

- Persistent Müllerian duct syndrome

**LH Receptor****Defect******

- Leydig cell hypoplasia

**Others**(hypospadias and cloacal exstrophy)

**Sex Chromosome DSD**

This group of DSD conditions impacts individuals with atypical sex chromosomes that result in a potential suite of developmental outcomes. Some of these conditions include:

**45 X**(Turner syndrome and its variants)

**47 XXY**(Klinefelter syndrome and its variants)

**Ovotesticular DSD**

**Discussion**

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (or CAH) is a common cause of 46 XX DSD resulting from excess androgens. This is a group of disorders that impact the development of the adrenal glands and may involve several metabolic effects. In most individuals with this condition, there is a 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency that results in mineralocorticoid deficiency and excessive formation of androgenic products. This condition causes excess virilization of an individual with XX sex chromosomes. The clinical presentation is dependent on the severity of excess androgens and the timing of development.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), or complete androgen insensitivity, is a condition in which a person with XY sex chromosomes does not respond to androgens. Individuals with this condition, while chromosomally male, present at birth and through development as female with typical female psychosexual characteristics and are often raised as female. These individuals have typical female external genitalia but no uterus and are thus infertile.

Partial androgen insensitivity is a similar 46 XY condition involving under-masculinized morphology. Individuals with partial androgen insensitivity syndrome may have mildly virilized female external genitalia (clitoromegaly) to mildly under-virilized male type external genitalia (hypospadias and/or microphallus). In both cases, the affected individuals have testes and typically have normal production of testosterone and DHT.

An autosomal recessive 46 XY DSD, 5-alpha-reductase type 2 enzyme deficiency results from a mutation in the SRD5A2 gene. This enzyme converts testosterone to DHT, which is responsible for the masculinization of external genitalia in utero. Neonates with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency present with variable degrees of ambiguous genitalia, such as clitoral-like phallus, bifid scrotum, and pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias. At puberty, since masculinization at this time involves other androgens, the afflicted individual may have increasingly virilized external genitalia.

Hypospadias is an example of a common 46 XY DSD condition that involves an ectopic external urethral meatus on the ventral penis. Depending on the location of the external urethral meatus, the hypospadias may be asymptomatic or may cause additional challenges. For instance, granular hypospadias may be an incidental finding, while penile or perineal hypospadias may be associated with abnormal spraying of urine, abnormal curvature of the penis (chordee), or infertility via sexual intercourse. Epispadias are distinct from hypospadias as they tend to occur much earlier in development and present as an abnormal opening of the external urethral meatus on the dorsal aspect of the penis.

Sex chromosome DSDs include such conditions as Turner syndrome and Klinefelter syndrome. The incidence of Turner syndrome is approximately 1 in 2500 liveborn females. Turner syndrome is often diagnosable at birth due to features like low birth weight, lymphedema of hands and feet, and short neck. However, other forms of Turner syndrome may present later with short stature and delay in puberty. Some Turner syndrome karyotypes include 45 XO, 45 XO/46 XX, or 45 XO/ 46 XY. Klinefelter syndrome is another sex chromosome DSD that occurs in 1 in 1000 liveborn males. Clinical features of affected individuals include tall stature, weak muscles, small testes, gynecomastia, delayed puberty, and infertility.
