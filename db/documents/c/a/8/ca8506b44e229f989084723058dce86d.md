Secondary hypertension is a potentially life-threatening condition, that accelerates cardiovascular complications and end-organ dysfunction. It is essential for the patients to identify the symptoms specific to the secondary causes of hypertension and consult their primary care physician in order to facilitate the early diagnosis and management of the primary cause. All patients on the treatment of hypertension should practice a healthy lifestyle, take the drugs properly and monitor their blood pressure regularly at home. They should notify their physician about new symptoms and a change in the blood, which may warrant evaluation of the secondary cause of hypertension.
