Multimodal Analgesia (MMA), also referred to as “balanced analgesia,” uses multiple analgesic medications, physical modalities, and cognitive strategies to affect peripheral and central nerve loci for the treatment of pain.

Orthopedic surgeons are challenged with the task of pain management while mitigating the risk associated with opioids. MMA allows orthopedic surgeons and other medical professionals a more modern and evidence-based approach in treating acute pain in their patients. The use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids, immediate-release opioids, cognitive therapy, peri-articular injections, and physical modalities, such as cryotherapy, will be reviewed in this article to assist the modern orthopedic surgeon in controlling pain in their patients in the postoperative period. In addition, this article will review the various drug classes, adverse effects, and contraindications and provide insight into special consideration to certain patients who are opioid-tolerant or suffer from comorbid conditions.
