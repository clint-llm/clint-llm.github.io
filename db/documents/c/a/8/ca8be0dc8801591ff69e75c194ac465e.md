As with any other intraocular surgery, pediatric cataract surgery has its own set of associated complications that may require additional treatment.

- Visual axis opacification (VAO): It is a potential cause of amblyopia after cataract surgery.

- Glaucoma: The incidence of glaucoma is 10% to 25%.

- Post-operative anterior uveitis: It is more common in children than adults due to increased tissue reactivity. No-touch surgery and in-bag fixation reduce it. Post-operative frequent application of topical steroids and/or posterior sub tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide may be needed. Sometimes, dense fibrinous exudates and post-op miosis are seen. In such cases, mydriatics such as atropine or even subconjunctival injected mydricaine can be used to break synechiae formation and achieve mydriasis.

- IOL-related complications- IOL deposits, synechiae, pupillary capture, IOL opacification, decentration can be seen in the post-op period.

- Other complications include cystoid macular edema, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis, heterochromia, corneal decompensation, bullous keratopathy, astigmatism, post-op refractive surprise, etc. may also be seen.
