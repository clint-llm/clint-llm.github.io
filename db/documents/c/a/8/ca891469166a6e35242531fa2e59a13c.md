The anterior mediastinum contains thymus, fat, and lymph nodes, which corresponds with the most common etiologies of associated primary tumors. Although two-thirds of mediastinal masses are benign, about 59% of masses in the anterior compartment are malignant.

Germ cell tumors (GCTs) contain primitive germ cells that fail to migrate entirely during embryonic development. Although they mainly arise in the gonads, germ cell tumors represent 15% of anterior mediastinal masses.

Primary mediastinal lymphomas comprise 10% of all mediastinal lymphomas.

Another cause of anterior mediastinal mass is mediastinal goiter.  Mediastinal goiters typically arise when the lower part of the cervical thyroid lobes extend into the thoracic inlet.  Less commonly, mediastinal goiters represent remnants of embryonic tissues.
