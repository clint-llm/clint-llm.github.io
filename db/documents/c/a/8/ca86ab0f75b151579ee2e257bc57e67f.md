Complications related to cystocele can be categorized depending on the type of management the patient is receiving. If a woman refuses or is non-compliant with treatment, the disease's natural course may lead to a complete vaginal prolapse (procidentia).

Conservative management has its pitfalls. For example, vaginal pessaries can cause pain, erosion of the vagina, bleeding, or infection.

Surgical procedures carry the most significant number of complications. The most common is the recurrence of the prolapse and a need for further repair. Around 40% of women require a repeat procedure after an anterior colporrhaphy due to symptom recurrence.

There is also a higher rate of complications when using transvaginal mesh repair than using native tissue repair, predominantly in the form of chronic pelvic pain.
