Transvenous renal biopsy is performed via placement of a catheter (usually via jugular vein access) into the renal vein, usually in the setting of non-targeted biopsies.  A sheath is then placed into the renal vein that allows the insertion of a spring-loaded needle attached to a long extension support device.  A detailed discussion of this equipment and technique is beyond the scope of this article and is mentioned elsewhere

Percutaneous targeted biopsies and non-targeted biopsies can be performed using a variety of image guidance techniques, including US alone, US with needle guide technology, intermittent CT, fluoroscopic CT, or (in some specialized centers) MRI.  A retrospective case review concluded that US image guidance resulted in less risk of bleeding complications than a blind biopsy
