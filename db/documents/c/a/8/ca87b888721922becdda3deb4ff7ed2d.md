Observation is indicated for physiologic genu valgum or if the tibiofemoral angle is <15 degrees in a child <6 years of age. The use of bracing is typically not indicated in treating genu valgum.

Guided growth with hemiepiphysiodesis is typically used to correct angular deformities. Implant choices include screws, plates, or staples that are placed extraperiosteally. Indications of medial-sided hemiepiphysiodesis about the distal femur and/or proximal tibia include >15Â to 20 degrees in a child <10 years of age and if the mechanical axis falls on the lateral quadrant of the proximal tibia in a patient >10 years of age. Once skeletal age and physeal width have been established, the Green-Anderson growth charts can help predict the timing of epiphysiodesis for angular correction.

Osteotomies about the distal femur are also used in the treatment of genu valgum. A medial closing wedge osteotomy or a lateral opening wedge osteotomy can be performed when the deformity is primarily about the distal femur (most common). Indications are patients who are skeletally mature or near skeletal maturity, where there is insufficient growth remaining to benefit from guided growth.
