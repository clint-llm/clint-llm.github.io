For unresectable disease, platinum-based chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin are the first treatment option. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is more resistant to chemotherapy, however, and so there is an unclear survival benefit. For example, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has a response rate of between 12% and 48%, but median overall survival still is only 9 to 13 months. Biologic and antiangiogenic therapies are being investigated as well.
