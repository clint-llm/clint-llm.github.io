The CMTs are genetically determined disorders with implications of nearly 100 genes. Over 80% to 90% of the genetic abnormalities are due to copy number variation in PMP22 and mutations in GJB1, MPZ, and MFN2 genes. The frequency of abnormalities in other genes individually is rare.PMP22 is the commonest cause of CMT. PMP22 is a large geneÂ that is located in the middle of the 1.4 Mb regions in chromosome17p.12. This region is susceptible to frequent genomic rearrangements. Duplication or deletion in PMP22 leads to disease via a gene dosage effect.

Duplication in heterozygous state results in 1.5-fold overexpression, while homozygous duplication causes two-fold overexpression of PMP22 in Schwann cells. This genomic duplication results from an unequal meiotic crossover that is facilitated in the male germline by the flanking homologous repeat sequences. This overexpression overloads the proteasome system and leads to cytoplasmic aggregation of the ubiquitinated PMP22 protein. This, in turn, causes the recruitment of auto-phagosomes and lysosomes and increased autophagy.

Frameshift mutations in MPZ lead to mutant proteins aggregating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequent apoptosis. Other CMTs are usually the result of the loss of function mutations in other genes and uncommonly due to a toxic gain of function.
