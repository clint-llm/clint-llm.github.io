First described as a method of providing surgical anesthesia to the upper abdomen, the celiac plexus block has been in practice for nearly a century. The celiac plexus block is a multimodal adjunct to managing abdominal visceral pain. The celiac plexus comprises three pairs of ganglia: the celiac, superior mesenteric, and aorticorenal ganglia.

Several abdominal organs receive autonomic innervation via the celiac plexus. The celiac plexus block aims to target the afferent nociceptive fibers. It is suitable as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool for managing intraabdominal pain.
