The presentation of the patient with aortic transection exists on a spectrum. As previously mentioned, most patients with this injury pattern die at the scene. The cohort that survives transport and evaluation represents a more hemodynamically stable group with a less severe grade of injury. Blunt trauma often results in multiple affected organ systems, including central neurologic injuries. This may impede the provider’s ability to obtain a history. In the awake and conversant patient, he or she may be completely asymptomatic or may complain of chest pain radiating to the neck, back, or shoulder. These symptoms are nonspecific, and the injury requires an increased suspicion based on the mechanism to obtain a complete workup. On physical examination, the patient may have normal blood pressure or be profoundly hypotensive and in hemorrhagic shock. This often reflects the degree of wall disruption. A pulse examination can reveal asymmetry, which may indicate a transection involving the arch.
