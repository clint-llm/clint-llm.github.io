Certain populations are at greater risk for developing osteomalacia, and the following factors require attention and evaluation:

- Decreased sunlight to skin exposure

- Diet

- Dark skin

- Obesity

- Elderly

- Medications that may precipitate vitamin D deficiency

- Renal or hepatic disease

- Malabsorptive syndromes

Although there is insufficient data to recommend obtaining serum 25(OH)D levels in asymptomatic patients, clinicians should be aware of these factors that may put their patients at risk. It is important to educate patients about these risks and, if possible, how to make tolerable lifestyle changes. In patients who come from more conservative cultures, a vitamin D deficient diet and inadequate direct sunlight exposure may get overlooked by clinicians. Foods with the highest content of naturally occurring vitamin D are usually meat or fish-based. Since patients with vegetarian diets will not consume these foods, it is important to educate them on alternative sources of vitamin D enriched nutrition. These include fortified milk, yogurt, cheese, orange juice, bread, and UVB enhanced mushrooms. The biological significance of consuming these foods requires further assessment.
