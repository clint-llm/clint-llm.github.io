The motor control of speech occurs at multiple levels. The cranial nerve nuclei receive cortical supply through the corticobulbar tract. All other cranial nerves are innervated bilaterally except for the lower face, which receives contralateral innervation. The facial nerve terminates in 5 branches; the branches that contribute to the muscles of speech are the buccal, mandibular, and, to an extent, cervical. The glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), through the stylopharyngeal nerve, innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle and, through the pharyngeal branches, innervates the muscles of the pharynx.

Through the pharyngeal branches, the vagus nerve innervates the pharyngeal muscles, which elevate the palate and cause pharyngeal constriction. The glossopharyngeal nerve provides a sensory supply to the stylopharyngeus, which elevates the pharynx during speech. The cricothyroid muscle supplied by the vagus’ superior laryngeal branch is the vocal cords’ chief tensor. The recurrent laryngeal nerve separates the vocal cords and opens the glottis through the posterior cricoarytenoids, closes the glottis through lateral cricoarytenoids, and relaxes the vocal cords through the vocalis.

Hypoglossal nerve nuclei originating in the medulla provide motor branches to the tongue, supplying the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles (except the palatoglossus).

**Suprahyoid muscles:**These influence tongue movements by altering the position of the hyoid bone.

- C1 fibers supply the geniohyoid muscle.

- The trigeminal nerve supplies the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle.

- The facial nerve supplies the stylohyoid muscle and posterior belly of the digastric muscle.

In the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine produced in the presynaptic nerve terminal binds to receptors, ultimately creating an endplate potential strong enough to propagate action potential over the surface of the skeletal muscle membrane, resulting in muscle contraction. In myasthenia gravis, various autoantibodies interrupt these processes resulting in dysarthria and other symptoms.
