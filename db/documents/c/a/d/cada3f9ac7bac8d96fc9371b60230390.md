Selective serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists block serotonin both peripherally, on gastrointestinal (GI) vagal nerve terminals, and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This blockade results in powerful antiemetic effects. Currently, there are four 5-HT3 receptor antagonists on the market: ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron, which are FDA-approved for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in children and adults related to chemotherapy use, radiation therapy, and the effects of postoperative anesthesia. Dolasetron is also indicated for the treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting in children and adults.

**Adult FDA-Approved Indications**

- Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting

**Adult Non-FDA-Approved Indications**
