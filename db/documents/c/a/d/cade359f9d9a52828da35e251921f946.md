Interprofessional team members,Â including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and respiratory therapists, should perform an Allen test before cannulating or otherwise disrupting the radial artery. While uncommon, the rare patient may develop hand ischemia with interruption of radial arterial blood flow; for this reason, consistent use of the Allen test can lead to better patient outcomes.
