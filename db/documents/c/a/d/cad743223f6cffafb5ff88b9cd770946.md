The most significant risk of atlantoaxial instability is neural compression which can present with the following complications:

- Restricted neck movements

- Pyramidal signs and myelopathy

- Lower cranial nerve palsies

- Respiratory failure

- Vertebral artery dissection

- Quadriplegia

- Death

The major complications relating to the surgical approaches include:

- **Anterior approach**-pharyngeal wound dehiscence, CSF leak, meningitis, and need for tracheostomy.

- **Posterior approach**- venous plexus bleed, vertebral artery injury, implants related, instability of the subaxial spine, graft subsidence, non-union, graft-site complications.
