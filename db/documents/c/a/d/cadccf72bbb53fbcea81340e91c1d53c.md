Urosepsis can present with a varying spectrum of signs and symptoms, as infection in different parts of the urogenital tract may present differently, as mentioned below:

Cystitis presents with dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, suprapubic pain, and hematuria. Patients may also have a fever or other systemic symptoms (including chills, rigors, or marked fatigue or malaise beyond baseline), which suggest that infection has extended beyond the bladder.

Pyelonephritis classically presents with fever, chills, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and nausea/vomiting. It may also be associated with symptoms of cystitis. Atypical symptoms include pain in the epigastrium or lower abdomen.

Acute bacterial prostatitis most commonly presents withÂ fevers, chills, dysuria, pelvic or perineal pain, and noticeably cloudy urine. Obstructive symptoms, such as dribbling of urine, can also occur. On examination, the prostate is often firm, edematous, and markedly tender.

Patients may also have recurrent UTIs, a history of renal stones, an immunocompromised state, or a chronic source of infection like an indwelling catheter.
