Patients with persistent, debilitating symptoms (including instability symptoms) in the setting of known proximal biceps tendon pathology are good surgical candidates for either a tenotomy or tenodesis procedure. In the setting of significant instability, including frank dislocation, proximal biceps tenodesis is preferred over tenotomy.

Comparing the two procedures in the setting of LHBT pathology, the literature demonstrates a high level of patient satisfaction and patient-reported pain and overall outcome scores at long-term follow-up. A 2017 study of greater than 100 patients that were 1-year out from surgical arthroscopy procedures with concomitant biceps tenotomy revealed that greater than 90% of patients were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their outcome. Also, 95% stated that they would have the same surgery again.
