The arterial supply of the SCM derives from branches of the external carotid artery (occipital artery and superior thyroid artery), which are palpable with the pulse in the medial-anterior portion of the muscle. During intense physical activity, the blood supply to the respiratory muscles, including to the SCM, increases to the detriment of the muscles of the limbs.

The external jugular vein passes inferiorly and posteriorly to the SCM, draining venous blood via the external posterior and anterior jugular veins.

The lymphatic system of the neck that drains the SCM is the vertical chain, which includes the anterior superficial lymph nodes and the lymph nodes of the posterior triangle (inferiorly).
