The prognosis for patients with dysplastic nevi is excellent. However, those with a history of dysplastic nevi have an increased risk of developing melanoma. Therefore, recommendations are for regular skin check-ups with a dermatologist. Management of mildly dysplastic nevi can entail nothing more than regular observation. However, severely dysplastic nevi require surgical removal. Based on the degree of clinical abnormality, moderately atypical nevi can be managed with close observation if they are many in number or surgical removal if there are only a few.
