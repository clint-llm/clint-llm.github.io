Amlodipine is an excellent first-line choice among the myriad options of antihypertensive agents. Amlodipine has also shown robust reductions in cardiovascular endpoints (especially stroke). In addition, compared to nifedipine and other medications in the dihydropyridine class, amlodipine has the longest half-life at 30 to 50 hours. The benefit of such a long half-life is the ability to have once-daily dosing. Therefore, healthcare providers, including clinicians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, etc., should be familiar with the indications and contraindications of amlodipine. However, the drug can cause severe hypotension in overdose; thus, the recommendation is to gradually titrate the dose with an initial low dose. In addition, long-term patient monitoring is necessary for optimal blood pressure control.

Amlodipine therapy requires the participation of the entire interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs) and specialists will typically initiate treatment. The pharmacist should report to the clinician for potential drug interactions (e.g., simvastatin or erythromycin). In addition, pharmacists should verify dosing and educate the patient about the common adverse drug reactions. The nurse should assess patient adherence and offer to counsel on medication administration. Both nursing and pharmacy staff should alert the prescriber if they encounter any issues. In an acute overdose of amlodipine, emergency physicians and triage nurses should stabilize the patient with a primary focus on circulation. In a massive overdose of amlodipine, it is important to obtain an emergency consultation with a medical toxicologist. Critical care physician supervision is necessary for patients requiring vasopressor therapy in MICU.

The interprofessional team approach can improve patient outcomes related to amlodipine therapy by maximizing efficacy and minimizing the risk of adverse drug reactions. In addition, a pragmatic randomized controlled trial indicated that Team based care(TBC) involving community pharmacists and nurses working in an interprofessional manner with clinicians could accomplish long-term blood pressure control related to antihypertensive therapy, including calcium channel blockers.
