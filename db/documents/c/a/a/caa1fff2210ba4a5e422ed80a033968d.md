**Absolute Contraindications**

- Use of enalapril is contraindicated in patients with:

- Idiopathic angioedema

- Hereditary angioedema

- Previous history of  angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors

2. History of hypersensitivity reaction with the use of ACE inhibitors

3. Pregnancy and lactation

**Relative Contraindications:**Clinicians should avoid using enalapril or, if necessary, use it with caution in patients with aortic stenosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, collagen vascular disease (e.g., SLE), renal artery stenosis, and renal impairment.

**Drug Interaction:**ACE inhibitors interact with numerous drugs and can cause adverse effects, therapeutic failures, and toxicities. Thus these interactions are important to take under consideration when prescribing enalapril:

- Molsidomine

- Naftopidil

- Nicergoline

- Nitroprusside

- Obinutuzumab

- Pholcodine

- Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors

- Prostacyclin analogs

- Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics

- Tizanidine

2. Drugs that diminish the antihypertensive effect of  ACE inhibitors are:

- Amphetamines
