Postoperative bronchopleural fistula (BPF) may be classified as acute, subacute, and chronic. The acute form is caused by surgical dehiscence and requires prompt surgical intervention. When acute, BPF can be life-threatening due to tension pneumothorax or asphyxiation from pulmonary flooding. Patients present with sudden appearance of dyspnea, hypotension, subcutaneous emphysema, cough with expectoration of purulent fluid, tracheal or mediastinal shift, persistent air leak, and a reduction or disappearance of pleural effusion on the chest radiograph. The subacute and chronic forms are primarily related to infection and are often seen in immunocompromised or debilitated patients with multiple comorbidities. The subacute presentation is more insidious and is characterized by wasting, malaise, and fever. The chronic form is associated with an infectious process and fibrosis of the pleural space.

A BPF can occur any time during the postoperative period but more often occurs within 8 to 12 days after surgery. If seen within the first four postoperative days, the BPF is likely secondary to a mechanical failure of bronchial stump closure and requires reexploration. A BPF may also occur after suppurative pneumonia, massive pulmonary infarction, or spontaneously. Empyema may occur alone or may be associated with a BPF. A BPF can occur without associated empyema, and the fluid in the pleural space in these cases is sterile. Displacement of the mediastinum to the opposite side occurs because of air on the operative side. Clearing of fluid from the pleural space and coughing up of fluid and blood suggest a BPF. The sudden reappearance of air in an obliterated space suggests either a BPF or a gas-forming infectious process. If a fistula appears in nonsurgical cases or in delayed postoperative period, the diagnosis should be suspected when fever, productive cough, and new or increasing air-fluid levels are seen on the chest radiograph in the pleural space. Esophagotracheal fistulas are associated with coughing and dyspnea during eating and drinking.
