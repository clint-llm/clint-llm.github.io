Sotalol is a non-cardioselective beta-blocker that also possesses potassium channel blocker properties. It classifies as a class III agent in the Vaughan-Williams classification system for antiarrhythmic medications due to its predominant potassium channel blocking effect. Sotalol is indicated in premature ventricular contractions, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia, pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, maintaining sinus rhythm, postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery, and supraventricular tachycardia. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of sotalol, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team, with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of sotalol.
- Outline the indicated uses, both approved and off-label, for initiating therapy with sotalol.
- Identify the adverse effects associated with sotalol therapy.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance sotalol when indicated and improve patient outcomes.
