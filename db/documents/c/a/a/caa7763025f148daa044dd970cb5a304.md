**Autoimmune**

Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by the destruction of gastric parietal cells and the resulting lack of intrinsic factor, which is secreted by these cells. The antibodies identified are:

- Intrinsic factor antibodies (IFA)

- Parietal cell antibodies (PCA)

Parietal cell antibodies work against the parietal cell proton pump ATPase. The primary targets of parietal cell antibodies are the proton pump subunits: alpha and beta. They result in the destruction of the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa. Over time, atrophic gastritis with a complete lack of IF occurs, which impairs B12 absorption.

Pernicious anemia can be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (3% to 4%), vitiligo (2% to 8%), and autoimmune thyroid disease (3% to 32%). This association has led to studies exploring HLA alleles that may be related to autoimmune gastritis. HLA-DRB1/03 and HLA-DRB1/04 alleles may predispose to autoimmune gastritis with subsequent PA.

**Genetics**

Researchers have also identified congenital and juvenile forms of pernicious anemia, which are thought to follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. These patients have ineffective IF secretion or abnormally formed IF secretion, which results in vitamin B12 deficiency due to malabsorption.
