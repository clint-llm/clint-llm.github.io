- Most of the studies that currently exist regarding SCS therapy are either small prospective studies or retrospective studies. For this reason, there are relatively few guidelines regarding contraindications for this procedure.

- As with other elective procedures, the standard contraindications apply. These include:

- Infection at the surgical sites
- Aberrant anatomy at the surgical sites that would preclude safe placement
- Uncontrolled systemic illness
- Uncontrolled bleeding diathesis

- Anticoagulation is typically held per ASRA guidelines. The inability to hold anticoagulation due to life-threatening clotting disease or proximity to cardiac surgery would be a contraindication as well.

- A study by Eijs et al., which looked at 36 patients with CRPS, found that one of the relative contraindications for SCS therapy is mechanical allodynia (painful sensation experienced by light touch). The authors found that patients experiencing mechanical allodynia, which was brush-evoked in this study, had a 31% pain reduction compared to 81% pain reduction in patients with CRPS without allodynia.

- Other indicators of poor SCS outcomes include symptoms of active depression, anxiety, somatization, and poor coping skills.

- Patients with stump, phantom-limb, or paraplegic pain do not seem to benefit from SCS therapy.
