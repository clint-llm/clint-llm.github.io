Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus is often an acute onset presentation with tense vesicles and bullae over erythematous or normal skin. These blisters appear more in sun-exposed areas but can be seen in non-sun-exposed skin and mucosa with a predilection for the trunk, face, neck, vermillion border, upper extremities-extensor surfaces, supraclavicular region, and oral mucosa.

A rare pattern, erythema gyratum repens described as a centrifugally migrating erythematous plaque, has been described.

BSLE may be associated with urticarial lesions, and pruritus is not always present. Healing with milia and/or scarring occurs infrequently. However, hypo/hyperpigmentation of the affected skin is usually seen.

Several reports have shown an association with BSLE and active lupus nephritis. A multicenter retrospective study and literature review with a total of 128 cases described lupus nephritis in 50% of the cases, mainly class III or IV. 7% of cases had neuropsychiatric SLE and 45% with hematologic involvement at the time of BSLE.
