Neisseria meningitidis is an aerobic or facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative diplococcus that exclusively infects humans. There are at least 12 serotypes based on unique capsular polysaccharides of N. meningitidis with serotypes A, B, C, W, X, and Y, causing most meningococcal infections. Serotypes A and C are the main serotypes that cause meningococcal disease in Africa. Serotypes B and C are the main serotypes in Europe and the Americas, and serotype Y, generally causing infection in the United States and Canada. Serotype W is the cause of epidemic outbreaks worldwide and had an association with the Hajj pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia.

N. meningitidis is a common and important cause of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the United States, infecting children and adults. It is a devastating infection with high mortality, an overall mortality rate of 13 percent, and it is the second most common cause of community-acquired adult bacterial meningitis after Streptococcus pneumonia**.**Other infections that N. meningitidis can cause are meningococcemia (defined as a blood infection due to N. meningitidis), pneumonia, septic arthritis, pericarditis, and urethritis. N. meningitidis can also cause both endemic and epidemic infections and can even infect young, healthy adults.
