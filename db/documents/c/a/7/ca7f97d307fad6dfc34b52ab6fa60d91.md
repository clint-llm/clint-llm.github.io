Researchers have explored the effects of ghrelin and leptin since their discovery. From knowing that ghrelin was a growth hormone and leptin's effects in regulating body weight, many studies have explored their subsequent actions and effects. Studies have shown that their primary action lies in the various nuclei of the hypothalamus in regulating appetite and satiety.

Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide synthesized from the human ghrelin gene, GHRL, on chromosome 3.

The obese (ob) gene, located on chromosome 7, produces leptin, which is primarily found in adipose tissues. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone existing as a 167 amino acid peptide with a highly preserved form across species.

Subjects with a higher BMI and corresponding percent of body fat have demonstrated a marked increase of leptin in the circulating blood plasma.Â Besides regulating energy storage levels, leptin release also depends on factors such as food intake, gender, age, exercise, and circulating glucose.
