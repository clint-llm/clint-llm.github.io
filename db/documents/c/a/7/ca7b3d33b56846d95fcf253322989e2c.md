Monitoring is based on the limited therapeutic index of aminoglycosides and known toxicities, particularly nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. In general, clinicians should avoid concomitant the use of additional medications with possible ototoxic or nephrotoxic effects. In courses that extend beyond 2Â to 3 days, serum concentration requires monitoring to ensure efficacy as well as avoid excessive trough concentrations. Renal function should be monitored both before and during the use of streptomycin.
