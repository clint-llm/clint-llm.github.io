Management of benztropine dosage and methods of administration requires cooperation between different members of the interprofessional healthcare team. For instance, prescribers should be starting benztropine at a lower dosage and taper on gradually, especially in the geriatric population and patients with mental or behavioral issues. Nurses should monitor patients for therapeutic success and any adverse events. When benztropine overdose is suspected, ICU nursing staff should monitor patients until the resolution of toxicity symptoms. The pharmacist can verify appropriate dosing for the patient and review the patient's medication profile to find potential drug interactions. Collaborative work of the healthcare team members can significantly improve patient outcomes and lead to successful management of symptoms requiring benztropine therapy. [Level V]
