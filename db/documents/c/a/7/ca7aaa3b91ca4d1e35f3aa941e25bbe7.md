Most of the CALMs are present at birth or may appear early in life. CALMs present at birth may be difficult to visualize (Wood's lamp may improve visibility). In patients with NF1, the size and number of CALMs may increase with age. The prevalence of CALMs in newborns varies with race from 0.3% in whites to 18% in African Americans. In school-aged children, the prevalence varies from 13% in whites to 27% in African Americans. CALMs are more frequently seen in black children. While most of the children present with one or two CALMs, three or more CALMs are seen in 1% to 14% of the population.
