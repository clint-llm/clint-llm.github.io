Pharyngeal pouches derivatives produce tissues necessary for hearing, calcium homeostasis, and adequate immune response. The first pharyngeal pouch develops into the middle ear cavity and the eustachian tube, which joins the tympanic cavity to the nasopharynx. The inner surface of the eustachian tube is covered by a mucosal layer of ciliated cells, supporting cells, secretory cells, and connective tissue. The ciliated cells in the eustachian tube allow for secretions from the middle ear cavity to enter and drain into the nasopharynx. The primary function of the eustachian tube is to equilibrate pressures between ambient air pressure and the middle ear by permitting entry of air into the middle ear cavity. Failure of ciliated cells leads to pathologies such as otitis media with effusions, causing conductive hearing loss.

The second pharyngeal pouch develops into the palatine tonsils, a secondary lymphoid organ playing a role in protecting the body from pathogens passing through the pharynx.

The third pharyngeal pouch develops into the thymus and inferior portion of the parathyroid. The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that supports the development and selection of T cells. Host T-cell immunity is attributable to the development of the third pharyngeal pouch. Positive selection of T-cells takes place in the cortex of the thymus. The medulla of the thymus is responsible for self-tolerance education in T cells. Failure in the development of this pouch results in severe immunodeficiency against viral and fungal pathogens.

The fourth pharyngeal pouch is responsible for the development of the superior region of the parathyroid and the ultimobranchial bodies. Together, the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches play a crucial role in the homeostasis of calcium and phosphate via the function of the parathyroid gland. The ultimobranchial cells develop into the C cells of the thyroid gland, which produce calcitonin in response to increased serum calcium levels. The fifth and sixth pharyngeal pouches combine with the fourth pharyngeal pouch.

Cardiac neural crest cells arising from the dorsal neural tube migrate to the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches.  The cardiac cells proliferate and integrate into the parenchyma that eventually forms the aortic arches and great vessels.
