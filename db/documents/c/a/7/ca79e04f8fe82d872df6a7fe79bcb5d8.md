The levator scapulae muscle originates from the posterior tubercles of transverse processes of C1 (atlas), C2 (axis), C3, and C4 vertebrae.

The primary action of the levator scapulae is to elevate the scapula. The levator scapula works in conjunction with the trapezius and rhomboid muscles to accomplish this motion. The levator scapulae, along with the descending fibers of the trapezius, latissimus dorsi, rhomboids, pectoralis major and minor, and gravity, also inferiorly rotates the scapula, depressing the glenoid cavity.
