One of the difficulties with valvular heart disease is determining when patients need an intervention. For example, in aortic stenosis, only half of the patients have symptoms on presentation, yet half of them may die within two years.

Valvular heart disease is staged A through D, based on echocardiography parameters: A at-risk features (i.e., bicuspid valve) normal parameters asymptomatic, B moderate parameters asymptomatic, C1 severe parameters still asymptomatic preserved ejection fraction, C2 severe parameters still asymptomatic reduced ejection fraction, and D symptomatic +/- severe parameters. Severe parameters for stenosis include aortic valve area < 1.0 cm squared, mean pressure gradient ≥40 mmHg, aortic jet velocity ≥4.0 m/sec. Severe parameters for insufficiency include regurgitant jet width ≥65% of the left ventricular outflow tract, vena contracta >0.6 cm, holodiastolic aortic flow reversal, effective regurgitant orifice ≥0.3 cm squared, regurgitant fraction ≥ 50%, and regurgitant volume ≥60 mL/beat.

In general, patients with aortic valve stage A receive a screening echocardiogram, patients with stage B disease receive echocardiogram surveillance every 3-5 years, while aortic stage C patients receive echocardiogram surveillance every 0.5 to 1 year with possible intervention, and stage D patients receive an intervention. A Heart Valve Team should assess any patient considered for intervention in a multidisciplinary fashion.

Class I and Class II indications for intervention for aortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency are summarized below.

Aortic Stenosis Class I

- Stage D (severe parameters + symptomatic)

- Stage C or D (severe parameters regardless of symptoms) if already indicated for another heart surgery

- Stage C or D (severe parameters regardless of symptoms) if ejection fraction <50%

Aortic Stenosis Class II

- Stage C with very severe parameters (jet velocity >5.0 cm/sec)

- Stage C decreased exercise tolerance

- Stage D without severe parameters (low-flow/low-gradient), but low dose dobutamine stress produces high-flow/high-gradient parameters

- Stage D without severe parameters, but anatomic and clinical evidence suggests stenosis is the underlying cause of symptoms

- Stage B if already indicated for another heart surgery

- Stage C if the low-risk patient and jet velocity is increasing >0.3 cm/sec/year

Aortic Insufficiency Class I

- Stage D (severe parameters + symptomatic)

- Stage C or D (severe parameters regardless of symptoms) if already indicated for another heart surgery

- Stage C or D (severe parameters regardless of symptoms) if ejection fraction <50%

Aortic Insufficiency Class II

- Stage C with pronounced left ventricular dilation (>50 mm at end-diastole)

- Stage B if already indicated for another heart surgery

Once a patient meets indications for an intervention, the Heart Valve Team will assess the patient’s operative and interventional risk, using a combination of Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk calculators, frailty indices, and a patient-specific accounting of failed organs and comorbidities to determine whether SAVR or TAVR is appropriate.

For patients with Stage B or C disease indications above (i.e., asymptomatic patients), at this time, SAVR is the only indicated intervention. For patients with Stage D disease, either SAVR or TAVR may be an option depending on the risk above. For low risk (<4% operative mortality), SAVR is indicated. For intermediate (4-8% operative mortality), either SAVR may be offered as a class I recommendation or TAVR may be offered as a class II recommendation. For high risk (>8% operative mortality), SAVR and TAVR have equivalent class I recommendation status. For prohibitive surgical risk (>50% mortality or ≥3 organ systems already failed), TAVR carries the class I recommendation, and SAVR should not be offered.

Once SAVR is chosen, the team must choose between a valve replacement or repair. Again, in broad terms, stenosis is correctable by replacement, while isolated insufficiency is correctable by replacement or repair. Some groups have also shown success in repair for the bicuspid disease.

Once a replacement is chosen, there are three options for replacement: mechanical valve, stentless pulmonary autograft/homograft (Ross procedure), or bioprosthetic valve. Each option varies in requirements for anticoagulation and long term durability. This variability should be made clear to the patient according to the ACC/AHA guidelines, and the decision process should be a shared one with the patient, whereas formerly, patient age guided the choice.

Other variables must be considered when selecting a replacement valve. Pre-existing renal disease, hyperparathyroidism, and young age all increase the risk of calcium deposition and bioprosthetic structural deterioration.

Not to be omitted in a discussion of valvular disease, surgical treatment of infective endocarditis cannot be over-generalized; it must be rooted in the full scenario of the particular patient, i.e., how much should be debrided and when to perform the debridement. The ACC/AHA offers some basic guidelines.

A full culture-driven course of antibiotics should be the first-line treatment until one of the following scenarios pushes the multidisciplinary team toward early surgical source control: deteriorating heart failure, highly virulent or resistant organisms, new heart block, annular abscess, relapsing infection, persistent bacteremia for five to seven days, presence of a prosthetic valve infection, infected defibrillator, pacemaker, or leads, recurrent emboli, persistent vegetations, or mobile vegetation >1.0 cm.
