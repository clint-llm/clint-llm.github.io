**Indications for Post-Mastectomy Radiation Therapy (PMRT)**

Several large randomized trials have demonstrated a clinical benefit with the addition of postmastectomy radiation therapy in patients with high-risk disease.

**Current controversies in PMRT**

**Less than 4 positive lymph nodes**

Despite earlier trials showing a consistent survival advantage for all node-positive patients, the validity of these findings among patients with less than 4 positive lymph nodes is often debated. The main criticisms of these trials were the use of less effective systemic therapies (i.e., taxanes, dose-dense chemotherapy scheduling, HER2 targeted agents, and prolonged use of hormonal therapy were not consistently used) and inadequate axillary lymph node dissections. Furthermore, several other studies suggest the rate of locoregional recurrence among patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes is low

Given the conflicting data, the NCCN recommends postmastectomy radiation therapy should be “strongly considered” in patients with 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes while also taking into account other clinical characteristics (i.e., age, comorbidities, life-expectancy), pathologic risk factors (i.e. tumor size, ratio of positive lymph nodes, tumor grade, LVSI), and biologic tumor makeup (i.e., hormonal receptor status and targetable mutations). These recommendations also are in line with recently updated postmastectomy radiation therapy guidelines put forth by a joint panel comprised of the American Societies of Clinical, Radiation, and Surgical Oncology

**T3N0**

A similar controversy exists among node-negative patients with large primary tumor size (greater than 5 cm)

**Complete nodal response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy**

Current recommendations for postmastectomy radiation therapy are based on clinical stage prior to initiation of any therapy. However, an excellent/complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in either the nodes and/or the breast is associated with a significantly decreased risk of locoregional recurrence

**Internal mammary node coverage**

If internal mammary nodes (IMNs) are involved (i.e., pathologically enlarged on CT and or metabolically active on PET), they should be included in the radiation field. Elective IMN coverage is somewhat controversial. In the earlier postmastectomy radiation therapy trials, the radiation portal encompassed all draining lymphatics of the breast including the axillary, supraclavicular, and internal mammary nodal (IMN) chain

Several large trials have evaluated the volume of elective nodal irradiation (ENI) volume to include in patients with centrally/medially located tumors, positive lymph nodes, or in node-negative patients with high-risk disease after mastectomy

In summary, comprehensive lymph node coverage has yielded mixed results but may offer a small improvement in disease-free survival and possibly even breast cancer-specific survival. Given the insufficient evidence, a multi-disciplinary expert panel on post-mastectomy management suggests the radiation treatment field should include the IMN, supraclavicular, and apical axillary regions as well as the chest wall if comprehensive nodal radiation is recommended

**Postmastectomy radiation therapy****after implant/tissue expander**

Postmastectomy radiation therapy after breast reconstruction has been associated with increased rates of capsular contracture, reconstructive failures, revision surgeries, and overall worse cosmetic outcomes

Most often, implant reconstruction occurs in two phases with the placement of a tissue expander followed by a permanent implant. Several studies evaluating the optimal sequence of two-phase reconstruction with radiotherapy have demonstrated higher rates of reconstructive failures ranging from 32% to 40% when radiation was delivered to the tissue expander as compared to radiation directed at the permanent implant
