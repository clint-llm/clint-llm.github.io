Strongyloides stercoralis is a nematode with a complicated life cycle that involves parasitic and free-living forms. It can cause autoinfection, which is the ability to complete a full life cycle within humans and, therefore, multiplies. Multiple migratory cycles can lead to recurrent infections. Only a complete cure can eliminate the risk of complications, so accurate diagnostic methods must be employed.
