- Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread malaria species with predominance in Latin America and Southeast Asia

- The blood smear is the gold standard diagnostic tool for malaria, but in resource-limited clinical settings, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are a reasonable alternative

- Treatment decisions need to account for the severity of disease and local patterns of drug resistance

- The uncomplicated disease is treatable with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with primaquine

- In the setting of severe disease outside of the United States, IV artesunate is the treatment of choice

- In the United States severe vivax malaria can be treated with intravenous quinidine plus tetracycline, or doxycycline, or clindamycin (artesunate is available in the United States as an investigational new drug (IND) protocol # 76,725 via the CDC)
