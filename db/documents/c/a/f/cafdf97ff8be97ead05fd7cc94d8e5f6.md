Somatostatin is involved in the exocrine, endocrine, and CNS systems. Within these systems, there is a wide array of hormones that are affected. In the exocrine system, somatostatin inhibits bile secretion, colonic fluid secretions, gastric acid secretion, pancreatic enzymes, cholecystokinin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In the endocrine system, it inhibits growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin, gastrin, insulin, glucagon, and secretin. In the CNS, somatostatin is present as a neurotransmitter in the lateral septum, cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and numerous brainstem nuclei.
