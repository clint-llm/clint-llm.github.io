Incidence of aortic arch anomalies:

Approximately 1 to 3 percent of all congenital heart disease.

Compared to females, males appear to have a 1.4 to 2 times greater risk of having a vascular ring than females.

Among the aortic arch anomalies that can lead to a vascular ring, the following with the first two listed below comprising more than 90% of all vascular rings seen:

- Double aortic arch (DAA)

- RAA and aberrant LSCA and left PDA

- Circumflex aortic arch - Either a left-sided aortic arch with a right descending aorta and right-sided PDA (or) a right-sided aortic arch with a left descending aorta and left-sided PDA

- Pulmonary artery sling (It is not a vascular ring in a true sense and hence called vascular sling because it passes anterior to the esophagus behind the trachea)

- Left-sided aortic arch (LAA) with aberrant RSCA (ONLY if right-sided PDA is present)

- Right-sided aortic arch (RAA) with mirror image branching (ONLY if left-sided PDA arises from descending aorta)
