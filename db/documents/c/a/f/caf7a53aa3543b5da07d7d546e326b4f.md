Bone marrow aspiration or biopsies, as well as complete blood counts with differential, are used to look for issues with hematopoiesis. Typically these biopsies are taken from the iliac crest but may also be taken from the sternum, vertebrae, or tibia under certain conditions.

Stains of the biopsies are used to detect a variety of conditions including aplastic anemia, neoplasia, fibrosis, and inflammation. H and E staining allows practitioners to identify mature nearly mature cells of the various cell lines in hematopoietic tissue. Importantly, very immature cells including hematopoietic stem cells cannot be easily identified by this method as they are not easily discernable from one another and look more like lymphoblasts under the microscope. Typical immature myeloid cells are nucleated and more basophilic than their mature counterparts. Immature granulocytes will have large vesicular nuclei and will be less basophilic. Fluorescent staining for cell surface markers such as CD34 remains the key method for attempting to differentiate certain progenitor cells and undifferentiated HSC.
