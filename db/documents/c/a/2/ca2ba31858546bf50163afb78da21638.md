The objective measure that is most commonly used for Crohn disease is the Crohn disease activity index (CDAI). This index, which includes patients' demographic characteristics, subjective complaints and symptoms, laboratory values, and extraintestinal findings, classify the disease activity. Different online tools are available to calculate this score and help predict the disease stage. Another tool for Crohn disease is Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). Similarly, such tools are also available for ulcerative colitis and include the simple clinical colitis activity index (SCCAI), Mayo score/disease activity index (DAI), and Seo index for disease quantification.
