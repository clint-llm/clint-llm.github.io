**Diagnosis of Vaginitis**

**The Wet Prep**

After specimen collection is completed during the exam, the swab is transferred to a tube containing 0.5 mL to 1 mL of physiologic saline. The swab should be vigorously swirled to dislodge particulates. Three slides are prepared by placing a droplet utilizing a disposable transfer pipette. The three slides are a wet mount, potassium hydroxide mount and a slide for gram stain.

Exams should proceed immediately after specimen collection. If this is not possible, the specimen should be kept at room temperature and examined within 2 hours. Cooling will limit the trichomonas motility.

The wet mount is examined immediately. The 10X objective is used to assess the types of the epithelial cells present (mature, parabasal, basal or clue cells) and to establish the presence of budding yeast or pseudohyphae. The 40X objective is used to count organisms and cells per the high-power field (HPF).

- Squamous epithelial cells are polygonal cells. The central nucleus is roughly the size of a red blood cell (RBC). There is a large amount of irregular cytoplasm. The cells’ margins are distinct. They are present in large numbers in the vaginal secretions of healthy women.

- Clue cells are an abnormal variation of the squamous epithelial cell. The cell is distinguished by coccobacillus bacteria which is attached in clusters to the cell surface. This makes the cells edges stippled and the borders indistinct. The cell is granular and irregular. Clue cells, when present in abundance (greater than 20% of squamous epithelial cells), indicate Gardnerella vaginalis overgrowth.

- White Blood Cells will appear one-half to one-third the size of squamous epithelial cells. They exhibit a granular cytoplasm. The multi-lobed nucleus lends to the name polymorphonuclear white blood cells (PMN’s). In normal secretions, they are present in small numbers. Greater than 3% white blood cells (WBC) suggest vaginal candidiasis, atrophic vaginitis or infections with trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhea or HSV.

- RBCs are one-half the size of WBCs and are smooth, non-nucleated biconcave disks. RBCs can be confused with yeast, but KOH will lyse them while yeast cells remain on the KOH mount.

- Parabasal Cells are larger than a WBC but smaller than squamous epithelial cells. They are round to oval shaped with a nucleus to cytoplasm level ratio of 1:1 or 1:2. The cytoplasm contains basophilic granulation or amorphic basophilic structures. These are rarely seen in normal vaginal secretions unless women are menstruating or postmenopausal. Parabasal cells present with many WBCs indicates desquamative inflammatory vaginitis.

- Basal Cells are roughly the same size as WBCs but with round nuclei. The nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio is 1:2. These are not normally found in vaginal secretions. Their presence can indicate vaginal atrophy or in the presence of excessive WBCs, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis.

- Lactobacillus species should predominate in the healthy reproductive age vagina. These will appear as large, nonmotile rods.

- Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan slightly larger on average than a WBC. There are four anterior flagella and an undulating membrane that extends half the body length. An axostyle bisects the trophozoite longitudinally and protrudes from the posterior end. This enables the organism to attach to the vaginal mucosa.

- Yeast cells (blastospores) are of similar size to RBC’s. Pseudohyphae are multiple buds that instead of detaching, form chains. Yeast is best observed on the 10-fold objective.

A separate slide is used for the KOH prep. The saline-diluted specimen is added to the slide along with a drop of 10% KOH. Increased numbers of anaerobic bacteria (G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Trichomonas as opposed to a predominance of Lactobacillus) will lead to the production of amines. KOH will lead to volatilization of these amines leading to a “fishy” amine odor, thus the “Whiff test.” After performing the “Whiff test” place the coverslip and leave the slide to rest for 5 minutes. Letting the slide rest will allow for the dissolution of the epithelial cells and the RBCs. The microscopic exam can then be performed to search for yeast pseudohyphae and blastospores without interference from other cell types.

**Gram Stain**

The gram stain remains the gold standard for identifying the causative agent for bacterial vaginosis but is only routinely used in the research setting. The gram stain slide must be heat-fixed. It is evaluated using the Nugent score. The Nugent score is calculated based on the observed quantities of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides species and Mobiluncus species.

**Cultures**

Cell culture has a limited role in the evaluation of vaginitis. It remains the gold standard for the detection of yeast. Unfortunately, the results are not timely. The culture of Gardnerella vaginalis is not useful as it is part of the normal flora in 50% of women. Trichomonas vaginalis can be cultured, but it requires a specific medium, Diamond’s medium, and is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Beyond recurrent yeast, culture is not clinically important to the evaluation of vaginitis.

**DNA Technologies**

DNA hybridization probes are available for G. vaginalis, Candida species, Trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea and are being used increasingly in the evaluation of abnormal vaginal discharge. The sensitivities are very high and turn around is quick.

Various point-of-care tests exist for Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis are commercially available. Most require in-house equipment (exception, OSOM for trichomonas which has the lowest sensitivity), but the turn-around time is 15 to 60 minutes. Their sensitivities are 90% or better.
