Kozhevnikov and researchers later examining his work believed the seizures in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) were cortical in origin and related to some form of localized encephalitis. Hyperexcitability of anterior horn cells was, at the time, believed to be the underlying cause of diseases such as familial progressive myoclonic epilepsy of Unverricht which, like EPC, presented with myoclonic jerks.

Studies on status epilepticus (SE) have shown a failure of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition and consequent unimpeded action of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) at the synaptic level to play a part in sustaining the epileptic activity. Scientists have postulated a similar process involved in EPC and how it is sustained over extended periods of time, but a causal relationship is yet to be established.
