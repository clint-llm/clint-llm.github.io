Lesions are often a singular subcutaneous dome-shaped papule or nodule measuring less than 2 cm and may be skin-colored, pink to tan, or red to brown. Most lesions are asymptomatic although some may present with pain upon pressure. The lesions tend to grow slowly and are usually superficially located, with rare, deeper involvement of subcutaneous fat or skeletal muscle. The head and neck are the most common locations, but neurothekeomas may also be seen on the shoulder or upper extremities.
