Duration of respiratory distress is the principal determinant for diagnosis of TTN. If distress resolves within the first few hours of birth, it can be labeled as "delayed transition." Six hours is an arbitrary cutoff between "delayed transition" and TTN because by this time baby might develop issues with feeding and might require further interventions. TTN is usually a diagnosis of exclusion and hence any tachypnea lasting over 6 hours requires workup to rule out other causes of respiratory distress.

The workup usually includes:

- Preductal and postductal saturations: to rule out differential cyanosis

- Complete blood count (CBC), blood culture, Â C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate to rule out neonatal sepsis

- ABG analysis may show hypoxemia and hypocapnia due to tachypnea; hypercapnia is a sign of fatigue or air leak.

- Chest x-ray: May show hyperinflation, prominent perihilar vascular markings, edema of interlobar septae or fluid in the fissures.

Other workups to consider:

- Ammonia level in the setting of lethargy and metabolic acidosis to rule out inborn errors of metabolism

- Echocardiography to rule out congenital cardiac defects in patients with differential cyanosis or persistent tachypnea for over 4 to 5 days
