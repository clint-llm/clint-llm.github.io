According to the Prospective Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (PROCLIPI) study published in 2020, patient characteristics associated with a significant decrease in quality of life (QoL) in MF/SS include newly diagnosed women and those with alopecia and confluent erythema.

In 2021, a published study of one-on-one patient interviews suggests that those with CTCL, such as MF, often report sleep interference, lack of understanding of their disease, feelings of uncertainty, depression, hopelessness, treatment/tumor burden, and sometimes suicidal thoughts.
