Methamphetamine is a highly addictive psychostimulant drug that is a derivative of amphetamine. Methamphetamine can produce euphoria and stimulant effects like those from other stimulants such as cocaine. In addition, methamphetamine is easily synthesized from inexpensive and readily obtainable chemicals. These characteristics have led to widespread and rampant abuse worldwide, currently estimated at 33 million users based on the 2016 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime World Drug Report. In the United States, there were greater than 150000 emergency department visits for toxicity from methamphetamine in 2011 based on data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of methamphetamine toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the toxicokinetics and pathophysiology of methamphetamine toxicity.
- Summarize the presenting signs and symptoms, and expected examination findings in the evaluation of a patient with methamphetamine toxicity.
- Explain treatment and management strategies available for methamphetamine toxicity.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by methamphetamine toxicity.
