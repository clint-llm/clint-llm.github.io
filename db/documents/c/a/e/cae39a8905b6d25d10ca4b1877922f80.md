The pathophysiology of branchial arch malformations spans a broad and complex range. Anomalies are detectable in isolation from other issues, or part of a more extensive developmental syndrome, including DiGeorge syndrome, auriculocondylar syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, or velocardiofacial syndrome, among many others. This article will focus on the most common isolated defects associated with branchial arch derivatives in the following section rather than the complex syndromes of craniofacial developmental.
