The ever-looming threat of a terrorist attack, in particular, a bioterrorist event, necessitates that healthcare professionals must prepare to manage victims of these catastrophic events. A broad understanding of potential biological weapons, including identifying the offending agent and the steps in the management of the patients, is paramount in limiting the morbidity and mortality associated with a bioterrorist attack. The healthcare professional's initial role in the event of a bioterrorist attack is to identify that an attack has taken place. Bioweapons, especially infectious agents, may simulate naturally occurring infections.

The healthcare professional should be able to differentiate between these by a thorough epidemiological analysis of the outbreak. Once this is identified, appropriate disease-specific interventions can be started to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the attack.Â The choice of the bioweapon may depend on the technical and economic capabilities possessed by the terrorist organization. Healthcare professionals should be familiar with both the epidemiology and the control measures in such an event to respond if an outbreak should occur. Research targeted at improving the diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities as well as the implementation of effective response plans is another step against bioterrorism. Training healthcare workers and other frontline workers in identifying and managing a bioterrorist attack with regular refresher sessions may also be useful.

Panic and fear among the public can be another aspect of a bioterrorist attack. Healthcare workers also have a role in minimizing panic by explaining the situation to the victims and starting appropriate and timely management to minimize the agent's impact. With prompt identification of the causative biological weapon along with rapid initiation of treatment and containment measures, healthcare professionals can play a direct role in preventing mass casualties and limiting large-scale damage to human life.
