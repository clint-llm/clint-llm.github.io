Immunohistology shows few or no immunoglobulin and complement deposits and hence named pauci-immune vasculitides.

GPA: biopsy from lung tissue shows evidence of vasculitis and necrotizing granuloma formation, which is characteristic of this disease. However, kidney biopsyÂ does not show granulomas.

MPA: biopsy shows capillaritis without granuloma formation in addition to leukocytoclastic changes and crescentic glomerulonephritis in kidneys.

EGPA: biopsy shows necrotizing vasculitis with eosinophilic infiltrates and eosinophilic granulomas.
