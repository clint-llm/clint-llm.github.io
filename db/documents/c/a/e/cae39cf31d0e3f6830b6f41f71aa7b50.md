Establishing a diagnosis of benign occipital epilepsy involves a detailed history and characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. Imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are normal and help differentiate these from secondary epilepsy syndromes. These are not always necessary but can be done to rule out symptomatic occipital epilepsy. Comprehensive neurological examination and developmental assessment are also normal.

EEG findings are characterized by focal occipital paroxysmal interictal discharges, though more than 50% of patients may have diffuse or multifocal epileptiform activity, with occipital predominance.

The magnetoencephalographic study revealed spikes in frontal, Rolandic, parietooccipital, and calcarine sulci. Localized hyperexcitability was seen in the areas along the major cortical sulci.
