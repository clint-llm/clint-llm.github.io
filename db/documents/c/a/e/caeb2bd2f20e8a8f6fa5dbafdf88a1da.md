Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) is a frequently encountered cause of nephrotic syndrome, accounting for 40% of cases in adults and 20% in children.

Although clinical signs are suggestive, the confirmation of the diagnosis of FSGS is achieved only by histopathology findings.

The most common clinical manifestation of FSGS (in over 70% of patients) is nephrotic syndrome, presenting as generalized or dependent edema, fatigue, and appetite loss. Hypertension is another common feature and could be severe, with diastolic blood pressure over 120 mmHg; this is common in patients of Afro-Caribbean origin, particularly those with kidney insufficiency.
