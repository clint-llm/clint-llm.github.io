Thalamocortical radiations are the nerve fibers between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. Functionally, thalamocortical radiations, also called thalamocortical fibers, relay sensory or motor information from the thalamus to distinct areas of the cerebral cortex through relay neurons. Structurally, thalamocortical radiations are parallel pathways linking specific thalamic nuclei with specific cortical areas. There are also corticothalamic fibers, which relay information back to the thalamus from the cerebral cortex. Thalamocortical radiations are involved in the control of cortical arousal and consciousness, and play a role in movement disorders such as Parkinson disease.
