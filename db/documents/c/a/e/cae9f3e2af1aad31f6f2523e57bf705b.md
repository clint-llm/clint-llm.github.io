Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) is a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to the microfilariae trapped within the lung parenchyma. The species causing filariasis in humans areÂ Wuchereria bancrofti,
Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. These nematodes reside in the lymphatic system and bloodstream of humans. Filariasis spreads from person to person by mosquito bites, which serve as a vector. The vectors of W. bancrofti are Culex, Anopheles, and Aedes mosquitoes.
