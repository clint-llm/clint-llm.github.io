The supratrochlear nerve block can help anesthetize a large area of the forehead without distorting the tissue, as would be the case with local infiltration. Moreover, it is an alternative to opioids or other pain medications.

The supraorbital nerve block is also frequently used to anesthetize the forehead and, as it innervates a larger portion of the forehead, involves a larger total area, including the periphery of the forehead/face. Performing a supratrochlear nerve block can help anesthetize the paramedian region of the forehead and, in conjunction with a supraorbital nerve block can anesthetize the entire hemi-forehead extending posteriorly to include the anterior portion of the scalp.
