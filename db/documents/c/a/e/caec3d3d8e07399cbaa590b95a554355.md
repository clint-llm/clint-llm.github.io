The patient's blood pressure should also be recorded before treatment initiation and monitored biweekly for the first month of treatment. After which, it should be monitored as indicated clinically.

An accurate baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be established before initiating voclosporin, and eGFR should be assessed every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment and every 4 weeks after that.

Voclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can be administered concomitantly without adjusting the dose of MMF. There is no risk of the emergence of MMF-related adverse effects following the discontinuation of voclosporin.
