Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) involves both benign and malignant entities that include hydatidiform mole (complete and partial), choriocarcinoma, invasive mole, epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT) and placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). The last four are known as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN); all can metastasize and can be fatal if not treated. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, management, and complications of GTN in the clinical setting, emphasizing the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with GTN and its related conditions and sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Identify pathologic finding for each type. 
-  Explain the pathophysiology of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Review the different malignant conditions. 
- Summarize the options for the management of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Describe surgical and medical therapies.
- Identify the importance of improving care communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by the gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.
