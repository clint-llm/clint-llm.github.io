Obeticholic acid is contraindicated in patients with complete biliary obstruction.

Inhibitors of the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP) such as cyclosporine should normally be avoided when the patient takes OCA to prevent the buildup of conjugated bile salts in the liver. However, if BSEP inhibitors are necessary, transaminases and bilirubin should be monitored.
