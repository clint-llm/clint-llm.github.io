Before insertion of IABP, informed consent is necessary, with a clear explanation of the risks and benefits of IABP device insertion, with concise instructions about post-procedure care. These instructions include not to flex the leg if femoral artery access of that leg was the entry point for IABP insertion and inability to walk till the device is in place in case of femoral artery access used for device insertion.

Before theÂ procedure, the patient requires a thorough evaluation for any bleeding diathesis, infection, and presence of severe peripheral arterial disease.

The patient is positioned supine, and adherence to the sterile technique should be practiced to insert the device.
