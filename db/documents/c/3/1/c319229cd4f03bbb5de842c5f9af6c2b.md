Human factors play a role in decisions and especially in situations of failed airway management. Avoiding loss of situational awareness, avoiding perseveration on the same task, or delaying performing a surgical cricothyrotomy is essential.

Attending difficult airway workshops to practice techniques, networking with experts, and looking for opportunities to practice them in elective procedures are excellent ways to build skillsets.
