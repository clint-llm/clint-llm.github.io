During the third trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound is commonly performed in patients that present both asymptomatically or with symptoms. There are currently no major guidelines or protocols to standardize the use of ultrasound at this stage of pregnancy. Ultrasound can be useful to identify fetal and maternal pathology and to follow the progression of the pregnancy. This activity reviews the approach and interpretation of ultrasound during the third trimester and highlights relevant information for an interprofessional team managing this patient population.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the general technique to perform an ultrasound evaluation during the third trimester of pregnancy.
- Identify the indications and contraindications for performing an ultrasound evaluation during the third trimester of pregnancy.
- Describe the typical fetal and maternal ultrasonographic findings during the third trimester of pregnancy.
- Summarize the most common pathologic findings that can be appreciated when performing an ultrasound evaluation during the third trimester of pregnancy.
