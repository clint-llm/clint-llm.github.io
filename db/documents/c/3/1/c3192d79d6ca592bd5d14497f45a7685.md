A neurolytic block is the targeted destruction of a nerve or nerve plexus. Frequently, the term neuroablation is used to also describe the physical interruption of pain either chemically, thermally, or surgically. All neurolytic techniques cause Wallerian degeneration of the nerve axon distal to the lesion.
