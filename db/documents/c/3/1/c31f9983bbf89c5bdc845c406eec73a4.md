An appropriately skilled intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) team should be assigned for each patient and procedure. After a detailed preop evaluation (history, physical exam, and review of the medical record) and discussion with the surgeon to review the imaging, relevant neural anatomy, physiology, and planned procedure, the IONM team determines the appropriate modalities IONM required for the scheduled procedure. The team discusses IONM procedures and their risks with the patient and documents patient's data. IONM personnel discusses planned monitoring with nursing staff and determines a suitable location for monitoring equipment in the operating room. IONM personnel set up and check all the equipment before the patient arrives in the operating room. A suitable anesthesia plan is discussed with the anesthesia team as required for the surgical procedure and specific neuromonitoring modality. The technique of IONM involves the placement of electrodes or other monitoring devices under all aseptic skin preparation, acquisition, recording, and interpretation of high-quality data.

IONM personnel acquires baseline responses for needed monitoring modalities, informs and discusses alert criteria and testing strategies with the surgical and anesthesia team to coordinate monitoring as required during the procedure. IONM personnel also reviews the anesthesia regimen with the anesthesia team to optimize anesthesia maintenance during the procedure. The IONM record contains surgical event times, communication between teams, alert issued to surgical and anesthesia team, anesthesia drugs, and dosages used. Significant changes in the dose of anesthesia medications and physiological parameters, including heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature, are also recorded.
