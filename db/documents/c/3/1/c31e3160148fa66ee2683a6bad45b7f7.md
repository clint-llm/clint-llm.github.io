Nocturnal cough is a common presentation with diverse etiology. When a patient presents with this symptom, it is best managed by an interprofessional team, including primary care providers, pulmonologists, immunologists, or addiction specialists. In case the nocturnal cough is caused by GERD, a gastroenterologist may need to be consulted to treat the underlying condition. There may also be a need to involve respiratory therapists, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners to more appropriately manage the patient.

To improve outcomes of nocturnal cough, prompt management by an interprofessional team is recommended.
