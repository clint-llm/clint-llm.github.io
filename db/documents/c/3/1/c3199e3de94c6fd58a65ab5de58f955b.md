The prognosis of tarsal tunnel is variable. In patients with an identifiable etiology due to mass effect diagnosed early in the disease course, the response is generally favorable. Patients without an identifiable cause and who do not respond to conservative therapy generally do not do as well with surgical intervention. A positive Tinel sign is a strong predictor of surgical relief.
