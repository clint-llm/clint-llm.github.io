The esophagus serves as a conduit for the transportation of a bolus from the pharynx to the stomach. Thus, events occurring upstream, in the mouth, and downstream, in the stomach impact the esophagus. Additionally, the trachea and the diaphragm closely neighbor the esophagus, with the former being anterior to it and the latter surrounding the LES through its crural part. The crural diaphragm plays an essential role in mediating the relaxation of the LES high-pressure region, allowing for the passage of the food bolus to the stomach.
