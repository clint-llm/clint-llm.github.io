Halothane hepatitis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion, making its initial treatment similar to any other form of fulminant hepatitis. Depending upon each individual case, supportive therapy consists of:

- Fluid and electrolyte balance

- Correcting coagulation alterations

- Managing hypoglycemia

- Supporting ventilation

- Supporting hemodynamics

- Oral lactulose/restricting protein intake

The treatment for both types of halothane hepatotoxicity is supportive measures.

Type 2 halothane hepatitis is severe and requires close monitoring if suspected, as supportive care for these patients is much more intensive and needs to start immediately. A liver transplant is usually necessary once acute liver failure is imminent, despite best supportive measures.
