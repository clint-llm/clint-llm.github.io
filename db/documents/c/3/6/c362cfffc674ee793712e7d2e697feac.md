Brow ptosis itself rarely progresses to more serious pathology. Its mostÂ clinically significant sequela is visual field obstruction, progressing from lateral to medial. Brow ptosis correction surgery complications include patient dissatisfaction (7.4%), numbness of the forehead due to supratrochlear and supraorbital nerve damage (5.5%), alopecia (2.8%), and brow asymmetry (1.7%). Nonsurgical brow rejuvenation complications are very rare. The most common complication of botulinum toxin treatment is periorbital bruising in 1.7% of patients.
