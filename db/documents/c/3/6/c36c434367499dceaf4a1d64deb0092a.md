Patients should be educated to follow up regularly with their physicians after an episode of MI or following cardiac surgery. They should be advised to note the development of new or prolonged chest pain, change in their energy levels, and the onset of new palpitations or a general decline in their health and physical fitness. Few studies have demonstrated vague presenting symptoms, and if patients experience arm, back, or epigastric pain that does not resolve following a cardiac event, they should pursue a medical evaluation.
