Pyogenic granuloma (PG), sometimes known as granuloma pyogenicum, refers to a common, acquired, benign vascular tumor that arises in tissues such as the skin and mucous membranes.

The lesion grossly appears as a solitary, red, pedunculated papule that is very friable. Less commonly, it may present as a sessile plaque. It shows rapid exophytic growth, with a surface that often undergoes ulceration. It is often seen on cutaneous or mucosal surfaces. Among the latter, it is most commonly seen within the oral cavity. Rarely, it may occur at other sites within the gastrointestinal tract.

When it occurs in the intraoral mucosa in the setting of pregnancy, notably on the gingiva, it is referred to as granuloma gravidarum, granuloma of pregnancy, or epulis gravidarum, usually in the second or third trimester.
