Ramsay Hunt syndrome, also known as herpes zoster oticus or geniculate ganglion herpes zoster, is a late complication of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, resulting in inflammation of the geniculate ganglion of cranial nerve VII.

Although the classic triad of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is ipsilateral facial paralysis, otalgia, and a vesicular rash, there is significant variability in clinical presentation, with some patients demonstrating facial paralysis before the rash or, sometimes, no rash at all.
