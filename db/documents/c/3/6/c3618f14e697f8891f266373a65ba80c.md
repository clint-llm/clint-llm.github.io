The superior oblique muscle originates above the annulus of Zinn, which is the origin site for most of the other extraocular muscles. The muscle itself travels along the superomedial orbital wall; however, its cord-like tendon is what passes through the trochlea and turns at an approximately 53-degree angle in the posterolateral direction sagittally. It then fans out and inserts on the sclera in the superotemporal quadrant.

The tendon of the superior oblique is thin and extends posteriorly for approximately 11 mm. The insertion point of the tendon is about 6 to 7 mm from the optic nerve (CN I). One unique aspect of this tendon is its relation to the superior temporal vortex vein, which exits temporally to the insertion of the superior oblique but can also split the fibers of the insertion and pass through them.

The superior oblique muscle is made up of similar muscle types to the remaining extraocular muscles, a particular type of skeletal muscle which contains a combination of type I, slow fibers, and type II, rapid fibers. Also, extraocular muscles, including the superior oblique, possess a higher ratio of nerve fibers to skeletal muscle fibers when compared to other skeletal muscles.
