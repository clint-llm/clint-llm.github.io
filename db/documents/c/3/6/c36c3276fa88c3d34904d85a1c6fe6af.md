**Anterior Triangle**

The internal jugular vein carries considerable clinical significance as it courses through the anterior triangle of the neck. The jugular venous pressure is a feature of the internal jugular vein and serves as a clinical measure of the function of the right side of the heart. In conditions such as inferior wall myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, the forward flow of blood becomes impeded, and the pressure within the internal jugular vein rises as a consequence. This increased pressure causes the vein to appear grossly engorged, and the resultant waveform can be detected by a jugular venous pulse tracing. The internal jugular vein is also frequently used to establish central venous access for purposes such as parental nutrition, dialysis, and administration of chemotherapy drugs. Central access through the internal jugular vein typically has less adverse effects than the subclavian vein, and it can be easily localized using both surface anatomy and ultrasound guidance. However, the proximity of the internal jugular vein to the carotid artery poses the risk of potential puncture or hematoma.

The carotid sinus and carotid body are at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery and serve important physiologic roles with clinical relevance. The carotid sinus is a baroreceptor that regulates blood pressure. It receives innervation from the carotid branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. An increase in blood pressure causes increased tension within the sinus, which adjusts the autonomic activity and results in decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, and a decreased respiratory rate. As a result, the clinician can attempt gentle compression of the carotid sinus, referred to as a carotid sinus massage, to terminate supraventricular tachycardia and other cardiac arrhythmias. The carotid body is a chemoreceptor that detects blood oxygen content and complements the regulatory function of the carotid sinus. Its innervation derives from branches of both the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. In certain conditions of chronic hypoxia such as high altitude or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the carotid bodies can become overstimulated, leading to hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and possibly even neoplastic transformation.

**Posterior Triangle**

Lymphadenopathy is a relatively common pathology of the cervical region and can occur in both the anterior and posterior triangle of the neck. Physical exam and clinical understanding of lymphatic drainage patterns are imperative to determine the underlying cause of the lymphadenopathy. Soft, tender lymph nodes are typically associated with infectious etiologies, such as pharyngitis or mononucleosis, while firm, rubbery lymph nodes are more likely to signify a neoplastic process. Cervical lymphadenopathy is often the presenting sign of head and neck cancers in the adult population, and further work-up is warranted to identify the source of the primary tumor.
