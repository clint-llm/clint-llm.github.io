MNTI management is based on reports which demonstrate that complete excision is the best treatment. A 2019 systematic review analyzing the treatment modalities for MNTI, demonstrated that excision appears to be the best choice as it is associated with low recurrence and lower morbidity rates.

There is a minority of MNTI cases that were successfully treated with chemotherapy alone, without the need for the surgery.
