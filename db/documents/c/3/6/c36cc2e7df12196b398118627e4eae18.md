Complications may include spontaneous rupture or abscess formation, but these are rare. Symptomatic patients with these tumors, especially those with abdominal pain, can be attributed to concomitant GI diseases, particularly IBS, as the lesion itself does not result in symptoms.

Women with hepatic hemangiomas may encounter complications if they become pregnant, as the increased estrogen accompanying pregnancy may cause the hemangioma to grow.

Other complications can include compression of other structures, bleeding, clot accumulation, and calcification.
