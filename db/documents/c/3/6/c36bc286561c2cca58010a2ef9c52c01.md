PC usually takes place in the radiology department with interventional capacity. Interventional radiologists have additional training in placing image-guided percutaneous catheters. Patients needing PC usually have dilated bile ducts due to the pathology and obstructions. This dilatation makes recognizing the biliary ducts on transabdominal ultrasound or with all cross-sectional imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography, easier. There are various ways to access the biliary tree, including a combination of fluoroscopic and ultrasound-guided techniques, based on the physician’s preference.

**Patient's Position and Preparation**

The patient should be in a comfortable supine position allowing appropriate access to the liver. The overlying upper abdomen should be prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.

**Anesthesia**

The procedure involves painful steps that include a percutaneous catheter traversing the skin, intercostal muscles, and the liver capsule. Therefore the procedure should be performed using local anesthesia and moderate sedation. When additional steps like biopsies or stenting are needed, sedation becomes particularly important.

**Antibiotic Prophylaxis**

Gram-negative bacteria and enterococcal antibiotic coverage are necessary for the obstructive biliary system.

**Access and Cannulation**

The most preferred approach to limit complications is accessing the right bile duct from a slightly anterior approach, at the midaxillary line, below the tenth rib. Other approaches include a left-sided epigastric approach or a trans-gallbladder approach.  The method utilized should be determined based on the expected pathology. A sequence of wire and catheter exchanges are performed until access into the biliary tree is obtained. Once biliary access is confirmed, drainage of the bile is the next step, followed by contrast injection into the biliary tree to evaluate the biliary anatomy and pathology. A catheter can then be inserted and advanced across an obstruction into the duodenum. The drainage in this way will be both internally and externally. The external end of the catheter can be caped to enhance internal drainage and preserve the enterohepatic bile salt circulation.

The cholangiographic findings will then direct the management of the defined pathology. Management may include biliary drainage placement, biliary dilation, and/or stent placement.
