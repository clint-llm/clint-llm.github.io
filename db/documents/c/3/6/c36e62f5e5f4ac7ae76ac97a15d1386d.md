**Vaso-occlusive Crisis Management**

Rapid pain assessment and initiation of analgesia should be undertaken promptly. Depending on the degree and severity of pain, analgesic administration can be given intravenously (IV) or intranasally. For patientsÂ who are not in severe pain and can tolerate oral medications, oral analgesics can be used. Generally, the type, route, and dose of the analgesic should be individualized to the patient. Most guidelines recommend early initiation of parenteral opioid analgesics, usually with morphine at 0.1 mg/kg IV or subcutaneously (SC) every 20 minutes, and maintaining this analgesia with morphine at doses of 0.05 to 0.1 mg/ kg every 2 to 4 hrs (SC/IV or PO). Those with persistent pain benefit from a PCA pump. Close monitoring of vital signs including oxygen saturation should be maintained with frequent reassessments of pain severity or resolution.

For other complications like acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration-supportive care with oxygen, judicious fluid administration, and transfusion therapy is needed. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status, with particular attention to excessive sedation, is also necessary.
