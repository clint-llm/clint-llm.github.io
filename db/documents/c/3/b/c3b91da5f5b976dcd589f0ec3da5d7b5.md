Mitral valve insufficiency or mitral regurgitation (MR) is characterized by the reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the left atrium (LA), typically in the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle. It continues to be a significant issue in cardiovascular health worldwide. Serial advancements in the diagnostic tools, clinical management, and treatment of this valvular lesion have changed the clinical approach over the last several decades. The mitral valve apparatus is a complex but dynamic structure and consists of the mitral annulus, two leaflets, chords, and papillary muscles, which are surrounded by complex anatomy in LA and LV.
