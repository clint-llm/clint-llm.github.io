**The Six Stages of a Diabetic Foot**as described by the 7th Practical Diabetes International Foot Conference

- Stage 1 - Normal foot with no risk factors;

- Stage 2 - High-risk foot

- Stage 3 - Ulcerated foot

- Stage 4 - Cellulitic foot

- Stage 5 - Necrotic foot

- Stage 6 - Foot that cannot be rescued

There are three types of diabetic foot ulcer described namely neuropathic, neuroischaemic, and ischaemic.

**Major Risk Factors**

- Peripheral motor neuropathy: Abnormal foot anatomy and biomechanics, with clawing of toes, high arch, and subluxed metatarsophalangeal joints, leading to excess pressure, callus formation, and ulcers

- Peripheral sensory neuropathy: Lack of protective sensation, leading to unattended minor injuries caused by excess pressure or mechanical or thermal injury

- Peripheral autonomic neuropathy: Deficient sweating leading to dry, cracking skin

- Neuro-osteoarthropathy deformities (i.e., Charcot disease) or limited joint mobility

- Abnormal anatomy and biomechanics, leading to excess pressure, especially in the midplantar area

- Vascular (arterial) insufficiency: Impaired tissue viability, wound healing, and delivery of neutrophils

- Hyperglycemia and other metabolic derangements: Impaired immunological (especially neutrophil) function and wound healing and excess collagen cross-linking
