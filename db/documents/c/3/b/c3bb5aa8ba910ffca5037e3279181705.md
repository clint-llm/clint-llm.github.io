Patients who survive an acute CCl4 intoxication generally have a good prognosis without permanent injury. Patients with CCl4 toxicity may have different outcomes, such as fatty degeneration on the short to the mid-term time scale, whereas fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer on the long-term scale. Prognosis depends on the early use of antioxidants or medicationsÂ that counteract collagen deposition. Finally, it bears mentioning that prognosis also depends on the age of the patients as young individuals are less sensitive to CCl4 toxicity.
