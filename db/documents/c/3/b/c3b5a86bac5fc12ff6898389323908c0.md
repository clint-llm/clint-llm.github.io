Histologic examination of IgA pemphigus demonstrates subcorneal blisters with massive neutrophilic infiltration and with a mild loss of cohesion between keratinocytes. Histopathology is useful in differentiating the two major subtypes of IgA pemphigus discussed earlier. In the subcorneal pustular dermatosis subtype, there is an increased intensity of IgA autoantibodies in the upper surface of the epidermis. In contrast, the intraepidermal neutrophilic type is histologically characterized by inflammatory infiltrates, primarily in either the entire or lower part of the dermis.
