ATTR-CM is emerging as an essential clinical entity in the realm of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Real-world clinical data have demonstrated an increased prevalence of ATTR-CM than what was previously perceived. Which improving novel non-invasive imaging techniques, clinicians can now facilitate early diagnosis of ATTR-CM. With the advent of effective therapeutic options for ATTR-CM, it is now possible to improved outcomes in these patients. However, as these therapies cannot reverse the disease process and can only prevent further progression, early identification is paramount for them to be most effective.

Primary care physicians and general cardiologists should understand the disease process and pathophysiology of ATTR-CM. They should look for clinical cues of ATTR-CM and should screen patients who fit the clinical picture. Novel non-invasive cardiac imaging like cardiac MRI and bone avid scintigraphy may have an essential role in diagnosing ATTR-CM. Echocardiogram with strain imaging has also emerged as an efficient screening tool. Radiologists and cardiologists specializing in cardiac imaging should get more familiar with imaging patterns and findings of ATTR-CM.
