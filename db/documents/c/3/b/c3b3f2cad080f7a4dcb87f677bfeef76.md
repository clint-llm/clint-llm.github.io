The clinical history should aim to delineate the specific subtype of AFND, which are the following:

- Classical

- Malignancy associated

- Drug-induced

History of fever, sore throat, or any other infection, significant weight loss, current or previous malignancy, or a new drug administration should be sought.

The classical clinical appearance is that of erythematous, tender, non-pruritic, papules, nodules, and plaques with predominantly head, neck, and upper trunk distribution patterns.

The plaques are often studded with multiple closely grouped translucent papules giving an illusion of vesiculation. These pseudo-vesicles and pseudo-pustules impart a mamillated appearance to the surface of the plaques and are considered one of the suggestive manifestations of AFND. Subsequent ulceration may occur, which resembles a superficial pyoderma gangrenosum that has been described in association with acute myeloid leukemia. Targetoid appearance, facial erysipelas like presentation, and giant cellulitis like appearance are the morphological variants.

Papulonodular lesions of lower limbs closely resemble erythema nodosum and can be differentiated histopathologically. Oral and genital involvements are usually uncommon. However, aphthous ulceration has been reported. Ocular involvement is relatively common in the form of episcleritis and conjunctivitis.

Systemic manifestations: The presence of fever and leukocytosis is the most common, followed by arthralgias and arthritis. Arthritis is typically asymmetric, non-erosive, and sterile.

The specific involvement of visceral organs is known as extracutaneous Sweet syndrome. This includes neutrophilic alveolitis, multifocal sterile osteomyelitis, mesangial glomerulonephritis, acute myositis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and colitis.

CNS involvement, also known as neuro-Sweets disease, may range from aseptic meningitis to brain stem involvement and benign encephalitis.

In about 30% of cases, the skin lesions show spontaneous resolution by 3 months. However, fluctuating course with relapse and remission is more frequently observed.

Clinical variants:

- Neutrophilic dermatosis of dorsal hands- it is characterized by bluish violaceous or hemorrhagic papules, bullae, and nodules on the dorsal hands. It may be accompanied by typical lesions of Sweet syndrome over other areas of the body. This variant may have a greater association with occult or hematological malignancy. It closely mimics a bullous pyoderma gangrenosum.

- A subcutaneous Sweet syndrome-this entity presents with erythema nodosum like lesions on the shins.
