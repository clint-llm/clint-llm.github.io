Researchers have identified hundreds ofÂ mutations causing Fabry disease in the gene for alpha-Gal A, located on the X chromosome. Deficiency of alpha-Gal A is the main cause for the lysosomal buildup of glycosphingolipids, principally the cerebroside trihexosides. Progressive glycolipid accumulation with resultant swelling and proliferation of endothelial cells leads to renal failure in the third to the fourth decade, cardiac disease, strokes, and early death. Classic Fabry phenotype is associated with these mutations and presents with multisystem involvement. Milder forms with missense mutations are restricted to cardiac abnormalities.
