A renal biopsy is a tool for diagnosing the cause of AKI, CKD, or renal mass. However, it is associated with complications.  An interprofessional team of clinicians and nurses can help optimize the overall outcome by educating the patient in regard to the rationale for the procedure over other courses of action and in regard to anticipated management options for theoretical complications.  The clinical nurse and the technologist can help the physician minimize procedure complications by readying the patient and equipment so that the physician is most likely to obtain an adequate biopsy specimen on the first try and by helping the physician address any problems that arise during or after the procedure.

Research on renal biopsies discussed above (primarily Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine version 2.1 level 3) shows that renal biopsies are usually successful at achieving a diagnosis without complication, but that they alter patient outcomes in a minority of cases if the patients are not selected carefully.
