- Fasting blood sugar, pre-meal blood sugar, and hemoglobin A1c are measured semi-annually in patients with good blood sugar control and quarterly in those who did not meet treatment goals or have a change in therapy.

- In patients taking metformin, initial and frequent monitoring of hemoglobin, RBC indices, and renal function tests before therapy initiation, and at least every year. The clinician should repeat these tests every 3 to 6 months if the glomerular filtration rate is 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and every three months if the glomerular filtration rate is from 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels should be measured if the patient is on long-term metformin to rule out megaloblastic anemia.

- In patients taking pioglitazone, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin are measured before initiation and periodically. Signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, features suggestive of bladder cancer (hematuria, dysuria, and urinary urgency), and periodic ophthalmologic exams require monitoring.

- Note any signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating, numbness of extremities), abnormal liver function, and weight fluctuations (due to the potential to cause weight gain) in patients taking sulfonylureas.

- In patients taking acarbose, serum creatinine and serum transaminase levels should be monitored every three months during the first year of treatment and periodically thereafter.

- Renal function (baseline and periodically during treatment) and LDL require monitoring for patients with SGLT 2 inhibitors.
