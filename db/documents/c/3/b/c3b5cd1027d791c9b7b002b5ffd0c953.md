Approximately two-thirds of the patients diagnosed with bronchial atresia in one study were asymptomatic and incidentally found on chests radiograph. Patients usually get diagnosed in the second or third decades of life. One-third of the patients report symptoms, which include cough, shortness of breath and recurrent infections and to a lesser extent wheezing, hemoptysis, chest pain, or pneumothorax.
