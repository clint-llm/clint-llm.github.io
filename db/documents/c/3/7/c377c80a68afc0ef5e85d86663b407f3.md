History can reveal high blood pressure in association with renal dysfunction. A thorough medical history should be taken with specific attention for heat intolerance with abnormally decreased sweat and tear production, severe heart disease, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Attention should be paid to family history, considering the X-linked pattern of genetic inheritance. Affected males may present with the disease appearing in childhood and early adolescence with the involvement of any organ system. However, it usually presents with painful acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, gastrointestinal symptoms, namely abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Skin manifestations include microvascular lesions that can appear as small petechiae around the umbilicus, eye manifestations such as lenticular opacities and corneal dystrophy.

The course of the disease is variable but usually manifests as polyuria, polydipsia, and proteinuria leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiac conduction and valvular defects, CVA, and other neurological manifestations in the third to the fourth decade of life. Some patients may present with complaints of lymphadenopathy and problems adjusting to heat or cold and strenuous exercise.
