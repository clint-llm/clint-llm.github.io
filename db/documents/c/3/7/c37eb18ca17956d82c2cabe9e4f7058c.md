- The patient should be risk-stratified and medically optimized for general anesthesia.

- A thorough preoperative head and neck examination, including an assessment of facial nerve function, should be performed.

- Preoperative photography may be considered to document the defect's shape, size, and location.

- The patient should be appropriately counseled regarding the procedure's risks, benefits, and alternatives. Pertinent to this procedure, it is important to mention flap compromise, alopecia, paresthesias, and facial nerve injury, among the other more common risks associated with surgery (e.g., pain, bleeding, infection, scarring, etc.).

- The surgeon should mark the skin incisions in the temporal scalp to ensure maximal preservation of the hairline. The Y or T-shaped incision is made parallel to the course of the STA. The arterial bifurcation is commonly found 3 centimeters above the helical root.

- Important landmarks are identified, including the STA and trajectory of the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve.

- General anesthesia is recommended. Long-acting paralytics are usually avoided to permit intraoperative facial nerve monitoring. Similarly, some surgeons will prefer to avoid using local anesthesia, instead substituting plain 1:100,000 epinephrine to avoid interfering with nerve monitoring.

- A single dose of intravenous antibiotics covering skin flora is given preoperatively.
