An important feature of the toxicokinetics of lead is the differential absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of lead in young children compared to adults. In both adults and children, lead is primarily absorbed via the lung (inhalation) and GI tract (ingestion). While pulmonary absorption is reasonably efficient in both age groups (about 40%), children inhale more air relative to their body size than adults do, placing them at proportionally higher risk. Children generally absorb about 40 to 50% of the lead they ingest, while adults only absorb about 10 to 15%. The GI absorption of lead is also higher in those individuals with concomitant iron, calcium, or zinc deficiency, which tend to plague young children more often than adults.

Once the lead is absorbed, it binds to red blood cells and distributes into two major compartments: the bone and the soft tissues. The soft tissue compartment includes the liver, kidneys, bone marrow, and brain, and is relatively labile compared to the more stable bone compartment. In adults, nearly the entire body burden of lead; about 85 to 95% - is stored in the stable bone compartment, whereas only about 70% of the body burden of lead storage is in bone in children. Children are thus again at greater risk of developing manifestations of lead toxicity because more of their lead body burden is stored in metabolically active sites, rather than in relatively inert bone.
