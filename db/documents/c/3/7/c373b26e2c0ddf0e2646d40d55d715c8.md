The etiology of gastrointestinal bleeding is divided into upper gastrointestinal (GI) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Upper GI Bleeding**

- Peptic ulcer disease (can be secondary to excess gastric acid, H. pylori infection, NSAID overuse, or physiologic stress)

- Esophagitis

- Gastritis and Duodenitis

- Varices

- Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG)

- Angiodysplasia

- Dieulafoy lesion (bleeding dilated vessel that erodes through the gastrointestinal epithelium but has no primary ulceration; can be at any location along the GI tract

- Gastric antral valvular ectasia (GAVE; also known as watermelon stomach)

- Mallory-Weiss tears

- Cameron lesions (bleeding ulcers occurring at the site of a hiatal hernia

- Aortoenteric fistulas

- Foreign body ingestion

- Post-surgical bleeds (post-anastomotic bleeding, post-polypectomy bleeding, post-sphincterotomy bleeding)

- Upper GI tumors

- Hemobilia (bleeding from the biliary tract)

- Hemosuccus pancreaticus (bleeding from the pancreatic duct)

**Lower GI Bleeding**

- Diverticulosis (colonic wall protrusion at the site of penetrating vessels; over time mucosa overlying the vessel can be injured and rupture leading to bleeding) [diverticulosis]

- Angiodysplasia

- Infectious colitis

- Ischemic colitis

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- Colon cancer

- Hemorrhoids

- Anal fissures

- Rectal varices

- Dieulafoy lesion (more rarely found outside of the stomach, but can be found throughout GI tract)

- Radiation-induced damage following treatment of abdominal or pelvic cancers

- Post-surgical (post-polypectomy bleeding, post-biopsy bleeding)
