The discovery, development, and implementation of ionizing radiation as a means for medical imaging, such as fluoroscopy, has proved to be pivotal in the advancement of modern medicine. With this technology so readily available, guiding medical procedures has become widespread in the medical community. However, with such use comes the hazardous risk of exposure to radiation and its subsequent potential detrimental effects on patients and caregivers such as physicians, nurses, and radiation technologists. This activity reviews the protective measures against radiation exposure during the use of fluoroscopy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the facilitation and promotion of radiation safety.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basics of X-ray imaging.
- Describe major sources of radiation exposure.
- Review radiation exposure reduction and protective methods.
- Identify detrimental biologic effects of radiation exposure and how the interprofessional team can work together to avoid them providing the best patient outcomes.
