Physical examination generally reveals a 0.5 cm to several centimeters of non-fluctuant, compressible mass. A central, dark comedone opening (punctum) is often described. Epidermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic; however, if ruptured it may closely resemble a furuncle with tenderness to palpation, erythema, and swelling. A foul-smelling yellowish cheese-like material discharged from the skin may be described. Some patients may describe an event of a fall on their back or someone slapping their back causing painful swelling and the resulting cystic rupture. Epidermoid cysts can be found anywhere but are commonly found on the face, neck, chest, upper back, scrotum, and genitals. They can also be found on the buttocks, palms, and plantar side of feet if due to penetrating trauma. If occurring on the distal portion of the fingers, changes to the nail plate may occur. Taking a good history can aid in determining if the cyst is an isolated case, caused by medications, or if it is part of a genetic syndrome.
