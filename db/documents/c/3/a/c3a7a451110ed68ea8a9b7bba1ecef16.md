An interventricular septal abscess most commonly arises from the progression of infective endocarditis in a native or prosthetic valve to the interventricular septum. A perivalvular abscess due to infective endocarditis can also extend and become an interventricular abscess.

The primary etiology of the interventricular septal abscess is disseminated bacteremia, an extension of infective source or local infection.
