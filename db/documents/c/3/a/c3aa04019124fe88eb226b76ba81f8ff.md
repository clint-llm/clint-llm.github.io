During embryology, the blood vessels predominately develop from the mesodermal germ layer. The mesodermal germ layer contains mesenchymal tissue. The princeps pollicis artery develops from mesenchymal tissue. As the limbs grow during embryology, the fibroblast growth factor induces the lengthening of bones, muscles, and blood vessels. Fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have angiogenesisÂ characteristics on blood vessels; this will induce the formation and growth of the princeps pollicis artery.
