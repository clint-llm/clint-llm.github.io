Adequate calcium intake, from either direct food sources or calcium supplements, is essential for nutrition in patients of all ages. This article will summarize dietary sources of calcium, the current recommendations for calcium intake, the different types of calcium supplementation, the preventative measures and health benefits of calcium, and the potential risks of excessive calcium intake. Additionally, this article will highlight the role of interprofessional team members in ensuring that patients receive appropriate dietary calcium for growth, nutrition, and disease prevention.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the current recommendations regarding healthy calcium intake based on the indications for and the different formulations of calcium supplementation. 
- Outline the critical steps involved in calcium absorption, metabolism, and regulation, and summarize the main physiologic functions dependent upon ionized calcium. 
- Review any potential adverse events associated with excessive calcium intake, including special considerations regarding calcium intake in specific high-risk populations like those with chronic kidney disease.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding adequate calcium supplementation to improve bone health and nutrition in both general and high-risk populations.
