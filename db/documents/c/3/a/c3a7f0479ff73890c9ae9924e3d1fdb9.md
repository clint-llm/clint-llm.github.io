Hand fractures are common in the general population, with a relative propensity seen in contact-sport athletes (e.g., boxers and football players) and manual laborers. Metacarpal fractures typically occur secondary to a direct blow or fall directly onto the hand. These fractures commonly occur during athletic activities, particularly in contact sports. Almost one-fourth of cases occur during athletic events. Metacarpal fractures, when extra-articular, are often managed with closed reduction and cast immobilization. When closed reduction is not successful, and in cases of intra-articular fractures, the management includes open reduction and internal fixation. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of metacarpal hand fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical, most common mechanisms of injury that lead to metacarpal hand fractures.
- Review the examination procedures and diagnostic imaging needed for metacarpal hand fracture assessment.
- Describe the treatment protocol for metacarpal hand fractures.
- Explain why careful planning and discussion among interprofessional team members involved in managing patients with metacarpal hand fractures will improve outcomes.
