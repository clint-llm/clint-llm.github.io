The prognosis for lateral epicondylitis is generally good. Most patients will have pain relief within 12 months of conservative treatment (ice, rest, and anti-inflammatory medications). For patients who do not improve with initial treatment, various physical and occupational therapies can be helpful. Patients who fail to follow through on their therapy plan frequently have a recurrence of symptoms.
