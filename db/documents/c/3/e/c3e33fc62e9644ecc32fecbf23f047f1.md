Excess use of docusate may cause dependence on bowel function. Patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or the elderly that use the laxatives for constipation are at risk for dependency and abuse. Alternating diarrhea with constipation can be a presentation of laxative abuse. Excessive bowel movements induced by a laxative can lead to fluid and electrolyte losses via the gastrointestinal tract. This condition can manifest with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hypovolemia can lead to acute kidney injury. The treatment of laxative abuse is to stop the offending agent. Rebound signs and symptoms like constipation, weight gain, and edema can occur after stopping a laxative. Diuretics can be used cautiously in such cases to treat edema.
