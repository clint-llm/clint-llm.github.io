Aphasia is an impairment of language function which is localized to the dominant cerebral hemisphere. Traditionally, aphasia is categorized as either an expressive (Broca) or a receptive (Wernicke) aphasia. Many patients have a component of both types of aphasia. This article describes Wernicke aphasia (also called receptive aphasia). This condition was first described by German physician Carl Wernicke in 1874 and is characterized by impaired language comprehension. Despite impaired comprehension, speech may have a normal rate, rhythm, and grammar. Patients with Wernicke's aphasia have impaired comprehension of their speech and thus do not recognize the errors that they are making.
