Based upon similar ocular findings (early onset nystagmus):

- OCA syndromes

- Ocular albinism

- Optic nerve atrophy and hypoplasia: The condition of broad etiology resulting in decreased visual acuity, nystagmus, and optic nerve atrophy, optic disc pallor

- Inherited retinal dystrophy: A family of disorders of variable heritance patterns (autosomal dominant, X-linked, recessive) and broad phenotypes that included congenital nystagmus and decreased visual acuity

- FRMD7-related infantile nystagmus syndrome (also known as congenital motor nystagmus, congenital infantile nystagmus): An X-linked disorder with nystagmus and reduced visual acuity with normal VEPs

- Aniridia: The absence of the iris, which demonstrates foveal hypoplasia, nystagmus, amblyopia, and cataracts

- Aland Island eye disease (Forsius-Eriksson syndrome): An X-linked disorder with fundal hypopigmentation, foveal hypoplasia, myopia, nystagmus, astigmatism, night blindness

- Cross-McKusick-Breen syndrome: An autosomal recessive disorder with hypopigmentation of skin, silvery gray hair, microphthalmia, corneal opacification, nystagmus, with or without mental retardation, athetosis, ataxia, joint contractures, and spastic tetraplegia

- Achromatopsia: An autosomal recessive disorder causing dysfunctional cone cells in the retina, resulting in partial or complete loss of color vision with associated photophobia, nystagmus, low visual acuity, and hyperopia.

Based on hair and cutaneous finding (hypopigmentation):

- OCA syndromes

- Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome

- Chediak-Higashi syndrome

- Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome

- Vici syndrome: An autosomal recessive disorder with absent corpus callosum; subjects present with hair and skin hypopigmentation, findings similar to OA1, microcephaly, immunodeficiency, cardiac abnormalities, failure to thrive, cataracts, cleft lip and palate, and neurologic abnormalities

- Waardenburg syndrome type II: Autosomal dominant MITF gene mutation presenting with patchy skin hypopigmentation, white forelock or prematurely gray hair, iris heterochromia, sensorineural hearing loss

- Tietz albinism-deafness syndrome: Autosomal dominant MITF gene mutation presenting with white eyebrows and eyelashes, iris hypopigmentation, normal visual acuity, and sensorineural hearing loss

- Griscelli syndrome: Autosomal recessive defects in myosin, myosin receptors, and binding; melanocytes fail to transfer melanosomes to dendrites and peripheral keratinocytes leading to diluted skin/hair color; present with hypopigmentation, melanin aggregation in silvery-gray hair, immunodeficiency, decreased visual acuity with roving eye movements, pancytopenia, hemophagocytic syndrome, and cerebral demyelination
