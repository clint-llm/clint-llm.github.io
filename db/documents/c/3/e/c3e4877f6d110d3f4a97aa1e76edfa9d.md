While someÂ have argued that human hair is a vestigial evolutionary remnant, in reality, human hair serves many psychological and physiological functions. Human hair grows at a rate of 0.35 mm/day, and around 100 hairs are shed daily. Human hair angiogenesis begins at about ten weeks of gestation, and final development results in the mature hair follicle. The pilosebaceous unit comprises the sebaceous gland, the arrector pili muscle, and the hair follicle. The clinical significance of hair includes increased hair loss disorders, complete hair loss disorders, and other conditions. Hair loss is often accompanied by psychological strife, which should be addressed and monitored by clinicians.
