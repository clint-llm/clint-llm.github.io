The adverse effects of isosorbide are due to the vasodilation of the venous capacitance vessels and the arterioles. The venodilation results in peripheral pooling of blood and arteriolar dilation, lowering systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and lowering blood pressure. Other adverse effects can be due to the reflex activity of the sympathetic nervous system due to vasodilation.

The adverse effects of isosorbide are:

- Headache (greater than 10 percent)

- Reflex tachycardia (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Orthostatic hypotension (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Hypotension (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Cutaneous flushing (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Nausea, vomiting (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Dizziness (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Lightheadedness (0.1 to 10 percent)

- syncope (0.1 to 10 percent)

- Monday disease -Â  Monday disease is due to the development of tolerance throughout therapy. It presents with tachycardia, dizziness, and headache during re-exposure after a drug-free interval.

- Methemoglobinemia(rare)
