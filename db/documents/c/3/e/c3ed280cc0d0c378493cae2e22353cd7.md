Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by parathyroid glands and plays a role in calcium and skeletal metabolism.

Prolonged SHPT is often associated with disturbances of bone turnover, as well as visceral and vascular calcifications, which are responsible for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Despite improvements in medical treatment, surgical treatment of SHPTÂ is often necessary, especially in refractory cases.
