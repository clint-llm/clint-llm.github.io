The treatment of organ rejection depends on the type of injury and underlying etiology. In chronic kidney rejection, complications including arterial hypertension, pulmonary edema, and uremia should be managed through various therapeutic options, including but not limited to hemodialysis, hemofiltration, and the use of diuretics.

As a general statement, most infectious causes should be treated with specific, directed antimicrobials.

In diabetic nephropathy, the albumin to creatinine ratio can be used to guide therapy.  If this ratio is greater than 3, inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is recommended with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). This therapy should be pursued even in the setting of normal blood pressure to help protect the donor's kidney.

Tight glucose control is recommended in the setting of hyperglycemia.  In type 1 diabetes mellitus, therapy is typically accomplished with insulin, and in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, therapy is usually with a biguanide or sulfonylurea.

In end-stage rejection, there may be a consideration for retransplantation of the organ or tissues.
