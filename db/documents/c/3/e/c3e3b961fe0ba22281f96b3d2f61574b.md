Therapeutic hypothermia is usually well-tolerated, but short-term adverse effects are common.

- Cardiovascular complications  

- Bradycardia - Heart rate decreases 15 /min per 1degree C change in temperature. At 33.5 degrees C, the average heart rate is approximately 80 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). Neonates can tolerate significant bradycardia (60 to 80 bpm) if blood pressure is maintained adequately. If the heart rate is persistently below 60/min, obtain a full EKG.
- Hypotension - Hypothermia decreases cardiac output and causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which leads to hypotension. Consider echocardiogram to assess cardiac output. Maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 40 mmHg. Significant hypotension may need a saline bolus, vasopressors, and steroids. 
- Prolonged QT interval and ventricular arrhythmias

- Respiratory complications 

- Impaired surfactant production.
- Hypothermia can also cause worsening of oxygenation due to induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is usually reversible with rewarming. 
- Hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin curve and can result in decreased oxygen delivery.

- Electrolyte imbalance

- Hypokalemia 
- hyponatremia
- Hypomagnesemia
- Hypophosphatemia

- Coagulopathy - platelet dysfunction

- Increased incidence of sepsis due to inhibition of pro-inflammatory response

- Delayed gastric emptying causing intolerance of enteral feeds

- Altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of medications like sedatives and analgesics during hypothermia

During rewarming, the following complications can occur.

- Higher risk of seizures due to an increase in cerebral metabolic rate

- Apnea

- Higher risk of hypotension due to vasodilation of constricted peripheral vascular bed.
