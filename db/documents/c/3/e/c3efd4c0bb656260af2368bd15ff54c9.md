Several disorders should merit consideration in the differential diagnosis of BD. In porphyria cutanea tarda and pseudoporphyria, the blisters are usually infracentimetric and favor the hands rather than the feet and ankles. Pseudoporphyria is not uncommon in patients with diabetes as they may develop complications including both chronic renal failure and atherosclerotic cardio­vascular disease and, thus, they may be receiving dialysis and/or diuretics. The distal extremity is also a common site for erythema multiforme and fixed drug eruptions, but the bullae usually develop on an inflammatory base. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and localized bullous pemphigoid, closely resembling BD, both clinically and histologically, are dif­ferentiated from BD by histologic examination and direct immunofluorescence, as well as by an accen­tuation of lesions at frictional sites in patients with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. If there is a surrounding inflammatory skin with erythema, warmth, and tenderness, the possibility of bullous cellulitis must also be a consideration.
