Since portal vein obstruction is more of a radiological than clinical diagnosis, it is less likely to be suspected in a patient without ample evidence. However, due to similar symptomatology or pathophysiology, the following differentials should be ruled out:

- Primary biliary cirrhosis

- Arsenic toxicity

- Budd-Chiari syndrome

- Cirrhosis

- Sarcoidosis

- Schistosomiasis
