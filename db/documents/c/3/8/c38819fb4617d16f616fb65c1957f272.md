Even though the literature on tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis is limited, there have been isolated case studies of patients developing severe complications after being diagnosed with TKI keratitis, such as corneal perforation, secondary infection, and ulcerative keratitis. Bilateral ulcerative keratitis was seen in a patient on afatinib in a case study done by McKelvie et al.

In a more severe and isolated case reported by Sobol et al., a patient being treated with erlotinib was diagnosed with streptococcus dysgalactiae infectious keratitis, subsequently progressing to corneal perforation.
