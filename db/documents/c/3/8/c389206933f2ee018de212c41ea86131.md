There tends to be no significant effect on the AV node as it does not depend on fast sodium channels. Instead, sodium channel blockade produces a variety of cardiac effects as demonstrated by their impact on the myocyte action potential. With varying degrees of potency, class I agents decrease the slope and amplitude of phase 0, and thereby reduce the rate of depolarization and the conduction velocity through the myocyte. This leads to a slower depolarization of the cell and is important for the desired therapeutic suppression of tachydysrhythmias through reentrant mechanisms. Concomitant anticholinergic effects of many of these drugs can complicate their sodium channel effects.
