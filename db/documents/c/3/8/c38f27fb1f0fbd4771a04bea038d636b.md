The sublingual glands receive their primary blood supply from the sublingual and submental arteries, which are branches of the lingual artery and facial artery, respectively. These arteries are both branches of the external carotid artery. The sublingual vein drains into the lingual vein, which then flows into the internal jugular system.

The sublingual glands drain into the submandibular lymph nodes. The submandibular lymphatics comprise 3 to 6 nodes, which are located in the submaxillary triangle, beneath the body of the mandible. The nodes are palpable on the superficial surface of the submandibular gland. Malignant tumors may drain into these regional lymph nodes, requiring more extensive neck dissection for the complete treatment of cancer.
