The evaluation of SAD has many challenges. Treatment of SAD entails hormonal therapy and the use of neurotransmitters requiring precise diagnosis. However, SAD exhibits symptoms similar to other forms of depression. The temporal nature of mood swings also affects data acquisition. SAD is depicted as a seasonal presentation of specific depression symptoms. The pattern was observed among many Canadian youths. These variations pose a major challenge to medical personnel regarding diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.

DSM-5 is a major diagnostic criterion. It is used seasonally when the depressive symptoms are more than normal and present only in specific months of the year and are replicated at specific times.
