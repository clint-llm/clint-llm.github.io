Intracardiac shunts are the most common congenital heart defects. One in eight newly born infants worldwide has some type of congenital heart anomaly. The prevalence of congenital heart defects varies with geography. Asia has the highest prevalence, with 9.3 cases reported for every 1,000 live births, and the least prevalence was noticed in Africa, with 1.3 cases reported for every 1,000 live births. North America has 6.9 cases per 1,000 live births. The difference in prevalence could also be attributed to the better availability of diagnostic modalities in certain parts of the world than others. In the US, the prevalence of congenital heart defects is slightly higher in whites and Hispanics than in the black population. Overall, female predominance was seen in the US, with 8.03 females affected compared to 7.67 males for every 1,000 live births.
