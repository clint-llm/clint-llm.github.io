This structure has little variation concerning the anatomical location and function. Previous studies have revealed different locations of insertion for the TFL - however, the band itself has been consistent with its insertion onto Gerdy's tubercle. Anatomical and structural bony abnormalities, whether because of injury or degenerative process, may ultimately affect the physiological function of the ITB depending on the adaptation of the musculoskeletal structures.Â Further evaluation of the proximal muscular structures may be warranted to determine the clinically significant variations of the ITB tract distally.
