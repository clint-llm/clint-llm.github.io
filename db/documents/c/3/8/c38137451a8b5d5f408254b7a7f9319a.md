Cefepime is a cephalosporin in the beta-lactam class of antibiotics used to manage and treat gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for cefepime as a valuable agent in managing bacterial infections for hospitalized patients. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse effects, and other essential factors such as dosing and monitoring appropriate for all interprofessional team members when treating patients with cefepime.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of cefepime. 
- Review the chemical structures of cefepime vs. penicillin to explain why IgE mediated cross-reactivity reaction is unlikely.
- Summarize the possible toxic effects that cefepime. 

- Outline interprofessional team approaches for improving care coordination for the safe use of cefepime that will reduce morbidity and improve patient safety.
