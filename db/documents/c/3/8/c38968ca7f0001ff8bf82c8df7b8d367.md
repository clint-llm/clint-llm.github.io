The word "endophthalmitis" can be broken down in greek to "interior-eye-inflammation" and is used to describe an infection of the vitreous or the aqueous humor within the eye. An intraocular infection has devastating consequences, leading to decreased vision and possibly irreversible blindness. The interior of the eye is a sterile environment, but this can suffer compromise by exogenous sources such as penetrating trauma and surgery or endogenous sources via bacteria in the patient's circulatory system. Endophthalmitis results from either bacteria or fungi invading and multiplying within the vitreous or aqueous humor. This activity outlines and describes the evaluation and management of bacterial endophthalmitis and reviews the role of the healthcare professional as well as that of the interprofessional team in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care to enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bacterial endophthalmitis.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of bacterial endophthalmitis.
- Outline the management options available for bacterial endophthalmitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes.
