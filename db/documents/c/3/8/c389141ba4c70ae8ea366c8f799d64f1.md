Plasmapheresis offers an effective therapy for many acute and chronic diseases. It can also be used as an adjunct to prepare for procedures, surgery, and even improve postoperative recovery or shorten ventilation periods. Generally, risks and side effects are mild, most common being transient hypotension and related symptoms.

The American Society for Apheresis has done extensive research on plasmapheresis as a therapeutic strategy, and continue to update a comprehensive apheresis guideline using an evidence-based approach to aid physicians caring for these patients.
