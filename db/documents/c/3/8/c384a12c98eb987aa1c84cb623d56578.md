Neonatal myasthenia gravis is an antibody-mediated disorder caused by the transplacental transmission of maternal antibodies. Approximately three-quarter of the mothers with myasthenia gravis posses anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibodies. These circulating maternal autoantibodies cross the placenta to the fetus and are responsible for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor loss by speeding up their degradation, blocking acetylcholine binding, and prompting the lysis of the postsynaptic membrane through activation of the complement system. This leads to an affected child after birth(rarely before birth with decreased fetal movements and the formation of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and decrease fetal swallowing and polyhydramnios). The antibodies can be directed against the fetal (present until 33 weeks' gestation) or the adult acetylcholine receptor. Children of mothers who have MG will develop neonatal myasthenia gravis approximately 5% to 30% of the time.
