The pathology of LBD overlaps that of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, called Lewy bodies (comprising aggregates of ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein) and found within the brain parenchyma (mainly in the brainstem, limbic system, and cerebral cortex), are characteristic of Lewy body dementia.
