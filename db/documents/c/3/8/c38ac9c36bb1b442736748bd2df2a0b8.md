Patients who receive a diagnosis of peliosis hepatis should receive adequate counseling from medical providers regarding the disease condition as well as their prognosis. Those with incidental lesions found on abdominal imaging with subsequent biopsies demonstrating this condition should receive a referral to a gastroenterologist with expertise for annual monitoring of disease progression. Given the limited research, a specialist should provide the patients, families, and friends with both early and anticipatory counseling to best understand this disease process.
