The treatment of breast discharge depends on the etiology. A physiological discharge does not require any treatment. Systemic causes of nipple discharge require specific medications. Benign causes of breast discharge like duct ectasia requires microdochectomy (removal of one duct) or total duct excision (removal of all ducts). Duct papillomas that produce unilateral bloody discharge require microdochectomy. Breast cancer-producing bloody nipple discharge requires surgery and/or chemotherapy or radiation depending on the staging of the disease.Â Purulent discharge is treated with appropriate antibiotics, but abscesses need incision and drainage and wall biopsy of the abscess.
