The hypogastric nerve starts at the fork of the superior hypogastric plexus: right and left plexus, continuing inferiorly bilaterally on the sides of the body, descending into the pelvis forming the inferior hypogastric plexus. The inferior hypogastric plexus forms a network of nerves that supply the viscera of the pelvic cavity. The plexus lies in the extraperitoneal connective tissue on the pelvic sidewall; the plexus lies on the rectum in males and the rectum and vagina in females. It is located anterolaterally to the mesorectum.

The inferior hypogastric plexus is commonly described as a triangle. The inferior edge of the triangle constantly stretches from the fourth sacral root; its posterior (dorsal) side the point of contact with the sacral roots, from which it receives its afferents; its cranial edge lays parallel to the posterior edge of the hypogastric artery.

Contributions to the inferior hypogastric plexus include:

- superior hypogastric plexus in the form of the hypogastric nerve

- sacral splanchnic nerves from the sympathetic trunk at vertebral levels T10-L2

- pelvic splanchnic nerves

The pelvic splanchnic nerves contribute parasympathetic efferent fibers to the plexus.
