Cataplexy is all but unique to type 1 narcolepsy; therefore, the differential diagnosis of this feature is sparse. Pseudocataplexy, a feature of conversion disorder, is characterized by cataplexy-like attacks; however, the other defining characteristics of narcolepsy are often absent.

Although rare, cataplexy can occur in the presence of lateral hypothalamic lesions implicated in the development of secondary narcolepsy. Such lesions may arise in the setting of arteriovenous malformations, cerebrovascular accidents, inflammatory processes, and neoplasms.
