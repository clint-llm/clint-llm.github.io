Once underway, the surgical team will fit the patient with a special frame to immobilize head movement during the surgery. This frame is called a stereotactic head frame. Surgery is commonly performed under general anesthesia, but local anesthesia is also a viable alternative. Intriguingly, the brain itself does not require an anesthetic itself, as it lacks pain receptors. The surgeon then implants a thin wire lead to the structures that were identified pre-surgery. Tiny electrodes at the end of the wire will contact the aforementioned structures. The lead is then connected to a wire which runs just superficially to the skin, which ultimately connects to a pulse generator within the chest wall. Both the neurosurgeon and neurologist will closely monitor brain function throughout the procedure to ensure appropriate electrode placement.

The subsequent chest wall surgery involves the placement of the pulse generator just under the skin near the clavicle. Unlike the preceding procedure, chest wall surgery requires general anesthesia. The pulse generator is then connected to a special remote control.
