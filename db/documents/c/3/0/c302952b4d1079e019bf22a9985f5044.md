Jellyfish are members of the phylum Cnidaria. They are invertebrates that float in salt and brackish water. They have a central bell and multiple lengthy tentacles. Jellyfish consume their prey using stinging cells called nematocysts.  Nematocysts are hollow, barbed tubes that inject venom into the victim's skin at a force of two to five pounds per square inch (13-34 kPa). The nematocysts are located along the jellyfish's tentacles and discharge using a “spring mechanism” upon contact with the prey.
