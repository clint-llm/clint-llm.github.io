Oseltamivir is generally very well tolerated and has few drug interactions. Multiple animal toxicity studies, pre, and post-marketing of oseltamivir, have indicated respiratory suppression resulting from central nervous system suppression, hypothermia, hypoactivity, and sudden death. This adverse event correlates with sudden-onset type neuropsychiatric reactions in human patients (especially children from Japan), but no definitive link has been established.

Oseltamivir-induced liver injury requires discontinuation of the drug and avoidance of reexposure. The majority of the patients recover on discontinuation of oseltamivir without specific interventions.
