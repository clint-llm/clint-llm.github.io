The velopharyngeal sphincter consists of the soft palate (velum), levator veli palatini, tensor veli palatini, palatopharyngeus, palatoglossus, muscularis uvulae, and the superior constrictor muscles.

During normal speech, this separation allows airflow to be channeled from the vocal cords to the articulating tongue, lips, and teeth of the oral cavity. This produces the consonant (p, b, t, d, k, g, f, v, s, z, sh, ch, ge, l, r, w, y) and vowel sounds or phonemes.

During VPD, there is an airflow leak into the nasal cavity secondary to anatomic, neurologic, or functional impairment. Sound produced at the vocal cords subsequently enters both the oral and nasal cavities, causing both cavities to resonate and creates an overall “nasal” sound due to excessive nasal airflow. This is also known as nasal emission or nasal escape.

Patients’ ability to produce consonant sounds becomes impaired and they may develop maladaptive compensatory mechanisms such as glottal stops, pharyngeal fricatives, and facial grimaces in an effort to close the anterior nares and decrease nasal airflow.
