The most common variant includes the aberrant subclavian, which means the artery root comes off a location different than typically found. Majority of these cases are benign, but in some cases, the variant may cause symptomology. If the right subclavian roots directly from the aortic arch (the most common aberrant) as the last branch of the arch it travels posteriorly, and it may wrap around the esophagus leading to a vascular ring which may induce dysphagia (dysphagia lusoria). Less likely, this variation's path may also put pressure on the recurrent nerve and lead to hoarseness or vocal cord paralysis (dubbed Ortner syndrome).
