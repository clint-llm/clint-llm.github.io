Since HIVAN is associated with a high risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and increased mortality, treatment should not be delayed. Combined antiretroviral therapy continues to be the mainstay of treatment for HIVAN, as it has been shown to reduce the likelihood of progression into ESRD. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is also important since it has been shown to improve renal survival and should be considered as an adjunct to cART in HIVAN. In patients with refractory renal impairment after cART and RAAS blockade treatment, steroids can be added as an adjunct, but data supporting them as primary treatment is weak, and the side effect profile is broad. It is important to adjust cART therapy to renal function as some have been shown to directly affect renal function, such as tenofovir, atazanavir, and indinavir. In those who progress to ESRD, renal replacement therapy remains the mainstay of management, and renal transplantation can be considered as the evidence demonstrates it is effective in patients with controlled HIV.
