Assessment of the vestibulo-ocular reflex takes place using the Halmagyi-Curthoys test, also known as the rapid impulse test. To perform this, the physician will rapidly move the patient’s head in one direction (left or right), and the eyes should remain in place focused on a particular object in front of them despite the head movement. If a patient’s VOR has damage on one side when their head turns to that direction with force, their eyes will follow the direction of the head movement before coming back to their focal point; this would imply some issue in the vestibulo-ocular reflex arc.
