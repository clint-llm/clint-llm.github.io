Diving accidents are a common occurrence and account for more than 1000Â emergency department visits per year in the United States. While this rate has remained steady for many years, the hope that increasing awareness, as well as technological improvements, will lead to a decrease in future casualties. All divers should be aware of the annual Divers Alert Network report that provides case studies of recent accidents and the steps that could have been taken to prevent them.
