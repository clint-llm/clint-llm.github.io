A thorough medical history and physical exam is a requirement for all individuals suspected of having XLA.

In the case of infants or very young children, history is elicited through a careful interview of the parents or caretakers. Obtaining information about the general health status, past infections, hospitalizations, surgeries, vaccinations, vaccination reactions, allergies, and current and past medications is crucial. Knowledge of the patient’s diet, home environment, social history, and travel activities may also be contributory.

A history of frequent, chronic, or recurrent infections, such as conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., pharyngitis; sinusitis; bronchitis; pneumonia), deep-seated skin infections (e.g., empyema), purulent otitis media, and diarrhea should raise suspicion. Patient records containing documented information of cultures found positive for encapsulated bacteria may help guide the diagnosis. Bacterial pneumonia, for example, is rare in infants and immunocompetent young children. Other important clues that can be used to direct the work-up include a history indicating the need for IV antibiotics to resolve infections, multiple hospitalizations before the age of 3 years, or developmental delay.

A careful review of systems should be completed, with special attention paid to the upper and lower respiratory, lymphatic, gastrointestinal, and integumentary systems.

XLA infants are born healthy, with no outward signs of impending illness, and do not develop recurrent infections until 6-8 months of age when maternal antibodies are no longer active.  Although a history of recurrent infections beginning after 6 months of age is very characteristic of this disease, a physical exam is also important.  Lymphoid tissues are typically hypoplastic in XLA patients. The tonsils may be difficult to visualize, and the cervical/inguinal lymph nodes may not be palpable. The otoscopic exam may be used to detect signs of chronic damage, i.e., purulent otitis media, perforation of the tympanic membrane, or nasal discharge. Chest auscultation is performed to check for prolongation of expiration or inspiration, cough, any increase in respiratory effort, or stridor. Audible rhonchi, crackles, wheezing, and/or inspiratory squeaks suggest lung pathology and warrant further testing (e.g., lung function tests, CT scan, or biopsy) to rule out bronchiectasis. Similarly, the presence of abdominal distention justifies the need to perform an abdominal ultrasound to exclude hepatosplenomegaly.

Finally, it is important not to overlook the family medical history, including information about past infections, hospitalizations, surgeries, previous diagnoses or symptoms of immunodeficiency, the ages and health status of living relatives, or causes of death.
