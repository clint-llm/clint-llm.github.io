Careful use of ultrasound with continuous visualization of the needle tip will reduce the risk of complications. Pneumothorax is a potential complication, occurring in about 1% of procedures, generally occurring by advancing the needle farther than needed.

Thus, special care should be used in patients whose anatomy limits the visualization of the needle-point.Â  Pneumothorax is a common cause of lawsuits in chronic pain practice, accounting for 4% of closed claim cases.

Another risk of the suprascapular nerve block is an accidental intravenous or intraarterial injection. The suprascapular artery and vein lie near the nerve, even though they are separated by the superior transverse ligament of the scapula. The accidental puncture and injection into the vein or the artery could cause local anesthetic toxicity that may be fatal. Careful, frequent aspiration is necessary to avoid this complication. Visualization of local anesthetic spread on ultrasound also confirms non-vascular injection. The risk of intravascular injection increases in patients with poor ultrasound visualization.

Other potential complications of peripheral nerve blocks, in general, include infection, bleeding, local anesthetic toxicity, and nerve injury.
