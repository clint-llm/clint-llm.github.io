Dementia is a common condition, and its prevalence is expected to increase with time. It is caused by various underlying etiologies and disease states, and each of them may present differently. An interprofessional approach is recommended when managing patients with dementia. Interventions, including care coordination and interprofessional communication, can help reduce hospitalization and decrease emergency department visits.

Physicians must coordinate with other healthcare workers, including other physicians, pharmacists, social workers, and nurses, when managing patients with dementia. Any medication change must be carefully coordinated with all physicians involved in the patient's care. Pharmacists can help with counseling about medication side effects and compliance, and attention should be paid to over-the-counter medications and supplements as much as prescribed medications. Safety in the current living situation must be reviewed during every clinic visit, and social workers may be consulted to assess the safety and adequacy of the living situation and caregiver support. Involving family members and caregivers is an important aspect of the care of patients with dementia. They must be encouraged to accompany the patient during clinic visits to provide an accurate clinical history and to reiterate and enact the plan at home.
