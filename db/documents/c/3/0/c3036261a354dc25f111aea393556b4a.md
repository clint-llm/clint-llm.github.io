Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that consist of hydrogen and carbon. They are quite ubiquitous in society and are present in many common household and occupational products, for example, in motor fuel, paint thinner, cleaning agents, lotion, and industrial solvents. Unfortunately, these products are also used as agents of abuse and typicallyÂ are inhaled for their euphoric effects. Inhalation is made possible by the volatility of these substances.

Serious toxicity and death can be associated with hydrocarbon exposure through inhalation, ingestion, or aspiration. Pulmonary toxicity is most common, however cardiovascular, nervous, and gastrointestinal systems can all be affected.
