Various studies for risk factors for severe scrub typhus have revealed that deranged laboratory parameters such as leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, abnormal chest X-ray, and serum creatinine levels are associated with a worse prognosis. Patients who presented with these features along with septic shock with concomitant hypothermia carry a higher risk factor for organ dysfunction and, ultimately, death compared to those who presented with fever alone. Severe pulmonary involvement, as in acute respiratory distress syndrome, is associated with higher mortality rates. Renal failure associated with patients with severe scrub typhus may be life-threatening, and a serum creatinine level of more than 1.4 mg has been proposed to be an independent predictor of fatality in scrub typhus.

Lee et al., while conducting a retrospective epidemiological study, proposed that those who are managed in ICU who presented without an eschar along with a higher APACHE II score are independent risk factors associated with high mortality.
