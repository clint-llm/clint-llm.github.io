As a centrally acting drug, flibanserin frequently causes somnolence. Therefore it is recommended to be taken at bedtime. Additionally, using flibanserin with centrally acting depressants like benzodiazepines, opioids, and sedating antihistamines should be monitored cautiously due to the increased risk of depression in the central nervous system (CNS).

Flibanserin has a half-life of approximately 11 hours; therefore, CNS depression is more likely to occur in the early morning when administered at bedtime.
