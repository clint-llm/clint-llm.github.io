In gathering the history, it is important to identify any existing risk factors for pneumomediastinum as well as preceding events. Key elements of the history include:

- History of smoking or recreational drug use

- History of airway or lung disease

- History of excessive vomiting or coughing

- Recent history of instrumentation

- History of blunt or penetrating trauma

The most common symptom of pneumomediastinum is retrosternal chest pain (60Â to 100% of patients), which may radiate to the neck or back. Pain is typically acute in onset and may be preceded by excessive coughing or vomiting. Other symptoms include:

- Dyspnea (75% of patients)

- Coughing spells (80% of patients)

- Neck pain (36% of patients)

- Odynophagia

- Dysphagia

- Emesis

- Abdominal pain

The most common sign on physical exam is subcutaneous emphysema (70% of patients). An uncommon but specific sign that may be present is the Hamman sign, a mediastinal crunch or click synchronous with the heart sounds auscultated over the cardiac apex. Other signs include:

- Rhinolalia (nasal tone of speech)

- Dysphonia

- Hoarseness

- Neck swelling

- Tachycardia

- Tachypnea

Rarely, patients may present with malignant pneumomediastinum, which is severe pneumomediastinum that obstructs the great vessels of the heart resulting in cardiac tamponade physiology.
