Duplex ultrasonography is used for follow-up. The blood flow velocities are measured regularly to ensure that restenosis is not occurring. Even with treatment, a morbidity rate of 30% has been reported. The most common complications of surgery or an endovascular procedure include a hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and thrombosis followed by bowel infarction. It is vital to tell the patient to stop smoking.

Once discharged from the hospital, the patient should be told to consume several small meals rather than one large meal. This practice requires less blood flow in the mesenteric vessels. If the surgery is not a success, the symptoms will appear immediately. A number of patients with failed surgery end up having massive bowel resection and end up with a short gut.

**Prognosis**

Surgical management is the standard for the treatment of this disease.

- The mortality is still in the range of 60 to 95%.

- Reocclusion is more prevalent in males than females

- 86% to 96% of patients remain asymptomatic at 5 to 10 years, with similar graft patency rates.

- After endovascular treatment, symptom relief is achieved in 85% of patients.

- The most common complication has been reported to access site hematoma/pseudoaneurysm/thrombosis, followed by bowel infarction (4.6%).

- Endovascular SMA treatment is considered suitable and safe for patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia.
