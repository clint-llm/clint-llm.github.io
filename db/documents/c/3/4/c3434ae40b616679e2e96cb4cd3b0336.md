Orbital color doppler imaging (CDI) is an upcoming modality to evaluate the orbital blood flow (OBF). It aids in diagnosis, prognostication, and serial follow-up for a variety of ophthalmic diseases. This activity outlines the ideal steps of the procedure and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients undergoing sequential orbital CDI.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the anatomy of orbital vasculature and autoregulation of blood flow in orbit.
- Describe the steps for an accurate and reliable doppler study.
- Summarize the precautions to be taken while performing orbital color doppler imaging.
- Outline the applications of orbital color doppler imaging in ocular disorders managed by an interprofessional team.
