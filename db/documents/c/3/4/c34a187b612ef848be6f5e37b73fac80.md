The aorta receives nutrient-rich blood from the left ventricle after blood is ejected through the aortic valve. The aortic valve, a tri-leaflet unidirectional valve, ensures that blood maintains anterograde flow from the heart to the systemic system. From this point, the aorta extends approximately 5.0cm superiorly to the level of the T4 vertebrae and is known as the ascending aorta. The coronary arteries, found at the cusp of the aortic valve, are the first branches of the aorta.

The ascending aorta then forms the aortic arch as it curves posteriorly, towards the left, passing over the root of the left lung and anterior to the trachea. The superior aspect of the aortic arch is commonly found in the Plane of Ludwig, a transverse cross-section between the T4 vertebrae and the second sternocostal articulation, commonly demarcated by the sternal angle. The brachiocephalic, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries all branch off the aortic arch. The aortic arch continues to curve inferiorly and posteriorly, towards the vertebral column. The aortic arch transitions to the descending aorta, which can be further subdivided into the thoracic and abdominal aorta. The thoracic aorta is the portion of the descending aorta contained within the posterior mediastinal cavity. This portion of the aorta lies just to the left of the vertebral column and drifts medially as it continues to move inferiorly through the thorax until it crosses the diaphragm at the T12 aortic hiatus and continues as the abdominal aorta.

The thoracic aorta gives rise to multiple branches. Visceral branches include the pericardial, bronchial, esophageal, and mediastinal branches. The pericardial branches are small vessels that travel to the posterior surface of the pericardium. The left bronchial arteries, typically two in number, arise from the thoracic aorta as well. These arteries supply the bronchial airways, areolar tissue of the lungs, and esophagus. The esophageal arteries arise from the anterior portion of the aorta and travel inferiorly towards the esophagus where they anastomose with several other arteries. The mediastinal branches of the thoracic aorta go on to supply the lymph glands and areolar tissue located within the posterior mediastinum. Parietal branches include the intercostal, subcostal, and superior phrenic branches. There are nine pairs of intercostal arteries in total which arise from the posterior portion of the aorta. These arteries further divide and provide branches for intercostal, lateral cutaneous, mammary, and spinal arteries, to name a few.The superior phrenic arteries also arise from the thoracic aorta, later anastomosing with the pericardiophrenic and musculophrenic arteries. The lowest branching arteries of the thoracic aorta are the subcostal arteries which will later give off a posterior branch.

The abdominal aorta gives rise to five major branches: the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, left and right renal arteries, and inferior mesenteric artery. The celiac trunk mainly supplies organs of the foregut, while the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries supply organs of the midgut and hindgut, respectively. Other notable branches of the abdominal aorta include inferior phrenic, middle suprarenal, gonadal, lumbar, and median sacral arteries. It is important to note the superior suprarenal arteries originate from the inferior phrenic arteries while the inferior suprarenal arteries originate from the renal arteries.

The celiac trunk branches into three vessels: splenic, common hepatic, and left gastric arteries. The common hepatic artery further divides into the proper hepatic artery, which further divides into the right gastric and hepatic arteries, and the gastroduodenal artery, which supplies the proximal duodenum and pancreas. The left gastric artery mainly supplies the lesser curvature of the stomach and anastomoses with the right gastric artery. The splenic artery supplies the spleen. It also provides the left gastroepiploic artery which anastomoses with the right gastroepiploic and gastroduodenal arteries. These vessels supply the greater pyloric curvature.

The superior mesenteric arteries branch into several ileal and jejunal arteries as well as the middle colic, right colic, and ileocecal arteries. This aortic branch supplies the bowel from the Ligament of Treitz (duodenal suspensory ligament), found in the third part of the duodenum, to the left splenic flexure of the colon. The superior mesenteric artery anastomoses with branches of the celiac trunk (gastroduodenal-pancreaticoduodenal anastomosis) and inferior mesenteric artery (middle colic-left colic anastomosis).

The inferior mesenteric artery provides circulation to the bowel from the distal 1/3 of the transverse colon to the rectumâ€™s pectinate line. Its branches include the left colic, sigmoidal, and superior rectal arteries, to name a few. The inferior mesenteric artery shares an important portocaval anastomosis with the inferior rectal artery, which becomes notable in cases such as portal hypertension.
