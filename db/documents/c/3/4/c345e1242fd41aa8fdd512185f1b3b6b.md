This issue highlights the risk of aircraft accidents, a delay in progress through training, and reduced skills at the end of training for student pilots, as well, as poor decision making and poor performance in operational aircrew. About 20 fatalities in the US Air Force attributed to G-LOC has been reported; a Canadian CF-18 also was lost due to G-LOC, and an RAF Red Arrows Hawk aircraft was lost due to A-LOC.
