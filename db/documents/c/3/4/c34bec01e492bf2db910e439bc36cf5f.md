Food allergies affect approximately 4% to 8% of children and 1% to 2% of adults.

In general, there appears to have been an increase in peanut allergy over the past 2 decades. The first evidence of peanut allergy may come to light between ages 12-24 months and unlike egg or milk allergies, peanut allergy does not always decrease with time. Some studies indicate that the severity of reactions to peanuts also increases with age.
