Dermatofibromas are a common skin lesion in almost all populations, with one study reporting that they account for 3% of all dermatopathology laboratory specimens. The overall worldwide incidence is difficult to determine, as the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic, and therefore many patients may never seek care for these lesions. These lesions are most common in patients in their 20s to their 40s. Most studies indicate a female predominance, with an incidence ranging from equivocal to only slightly higher in females too as high as twice as frequent in females than males.
