BTK plays a role in the maturation of Pro-B-Cells to Pre-B-cells. Thus there is a failure of B cell development in affected individuals. Immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells also are absent, resulting in deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia) or absent (agammaglobulinemia) immunoglobulins.

The deficiency of immunoglobulins results in absent antibody responses and increases the tendency to develop bacterial infections. Encapsulated pyogenic bacteria are usually the culprits because they are opsonized by antibodies as a defense mechanism. Thus Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Streptococcus pyogenes, and the Pseudomonas species are some of the common causative organisms. Recurrent otitis media is the most common type of infection seen before diagnosis in these patients.

Certain enteroviruses also are protected by the humoral immunity from replication in the gastrointestinal tract and subsequent spread to the central nervous system. Thus, there is an increased propensity to develop enteroviral infections, manifesting as meningoencephalitis, hepatitis, or dermatomyositis-like infections. However, with the increasing use of intravenous immunoglobulin in these patients, the incidence has decreased to a few isolated cases.
