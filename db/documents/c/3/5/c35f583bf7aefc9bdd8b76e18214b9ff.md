The mechanism by which cellular messengers transmit a signal has three components: secretion of messengers molecule, distribution in different tissues, and interaction with the specific cell surface or intracellular receptors in the target cell.****

**Endocrine signaling**: Hormones are signaling molecules that travel in the bloodstream throughout the body to reach the specific receptor on the membrane of the effector cell or bind to the receptor intracellularly. Long-range signaling is also is called endocrine signaling. Hormones of the endocrine system are the best example of long-range signaling. For example, epinephrine is secreted by the adrenal medulla into the blood. In the bloodstream, it can interact with many receptors (alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors). These receptors are distributed in several tissues, including the heart, blood vessels, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Adrenoceptors belong to the GPCR superfamily and divide into alpha and beta. Further subdivided as alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3. They regulate several physiological processes, like blood pressure, heart rate, and vasoconstriction. Another example is the hormone erythropoietin, secreted by specialized cells in the kidney. It stimulates erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce more erythrocytes (erythropoiesis).

**Paracrine signaling**: Paracrine signaling involves a cell secreting a molecule into the blood or the lumen. The signaling molecule can diffuse over a short distance and bind to the cells. An example of paracrine signaling is neurotransmission. The presynaptic neuron releases a neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft and immediately interacts with a postsynaptic neuron.

**Autocrine signaling**: Autocrine signaling occurs when a cell secretes a signaling molecule binds to a receptor on the same cell. An example of autocrine signaling is IL-1 secreted by macrophages that bind to IL-1 receptors on the same cells.

**Juxtacrine signaling**: Juxtacine signaling involves the contact of two cells. This type of signaling is important in the immune system for antigen presentation.
