Lesions in the lateral geniculate nucleus, such as those caused by arteriovenous malformations, can produce contralateral homonymous hemianopias and quadrantanopias indicating specific affected laminar subregions with special vulnerability to the macular region given its disproportionate representational region.

The lateral geniculate nucleus is among the numerous thalamic nuclei that show substantial alterations in individuals with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (and possibly type 3), including astrocytosis, loss of neuronal bodies, and increased levels of lipofuscin.

For individuals diagnosed with blindsight due to a lesion of the primary visual cortex, the LGN plays an essential role in mediating visually relevant information that is below the level of conscious awareness.
