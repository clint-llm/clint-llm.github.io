A craniotomy is a surgical procedure in which a part of the skull is temporarily removed to expose the brain and perform an intracranial procedure.

From a historical context and perspective, cranial interventions varied from a single burr hole trephine to a larger craniectomy. Modern craniotomies are performed by connecting a series of burr holes. Although trephination is the oldest cranial surgical technique with ancient reports dating back to 2300 years, our current modern surgical technique for a craniotomy is the final cured result of the procedure introduced at the end of the 19th century by the self-educated surgeon Wilhelm Wagner.

Depending on the type of intracranial lesion, pathology, and the surgical approach, some craniotomy procedures can be assisted by neuronavigation guidance based on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans to tailor the procedure to the size of the tumor using the smallest incision possible. Neuronavigation is a modern computerized technology that can help surgeons localize the pathology more precisely by merging a series of craniofacial points in the patient. Neuronavigation offers better guidance, orientation, and localization. It provides a higher level of confidence for the surgeon and an improved outcome for the patient.

**History**

The craniotomy approach has evolved over time. Trepanation, meaning “borer” became synonymous with trephination because of the French instrument tres fines meaning “three ends”.
