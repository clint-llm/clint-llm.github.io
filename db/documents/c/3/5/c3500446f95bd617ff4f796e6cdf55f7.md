Permethrin is a medication used in the management and treatment of scabies and pediculosis. It is in the synthetic neurotoxic pyrethroid class of medicine. It targets eggs, lice, and mites via working on sodium transport across neuronal membranes in arthropods, causing depolarization. This results in respiratory paralysis of the affected arthropod. This activity describes permethrin's indications, action, and contraindications as a valuable agent in treating scabies and pediculosis. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, monitoring, warnings, and toxicity of permethrin, pertinent to healthcare team members in the treatment of patients with scabies and pediculosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of permethrin.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of permethrin.
- Review the indications for therapy with permethrin.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interdisciplinary team to improve outcomes for patients receiving permethrin.
