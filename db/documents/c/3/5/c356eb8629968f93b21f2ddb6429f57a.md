Paracoccidioides has a geographic distribution primarily limited to certain regions of Central and South America. About 80% of cases have been reported in Brazil, followed by Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador.Paracoccidioides in endemic areas could be as high as 50 to 75 percent among the adult population. Nearly 10 million patients are infected in Latin America by this pathogen, although only 1 to 2% will eventually develop any clinical form of the disease.

PCM has some particular predisposing and modulating factors that differ from other endemic mycoses. After puberty, the illness affects predominantly males (75% to 95% of cases), even though women are equally exposed to the fungus. The presence of circulating estrogens has been described as a factor that would inhibit the transformation from conidia to yeasts and modulate the cellular immune response.

PCM is an occupational disease mostly related to farmers whoÂ live in rural areas. Workers involved in coffee and tobacco crops have an increased risk of acquiring the infection. PCM has also been reported among professionals who are exposed to aerosols containing soil particles.

The disease has been rarely associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but has been reported in association with tuberculosis in 15 to 20% of patients. Regarding cancer and solid organ transplantation, a few cases of concurrent infection have been reported.
