The management of patients with colonic polyps is best done with an interprofessional team. Patients with colonic adenomas may be asymptomatic or present with rectal bleeding. In any patient over the age of 50 and no familial polyposis syndrome, one should always consider the possibility of a malignancy. The primary caregiver and nurse practitioner should refer these patients to a gastroenterologist or general surgeon for further workup and removal of the lesion. While the majority of colonic polyps are benign, villous adenomas tend toÂ have a high rate of malignancy.

Patient education is vital because lifestyle changes may help prevent polyps. The patient should limit the intake of fat and meat products and ingest more vegetables. In addition, patients should consume more fiber and discontinue smoking. Nurses should educate the patient on the maintenance of healthy body weight, regular exercise, and abstaining from alcohol.

To ensure good outcomes the team should communicate with each other and make appropriate referrals on a timely basis.
