The temporal lobes are the most common brain region to develop epileptogenicity.

Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is often discussed as a separate entity because it is quite distinct from its lateral counterpart in terms of etiology, semiology, imaging, and electrophysiologic characteristics. Moreover, the mesial temporal lobes tend to be the site of origin of close to 80% of all TLEs.
