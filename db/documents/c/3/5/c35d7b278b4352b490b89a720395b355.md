Anesthetic vaporizers are an essential piece of anesthesia equipment. This activity reviews the modern anesthetic vaporizer classification, the physics principles behind their functioning, and possible hazards that could be present at the time of using an anesthetic vaporizer. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the technical complications related to the use of anesthetic vaporizers in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications for the use of anesthesia vaporizers.
- Describe the equipment required to administer anesthesia vaporizers.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of anesthetic vaporizers.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of anesthesia vaporizers and improve clinical outcomes.
