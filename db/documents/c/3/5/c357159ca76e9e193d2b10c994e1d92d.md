Some traditional classifications pose this as a model for organizing the types of intracranial aneurysms:

- Mycotic

- an artery having sustained damage secondary to an infectious process. these aneurysms tend to be located more distally

- Luetic

- also called syphilitic aneurysms, usually in the aorta and known as syphilitic aortitis, seen in the tertiary stage of syphilis

- Arteriosclerotic
- these vessel widenings (aneurysms) occur due to arteriosclerosis damaging the vessel wall

- Traumatic

- vessels may be damaged or disrupted in the setting of trauma both penetrating to the head, and blunt injuries - these are commonly pseudoaneurysms
- These types of aneurysms represent less than one percent of cerebral aneurysms. However, they are prone to grow rapidly, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Vigilance should be implemented to detect and treat these in the setting of trauma.

- Congenital

- Certain conditions predispose people to be born with aneurysms. One example is ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease).
