Classic roseola infantum is a clinically based diagnosis. It begins with a high fever that may exceed 40 C (104 F). The fever typically lasts three to five days. During the fever, children may appear to be active and well. However, children may also have malaise, conjunctivitis, orbital edema, inflammation of the tympanic membranes, lymphadenopathy, irritability, anorexia, a bulging fontanelle, diarrhea, cough and other upper respiratory tract symptoms. Uvulopalatoglossal spots also referred to as Nagayama spots, are erythematous papules found on the soft palate and uvula that are seen in two-thirds of patients

Upon rapid defervescence of the fever around days three to five, small, rose-pink or red 2 mm to 5mm papules and macules will develop. A pale halo can occur around the macules and papules in some cases. The rash usually begins on the trunk and can spread to the neck, extremities, and face. The rash is typically nonpruritic, blanching and can persist from one to two days
