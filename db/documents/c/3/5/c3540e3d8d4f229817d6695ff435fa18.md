Bile is a fundamental and unique secretion of the liver. It is a yellow-greenish fluid that is secreted from the hepatocytes and altered as it passes through the biliary tree by the epithelial cells lining the bile-duct (cholangiocytes). After its secretion, bile is stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. The presence of lipids in the duodenum stimulates the release of cholecystokinin which in turn stimulates gallbladder wall contraction, resulting in the release of the bile into the cystic duct and common bile duct.
