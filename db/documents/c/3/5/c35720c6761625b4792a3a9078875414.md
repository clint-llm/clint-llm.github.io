Management and therapy for gastrin-related disease, as with most areas of medicine, requires a team-based, interprofessional approach. Hypergastrinemia secondary to Helicobacter pylori infections may be managed via infectious disease treatment, not requiring an endocrine specialist or surgical intervention. Conversely, a patient with gastrinoma (ZES) must be managed by a coordinated team of endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists, and surgeons. Determining the cause of hypergastrinemia is also a team approach, requiring primary care, gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, and pathologists, among others.
