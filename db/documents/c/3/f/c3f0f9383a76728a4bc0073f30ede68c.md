The Manougian technique is one of the techniques used in aortic valve replacement surgery in the context of a small aortic annulus. The Manougian technique allows for the implantation of a larger valve but requires excellent knowledge of the anatomy of the aortic outflow tract and mitral area to avoid complications. This activity reviews the indications, anatomy and physiology, and complications of the Manougian technique and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients that have this procedure done.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the Manougian technique. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to the Manougian technique. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance of the Manougian technique. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the Manougian technique and improve outcomes.
