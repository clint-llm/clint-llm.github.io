Advanced trauma life-support care has been developed to standardize the evaluation and management of trauma patients since time is critical in trauma evaluation. The golden hour starts at the time of injury. This is the periodÂ during which timely and appropriate interventions can save the life of a patient that would otherwise die. A practitioner uses a primary survey to quickly assess, identify, and treat any life-threatening injuries if they exist.
