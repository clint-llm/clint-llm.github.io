This disease process is caused by Rickettsia conorii, which is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria that spreads in zoonotic fashion via the tick vector. Rickettsia conorii is transmitted exclusively by the brown dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and humans are considered an accidental host. However, more recent data suggests vertebrate vectors, namely domesticated dogs, may play a larger role in transmission than previously thought. Transmission occurs rapidly after the initial bite, and the bacteria cause systemic disease by attaching and entering into human vascular endothelial cells.
