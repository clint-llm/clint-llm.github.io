Patients, especially athletes, can help avoid the development of Hoffa pad impingement syndrome by focusing on closed-chain quadriceps exercises that will, in turn, promote appropriate patellar tracking and avoid the initial impingement event. Those with ligamentous laxity, a history of patellar dislocation, or prior ligamentous knee injury are at increased risk of developing this pathology. Increased awareness of this disease serves as the best preventative measure.
