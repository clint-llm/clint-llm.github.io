Patients should be monitored for symptoms and signs of infusion-related reactions (IRRs) during patisiran infusion and post-infusion if indicated.Â In practice, routine monitoring of plasma patisiran or vitamin-A levels does not require. Healthcare providers perform a thorough clinical assessment of patients before initiating therapy and follow-up visits to assess therapeutic efficacy and ensure patient safety.

The patients will need counseling regarding the following health-related conditions:

**Infusion-related Reactions**

Provide patients with information regarding the symptoms and signs of infusion-related reactions (e.g., flushing, dyspnea, facial edema, rash, chest pain, syncope, increased heart rate). Instruct the patients to immediately reach out to their healthcare providers if they experience any clinical manifestations of infusion-related reactions.

**Recommended Vitamin A Supplementation**

Inform patients that patisiran therapy decreases serum vitamin A levels. Advise patients to take the vitamin A supplement at recommended daily allowance regularly.

**Pregnancy**

Recommend the patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant or planning to conceive while on patisiran. Inform the females of childbearing age about the potential adverse effects on the fetus. If the patients become pregnant while on therapy, encourage them to enroll in the patisiran pregnancy exposure registry.
