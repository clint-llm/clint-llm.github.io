The management of congenital iris ectropion requires a multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach. CEU with glaucoma in children needs pediatric glaucoma specialists and requires the involvement of pediatricians, anesthesiologists, and internists. Pre and postoperative nursing care for the repeated evaluations under anesthesia and help of psychologists to counsel the parents may be required.

The pharmacist helps to prepare correct doses of medications. Nursing staff plays a vital role in confirming compliance with therapy. Acquired iris ectropion has many systemic associations requiring physician evaluation. Collaboration with oncologists isÂ necessary for many situations, such as breast cancer metastasizing to the iris.

Patients with acquired ectropion uveae have multiple comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular abnormalities, and in some cases, metastasis due to primary carcinomas elsewhere. Endocrinologists, cardiologists, internists, and oncologists will need to be consulted.

Interprofessional care coordination will drive improved patient outcomes with fewer adverse events. [Level 5]
