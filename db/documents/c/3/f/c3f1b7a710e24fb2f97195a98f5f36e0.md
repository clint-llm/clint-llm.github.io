Wheezing is commonly experienced by people who have asthma; although, it can be heard in people with foreign bodies, congestive heart failure, a malignancy of the airway, or any lesion that causes narrowing of the airways. During expiration, the presence of wheezing indicates that the individual’s peak expiratory flow rate is less than fifty percent compared to normal. The quality and duration of wheezing also depend on where in the airways the obstruction is located. In asthma, the wheezing is due to narrowing of the lower airways, whereas, with malignancies, the obstruction is usually in the upper, more proximal airways. In rare cases, wheezing may be heard both during inspiration and expiration. In severe asthma, no wheeze may be heard as the airflow will be so severely reduced, and chest auscultation will be silent. Since any process that reduces airway caliber generates wheeze, below are some of the many of the conditions that can cause wheeze:

- Respiratory infections (croup, laryngitis, bronchiolitis)

- Obstructive airway diseases (asthma)

- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Anaphylaxis

- Pulmonary peribronchial edema (congestive heart failure)

- Vocal cord dysfunction (paradoxical vocal fold motion [PVFM], vocal cord paralysis)

- Postnasal drip

- Airway compression: Intrinsic or extrinsic (squamous cell carcinomas, goiter)

- Hyperdynamic airway collapse (tracheobronchomalacia)

- Carcinoid tumors

- Foreign body inhalation

- Forced exhalation by normal individuals
