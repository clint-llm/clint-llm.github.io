Patients should be adequately counseled regarding all breast reconstruction options available. They should be aware of risk factors that may potentially increase the risk of flap related complications, including smoking, history of chest wall radiation, and previous abdominal surgeries. Those individuals who have a history of abdominal surgery will require a computed tomography angiogram to evaluate the vascular anatomy. Preoperative anticoagulation and antibiotics are necessary for all patients.
