Scalp vein catheterization can be a lifesaving measure in infants who lack peripheral access. The catheterization in most cases is done by the anesthesiologist or the NICU staff. However, the monitoring of these lines is usually done by NICU nurses. However, nurses need to know the potential complications of these lines which can range from an air embolus to dural sinus thrombosis and infection. The site of line insertion has to be regularly cleaned and monitored for infection. Overall, the durability of scalpÂ vein catheterization is much shorter than peripheral lines. In most cases, when peripheral access is obtained, the scalp line is removed.
