Methylxanthines are contraindicated in any patient with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to any medication with a xanthine-derivative component (including aminophylline, theophylline, ethylenediamine).

Precautions are necessary when any of the following conditions apply to the patient in question: cardiovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, hepatic impairment, hypo or hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorder, or pregnancy.

Pregnancy

Methylxanthines are pregnancy category C drugs (risk cannot be ruled out). The drug crosses the placenta and infiltrates breast milk. It may be used in pregnancy only if the benefit to stand outweighs the potential of causing harm to the fetus. In these individuals, careful dose adjustment and monitoring are essential.
