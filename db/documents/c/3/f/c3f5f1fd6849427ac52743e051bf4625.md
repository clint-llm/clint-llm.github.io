Decompression sickness (DCS) occurs when dissolved gasses (usually nitrogen or helium, used in mixed gas diving) exit solution and form bubbles inside the body on depressurization. DCS occurs from underwater diving decompression (ascent), working in a caisson, flying in an unpressurized aircraft, and extra-vehicular activity from spacecraft. Proper decompression procedures during diving can help decrease DCS. Experts have classified DCS as Type I with symptoms involving only the skin, musculoskeletal system, or lymphatic systems; and Type II with symptoms that involve the central nervous system. This activity reviews the presentation of decompression sickness and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of decompression sickness.
- Describe the presentation of decompression sickness.
- Summarize the treatment of decompression sickness.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by decompression sickness.
