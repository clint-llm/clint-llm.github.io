E-cigarettes are frequently cited as smoking cessation and reduction aids by vendors. However, little solid evidence has been published to date to support such a claim. However, one study out of the UK and published in the New England Journal of Medicine randomized 886 participants into two separate treatment groups.

Since there is unclear clinical guidance, clinicians may struggle to advise patients on if and how to weave e-cigarettes into their treatment plans. Most experts take the harm reduction approach. FDA approved aids are suggested first due to their established efficacy and safety.
