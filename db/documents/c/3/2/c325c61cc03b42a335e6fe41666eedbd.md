First described in the French literature in 1936, and the English literature in 1959, SSN dysfunction is implicated in approximately 1-2% of cases of shoulder pain, and up to 33% of cases of shoulder pain in overhead athletes.

- Suprascapular notch

- Spinoglenoid notch

- Superior transverse scapular ligament

Other secondary etiologies of SSN dysfunction include, but are not limited to:

- Scapulothoracic dyskinesia, shoulder girdle dysfunction

- Traumatic injuries with SSN injury occurring secondary to the nerve's proximity to the primary injury and associated mechanism of action
- Fractures of the scapula, clavicle, proximal humerus
- Glenohumeral dislocations
- Acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries

- Iatrogenic injuries during arthroscopic or open shoulder surgeries

- Space-occupying lesions
- Ganglion cysts
- Paralabral cysts
- Bone cysts
- Osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, metastatic lesions

- Systemic conditions
- The systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Historically a diagnosis of exclusion, SSN dysfunction has become an increasingly recognized clinical condition with an often discrete underlying pathologic process. Moreover, while isolated SSN injuries remain relatively uncommon, it is the most frequently injured peripheral branch of the brachial plexus in athletes

Primary etiologies of SSN compression and injury include the at-risk anatomic sites along the course of the SSN in addition to repetitive overhead activities that are often seen during various sports and manual labor with excessive overhead occupational demands. The former includes throwing athletes and those athletes exposed to repetitive overhead trauma and repetitive motions, such as baseball players, tennis players, weight lifters, swimmers, and volleyball players.
