The singular, most important, aspect of treatment is to secure the airway. Experienced providers should intubate these patients since their airways are regarded as difficult. An individual capable of performing a tracheotomy should be available if needed. This likely involves an inhalation induction of general anesthesia and subsequent intubation, though this varies from patient to patient. The patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit after the airway is secured, and culture swabs should be sent at the time of intubation after the tube is placed. The use of corticosteroids to reduce edema has been cited, with an overall shorter intensive care unit stay for these patients. Empiric antimicrobials should be initiated. Once culture and sensitivity results are available, the regimen should be adjusted. Once a leak around the endotracheal tube can be demonstrated with the cuff deflated, extubation can be entertained. .

All non-intubated patients must be admitted for observation and a tracheostomy tray must be available at the bedside. The ENT surgeon and the anesthesiologist must be notified of the admission in case an emergency airway is required. Nurses should be warned not to place the child in a supine position. In reality, this is rare - patients with a high suspicion of epiglottitis should be intubated as soon as possible.

If an emergency airway is needed, it should ideally be obtained in the operating room. The airway should be visualized with a laryngoscope first. if endotracheal intubation is not an option, then a tracheostomy should be performed.

Antibiotics usually administered should cover common respiratory and oral cavity flora, and can include cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime.
