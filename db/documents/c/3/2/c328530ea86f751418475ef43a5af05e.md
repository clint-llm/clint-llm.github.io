A wrist radiograph series is adequate for the characterization of a distal wrist fracture and can differentiate between a Colles and Smith fracture. Typically, orthogonal views (AP, lateral) are adequate.Â  However, additional radiographs of the wrist such as traction, oblique, and fossa lateral views along with advanced imaging, may offer vital information about the injury to include associated soft tissue injuries.

In general, radiographic interpretation should comment on the presence of a distal radial fracture with volar angulation, the fracture location (extra-, juxta-, or intra-articular), the degree of angulation, and the degree of displacement. The radiographic interpretation should also comment on carpal malalignment, carpal fractures, as well as the articulation of the radio-lunate and radio-scaphoid joints.
