The primary physician, physician assistant, and nurse practitioner can diagnose a significant number of the causes of lymphadenopathy after a careful workup. However, when the diagnosis is in question varied, consultants can be utilized to clarify the situation to provide the best outcomes. For example:

- Interventional radiology: Examination of the tissue specimen remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of lymphadenopathy.

- General surgery, otorhinolaryngology, urological, thoracic surgery: Clinical circumstances may dictate the need for an excisional biopsy as opposed to a biopsy sample examination

- Infectious disease: For the provision of input on both diagnosis and treatment of infectious causes of lymphadenopathy

- Rheumatology: For the provision of input on both diagnosis and treatment of rheumatologic diseases causing lymphadenopathy

- Allergy and immunology: For the provision of input on both diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune, toxicological exposure, and medication-related exposure causes of lymphadenopathy

- Hematology and oncology: For the provision of input on both diagnosis and treatment of neoplastic causes of lymphadenopathy
