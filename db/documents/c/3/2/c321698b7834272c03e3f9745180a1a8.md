Specific contraindications to oxytocin include hypersensitivity to the hormone itself or any part of its synthetic version and vaginal deliveries that are in themselves contraindicated. These include the patient having an active genital herpes infection, vasa previa, complete placenta previa, invasive cervical cancer, and prolapse or presentation of the umbilical cord). Other contraindications to administering oxytocin include the fetus in an abnormal position (most notably including a transverse lie) and the fetus exhibiting distress when delivery is not about to happen. Antepartum usage of oxytocin is also contraindicated for women with pelvises not large enough to handle an infant passing through her birth canal and for when the woman's uterus is either hyperactive or hypertonic.
