The mechanism of action for lamotrigine is not entirely understood. It is a triazine, and research has shown that lamotrigine selectively binds and inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, stabilizing presynaptic neuronal membranes and inhibiting presynaptic glutamate and aspartate release. Researchers have not demonstrated that lamotrigine has significant effects on other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine.
