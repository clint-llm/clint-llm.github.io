Infection control refers to the policy and procedures implemented to control and minimize the dissemination of infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings, with the main purpose of reducing infection rates. The primary purpose of infection control programs has been to focus on the surveillance of hospital-acquired infections and understand the epidemiology of the risk factors. In more recent times, healthcare epidemiology is characterized by consumer demands for more transparency and accountability, increasing scrutiny and regulation, and expectations for rapid reductions in HAIs rates. The role of infection control is to prevent and reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infections. This can be achieved by implementing infection control programs in the forms of surveillance, isolation, outbreak management, environmental hygiene, employee health, education, and infection prevention policies and management. This activity reviews the New York State requirements in educating healthcare professionals in regards to infection control.
