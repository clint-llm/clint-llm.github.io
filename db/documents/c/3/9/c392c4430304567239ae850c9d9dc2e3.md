The composition of VLDL consists of approximately 90% lipids and 10% proteins. This proportion gives VLDL a very low density of 0.96 to 1.006 g/ml, hence its name. Of its total lipid component, triglycerides take up to 70% of VLDLâ€™s mass, with cholesterol esters and fatty acids making up the rest.
