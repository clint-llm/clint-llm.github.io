A cervical epidural injection is an outpatient procedure often done by pain management physicians. However, multiple specialties can perform cervical epidurals, such as a physiatrist, an interventional radiologist, an interventional neurologist, an anesthesiologist, or even a spine surgeon.

A radiology technician is preferred to aid with C-arm operations, as is nursing staff for pre and post-procedure care.
