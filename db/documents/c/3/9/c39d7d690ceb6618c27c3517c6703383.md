Usually, the ileum enters the cecum. Rarely does a part of the ileum or jejunum prolapse into itself. Almost all intussusceptions occur with the intussusceptum having been located proximally to the intussuscipiens. This is because a peristaltic action of the intestine pulls the proximal segment into the distal segment.

- The part that prolapses into the other is called the intussusceptum.

- The part that receives it is called the intussuscipiens.

- An anatomic lead point occurs in approximately 10% of intussusceptions.

The trapped section of the bowel may have its blood supply cut off, which causes ischemia. The mucosa is sensitive to ischemiaÂ and responds by causing sloughing off into the gut. This creates a "red currant jelly" stool, which sloughed mucosa, blood, and mucus. "Red currant jelly" occurs in a minority of cases of intussusception and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children passing any bloody stool.
