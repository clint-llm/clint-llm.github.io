Because there are so many causes, the diagnosis and management of hypocalcemia are best done with an interdisciplinary team. Consultation with different specialists is sometimes required because of the diverse causes and effects. In each case, one needs to treat hypocalcemia and the primary disorder responsible for it. An endocrinologist and an internist should always be involved. While the condition can be managed in an outpatient setting, close follow-up is required. The pharmacist has to make sure that the patient is not on any medications aggravating this electrolyte disorder. A dietary consult is often beneficial for patients with renal failure and hypocalcemia to help improve adequate calcium intake. Patients have to be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcemia like muscle weakness and paresthesias so that they can seek treatment when needed. Open communication between the team members is vital to prevent the morbidity of hypocalcemia.
