# Introduction

Medical simulation is an effective strategy for teaching high risk, low-frequency procedural skills, developing teamwork, refining communication skills, improving crisis resource management strategies, and exposing latent patient safety threats.

Conducting a briefing before the simulation training has become a foundational part of the simulation experience. Prior to use in simulation, the importance of pre-briefings has been demonstrated in aviation, aerospace, and surgery.

# Function

A briefing before the simulation serves to prepare and orient learners to the simulation experience. By providing learners with an adequate orientation and creating a psychologically safe environment, it lowers the participant’s fear and anxiety.

# Issues of Concern

A goal of the briefing in advance of simulation is to create psychological safety with the learners. Scholars in individual and team psychological safety highlight that to optimize the educational environment, each learner or team member must feel psychologically safe.

Being able to identify and support psychologically distressed learners is important for educators. Upon identification of a psychologically distressed learner, educators should employ a psychological safety plan. Scholars have identified several key elements required for a psychological safety plan based on psychological first aid.

# Curriculum Development

The briefing before simulation has four key components.

The second component is establishing a fiction contract with the learners. A fiction contract is an explicit agreement between educators and learners that learner engagement is dependent on both parties. The educator is responsible for creating a scenario that is as real as possible within the limitations of the simulated environment. The learners are responsible for fully engaging in the simulation and acting as if everything is real, or suspending disbelief.

The third component is providing logistic details about the session to the learners. During the briefing before simulation, educators often emphasize the session content while disregarding the logistical details. Logistical details include the length of the session, location of bathrooms, availability of refreshments, breaks, and how to manage telephone calls, texts, pages, and emails throughout the session.

The last component of briefing in advance of simulation is pledging to respect the learners. To respect learners, educators must value the learner's thought process. Instead of viewing actions as correct or incorrect, educators should inquire about the learner's decisionmaking process and rationale behind their choices. This approach provides the educator insight into the learner's knowledge gaps and helps guide feedback.

# Clinical Significance

Briefing before simulation training is paramount to a successful simulation experience. It prepares and orients learners before the start of the simulation, which ensures the simulation experience is consistent and provides the most benefit to the learners. It creates a psychologically safe environment for the learners to feel comfortable making and learning from mistakes. This approach optimizes the learning experience and keeps participants engaged.

# Pearls and Other Issues

The briefing before simulation has four key components.

- Review the session's goals and objectives.

- Educators should review learning objectives, outlining the simulation session sequence of events, familiarizing the learners with the simulation equipment and environment, and explaining the roles of the educators.

- Establish a fiction contract with the learners.

- The educator is responsible for creating a scenario that is as real as possible within the limitations of the simulated environment. The learners are responsible for fully engaging in the simulation and acting as if everything is real.

- Provide logistic details about the session to the learners.

- Logistic details include the length of the session, timing of breaks, and how to manage telephone calls, texts, pages, and emails throughout the session.

- Pledge to respect the learners.

- Educators should inquire about the learner's decisionmaking process and rationale behind their choices - this provides the educator insight into the learner's knowledge gaps and helps guide feedback.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patient safety in healthcare is increasing in importance.
