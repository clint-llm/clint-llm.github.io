Neuromuscular blocking agents are commonly used to paralyze patients requiring intubation whether in an emergency as a life-saving intervention or as a scheduled surgery and procedure. The indications for intubation during an emergency can be divided into 3 categories: failure to maintain or protect the airway, failure to adequately ventilate or oxygenate, and anticipation of a decline in clinical status. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions of these agents, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients where a neuromuscular blockade is needed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the two basic mechanisms of action of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade drugs.
- Explain the indications where depolarizing neuromuscular blockade agents are appropriate.
- Outline the adverse events and monitoring necessary when using depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing procedures where depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents are used.
