The diagnosis of pseudocholinesterase deficiency most commonly occurs through family history and clinical context of prolonged apnea and paralysis following depolarizing neuromuscular blockade via succinylcholine. With an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and a heterozygous gene frequency ranging from 1 in 25 to 1 in 50, it is imperative for family members of known homozygotes to undergo testing for the presence of an altered BCHE gene.
