Oxycodone therapy is contraindicated in patients with:

- Respiratory depression

- Bronchial asthma (in unmonitored settings)

- Hypercarbia

- Hypersensitivity to oxycodone

- Known or suspected ileus or GI obstruction

While there is limited information involving studies of allergenic cross-reactivity in opioid medications, the possibility of a cross-sensitivity cannot be fully excluded. For patients with an opioid allergy, a clear description of the allergic reaction should be explored and properly documented before considering oxycodone. Patients who are found to have a true allergic reaction to other opioid medications should avoid oxycodone therapy when possible.

**US Boxed Warnings**
