In patients with an abnormal complete blood count (CBC), signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia (increase in unconjugated bilirubin, a decrease in hemoglobin levels, weakness, fatigue, jaundice, hemoglobinuria), or a family history of a hemoglobinopathy, further testing screens for, and diagnoses, hematologic disorders.

CBC includes measurement of hemoglobin level in the blood. Normal hemoglobin concentrations are approximately 13.5 to 18.0 grams per deciliter in men and 11.5 to 16.0 grams per deciliter in women. CBC also measures the size of erythrocytes through the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Low MCV, also known as microcytosis, is often the first indicator of thalassemia or thalassemia trait. A peripheral blood smear can also detect suspected hematologic disorders. Providers can see sizes, colors, and variations in the shape of erythrocytes. Peripheral smears can detect nuclei in erythrocytes, which are abnormal and signify pathology.

Hemoglobin variant testing measures by percentage the relative hemoglobin types present in erythrocytes. This testing allows for the detection of hemoglobin variants and thalassemic disorders. DNA and genetic testing help identify deletions and mutations in the alpha and beta-globin-producing genes, which has become a standard part of newborn screening to improve early detection and treatment (if applicable) of hemoglobin variants, including sickle cell disease/carrier status and thalassemia disorders.
