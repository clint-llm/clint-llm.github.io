The etiology for diabetic foot ulcer is multifactorial. The common underlying causes are poor glycemic control, calluses, foot deformities, improper foot care, ill-fitting footwear, underlying peripheral neuropathy and poor circulation, dry skin, etc.

About 60% of diabetics will develop neuropathy, eventually leading to a foot ulcer. The risk of a foot ulcer is increased in individuals with a flat foot as they have disproportionate stress across the foot, leading to tissue inflammation in high risk areas of the foot.
