The objectives of cleft palate repair are:

- Reorientation of the palatal muscles to provide the foundation for adequate palatal movement and intelligible speech.

- Isolate the oral cavity from the nasal cavity.

- Repair the palatal defect.

One of the surgical principles of cleft palate reconstruction is "robbing Peter to pay Paul." Dissection and mobilization of the hard palate mucosa to close a midline defect will leave demucosalized donor areas on the hard palate's lateral aspects that will re-mucosalize in 48 to 72 hours.

Another important surgical principle is to dissect, reposition, and suture the tensor and levator veli palatini according to the normal palatal muscle configuration in order to improve speech and swallowing function.

Lastly, the most important technical aspect to keep in mind is to avoid tension across the repair. Tension is the main contributor to partial or total dehiscence and fistula formation.
