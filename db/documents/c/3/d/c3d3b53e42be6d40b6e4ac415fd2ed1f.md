Ultrasound is extremely useful in detecting and localizing foreign bodies, especially in conjunction with plain radiography. A 2015 meta-analysis found it to be equally effective for the detection of superficial, radiopaque objects as X-rays. However, ultrasound became particularly useful in the detection of radiolucent objects. One of the studies in the meta-analysis found a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 97% for wooden objects of at least 2.5 mm. Ultrasonography does require prior training, an understanding of anatomy, and clinical time. Objects may be mistaken for anatomic structures such as tendons, vessels, or bursa, especially in hands, feet, or joints. Objects deeper than 2 cm will also be more difficult as imaging deeper into tissue comes with the cost of decreased resolution.

Foreign bodies will appear hyperechoic with variable shadowing and reverberation. After finding the foreign body, clues to the type of material can be gathered by its acoustic details. When imaging gravel or wood, the object will appear hyperechoic with a strong and distinct shadow. Metallic objects display a "comet tail" or distal, regular, parallel lines secondary to acoustic reverberation. Glass can present with variable acoustic shadows, including both comet tails or diffuse beam scattering.
