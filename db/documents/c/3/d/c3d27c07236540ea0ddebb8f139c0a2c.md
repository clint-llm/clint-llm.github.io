For a long time, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used in clinical practice to treat decompression sickness, carbon monoxide poisoning, clostridial infections, and enhance wound healing. However, newer applications of this therapy have been shown to successfully treat a wide range of conditions such as compartment syndrome, burns and frostbite, and even sensorineural hearing loss. HBOT works through inhalation of high concentrations of oxygen in a pressurized chamber. Under typical therapeutic conditions, theÂ partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in the plasma may reach levels greater than 20 times that of breathing room air at normal atmospheric pressure. Oxygen-rich plasma can then be transported to the hypoxic or ischemic tissue to promote angiogenesis, reduce edema, and even modulate the immune system response.
