Ephedrine, a stereoisomer to better-known pseudoephedrine, is a sympathomimetic amine with unique effects due to its indirect mechanism than other sympathomimetic agents like pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine.

Ephedrine’s indirect mechanism results in a sustained or even increased heart rate due to norepinephrine’s ability to bind alpha and beta receptors, whereas more direct sympathomimetics like phenylephrine results in reflex bradycardia. While the indirect effect is most profound on arterial blood pressure, the direct vasoconstricting action functions more on the venous system. It is, therefore, effective in elevating central venous pressure when the patient is challenged with fluids.

Stimulation of alpha-1-adrenergic smooth muscle receptors within vasculature results in a rise in systemic vascular resistance and, consequently, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Direct stimulation of beta-1 receptors by ephedrine and norepinephrine increases cardiac chronotropy and inotropy. Finally, beta-2-adrenergic receptor stimulation in the lungs results in bronchodilation with ephedrine administration, though it is not as pronounced as its cardiovascular effects.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Oral ephedrine attains peak plasma concentration at 1.8 hours and has a bioavailability of 88%.

**Distribution:**Oral ephedrine has a volume of distribution of 215.6 Liters. Ephedrine can cross the placental barrier.

**Metabolism:**Ephedrine is metabolized into norephedrine. The parent drug and its metabolite are both excreted in the urine.

**Elimination:**Limited clinical data after intravenous administration of ephedrine endorses similar observations of urinary excretion. The plasma elimination half-life of ephedrine after oral administration is approximately 6 hours. The urinary excretion of ephedrine is increased in acidic urine.
