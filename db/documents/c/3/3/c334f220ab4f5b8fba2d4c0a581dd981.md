Prolonged or significant exposure to ionizing radiation can result in acute radiation syndrome (ARS). The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements defines this as "a broad term used to describe a range of signs and symptoms that reflect severe damage to specific organ systems and that can lead to death within hours or up to several months after exposure." The proper care of acute radiation syndrome requires planning at the governmental, local and clinical levels to ensure that exposure to radiation is limited and that individuals with acute radiation syndrome are identified and treated appropriately. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of acute radiation syndrome and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify sources of ionizing radiation. 
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with radiation syndrome.
- Explain how to manage a patient with acute radiation syndrome. 
- Review modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by acute radiation syndrome.
