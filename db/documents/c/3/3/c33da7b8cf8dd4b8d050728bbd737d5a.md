For investigation of patients suffering from thrombotic events, it is essential to differentiate provoked and unprovoked thrombosis through history and physical. Thrombotic events are observable under diverse conditions. Therefore a broad differential diagnosis is essential including the more frequent (immobilization, travel) and less frequent entities such as cardiac disease (atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, prosthetic valves), non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) and hematologic causes such as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

Thrombophilia should be a differential diagnosis for vaso-occlusive events.  Arterial thrombosis such as osteonecrosis,
