Human iris color exists in a continuum from light blue to dark brown. The most common description uses three shades, including blue, green-hazel, and brown. As discussed above, the most important determining factors for human iris color are the iris stromal texture and stromal melanocytes. The stromal melanocytes are derived from embryological neurocrest cells, which migrate through the uveal tract to the iris during fetal development. Subsequently, the iris stromal melanocytes are also under the trophic influence of the post-ganglionic cervical sympathetic pathway. Consequently, any unilateral lesion affecting the cervical sympathetic (Horner syndrome), either congenital or acquired within the first two years of life, will lead to heterochromia.

Very rarely, longstanding Horner syndrome may also result in heterochromia. Other diseases related to neurocrest cell development and migration may cause heterochromia, such as Waardenburg syndrome and Perry-Romberg syndrome.

In addition to diseases primarily involving the iris melanocytes, any local eye or iris disease that causes a unilateral change in colors such as trauma with bleeding, melanoma and other tumors, and Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis.
