The diagnosis of SSADH deficiency is initially made by the presence of 4-hydroxy butyric acid excretion in urine, which is identified by special ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.Â Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows bilateral symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in globus pallidum and often raises diagnostic suspicion of SSADH in an appropriate clinical setting.

Specialized magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocols that allow editing for small molecules have shown elevated levels of GABA and related compounds in patients with SSADH deficiency.

Electroencephalography shows background slowing and epileptiform abnormalities. The epileptiform abnormalities are usually generalized and sometimes multifocal. Rarely photo paroxysmal response and electrographic status epileptics of slow-wave sleep have been reported.

The diagnosis is established by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variations in ALDH5A1. The molecular testing approach could be either single-gene sequencing or multigene panel testing.
