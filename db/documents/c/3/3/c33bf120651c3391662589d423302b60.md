The development of the musculoskeletal system begins during the fourth week of development with the formation of a limb bud.

Each somite contains a myotome from which the muscles derive. Myotomes can be further divided into epaxial or hypaxial portions. Innervation is used to classify a muscle as either epaxial or hypaxial. Epaxial muscles receive innervation from the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves, and hypaxial muscles receive innervation from the ventral roots of the spinal nerves.

Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, skeletal muscle is unique since it is under voluntary control by the organism. Myogenesis of skeletal muscle requires coordination with the lateral plate mesoderm, which gives rise to the neural, vascular, and connective tissue of the extremities.
