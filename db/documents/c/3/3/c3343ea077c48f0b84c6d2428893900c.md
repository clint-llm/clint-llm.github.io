**Uncoupling Agents**

An uncoupling agent dissociates the electron transport chain from phosphorylation by ATP-synthase, preventing the formation of ATP. Disruption of the phospholipid bilayer of membranes causes a fluid-like and disorganized state, which allows protons to flow through more freely. This proton leak weakens the electrochemical gradient, while also transferring protons without the use of ATP-synthase such that no ATP is produced.

While the cell becomes starved of ATP, the ETC will overwork in an attempt to shuttle more and more electrons to ATP-synthase without success. The ETC regularly produces heat as the electrons transfer from one carrier to the next, and this overactivity will raise the body temperature as a result. Additionally, cells will adapt to utilizing fermentation as if in anaerobic conditions; this may cause a type B lactic acidosis in affected patients.

Aspirin (Salicylic Acid)

- Salicylic acid is an uncoupler. Unique to salicylate poisoning, however, are signs of tinnitus and early respiratory alkalosis, which transitions to a mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis as the process progresses. Early treatment involves activated charcoal if presenting within 1 hour of ingestion, or sodium bicarbonate otherwise.

Thermogenin

- Thermogenin, also known as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), is found in brown adipose tissue. Brown adipose tissue has many small lipid droplets and a high concentration of mitochondria (which provide the "brown" color), in contrast to white adipose tissue, which has a single droplet. This difference supports that brown fat is classically abundantly present in hibernating animals or newborns, who have delayed neurologic thermoregulation (ex. shivering) and are therefore at risk for hypothermia. These brown fat mitochondria contain more thermogenin than other cells, allowing for increased inner mitochondrial membrane disruption and proton leakage.

**Oxidative Phosphorylation Inhibitors**

Certain poisons can inhibit cellular oxidative phosphorylation such as rotenone, carboxin, antimycin A, cyanide, carbon monoxide (CO), sodium azide, and oligomycin. Rotenone inhibits complex I, carboxin inhibits complex II, antimycin A inhibits complex III, and cyanide and CO inhibit complex IV. Oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase.

Rotenone (and some barbiturates) – inhibits complex I (coenzyme Q binding site)

- Rotenone is a broadly used pesticide, but more often in the US as a piscicide (fish). Rotenone blocks complex I from passing electrons from the Fe-S clusters to ubiquinone. It is poorly absorbed through the skin, but rarely deadly as poisoning can cause vomiting and removal of the substance. However, purposeful ingestion can be fatal.

Carboxin – inhibits complex II (coenzyme Q binding site)

- Carboxin is a fungicide that is no longer in use because of newer, more broad-spectrum agents. Similar to rotenone, carboxin interferes with ubiquinone at the binding site.

Doxorubicin – coenzyme Q (theoretical)

- Doxorubicin is used in cancer chemotherapy, typically breast and bladder carcinomas, and lymphoma. A well-known side effect of doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy. One proposed mechanism of causation is the generation of reactive oxygen species within myocardial tissue as the drug interferes with electron transfer by coenzyme Q.

Antimycin A – inhibits complex III (cytochrome c reductase)

- Antimycin A is a piscicide that binds to cytochrome c reductase at the Qi binding site. This activity prevents ubiquinone from binding and accepting an electron, thereby blocking the recycling of ubiquinol (CoQH2) by the Q cycle.

Carbon Monoxide (CO) – inhibits complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)

- Carbon monoxide binds to and inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). In addition to the disruption of the ETC, carbon monoxide also binds to hemoglobin at an oxygen-binding site converting it to carboxyhemoglobin. In this state, oxygen is displaced from hemoglobin, effectively blocking delivery to body tissues. The cardiac and central nervous systems, both organ systems which are highly dependent on oxygen consumption, manifest the common signs of CO poisoning. Symptoms such as tachycardia, hypotension, or arrhythmias may couple with fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, and changes in vision. More serious cases may display seizure, coma, retinal hemorrhages, or a characteristic cherry-red blood hue of the skin, though more often useful on autopsy (caution is critical: some patients may appear "normal" rather than pale/dusky because of inadequate tissue oxygenation).

- Sources of CO are paint strippers, house fires, wood-burning stoves, automobile exhaust, and other gasoline- or propane-fueled equipment. A CO saturation monitor can detect CO levels. Ratios of carboxyhemoglobin to hemoglobin greater than 10% are likely to show as symptomatic. Regular pulse oximetry devices read the percent of bound hemoglobin, irrespective of what is bound. Therefore, when CO is bound rather than O2, a patient's pulse Ox may still appear normal and cannot be used reliably. Instead, a co-oximeter should be used. Treatment for CO poisoning is to dissociate the bound CO with O2. Providing 100% supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather or administering hyperbaric oxygen are options.

Cyanide (CN) – inhibits complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase)

- Cyanide also binds to and inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Similar symptoms as a result of tissue hypoxia can present in affected patients. In contrast, these patients tend to have hypoxia that is not responsive to supplemental O2 and an almond breath odor. Typical sources of cyanide include house fires (furniture or rugs), jewelry cleaning solutions, plastic or rubber manufacturing, iatrogenic from prescribed nitroprusside, or even some fruit seeds (apricots, peaches, apples).

- Treatment can include nitrites to oxidize hemoglobin iron from Fe2+ to Fe3+, also known as methemoglobin, a conformation that binds cyanide, preventing it from contacting the ETC. However, this prevents blood cells from transporting oxygen, therefore requiring further treatment with methylene blue to reduce Fe3+ back to Fe2+. Another option is administering hydroxocobalamin, a form of vitamin B12, or thiosulfate, although thiosulfate is not time efficient and typically requires combination therapy with nitrites.

Oligomycin – inhibits ATP-synthase (complex V)

- Oligomycin is a macrolide antibiotic synthesized by Streptomyces species that inhibits the F0 subunit of ATP-synthase, preventing ATP production. Its predominant use is for research purposes.
