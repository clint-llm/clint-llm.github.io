As the respiratory tract is constantly exposed to the environment, it is not sterile.

For the pathogen to cause pneumonia, it must reach the alveolar space and have a large enough inoculum, or overwhelm the hostâ€™s already impaired immune system. Uncontrolled multiplication by the pathogen in the alveolar spaces triggers the macrophages to bring about an inflammatory response. Cytokines released due to the inflammatory response are responsible for the clinical manifestation of pneumonia. For example, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are responsible for fever while interleukin-8 (IL-8) and colony-stimulating factors cause chemotaxis and neutrophil maturation culminating in leukocytosis. This inflammatory response also results in leakage of the alveolar-capillary membranes, which leads to decreased lung compliance and shortness of breath.
