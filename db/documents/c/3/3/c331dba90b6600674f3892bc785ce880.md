After primary infection, the majority of patients remain asymptomatic. Most of these asymptomatic individuals clear the infection. However, a portion enters a "latent" phase with the potential "reactivation" in the future.

Latency is a unique aspect of tuberculosis infection. The majority of infected individuals who get infected do not actually develop symptoms until months to years after their initial exposure. This is known as latent tuberculosis.

The physical exam is usually normal in mild disease or shows nonspecific lung findings such as crackles or tubular breath sounds. Absent breath sounds are noted over consolidation areas. Extrapulmonary findings include clubbing and other signs of distant organ involvement.
