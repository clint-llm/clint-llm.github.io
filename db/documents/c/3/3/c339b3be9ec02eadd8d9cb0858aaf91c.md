Patients who develop an epiphrenic diverticulum can present in various situations and with different symptoms, depending on the size of the diverticulum as well as the underlying motility disorder. Those with a small diverticulum and no associated motility disorder may be asymptomatic, and the diverticulum is only discovered incidentally; however, patients with larger diverticulum or those who have a concomitant motility disorder can present with worsening symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation (the two most common symptoms).

Other symptoms include chest pain, heartburn, nocturnal cough, and asthma. Worrisome symptoms include weight loss, aspiration pneumonia, hematemesis, melena, and odynophagia. They could signify a malignant transformationÂ to esophageal carcinoma. As the diverticulum grows in size, complications can arise. These can be severe heartburn (secondary to stasis) or compression of neighboring structures (esophagus, lung, and heart).
