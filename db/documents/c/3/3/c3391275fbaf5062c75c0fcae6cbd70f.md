Suctioning of the airway requires meticulous preparation by personnel. All supplies should be gathered and prepared in a sterile environment. A verbal or written consent should be obtained depending on the patient's condition. The suction catheter should be connected to a vacuum source.

Preparation for suctioning also depends on an emergent versus a non-emergent need for suctioning. In cases of acute respiratory distress, where obstruction of the airway or the airway adjunct is suspected, suctioning must be performed emergently with even minimal preparation. Care should be taken to maintain sterility while suctioning the endotracheal/tracheostomy tubes. Suctioning of the oropharynx or the nasopharynx does not require complete sterility.

In non-emergent suctioning, all equipment and personnel should be thoroughly prepared.
