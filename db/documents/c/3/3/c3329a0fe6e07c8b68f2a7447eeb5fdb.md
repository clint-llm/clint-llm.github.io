Carbon dioxide is produced intracellularly during aerobic respiration, a process that uses glucose (C6H1206) and oxygen (O2) to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides energy to drive many intracellular processes. CO2 is a waste product of its production.

- C6H1206 + 6O2 —> 6CO2 + 6H2O + Heat

Intracellularly produced CO2 is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it is neutralized using a bicarbonate-carbon dioxide buffer system to maintain physiologic pH. Homeostasis of the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide buffer system is dependent on pulmonary excretion of CO2 and renal excretion of hydrogen ions.

- CO2 + H2O <—> H2CO3 <—> HCO3- + H+

Once carbon dioxide in the bloodstream reaches the pulmonary capillaries, it is exchanged for oxygen across the alveolar-capillary membrane.

The concentration of CO2 in the bloodstream determines the speed with which it is removed from the body by controlling the respiratory drive.

- MV = respiratory rate x tidal volume

Physiologic derangements in the following can produce pathological hypercarbia:

- Metabolic processes that increase CO2 production

- Renal dysfunction resulting in an imbalance in the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide buffer system

- Impairment of gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary membrane

- Depression of centrally mediated respiratory centers

- Exogenous exposure to an elevated level of CO2 during surgical procedures
