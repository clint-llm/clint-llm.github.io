In response to the HDAg, antibodies of the IgM and IgG class (anti-HDV) are produced. The three infective patterns (acute HDV/HBV coinfection, acute HDV superinfection, and chronic HDV infection) vary with respect to appearance and levels of HDV RNA, HDAg, and anti-HDV as well as HBV markers (Table 1). As HDV is dependent on HBV, the presence of HBsAg is essential for diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is essential to diagnose acute HBV/HDV coinfection.

In acute HDV infection, the appearance of HDAg is early but short-lived and often requires repeat testing for detection. The appearance of anti-HDV is late in acute infection and may be the only way to diagnose acute HDV if other HDV infection markers are absent. The pattern of IgM class of Anti-HDV depends on the course of acute hepatitis D. If HDV infection is self-limited, the appearance of anti-HDV IgM is transient and delayed.

Historically, HDAg detection was considered the gold standard for diagnosis of active HBV infection. As anti-HDV forms immune complexes with HDAg, detection of HDAg is difficult and time-consuming by the required immunoblot assay. Therefore, HDV RNA detection via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the most sensitive and practical test for the diagnosis of active HDV infection.

High-risk individuals (injection drug users, individuals from HDV endemic area) or those that present with severe course who have acute hepatitis B should be suspected for HDV coinfection. As mentioned, patients with coinfection have high titers of IgM anti-HBc. In these individuals, HDV markers can come before or after HBV markers. Occasionally, patients who present during the second phase of biphasic hepatitis seroconvert to anti-HBs, but they could still be tested positive for high titer IgM anti-HBc.

When the etiology of hepatitis is undetermined in chronic HBV carriers, HDV testing should be performed to rule out an acute HDV superinfection. Distinguishing between HDV superinfection and HBV/HDV coinfection can be difficult when superinfection occurs in unidentified chronic HBV carriers.

In individuals with chronic hepatitis B, HDV testing should be considered in high-risk individuals to rule out concurrent chronic HDV infection. This can be obtained by detection of total anti-HDV antibody followed by confirmatory staining for HDAg in liver tissues and/or measurement of serum HDV RNA. As HBV replication is suppressed in chronic HDV infection, hepatitis B e-antibodies (anti-HBe) are typically present.
