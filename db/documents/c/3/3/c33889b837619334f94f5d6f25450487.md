Surgery is indicated for patients with isolated or associated injuries yielding significant distal radioulnar joint instability.

Surgical repair of the distal radioulnar joint is contraindicated for patients with other evident pathology including radial and ulnar length discrepancies, distal radioulnar joint arthritis, sigmoid notch incompetence, extensor carpi ulnaris tendon subluxation, or other apparent reason for wrist pain.  Reconstruction of the triangular fibrocartilage complex and distal radioulnar joint often does not itself restore stability to the joint and careful patient selection should be carried out with the understanding that these procedures are performed primarily as adjunctive procedures to control pain. Various surgical reconstruction procedures exist in the literature, including reconstruction of the radioulnar ligaments, placement of an extrinsic radioulnar tether, and creating a radiocarpal sling or tenodesis. All of these procedures have their inherent limitations but have been found to help control symptoms.
