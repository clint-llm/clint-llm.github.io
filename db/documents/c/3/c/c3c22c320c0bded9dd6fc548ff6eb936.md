Several healthcare professionals use hyaluronic acid, including the plastic surgeon, primary care clinicians (including PAs and NPs), dermatologists, and internists, to enhance cosmesis. The hyaluronic acid filler can only be injected by the prescription of a licensed health care provider. Hyaluronic acid filler has become popular because of its low allergic response, ease of injection, rapid recovery, reproducibility, and immediate results. It is also frequently used for symptoms relief from knee osteoarthritis by several healthcare professionals, including orthopedics, rheumatologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation providers, and primary care providers.

It is essential to educate the patient that hyaluronic acid treatment is not permanent, and results may last anywhere from 8 to 16 weeks for the dermal filler and up to 6 months for intraarticular injection, depending on the type of product.
