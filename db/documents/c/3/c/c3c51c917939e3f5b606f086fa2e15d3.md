The diagnosis and management of mural thrombi are best done with an interprofessional team that includes an internist, cardiologist, neurologist, radiologist, vascular surgeon, and a team of specialty nurses. It is vital to treat mural thrombi as this can lower the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism. There are no standardized guidelines for the treatment of mural thrombi. The type of treatment depends on the location of thrombi, patient symptoms, and urgency of the situation. Even after treatment, patients may have to remain on some type of anticoagulation until the cause of the thrombus has been identified and treated.

The prognosis for patients with mural thrombi is good but in the presence of emboli, the prognosis is guarded.
