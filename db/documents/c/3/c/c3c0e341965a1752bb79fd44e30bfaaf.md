Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a systemic condition characterized by characteristic ossification patterns that can occur in the spine and peripheral entheses.

The ossifications are classically described in the spine as flowing ossifications along the anterolateral aspect in at least three successive vertebral levels or four contiguous vertebrae.  Although less common, peripheral enthesopathy can occur at the shoulder, elbow, knee, or calcaneus.

While the etiology remains poorly defined, various risk factors have been identified in the literature, including gout, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.  HLA-B8 is common in both DISH and diabetes mellitus.
