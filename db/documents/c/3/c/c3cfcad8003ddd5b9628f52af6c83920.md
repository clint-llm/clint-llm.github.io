When promptly diagnosed and managed, the prognosis is favorable. Overall reported union rates for pediatric lateral humeral condyle fractures are 91%. Delayed presentation is associated with a future range of motion limitation and avascular necrosis. The prognosis largely depends on accurate fracture classification and its appropriate management. Fracture displacement is also a significant factor in clinical outcomes.Â A displacement of 2 mm appears to be a cut-off for conservative management and is associated with fewer complications.
