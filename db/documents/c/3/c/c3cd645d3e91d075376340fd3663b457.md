Facial trauma in children can be associated with additional sites of both minor and severe injury, especially in high-energy blunt force trauma such as motor vehicle collisions. It is also essential to consider high-risk situations that lead to trauma, such as assault or neglect (including lack of supervision leading to self-injurious behavior).

Specific injuries to consider during the evaluation of pediatric facial trauma include:

- Bony Injuries

- Mandibular dislocation
- Facial bone fractures, including sinus involvement
- Skull fractures
- Spinal fractures or cervical instability
- Cartilaginous injuries
- Dental fractures and avulsions

- Wounds

- Lacerations and abrasions, including intraoral
- Penetrating injuries (including stab wounds and gunshot wounds)
- Animal and human bites

- Miscellaneous Injuries

- Contusions and swelling
- Epistaxis
- Septal hematoma
- Auricular hematoma
- Tympanic membrane perforation
- Inhalation injuries
- Burns (including chemical, thermal, electrical)
- Ocular injuries (extra-ocular muscle entrapment, globe rupture, retrobulbar hematoma, corneal abrasion)
- Ductal and glandular injuries
- Nerve injuries
- Vascular injuries
- Psychosocial trauma
- Spinal cord trauma
- Traumatic brain injury and concussion

- Injury Etiologies

- Non-accidental trauma (including shaken baby syndrome)
- Assault (including intimate partner violence)
- Suicide attempt
- Irritant exposure (inhalation injuries)
