The primary treatment for SCVT is **anticoagulation**. Within the first 14 days of primary SCVT, pharmacologic or mechanical thrombolysis yield excellent results. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) for 3-6 months is recommended. American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines recommends**LMWH**or**fondaparinux**to manage UEDVT, which should be continued for**at least five days**, followed by vitamin K antagonists. The latter should be continued for at least**three months**.

In managing cancer-associated thromboembolism and upper extremity involvement, **extended LMWH monotherapy**, compared to vitamin K antagonists, is preferred.

Compression therapy with either sleeves or bandages is not recommended during acute UEDVT. However, it might be considered in the management of PTS.

Idiopathic primary SCVT without evidence of malignancy is treated with anticoagulation for **3Â to 6 months**. SCVT associated with malignancy is treated with LMWH until the malignancy is cured or in remission.

Management of catheter-related SCVT varies. If the catheter can be removed, and there is a low risk of embolization and no prothrombotic risk, the catheter should be removed.

**Catheter-assisted therapy**in managing patients with UEDVT is recommended for those with the following eligibility criteria; 1. recent onset, 2. presence of severe symptoms, 3. low risk for bleeding complications, and 4. good functional status.
