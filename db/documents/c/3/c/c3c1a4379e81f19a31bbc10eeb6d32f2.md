Recurrent attacks of pancreatitis may present as pancreatic relapse in a few patients. There have been reports of the incidence of pancreatic cancer on the surveillance of patients with AIP; however, the association of AIP with malignancies is not established.

The other complications of AIP are related to the worsening of biliary strictures and if untreated, cause significant obstructive jaundice. There can also be complications related to long-term treatment with steroids, failure to wean steroids, or other complications secondary to immunomodulatory therapy.
