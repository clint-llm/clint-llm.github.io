The exact etiology of breast milk jaundice has not been determined. Most of the proposed etiologies involve the factors present in the human breast milk itself. Other hypotheses suggest potential genetic mutations present in the affected neonates.

Some human breast milk factors that may be related to breast milk jaundice's etiology include pregnane-3a,20ß-diol, interleukin IL1ß, ß-glucuronidase, epidermal growth factor, and alpha-fetoprotein.

Several studies have shown that mutations in the coding region of the UGT1A1 gene increase the risk of developing breast milk jaundice. Mutations in this gene's regulatory region are known to cause Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert syndrome, two syndromes known to cause persistent hyperbilirubinemia
