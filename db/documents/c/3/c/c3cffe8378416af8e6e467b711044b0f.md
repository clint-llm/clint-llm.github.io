Common adverse effects include headaches, myalgia, abdominal pain, gastritis, constipation, upper respiratory infections, elevated AST or ALT, and impaired serum glucose control.

Rarer, yet more severe, causations include cardiovascular effects such as atrial fibrillation, hepatic abnormalities, including cholestatic hepatitis, greater than a 3-fold elevation in transaminases, jaundice, and potential liver failure. Adverse musculoskeletal effects include greater than a three-fold increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, rhabdomyolysis, and compartment syndrome in the lower legs.

Additional serious reactions include interstitial lung disease, diabetes mellitus, erythema multiforme, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, although these adverse events are rare.

Drug concentrations, and consequently, incidence and severity of adverse effects, can become significantly increased when coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concomitant medications administered with simvastatin should have an assessment performed for potential drug interactions to minimize the risk of adverse effects. Patients are commonly advised to stop eating grapefruits or drinking grapefruit juice while on statin therapy. However, more recent research has shown this risk can be minimized by spacing the consumption of grapefruit and statin dosing.
