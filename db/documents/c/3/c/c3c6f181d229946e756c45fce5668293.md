When giving magnesium sulfate, there are minimal side effects with standard therapeutic doses, but magnesium sulfate has a broad therapeutic index. Patients most commonly complain of minor facial flushing and warmth with the administration; however, symptoms typically resolve spontaneously. In patients with neuromuscular disease, such as in myasthenia gravis, the neuromuscular function may worsen at lower concentrations of medication. If given rapidly or in high doses, patients may experience transient hypotension due to smooth muscle inhibition causing a vasodilatory effect that will resolve. If the patient is on a continuous magnesium sulfate infusion, serum levels must be accounted for as symptoms related to hypermagnesemia may become clinically evident. At supratherapeutic serum concentrations, absent reflexes, abnormal cardiac conduction, and muscle weakness may occur.
