Distal radial injuries are usually identified easily in the context of isolated trauma. "Front Line" providers in primary care and emergency medicine should familiarize themselves with the routine management of these injuries, and the indications for urgent surgical evaluation. Surgeons should educate local providers and emergency nurses and providers about how best to arrange follow-up for patients with distal radius injuries. Coordination between specialties, nursing support teams and clinicians will provide the best outcomes for patients and reduce long-term sequelae. In cases of significant debility or poly-trauma, inpatient teams should maintain a high index of suspicion for distal radius fractures during their tertiary surveys and have a low threshold to image upper extremities.
