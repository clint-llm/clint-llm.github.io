The NHANESIII (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) study found the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism among adults in the United States (12 years of age and older) to be 0.3% and subclinical hypothyroidism 4.3%. Female gender and increasing age were associated with higher thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the prevalence of antithyroid antibodies.

Hypothyroidism is more prevalent in women with small stature at birth and low body mass index in childhood.
