The initial clinical presentation is vague and non-specific. Also, many patients do not present with common symptoms, so diagnostic modality involving imaging, serology, and EEG remains the mainstay for diagnosing this condition. It varies from typical limbic system involvement to syndromes with complex neuropsychiatric manifestations. There have been specific syndromes associated with particular antibodies. Nonetheless, the presentation in most cases is widely variable.

Approximately 70% of patients have prodromal manifestations of headache, fever, and other symptoms resembling viral etiology. Then, it progresses with acute to subacute onset of memory deficits, altered mental status, behavior changes, psychosis, orofacial dyskinesia, hallucinations, agitation, delusions, catatonia, seizures, or abnormal movements. These patients may have a fluctuating clinical course with interval improvement.

Patients might progress to a decreased level of consciousness, central hypoventilation requiring mechanical ventilation. On review of systems, it will be pertinent to ask for fever, weight loss, and night sweats will be essential to look for any B symptoms or paraneoplastic process. Complete neurological examination is vital to look for focal neurological deficit and rule out other possible causes of encephalitis.
