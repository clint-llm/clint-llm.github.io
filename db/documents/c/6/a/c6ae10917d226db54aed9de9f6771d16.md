Acute sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses.Â Because sinus passages are contiguous with the nasal passages, rhinosinusitis is often a more appropriate term. Acute rhinosinusitis is a common diagnosis, accounting for approximately 30 million primary care visits and $11 billion in healthcare expenditure annually. It is also a common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and throughout the world. Due to recent guidelines and concerns for antibiotic resistance and the judicious use of antibiotics, it is essential to have clear treatment algorithms available for such a common diagnosis.

Rhinosinusitis can be classified into the following groups (based more on consensus rather than empirical research)

- Acute - symptoms lasting less than 4 weeks

- Subacute - symptoms last between 4 and 12 weeks

- Chronic - symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks

- Recurrent - four episodes lasting less than 4 weeks with complete symptom resolution between episodes
