Prognosis varies depending on the stage, the severity of the disease, and gestational age at diagnosis. Younger gestational age at diagnosis and the higher stage is associated with poorer prognosis. Single twin survival ranges from 15% to 70%, with about 50% survival of both twins, even with treatment. The prognosis is best for Stage I with overall survival of 86%. Additionally, about 75% of Stage I remain stable or regress.

There is less information available for Stages II-IV, but the perinatal death rate for ≥ Stage III is estimated to be 70% to 100%. Regarding Stage V, following the demise of one twin, there is a 10% risk of death and a 10 to 30% risk of neurological complication in the other twin. Some research shows an improved neurological outcome in the surviving twin if fetoscopic laser photocoagulation was performed earlier in gestation.
