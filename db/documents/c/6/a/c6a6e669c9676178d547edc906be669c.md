Cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare disorder. The exact prevalence and incidence are not known. The incidence of cicatricial pemphigoid estimated in a French study was 1.16 per million per year.

In a study out of Greece, the mean age of onset for cicatricial pemphigoid was found to be 66 years of age, and there was a 1.5:1 female predominance.

In a recent retrospective chart review of 162 patients with mucous membrane pemphigoid, 67% percent of patients had ocular involvement at presentation. In those without ocular involvement initially, it was estimated that the risk of developing ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid was 0.014 per person-year.

HLA-DQB1*0301 is a disease susceptibility marker for cicatricial pemphigoid.
