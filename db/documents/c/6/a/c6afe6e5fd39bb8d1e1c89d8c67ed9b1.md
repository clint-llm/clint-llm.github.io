History-taking in a patient with myoclonus should focus on the age of onset, course, and duration of disease, family history, precipitating factors such as drugs, triggers (auditory stimulus, movement, tactile, visual, or emotional stimuli), the body parts involved, and the rhythmicity of the myoclonus. The presence of associated neurological signs/symptoms or disorder help to identify the underlying etiology and/or pathology.

The main clinical characteristics demarcating myoclonus from other movement disorders are its rapid onset, brief duration, and the single-event type of muscle activation.

Clinically, cortical myoclonus is more prominent in the hands and face and more commonly provoked by tactile stimuli. Moreover, cortical myoclonus is generally action-induced. There is a frequent occurrence of negative myoclonus as well.

Brainstem reflex myoclonus, a subtype of subcortical myoclonus, typically presents with jerks that are more prominent in the axial region and proximal extremities.

Spinal myoclonus tends to present as unilateral arrhythmic jerking in the arm and/or trunk, whereas repetitive jerking of only the trunk and abdomen, in the supine position and bilaterally, may be due to propriospinal myoclonus.

Since a variety of classifications exist, there is considerable overlap between the subtypes of different classifications.

The presences of cognitive impairment, epilepsy, ataxia, other movement disorders, or neurological signs usually point towards symptomatic myoclonus. Meanwhile, acute or subacute onset should orientate towards a toxic, metabolic, or infectious etiology. A progressive course should orientate toward a degenerative process, static encephalopathy, or progressive metabolic disease.
