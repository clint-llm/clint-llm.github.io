The following factors may interfere with the Glasgow Coma Scale assessment:

- 
**Pre-existing factors**

- 
              
- Language barriers
              
              
- Intellectual or neurological deficit
              
              
- Hearing loss or speech impediment

- 
**Effects of current treatment**

- 
              
- Physical (e.g., intubation): If a patient is intubated and unable to speak, they are evaluated only on the motor and eye-opening response and the suffix T is added to their score to indicate intubation.
              
              
- Pharmacological (e.g., sedation) or paralysis: If possible, the clinician should obtain the score before sedating the patient.

- 
**Effects of other injuries or lesions**

- 
              
- Orbital/cranial fracture
              
              
- Spinal cord damage
              
              
- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy after cold exposure

There are instances when the Glasgow Coma Scale is unobtainable despite efforts to overcome the issues listed above. It is essential that the total score is not reported without testing and including all of the components because the score will be low and could cause confusion.
