The major complications of ECMO are bleeding and thromboembolism. Bleeding occurs in 30% to 50% of patients on ECMO. Maintaining the platelet count above 50000/mL and target activated clotting time reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Plasminogen inhibitors like aminocaproic acid can be started, or heparin can be stopped for a few hours to control bleeding, but it will increase the risk of thrombosis in the ECMO circuit. Systemic thromboembolism due to the thrombus formation within the circuit can beÂ detrimental, and routine inspection of all connectors with a close watch of the pressure gradient across the oxygenator is required. A sudden change in the pressure gradient indicates the development of a clot. Other complications can be vessel perforation with hemorrhage and arterial dissection during cannulation.
