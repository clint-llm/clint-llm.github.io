Variations are common, with over 30% having more than one artery supplying a kidney. These may arise over an extensive range (T11-L4) and often from the aorta or iliac arteries. The majority of these enter the kidney at the renal hilum, although direct entry via the renal cortex also occurs. Accessory arteries that supply the lower pole of the kidney have been shown to obstruct the ureteropelvic junction.Â Ectopic kidneys are even more likely to have more than one renal artery, and their origins may arise from the celiac, the superior mesenteric artery, or the iliac artery.

The segmental arteries do not contain a collateral system, and as such, ligation or occlusion of these arteries results in ischemia and infarction in the downstream segment of the kidney. The relatively avascular plane of Brodel is useful surgically to access the pelvicalyceal system. Its position is between anterior and posterior segmental arteries in the posterolateral convex margin of the kidney.
