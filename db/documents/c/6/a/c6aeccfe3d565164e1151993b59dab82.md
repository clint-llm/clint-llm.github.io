Mucoceles and ranulas are common salivary gland disorders that are often first seen by the primary care provider or even may present in the emergency room provided ranulas are massive and causing respiratory compromise. These providers should contact with radiologists as to help them in determining the extent of the lesions, thus aiding in surgical excision, and anesthesiologists if airway compromise is the possibility. This type of coordination is necessary for the better outcome of the disease.

The effective management of the disease is highly dependent on the interprofessional approach, particularly between the surgeons and the radiologists. The role of surgeons is evident as the most effective treatment of choice for persistent symptomatic mucoceles or ranulas with the minimum recurrence rate is considered to be the surgical removal of the lesion along with the salivary gland associated. Similarly, radiologists play a significant and imperative role in the management of the disease. They not only help in correctly diagnosing the disease by eliminating other differential diagnoses via imaging but also aid in its treatment by defining the boundaries of the swelling before the surgery.

Finally, the nursing staff is also an essential segment of the interprofessional group as they educate the patient about the disease. Only through this approach of interprofessional collaboration, optimal patient outcomes can be achieved.
