Condrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis may be confused with a malignant skin condition like basal cell carcinoma due to its nodular appearance and central crusting. Larger, inflamed lesions may mimic squamous cell carcinoma. Gouty tophi are also on the differential diagnosis; however, unlike CNH, tophi appear as multiple lesions and tend to occur at other sites, like fingers and toes. Keratoacanthoma may look similar to CNH initially but grows much faster and classically resolves spontaneously after a few months due to its growth outstripping its blood supply; CNH is unlikely to resolve spontaneously. CNH lesions with substantial keratosis may resemble seborrheic or keratotic dermatitis as well.
