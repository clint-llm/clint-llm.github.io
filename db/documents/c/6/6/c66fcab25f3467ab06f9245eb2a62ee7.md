Flutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen that competitively binds androgen receptors throughout the body. This binding inhibits cell growth in prostate cancer by inhibiting testosteroneâ€™s stimulatory effects. The drug has a half-life of 6 hours, meaning dosing will have to occur a minimum of 3 times a day to maintain adequate serum levels. The liver metabolizes flutamide mainly via the CYP3A4 and other cytochrome enzymes such as CYP1A2. Flutamide is primarily excreted in the urine, with less than 5% excreted in the feces.
