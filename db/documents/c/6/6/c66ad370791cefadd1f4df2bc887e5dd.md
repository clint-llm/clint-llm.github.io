The exact etiology of anorectal malformations is unknown and is likely multifactorial. Positive family history occurs in approximately 1.4% of cases.

Imperforate anus is commonly associated with other congenital abnormalities grouped as VACTERL Syndrome/Associations, which stands for:

- **V**ertebral defects – e.g., small hypoplastic vertebrae or hemivertebra

- **A**nal defects – anal atresia/imperforate anus

- **C**ardiac defects – e.g., ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, or tetralogy of Fallot

- **T**racheoesophageal fistula

- **R**enal defects – Complete or partial renal genesis (either unilateral or bilateral), other genitourinary system anomalies

- **L**imb defects – missing or displaced digits, polydactyly, or syndactyly (i.e., webbed or fused fingers or toes)

To diagnose VACTERL/VACTER Syndrome, at least 3 of defects must be present.

Other syndromes that may be commonly associated with ARMs include MURCS (Mullerian duct aplasia, renal aplasia, and cervicothoracic somite dysplasia), OEIS (omphalocele, exstrophy, imperforate anus, and spinal defects).

**Classification**

Anorectal malformations have traditionally divided into high, intermediate, or low malformation based on the relationship of end of the rectal pouch to the level of levator ani muscle (Wingspread Classification, 1984).

However, Pena et al., with his extensive experience in posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP), found that fistula type greatly influenced outcomes in these patients. In 1995, he described a new classification system based on the type of fistula present.

In 2005, the Krickenbeck group proposed a modification of this classification to allow for comparison of outcome data of patients with ARMs undergoing different surgeries. This classification system provides standards for the classification of diagnosis, surgical procedures, and postoperative results.
