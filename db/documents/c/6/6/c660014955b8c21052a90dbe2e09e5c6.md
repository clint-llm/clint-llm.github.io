Management of FGR SGA starts before birth. Prenatal fetal surveillance is performed using a biophysical profile (BPP) to monitor fetal well-being and determine the timing of delivery.

If delivery is felt to be indicated prematurely, administration of maternal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation before birth is indicated at <34 weeks’ gestation and should be considered for pregnancies between 34 to 36 6/7 weeks gestation in some cases.

As per the Neonatal Resuscitation Program, in preparation for delivery, every birth should be attended by a dedicated, qualified individual whose only responsibility is the assessment and care of the newborn.  In the case of a delivery with suspected risk factors such as FGR, two qualified individuals should be present with a full team equipped for extensive resuscitation, including intubation and CPR, immediately available if called.  Care of the FGR SGA infant after birth should begin as it does for any infant with a quick assessment of the infant’s gestational age, tone, and breathing. If the infant appears term with good tone and adequate breathing, initial steps of warming and drying, positioning the airway, and clearing any secretions can be done on the mother’s chest or abdomen; otherwise, the infant should be moved to the warmer for more extensive assessment and resuscitation.  Following stabilization, newborn care for the term FGR SGA infant can typically be done in the mother’s room or newborn nursery per institutional policy. However, preterm infants will need admission and continuing care for issues related to their prematurity in the neonatal intensive care unit.

Following initial stabilization of the term FGR SGA infant, a thorough physical exam should be performed, and measurements of head circumference, length, and weight should be obtained with care to note if the FGR is symmetric or asymmetric.  Special attention should be paid to thermoregulation and feeding.  Given their low-fat stores and increased area-to-body mass ratio, these infants are at risk of hypothermia and subsequent poor feeding, increased calorie expenditure, and slow weight gain.  Keeping the mother’s room warm, encouraging skin-to-skin, and appropriate clothing and swaddling are effective techniques to maintain euthermia, but additional support with an incubator or radiant warmer may be needed if euthermia (36.5 to 37.5 degrees C) cannot be sustained.

Early establishment of enteral feeding should be a priority to avoid hypoglycemia.  Exclusive breastfeeding from birth until six months of age should be encouraged of all infants, including preterm and term FGR SGA infants, as per the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization.

Finally, an investigation into the etiology of fetal growth restriction should be undertaken if it remains unknown.  Serum and urine testing for congenital infections such as toxoplasmosis and Cytomegalovirus should be considered. Placental pathology is often helpful for signs of prenatal infection or vasculopathy.  If the infant presents with dysmorphology, genetic testing should be considered as well.
