The proper evaluation and management of a snake envenomationÂ depend on an interprofessional team approach. This type of management starts from the emergency medical service team gathering information regarding the snake species and rapidly transporting the patient to the hospital. The emergency medicine physician will begin the initial resuscitation, preferably while being in contact with a toxicologist and poison center. The nursing staff will continuously monitor the patient for any progression of systemic toxicity. The pharmacist will be coordinating the preparation, mixing, and administration of antivenom, if available, as well as preparing to assist clinical staff in the event of anaphylaxis. Early consultation with an intensivist should be considered for optimal monitoring and may need to assist in the treatment of the patient. Only in rare cases where a fasciotomy is the only option in a situation where there is no access to antivenom, surgical consultation is needed. These interprofessional strategies are crucial in managing snake envenomation. [Level 5]
