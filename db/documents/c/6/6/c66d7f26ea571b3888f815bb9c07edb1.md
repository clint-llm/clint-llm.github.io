**Imaging**

**Chest radiograph**- A posteroanterior chest radiograph is considered a first-line investigation for the initial evaluation of a patient with signs and symptoms of pleural effusion in the setting of cancer.

Blunting of costophrenic angle, mediastinal shift, Crowding of the ribs, elevation of the hemidiaphragm may be radiographic findings that point towards a diagnosis.

**Thoracic Ultrasound**- Thoracic Ultrasonography has a higher sensitivity than chest radiography.

The shred sign can be used to diagnose pulmonary non-translobar consolidation with a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 98 percent.

Evidence supports the use of pre-procedural ultrasonography in identifying the optimal site for thoracentesis.  A grading system proposed by Smargiassi et al. uses the description of anatomical extent, visible radiological landmarks, and a number of intercostal spaces involved to stratify the extent of pleural effusion. A large pleural effusion is classified as one where the upper lung lobe is partially displaced, includes atelectasis of the lower lobe or partial atelectasis of the upper lobe, and involves three to four intercostal spaces. A massive pleural effusion is characterized by the full collapse of the lung, atelectasis of the whole lung with hilum visible, and involvement of four or more intercostal spaces.

**Contrast-Enhanced Chest Computed Tomography**- Mediastinal lymph node involvement and associated parenchymal disease may be better visualized on computed tomography, considered the gold standard screening in those with underlying pleural malignancy.

A CT scan scoring system proposed by Pocel et al. for differentiation between malignant and benign conditions includes the following parameters – the presence of pleural lesions measuring more than 1 cm, hepatic metastasis, pulmonary mass or nodule measuring more than 1 cm, pericardial effusion, absence of loculations and absence of cardiac silhouette enlargement. A score of more than 7 out of 10 can be used to detect malignancy with a sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 94 percent, respectively.

Dual-energy spectral CT imaging, which can generate material decomposition images, monochromatic image sets with fast kilovoltage switching, has been shown to have added utility in distinguishing benign from malignant pleural lesions. A combination of patient age, clinical history, and information on CT value measurement (at both high and low energy levels), and the effective atomic number obtained in a single spectral scan have been found to be useful in identifying malignant pleura disease.

**Positron Emission Tomography/Dynamic Imaging**- While early or indolent disease may give rise to false negatives, inflammatory pleural involvement, rheumatoid disease, pleurodesis procedure performed may be associated with false-positive results.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**- MRI offers better soft tissue resolution as compared to Computed tomographic scanning. MR Imaging possesses a higher sensitivity in detecting chest wall and diaphragmatic involvement.

**Histopathological Diagnosis**

**Diagnostic Thoracentesis**- The standard panel of tests that needs to be performed on a pleural fluid sample includes PF protein, glucose, pH, lactate dehydrogenase, cytology, and microbiology.

**Pleural Fluid Analysis**- Normal physicochemical characteristics include pH between 7.60 and 7.64, protein levels of less than 2 percent (2 gm/dl), less than 100 WBC’s per cubic millimeter, Glucose content similar to that of plasma, LDH level less than half of that present within the plasma. The following parameters can be used in making a diagnosis of malignant etiology underlying the accumulation of pleural fluid – pH less than 7.30, LDH levels greater than 1000 U/l, reduced pleural fluid glucose concentration (30 to 50 mg/dl), lymphocyte values greater than 50 to 70%.

Pleural fluid tumor marker levels have been used in the diagnosis of MPE. Carcinoembryonic Antigen, mucin, and Leu 1 have been shown to be elevated in effusions with an underlying malignant etiology.

An issue that continues to remain a deterrent in diagnosing malignant effusion by the use of conventional cytology remains the differentiation of malignant cells from reactive mesothelial cells.

**Pleural Fluid Cell Block**- Cell-block technique for processing fluids was first introduced in 1896.

**Pleural Biopsy**- Given the low diagnostic yield of conventional cytology and the lack of standard protocols which advocate the use of the cell block technique, a pleural biopsy may be considered in patients with cytology negative effusions.

**Image-Guided Biopsies**- Both ultrasound-guided and CT-guided biopsies have been used in obtaining representative pleural samples for diagnostic purposes.

**Thoracoscopy**- Medical thoracoscopy is recommended when the thickness of effusion is less than 10 mm on a CT scan.

**Pleural Manometry**- German physician Heinrich Quincke was the first to pioneer pleural manometry to measure the pressure within the pleural space in 1878. Techniques used to measure pleural pressures include a hemodynamic electronic transducer, electronic manometer, and U tube water manometer. Hemodynamic electronic transducers provide the most reliable and accurate measures of intrapleural pressures. The thickness of the normal pleural space is 20 micrometers, and 50 ml of fluid in the pleural space is required to ensure that the effect of local deformation forces on the measurement of pleural pressures can be nullified. Pressure within the pleural space is influenced by elastic forces of the chest wall, lung, and effusion volume. Gravity, ventilatory pressures, forces produced due to cardiac contraction and associated with lymphatic drainage play a role in generating pleural pressures. Lan et al. were the first to describe the utility of manometry in optimizing pleurodesis in those with malignant pleural effusion. Although real-time manometry has been proposed as a means of identifying an un-expandable lung following thoracentesis. However, there has been a lack of consensus on specific pressure cut-offs that can be used to distinguish between normal and unexpanded lung.
