Severe riboflavin deficiency can diminish levels of FAD and FMN and affect the metabolism of other nutrients, especially other B vitamins. Riboflavin is excreted from the body while only 15% of it is absorbed. Carbohydrates received from food convert to ATP, which is then used to produce energy in the body. It is essential to consume riboflavin every day either by food or with supplement. Most of the riboflavin is absorbed in the small intestine, and excess passes out of the body as urine. Urinary excretion can also decrease with age and stress. Hydrolysis of FAD and FMN to riboflavin done by pyrophosphates and phosphatase must occur in the upper intestine for dietary riboflavin absorption. Individuals who eat nutritional diets may not need supplements; therefore, it is necessary that they consume foods rich in B vitamins along with others. Also, foods provide better absorption of riboflavin when compared to supplements.
