- Severe lumbar stenosis or ankylosis

- Spinal dysraphism at the lumbar region, occult or manifest

- Complete obstruction documented

- For the definition of the superior margin in a complete block

- Infection at the lumbar area

**Lateral C1-C2 Cervical Puncture**

- Arachnoiditis at the lumbar area

- Severe lumbar stenosis or ankylosis

- Spinal dysraphism at the lumbar area, occult or manifest

- Complete obstruction documented
