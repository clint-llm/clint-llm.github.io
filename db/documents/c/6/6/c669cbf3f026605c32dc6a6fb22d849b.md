**Diagnostic Criteria as per DSM- 5**

At least four symptoms from the list below should have been present on most days for at least 6 months demonstrating a pattern of angry or irritable mood, argumentative or defiant behavior, or vindictiveness:

- Often loses temper

- Often touchy or easily annoyed

- Often angry and resentful

- Often argue with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults

- Often actively refuse or defy to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules

- Often deliberately annoys others

- Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior

- The child has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months

There should be evidence of impairment either in the form of distress (in the individual, family, peers, etc.) and/or negative impact on social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during substance use, psychotic, depressive, or bipolar disorder. The patients must not meet the criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Severity: ODD is considered mild if symptoms are confined to only one setting, moderate if at least two settings and severe if symptoms are present in three or more settings.
