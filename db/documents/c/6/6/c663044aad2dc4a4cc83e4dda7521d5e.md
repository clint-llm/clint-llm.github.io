Knowing the time of injury helps determine the acuity of the injury and would impact management options. The time interval between the injury and onset of the neurological symptoms could offer clues to the nature of the injury, as a delayed onset might suggest a compressive injury while an immediate onset post-injury suggests direct PNI. The mechanism of injury and severity of the impact can help in determining the extent and degree of nerve injury. This information can be of value for making clinical decisions and assessing the potential prognosis. History taking should also be focused on the neurological deficits and/or neuropathic pain distribution to help in the localization of the nerve injury.

It is important to identify signs such as lacerations, stab wounds, bullet entry/exit wounds, abrasions, or bruises. Furthermore, a detailed neurological exam is essential. A comprehensive assessment of motor power in all the muscles supplied by pertinent nerves, as well as a precise sensory examination is needed to avoid false localization. Additionally, vascular or musculoskeletal injuries can also point to the injury of adjacent nerves. Of note, musculoskeletal injuries can potentially limit the motor neurological assessment and thus should be identified and taken into consideration in the evaluation.

In cases of brachial plexus injury, a thorough exam can guide the examiner to specific clues. The presence of ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis (Horner’s syndrome) is suggestive of a proximal injury to the lower brachial plexus or avulsion of the proximal C8 and/or T1 nerve roots. Conversely, paralysis of the hemidiaphragm, winging of the scapula, and rhomboid muscle weakness would suggest a proximal upper brachial plexus injury with possible nerve root(s) avulsion.

Evaluation of pertinent muscle strength is possible by using the MRC-scale (Medical Research Council of Great Britain).

- Grade 0 (G0) where no muscle contraction can be elicited

- Grade 1 (G1) when there is muscle flickering but no active movement

- Grade 2 (G2) when muscle contraction can result in active motion but not against the gravity

- Grade 3 (G3) when the muscle strength can overcome gravity, but without resistance

- Grade 4 (G4) muscle contraction can be performed against resistance but not full power

- Grade 5 (G5) is full strength (normal)

The sensory function should be assessed accurately to avoid dermatomal overlap. Therefore an autonomous and distinct zones dermatomes should be examined for different sensory modalities (fine touch sensations, pinprick, and temperature sensation) to minimize the misinterpretation. For instance, testing the dorsal aspect of the hand for radial nerve and volar surface of the pinky finger for ulnar nerve examination.
