In atheroembolic renal disease, cholesterol emboli are often associated with irreversible organ damage with a poor prognosis. The renal outcome varies, with some patients going on maintenance dialysis and others improving but with a variable degree of residual chronic renal impairment. Renal function may improve in approximately one-third of these patients after variable time if there are no more embolic events and tubular recovery ensues.
