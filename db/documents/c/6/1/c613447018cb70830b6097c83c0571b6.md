Treatment of a stimulant overdose depends on the specific agent used, the ongoing adverse effects, and the potential risk for further adverse effects. The generally available options for treating stimulant toxicity are benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, and antihypertensive medications. Certain medications under these classes of drugs may be contraindicated depending on the specific drug used. Benzodiazepines lower the associated anxiety of stimulant toxicity and may improve the patient's vital signs. They are also the primary option if the patient is experiencing seizures. Beta-blockers are useful for lowering the patient's heart rate, given that tachycardia is a very common symptom of stimulant overdose. As well, they can improve the patient's hypertensive state. Antiarrhythmic medications are generally reserved for ventricular arrhythmias that result from stimulant toxicity.

It is critical to confirm the specific drug that induces the stimulant toxicity given the potential treatment contraindications. For example, cocaine overdoses are a frequent cause of stimulant toxicity. While they induce tachycardia, chest pain, and hypertension, the use of beta-blockers may potentially be cardiotoxic to a patient who has overdosed on cocaine.
