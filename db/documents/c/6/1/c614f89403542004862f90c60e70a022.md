An absolute contraindication for an image-guided breast biopsy is the non-visualization of the lesion. Relative contraindications are overlying skin infections and a high risk of bleeding demonstrated by a grossly abnormal international normalized ratio (INR). For a stereotactic biopsy, morbid obesity is a relative contraindication as biopsy chairs and tables have a weight limit, usually only accommodating patients up to 350 lbs. Additionally, modality-specific contraindications for mammographic stereotactic guided biopsies include pregnancy (relative), breast compression size, and inability to properly position the patient. These same contraindications hold true for MR with the addition of MR noncompatible implanted hardware or metallic devices.
