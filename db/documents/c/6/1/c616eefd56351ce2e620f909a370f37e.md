Linezolid is a synthetic oxazolidinone antimicrobial drug. It is indicated for gram-positive infections and approved for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infections, including infections complicated by bacteremia. Linezolid does not have approval for the treatment of gram-negative infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, or catheter site infections. Linezolid's primary place in therapy is an alternative to vancomycin in inpatient settings. This activity covers linezolid so that members of the interprofessional team can recognize its indications, coverage, contraindications, and adverse event profile to optimally manage patients with an infectious disease and exercise appropriate antimicrobial stewardship.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of antimicrobial action for linezolid.
- Summarize the indications for initiating linezolid therapy.
- Explain the contraindications to using linezolid.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance linezolid and improve outcomes.
