Liver failure is a medical emergency carrying a high mortality rate. It presents in an individual with normal liver function as acute liver failure(ALF), and in an individual with chronic liver disease either as ‘acute on chronic’ liver failure(AOCF) or decompensated end-stage liver disease. Though the etiology may be different, all the types of liver failure result in the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the body that causes end-organ dysfunction, eventually culminating in multi-organ failure and death.
