The procedure-related complications are hardware-related and biological.

Hardware-related complications

Lead migration is by far the most frequent complication reported with ONS. In a retrospective analysis of fifteen patients treated for a medically refractory headache, Schwedt et al. reported the rate as high as 60Â to 100%.

Biological complications

Patients treated with implanted neuromodulation devices often report pain related to the site of device components.

Some other complications associated with ONS include device malfunction, compliance issues, ineffective stimulation, and device shock.
