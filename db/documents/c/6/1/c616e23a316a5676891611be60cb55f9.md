Candesartan overdose would most likely manifest as symptomatic hypotension, dizziness, and reflexive tachycardia. Patients who develop symptomatic hypotension should have their vital signs monitored. Patients should receive instruction to lie down supine and raise their legs. If this is insufficient, clinicians can initiate fluid resuscitation and/or supportive pharmacotherapy to increase blood pressure.
