Carbamazepine is a commonly prescribed agent for focal epilepsy and other nonepileptic conditions such as neuropathic pain, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder in pediatric and adult patients. The first overdose was reported in 1967, and significant toxicity occurs at levels higher than 40 mg/L (usual therapeutic levels are 4 to 12 mg/L). Carbamazepine overdose is not uncommon. In 2014 there were 1880 documented cases of symptomatic carbamazepine toxicity according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers report. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of carbamazepine toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the toxicokinetics and pathophysiology of carbamazepine toxicity.
- Identify the presentation of a patient with carbamazepine toxicity, and potential differential diagnoses.
- Describe the treatment and management strategies for addressing carbamazepine toxicity.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and collaboration in order to employ better identification, screening, and treatment of carbamazepine toxicity and improve patient outcomes.
