**Normal T-wave Physiology**

Normal T waves are upright in leads I, II, and V3-V6, inverted in AVR. Less than five mm in limb leads, less than ten mm in precordial leads, and variable presentations in III, AVL, AVF, and V1-V2.

**Abnormal T-wave Pathophysiology**

T wave changes are secondary to electrolyte abnormalities in the myocardium since the ECG is representative of the electricity of the heart. The outflow of potassium from the myocyte during repolarization is necessary to restore resting membrane potential. In disease states such as ischemia, the Na/K-ATPase cannot function to restore this gradient; when there is hyperkalemia, the electrochemical gradient for potassium to flow out of the cell is skewed, altering the repolarization phase. These changes during phase three of the action potential are reflected by abnormalities in the T wave on an ECG.
