Nurses play a role in educating patients and their families about stroke burden and secondary-prevention, including lifestyle changes and medications. The nurses assist in early intervention emergency department triage, including ensuring medical stability for airway, breathing, and circulation. Nurses are needed at the bedside while antithrombotic therapy is infusing for close monitoring of therapy. Furthermore, nurses can intervene in interrupting therapy should the patient develop signs/symptoms of bleeding or changes in mental status. Nurses can encourage and recommend treatment for blood pressure, fever, and blood glucose.
