In surgery, knowing the anatomy of the head, face, and neck is crucial in avoiding complications. The anatomy of the mylohyoid nerve is important, especially in neck and jaw surgeries. The position of the mylohyoid nerve makes it vulnerable in surgeries such as genioplasty, removal of the submandibular glands, and lymph node dissection. The cutaneous sensory nerve of the mylohyoid nerve is prone to injury in any procedure involving the submental triangle (inferior chin region).
