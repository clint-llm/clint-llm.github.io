If a patient uses a bronchodilator and experiences any of the adverse effects described, they should promptly seek medical attention. These effects include difficulty breathing, fever/chills, decreased urinary output, nausea or vomiting, tremors, or convulsions, among others. A doctor can measure the patient's vitals in an emergency room and take a blood sample to detect any electrolyte abnormalities.
