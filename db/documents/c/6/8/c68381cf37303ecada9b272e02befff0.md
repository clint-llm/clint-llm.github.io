Graves’ orbitopathy has been said to occur in as many as 25 to 50% of patients diagnosed with Graves' disease. One study reported that the incidence of clinically apparent Graves orbitopathy was 16 per 100000 in females and 2.9 per 100000 in males. It is, however, also important to realize that an even larger proportion of patients may have MRI evidence of Graves orbitopathy in the absence of clinical disease.
