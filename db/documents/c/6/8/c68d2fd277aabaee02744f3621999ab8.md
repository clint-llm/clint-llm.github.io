The medulla provides sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to the heart and coronary arteries. The sympathetic innervation is via the cardiac fibers from the superior, middle, and inferior cervical ganglion. Sympathetic innervation causes vasodilation of the coronary arteries. The parasympathetic innervation is via the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve will constrict the coronary arteries.
