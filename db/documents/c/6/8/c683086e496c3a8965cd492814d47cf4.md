Betaxolol is a lipophilic beta-adrenergic blocker that is selective to the beta-1 adrenergic receptor, with a limited beta-2 blocking effect. This factor is an important distinction compared to topical nonselective beta-blockers.

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy defined by the death of retinal ganglion cells and characteristic changes to the optic nerve head. Intraocular pressure, as well as other factors, are factors for the loss of ganglion cells. While the exact mechanism of glaucoma is not completely known, there are two main independent pathways, the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral, that contribute to the intraocular pressure.  In primary open-angle glaucoma, there is increased resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor, a clear fluid produced by the ciliary bodies, through the trabecular meshwork of the eye. This action increases intraocular pressure, leading to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve over time, causing progressive vision loss that typically starts at the periphery and can expand to involve the whole field of vision for that eye.  It is also known that patients with normal intraocular pressure can also develop glaucoma.

Beta-blockers like betaxolol were once first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma, but now topical prostaglandin analogs, like latanoprost, are often the first drugs of choice.
