The genioglossus muscle under the control of multiple reflexes evoked by mechanoreceptors involved in the upper respiratory tract airway.

The hypoglossal nerve also referred to as cranial nerve XII, is responsible for the innervation of both the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles; this includes the genioglossus muscles as they are part of the extrinsic muscle group.

Pleural receptors, when called upon (during an inhalation), send inhibitory afferents to the XII nucleus, to make the genioglossus muscle more able to retract and better dilate the upper airway.
