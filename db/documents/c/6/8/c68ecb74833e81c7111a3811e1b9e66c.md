Permethrin is a neurotoxic synthetic pyrethroid. It targets eggs, lice, and mites.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Topical permethrin is associated with limited dermal or systemic absorption.

**Distribution:**Pharmacokinetic distribution property has not been examined despite its widespread use. Hence a study was conducted in 2019 to assess the plasma protein and lipoprotein Binding of Cis- and Trans-Permethrin and Deltamethrin in adult humans and rats. The study revealed that pyrethroid has high plasma protein binding (90%) and lipoprotein plays a major role in binding and transport.

**Metabolism:**Permethrin quickly undergoes esterase hydrolysis and detoxification within the body.

**Excretion:**During the 72 hours after topical application, permethrin's inactive metabolites undergo nearly complete excretion into the urine.
