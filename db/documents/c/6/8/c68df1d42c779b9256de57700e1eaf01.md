Lupus pernio is characterized by violaceous or erythematous, indurated plaques that are primarily distributed on the central face involving theÂ nose and cheeks. Lesions can also involve the ears and very rarely the dorsum of hands and feet. Lupus pernio can present as a few small nodules on the nose to exuberant plaques spreading across both cheeks.
