The evaluation of HaNDL is performed by a diagnostic criterion as follows:

- Severe to moderate intensity migraine-like headache lasting for a few hours.

- Increased lymphocytes (>15 white cells/ml))in the CSF with negative etiologic studies.  The opening pressure can increase to 400 and 440 mmH2O.

- Temporary neurological deficits along with acute headache episodes or development of these symptoms just after a headache

- The reappearance of headache and neurological deficits within three months.

Cranial imaging studies are negative in HaNDL, except for some abnormalities in perfusion-weighted examinations and diffusion restriction of the corpus callosum splenium region.

- Single-photon emission, computerized tomography (SPECT) test shows a temporary decrease in perfusion to the cerebral cortex during an episode with neurologic symptoms.

- Electroencephalogram (EEG) shows slow activity, focal, intermittent theta, or delta waveform.
