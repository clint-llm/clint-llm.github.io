Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are taken orally once daily, with or without food. Before initiating treatment and periodically during therapy, LFTs and HbA1C levels require monitoring. Maximal glucose-lowering effects of TZDs are not seen for six weeks to 6 months due to a delayed onset of action via modification of gene expression. For type 2 diabetes management, TZDs should be used in combination with lifestyle modifications and can be used in conjunction with biguanides, sulfonylureas, and insulin injectables.

Dosing for treatment of T2DM:

- Pioglitazone: Initial 15 to 30 mg PO with a meal once a day; may increase the dose by 15 mg with careful monitoring to 45 mg once a day. The maximum dose is 45 mg.

- Rosiglitazone: Initial 4 mg PO once a day. If inadequate response after 8 to 12 weeks, may increase the dose to 8 mg PO once a day or 4 mg twice a day.
