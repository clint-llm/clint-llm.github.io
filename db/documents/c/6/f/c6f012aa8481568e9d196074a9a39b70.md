**Myocardial Hibernation due to Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**

Chronic reversible ischemia due to obstructive coronary artery disease leads to a reduction in resting blood flow and subsequent downregulation in metabolism and contractility. This myocardium is viable and recovers partially or fully upon revascularization.

**Myocardial Stunning due to Acute Coronary Syndrome**

An acute coronary syndrome due to plaque rupture leads to an ischemic cascade downstream and subsequent impairment in LV contractility. The contractile dysfunction persists despite early revascularization and before irreversible myocardial injury sets. Duration of transient post-ischemic dysfunction or stunning is the function of the duration of ischemia. It is believed to be caused by acute ischemia followed by reperfusion injury.

**Myocardial Stunning Post-Cardiac Surgery**

On-pump cardiac surgical procedures like CABG involve the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass machines, aortic cross-clamping, and cardioplegia, which lead to an interruption in coronary artery blood flow. This leads to ischemia, initially followed by reperfusion injury once the heart is restarted, resulting in reversible post-ischemic systolic dysfunction.

**Left Atrial Stunning Post Cardioversion**

Conversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter to sinus rhythm by either electrical or pharmacological cardioversion leads to transient left atrial and left atrial appendage contractile dysfunction lasting about 4Â to 6 weeks. A stunned atrium and appendage can be a nidus for thrombus formation; hence, patients should be on anticoagulation for at least four weeks.

**Myocardial Stunning in Resuscitated Cardiac Arrest**

Myocardial dysfunction may result after the return of spontaneous circulation following a cardiac arrest. It manifests as global myocardial hypokinesis with a severe reduction in ejection fraction, reduction in cardiac output, and hypotension.
