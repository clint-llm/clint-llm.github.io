The most widely used anatomic classification of hepatic segments is Couinaud classification which describes eight functionally independent liver segments based on vascularization, bile duct distribution, and lymphatic drainage.

The hepatic blood supply is from the portal vein (about two-thirds), and the rest is from the hepatic artery; thus, maximum enhancement of the liver is attained during the portal venous phase, which is 60 to 120 seconds after arterial phase enhancement.

The hepatic veins enter the inferior vena cava and can be seen as anechoic tubes with thin walls on ultrasound. The portal triad, which includesÂ the portal veins, hepatic arteries, and bile ducts surrounded by fibrofatty tissue, can be seen as echogenic foci throughout the liver.

The portal vein forms from the junction of the superior mesenteric artery and splenic veins behind the neck of the pancreas.

Hepatomegaly and liver cirrhosis are two main pathologies that distort the liver anatomy. Cardiac disease, including congestive heart failure, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and right-sided valvular disease, can cause hepatomegaly and dilation of hepatic veins, called passive hepatic congestion.
