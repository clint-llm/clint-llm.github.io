Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the initial diagnostic test of choice and is considered the best screening test for assessing the pathology of the thyroid and for the monitoring of thyroid replacement therapy. Due to the negative feedback that T3 and T4 exert on the pituitary gland, elevated T3 and/or elevated T4 will cause decreased TSH production from the anterior pituitary gland. Abnormal TSH is often followed up with a measurement of free T4 and/or free T3.

TSH levels in the context of acute illness should be interpreted with more discretion as TSH levels are considerably more susceptible to the effects of illness.

Hyperthyroidism is a common etiology for atrial fibrillation; thus, further workup with an ECG may be warranted, especially in a patient complaining of palpitations. Obtaining troponin levels is not routine unless the clinical presentation warrants further cardiac ischemic workup, such as active chest pain.

Radiological diagnostics such as chest x-rays serve little diagnostic utility in managing hyperthyroidism. Diagnostics such as ultrasound are not useful in diagnosing hyperthyroidism, but the ultrasound findings of nodules could potentially determine an etiology.

Since a majority of cases of hyperthyroidism are due to Graves disease or toxic multinodular goiter, confirmation of the diagnosis can be made based on history, clinical findings, and palpating of the thyroid. In cases of diffuse goiter or no thyroid enlargement, a 24-hour radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) is needed to distinguish between Graves disease and other hyperthyroidism etiologies. Radioactive iodine uptake is the percentage of iodine-131 retained by the thyroid after 24 hours. For the typical western diet, the normal range of RAIU is typically 10% to 30%.

Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and thyroid adenoma are etiologies of hyperthyroidism with increased RAIU, reflecting an increased synthesis of thyroid hormone. Subacute thyroiditis, painless thyroiditis, iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, and factitious hyperthyroidism have decreased RAIU. Thyroiditis represents a disruption of the thyroid follicles with the subsequent release of thyroid hormone. Since there is no increased thyroid hormone synthesis, RAIU will be low in thyroiditis.

If RAIU is not available or is contraindicated, then measurement of thyroid receptor antibodies can be used asÂ an alternative test for diagnosis of Graves disease.

A radioisotope thyroid scan is a diagnostic tool that utilizes technetium-99m pertechnetate as a radioactive tracer. The technetium-99m pertechnetate is taken up by the thyroid gland by the sodium-iodide symporter. The scan itself assesses the functional activity of thyroid nodules, classifying them as either "cold" (hypofunctioning), "warm" (isofunctioning), or "hot" (hyperfunctioning). "Cold" nodules raise concern for potential malignancy due to ineffective uptake of iodide and synthesis of thyroid hormone typically seen in thyroid carcinomas.
