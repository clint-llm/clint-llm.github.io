Medical Histology is the microscopic study of tissues and organs through sectioning, staining, and examining those sections under a microscope. Often called microscopic anatomy and histochemistry, histology allows for the visualization of tissue structure and characteristic changes the tissue may have undergone. Because of this, it is utilized in medical diagnosis, scientific study, autopsy, and forensic investigation. Once the tissue sample has undergone fixation, processing, embedding, sectioning, and staining, it can undergo analysis through microscopy and the findings interpreted by a pathologist. The histological stains chosen for a given specimen depends on the investigational question at hand. Advanced interpretation of the histology slide combined with a patientâ€™s medical history can make an invaluable impact on the treatment course and prognosis.
