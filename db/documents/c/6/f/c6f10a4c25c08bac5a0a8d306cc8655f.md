Papillary fibroelastoma is most commonly asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. In some patients, PFE first manifests with features of embolization, including stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, or of cardiac obstruction such as syncope, heart failure, or sudden death. The most common presentation is a stroke in 30% of patients. It is also noted to be an incidental finding in one-third of patients.
