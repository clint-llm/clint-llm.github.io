The interplay between the parasympathetic nervous system, which constricts the pupil, and the sympathetic nervous system, which dilates the pupil, determines pupillary size.

The ciliospinal reflex is absent in

- Horner syndrome

- Propofol-induced anesthesia.

The exaggerated ciliospinal reflex may lead to bilaterally dilated pupils which remain dilated for 1 to 6 minutes with minimal or no response to brief exposure to light (seemingly non-reactive pupils) or in pupillometry. However, the pupil constricts on prolonged exposure (30 to 45 seconds) to light, and there is the preservation of the consensual pupillary response. Exaggerated ciliospinal reflex must be ruled out before suspecting a non-reactive pupil due to pathologies like increased intracranial tension, third nerve palsy, or midbrain compression in a comatose patient.

An exaggerated ciliospinal reflex may be present in

- Asymptomatic patients with a cluster headache - may be due to mechanisms 'proximal to the third-order sympathetic neurons'

- Barbiturate-induced coma - ciliospinal reflex may be present after routine nursing care of critically ill patients.

The presence of ciliospinal reflex during and after cardiopulmonary resuscitation may denote a positive prognostic sign for regaining consciousness.
