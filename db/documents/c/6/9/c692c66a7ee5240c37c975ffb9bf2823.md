Malunion of the fracture can occur if the fracture unites in a non-anatomical position. It can lead to post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow if there is articular surface malreduction. Also, deformities like cubitus varus or sometimes cubitus valgus may be associated.

Lateral condyle fractures are generally intra-articular (Salter-Harris IV). Growth arrest can occur when the ossific nucleus is involved.

Non-union seems to be more common on lateral condyle fractures compared to other elbow fractures. Prior studies have placed the risk between 1 to 5% depending on the definition used.

Healing of a lateral condyle fracture can often lead to a wider distal humerus. Cubitus varus develops in more than 20% of patients, while a valgus deformity can occur in more than 10%. These deformities alter the normal physiological carrying angle (5 to 15 degrees). Healing in a slightly displaced fashion compared to the initial position seems to be responsible for a varus deformity. A bony prominence can sometimes be felt clinically or seen radiologically with little significance.
