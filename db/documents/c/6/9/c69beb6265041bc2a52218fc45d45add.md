Stereotactic radiosurgery is an invaluable treatment option for brain and spine metastasis, primary tumors, vascular and functional conditions. As the techniques develop further, the indications are growing.

Stereotactic radiosurgery is a superior treatment option to WBRT, which is associated with significant neurological complications, including neurocognitive impairment, which limits its use.

The advantage of SRS over surgery is its minimally invasive nature. It is an outpatient procedure, which doesnâ€™t require a general anesthetic, and can treat multiple lesions in the same session with short recovery times. It is useful for deep, surgically inaccessible lesions or those in eloquent areas.
