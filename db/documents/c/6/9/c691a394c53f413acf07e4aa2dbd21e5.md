NH is a manifestation of specific disorders pertaining to various organ systems (table2).  The etiopathogenic disease entities leading to NH should be differentiated by appropriate investigations. As the clinical presentation of NH, with symptoms like respiratory distress, hypotonia, irritability, feeding intolerance, tachycardia, among others, is nonspecific, all other neonatal causes for such symptoms should be ruled out.
