Organizational culture is a primary concern in the process of hospital accreditation, wherein the quality of a hospital’s patient care is systematically assessed against the standards of care in medical practice.

Organizational culture is not just relevant to the hospital setting alone. Clinic and office-specific cultural archetypes can be identified and then potentially modified as part of practice redesign to culture types more strongly associated with high provider satisfaction.
