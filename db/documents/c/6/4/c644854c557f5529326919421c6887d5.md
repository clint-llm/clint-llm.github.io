Asteroid hyalosis is most often asymptomatic, and hence prognosis is good. However, in the presence of other ophthalmic comorbidities like diabetic retinopathy, the prognosis depends upon the associated diseases. Similarly, the presence of AH in situations like retinal detachment without an identifiable break, symptomatic floaters, etc. warrants vitrectomy, and the prognosis depends upon these associated diseases. Special care during biometry to avoid wrong intraocular lens power calculation helps in better prognosis in eyes with AH undergoing cataract surgery.
