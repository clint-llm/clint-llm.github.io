Breast cancer often requires surgery as part of curative treatment. The decision to proceed with mastectomy or breast conservation surgery remains both patient- and disease-driven. Some patients require upfront chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment to downstage their tumor or axillary nodes, as is the case in inflammatory breast cancer. In most early-stage breast cancer, surgery is the first step in treatment. Following surgery, adjuvant radiation is recommended in nearly all patients who undergo breast conservation therapy as recurrence rates are unacceptably high without it. Endocrine therapy is recommended for at least five years in those whose tumors are positive for hormone receptors (i.e., estrogen, progesterone) and often recommended for women considered high risk as prophylactic therapy. Chemotherapy is also recommended in more aggressive tumors as well as those who have a negative expression of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2neu receptors.

Surveillance guidelines following cure involve at least annual mammography to assess for local recurrence or contralateral breast cancers. The timing of initiation is generally six months after radiation therapy is completed. If the patient is receiving semiannual screening, current guidelines recommend returning to annual surveillance after two years.
