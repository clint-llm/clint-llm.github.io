Testing strategies for syphilis consist of dark-field microscopy and serological tests.

Dark-field examination by microscope allows for direct examination of spirochetes from the mucosal lesion and thus offers an immediate diagnosis.

The serological tests are classified as non-treponemal and treponemal. The non-treponemal tests (venereal disease research laboratory tests, rapid plasma reagin test) are screening tests that detect antibodies to cardiolipin in blood. The VDRL and RPR tests are only positive after the development of the primary chancre.

Positive non-treponemal tests are confirmed with treponemal tests (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption assay, T. pallidum particle agglutination assay) that detect antibodies to the T. pallidum in blood. Syphilis is a reportable disease.

Patients with neurologic symptoms should undergo a cerebrospinal (CSF) examination.

Reverse sequence screening is an increasingly used algorithm across US laboratories that use treponemal tests as the initial screening to identify those patients with treated, untreated, or incompletely treated syphilis.
