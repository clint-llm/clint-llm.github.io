Once the eggs of the tapeworm have been ingested by a human, oncosphere larvae are released from the egg, which can pierce the lamina propria of the intestine. As it penetrates, it enters the blood or lymphatics and gets transported to the liver, lungs, or other internal organs, where it develops into hydatid cysts (metacestode larvae). These cysts possess an inner germinal layer and an outer laminated layer surrounded by a fibrous capsule derived from the host. The inner cellular layer gives rise to smaller "daughter" cysts. In humans, cysts grow slowly and can be up to multiple liters in volume, and contain thousands of protoscolices. Over time, septations and daughter cysts disrupt the typical unilocular pattern of echinococcal cysts.
