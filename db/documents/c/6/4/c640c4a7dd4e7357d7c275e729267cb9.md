Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA), consists of the presence of digital clubbing, increased periosteal activity of the tubular bones, arthralgias, and joint effusion and is characterized by abnormal proliferation of the skin, soft tissues, and osseous tissues in the distal parts of extremities.

Clubbing is among the oldest signs in clinical medicine, first described in a man with curved fingernails and empyema by Hippocrates (460 BC - 370 BC).
