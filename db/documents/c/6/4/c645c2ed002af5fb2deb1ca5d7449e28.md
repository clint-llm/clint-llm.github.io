Refractory shock is a potentially fatal manifestation of cardiovascular failure with inadequate response to vasopressors characterized by poor tissue perfusion, hypotension, and organ failure. Management of refractory shock involves treating the cause and restoring organ perfusion with fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of refractory shock and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of refractory shock.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of refractory shock.
- Outline the management options for refractory shock.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with refractory shock.
