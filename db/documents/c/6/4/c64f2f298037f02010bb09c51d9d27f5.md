Approximately 4 to 12% of syphilis patients will present with oral manifestations and are usually diagnosed in the secondary phase of the disease. The mean age of syphilis diagnosis is around 34 years old, of which 51% are men.

Most reported gonorrhea cases are based on urogenital testing. The epidemiology of oropharyngeal gonorrhea is limited because most clinics do not offer oropharynx screenings. The prevalence of oropharyngeal gonorrhea in MSM is 2% to 11%, in heterosexuals 3% to 7% for men, and between 2% to 10% for women.

Tuberculosis is more common in developing countries. In 2019, more than 80% of tuberculosis cases occurred in Indonesia, India, China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and South Africa. Most oral manifestations of tuberculosis are secondary to the primary pulmonary infection; however, in younger patients, primary oral tuberculosis may occur from direct inoculation of the organism in the oral mucosa.

Scarlet fever can occur in all age groups, but it is more prevalent amongst children between 5 to 15 years old. Strep throat is responsible for 15 to 30% of all pharyngitis in children and 5 to 15% in adults, making the prevalence of scarlet fever higher in children. Scarlet fever is seen more in underdeveloped countries due to crowded living circumstances.
