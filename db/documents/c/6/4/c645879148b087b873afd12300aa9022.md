Routine safety precautions in high-velocity situations should be implemented, such as wearing a seatbelt while driving a car. Once the injury is sustained, patients should promptly present to a trauma center for evaluation. Patients who sustain both bone forearm fractures should be educated on the typical clinical course as well as the most common complications. The signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome should be discussed in detail.

Often patients will be immobilized in a splint and are given follow-up at an orthopedic surgery clinic. Splint care instructions should be provided, and the importance of follow-up should be stressed. Modifiable risk factors for complications should be addressed at the initial visit, including tobacco cessation if applicable. The patient should not be allowed to bear weight on the affected extremity, and if rehabilitation therapy with a physical therapist is necessary, that can be scheduled at this time.
