Despite the advances and progress that have been made with drug-eluting, coronary stents, there continues to be a need for further improvement to minimized early and late inflammatory and hypersensitivity reactions to the drug or the polymer. Improvements still need to be made with the drug-releasing polymer as irregularities within the polymer result in inconsistent drug delivery and can also serve as a nidus for possible thrombus formation within the stent. Further improvements in the structure and metal base continue to be developed due to ongoing issues with possible stent fracture and longitudinal deformation that can occur over time in up to 2% to 5% of stents, particularly in the right coronary artery. Also, issues with permanent metallic implants placed in the coronary vessel over time cause vessel straightening and loss of cyclic strain, loss of vasomotion, and adaptive vascular remodeling, and need to be addressed and improved. Lastly, neoatherosclerosis has been seen to develop in second-generation stents where a thin layer of neointimal hyperplasia has developed and begins to adapt and develop lipid accumulation with lipid-rich phenotypes similar to diseased native vessels. These are all areas for future improvement with third-generation stents as well.
