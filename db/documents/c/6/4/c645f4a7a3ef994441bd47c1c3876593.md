Esmolol is contraindicated in patients with sinus bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular heart block, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of hypersensitivity reactions to esmolol. In addition, Esmolol and calcium channel blockers should not be given together, as this may exacerbate hypotension and bradycardia.

Patients with first-degree heart block and nodal dysfunctions are at an increased risk of progressive heart block, bradycardia, and AV dissociation. Patients with preexisting heart failure are at greater risk of decompensated heart failure and cardiogenic shock.

Clinicians should be cautious when using beta-blocker, such as esmolol, in patients with airway diseases such as asthma and COPD; even though the beta-2 receptor's effects are minimal, some risks may exist at higher doses.
