Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a tumor arising from the parafollicular cells, or C cells, of the thyroid gland. Medullary thyroid cancer produces calcitonin, and elevated calcitonin level is an essential feature of this tumor. Recent advances in molecular pathogenesis and genetic testing have led to risk stratification of the patients and the identification of molecular targets for therapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of MTC and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of medullary thyroid cancer.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with medullary thyroid cancer.
- Summarize the treatment options for medullary thyroid cancer.
- Outline the importance of care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by medullary thyroid cancer.
