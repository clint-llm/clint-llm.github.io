Side effects are generally mild and resolve promptly upon decreasing the dosage or discontinuing the drug for short intervals.

Patients should be frequently monitored for side effects, more so in the early initiation phase of therapy when they are much frequent. Side effects are usually self-limited and include hypotension (more common with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and ACEi/ ARBs), electrolyte imbalances, pedal edema (more common with CCBs) and renal dysfunction. Renal dysfunction and electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are frequent with ACEi and ARBs and need to be monitored periodically until the achievement of static levels of Cr, K, and Na.

For patients with severe side effects like symptomatic hyperkalemia or hyponatremia, syncope and acute kidney injury (AKI), treatment needs to be discontinued, and in-patient management is advised. Nephrologist and cardiologist opinions also need to be sought in such cases. Once the issues settle, treatment needs to be re-instituted gradually and cautiously with careful monitoring and frequent follow-ups.

Angioedema has been a potentially life-threatening side effect of ACEi and ARBs in susceptible individuals and warrants prompt discontinuation and is also a lifelong contra-indication for ACEi/ ARB usage.
