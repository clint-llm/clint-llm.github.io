Brain herniation syndromes are a medical emergency and require urgent assessment and intervention from a wide variety of clinical teams. These teams include emergency medicine, anesthetics, intensive care, trauma, orthopedics, and neurosurgery. Close monitoring of neurological status is required throughout the time course of their admission including neurological observations by nursing staff. (Level 2, 3 evidence)

If the patient survives the initial phase, then it is likely neurorehabilitation teams will be required. This is usually a multidisciplinary team approach and will include: physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, dieticians, and psychologists. Though survival is the primary goal, a good functional recovery indicated by a return to activities of daily living is considered equally as valuable.
