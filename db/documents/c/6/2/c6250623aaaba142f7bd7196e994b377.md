Differentials for LBBB include intra-ventricular conduction delay - which can result in similar ECG findings but often will not have an R wave in V6. A paced rhythm can often be confused with LBBB but again often does not have an R wave in V6 and pacer spikes are usually seen. An LBBB pattern with QRS duration less than 120 ms is called an incomplete LBBB. A ventricular rhythm (run of PVCs) without super-ventricular stimulation can appear very similar to a left bundle branch block and in certain uncommon situations would be indistinguishable from LBBB.
