Anaerobes are bacteria that do not require oxygen to live. Anaerobes usually fit into two groups based on their gram stain into gram-positive and gram-negative and into cocci and bacilli based on their morphology. Of these, notable pathogenic gram-negative bacillus-shaped strains are Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas. Bacteroides species are important clinical pathogens and are present in most anaerobic infections, with an associated mortality of approximately 19%.Bacteroides fragilis is an obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacillus. The human colon has the greatest population of bacteria in the body (over ten organisms per gram of wet weight), and the largest part of these organisms are anaerobes; of these, approximately 25% are species of Bacteroides.Bacteroides fragilis is part of the normal microbiota of the human colon. Disruption of the mucosal surface either by inflammation, trauma, or surgery and spread of Bacteroides fragilis to the bloodstream or surrounding tissues results in clinically significant infection.
