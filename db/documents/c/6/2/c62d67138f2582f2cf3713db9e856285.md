Whereas some hospitals have machines that offer continuous CT fluoroscopy that enables the radiologist to watch the needle while advancing it in real-time (while radiating their own hand), many do not.

**Patient and Room Set-Up**

All patients should be outfitted with the following (at a minimum):

- A monitor that can detect blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide waveforms

- A working intravenous (IV) line

- These are necessary because of (1) the rare but occasionally dramatic occurrence of vasovagal episodes that require immediate sedation or delivery of medications without interrupting the procedure or moving the patient, and (2) lung biopsy patients often have serious coexistent medical problems, such as heart disease, that may need emergency medication.

The following should be available:

- Oxygen

- Suction equipment

- Artificial airway and intubation equipment

- A bag valve mask

- A resuscitation cart

Other equipment for handling a pneumothorax should include the following:

- Needle for Seldinger or trocar technique of chest tube introduction

- Chest tubes with or without a guidewire (4 French is small enough to evacuate the air, while 14 French may be needed to evacuate thick blood); a valved tube is useful (one can be created with a stopcock)

- Heimlich valve for emergent treatment of tension pneumothorax

- Wall suction

- Chest drainage system for long-term treatment of pneumothorax/hydrothorax/hemothorax

- Connecting stopcocks and tubing

**Use of Intravenous Contrast**

For lesion localization, a non-enhanced CT alone is usually sufficient because the difference in density between the lung and nodule serves as natural contrast. Occasionally, intravenous contrast agent administration may be required during the procedure, such as to define vascular structures in the anticipated needle path or mediastinal structures.
