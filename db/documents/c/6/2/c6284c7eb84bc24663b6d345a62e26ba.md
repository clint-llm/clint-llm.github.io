Niacin (a combination of nicotinic acid and nicotinamide), a B vitamin (vitamin B3), is a pharmacotherapeutic agent that has been used since 1955, making it the oldest pleiotropic hypolipidemic agent.

Niacin has seen extensive use, alone or in combination, with statin medications (hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) in the reduction of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and lipoprotein levels. Moreover, niacin is the most potent agent used to increase plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

Niacin being such a pleiotropic agent still possesses properties that remain uncovered. Some other studied uses of niacin other than those stated above include the following.

- Arthritis

- Alzheimer disease

- Huntington disease

- Schizophrenia

- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

- Muscular atrophy

- hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease

- Parkinson disease

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- It also has therapeutic use in treating diabetic encephalopathy,Â malignant glioma, neurodegenerative diseases

- Circadian rhythm and metabolism regulation through sirtuins

- Intracellular calcium regulation
