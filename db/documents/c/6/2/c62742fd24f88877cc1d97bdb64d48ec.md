Oppositional defiant disorderÂ symptoms are commonly seen initially during preschool years and often precede symptoms of CD. In a large-scale study using retrospective age-of-onset reports, 92.4% of those who met ODD criteria also met criteria for at least one other mental disorder, including mood disorders (45.8%), anxiety disorders (62.3%), impulse control disorders (68.2%) and substance use disorders (47.2%).

ODD is a strong risk factor for the development of CD in boys, with atypical family structure being an important factor. In contrast, ODD does not increase the risk of later development of CD in girls. However, ODD does increase the risk of continued ODD symptoms, depression, and anxiety.
