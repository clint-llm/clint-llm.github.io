Abrasion is the superficial denudation of the epithelium due to scraping, impact, or pressure. While the management of abrasions is relatively simple, these can be extremely important medico-legally. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of abrasion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of abrasions.
- Summarize the medical management of abrasions.
- Identify the appropriate needs for screening and documentation on the presentation of abrasion that are medicolegally significant. 
- Review the importance of improving documentation and management among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients who have sustained abrasions.
