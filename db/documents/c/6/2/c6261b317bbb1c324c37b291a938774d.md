- Anemia is the most common hematological disorder and is one of the most common conditions seen in clinical practice.

- Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia, while anemia of chronic disease is the most common anemia in hospitalized patients.

- Anemia is not a diagnosis but a presentation of underlying diseases. Work up for the cause of anemia can unmask many of the underlying diseases, thereby helping to treat patients early and appropriately.

- Most of the anemias are easy to treat and thereby improve a person's productivity.

- Comprehensive history taking and physical examination are very important in diagnosing anemia.

- If early workup is unrevealing, appropriate consultation by a specialist is important for further workup and treatment.

- Encouraging patients to eat a healthy and balanced diet is important to prevent anemia due to nutritional deficiencies.

- Women of childbearing age are at increased risk of anemia due to pregnancies and menstrual bleeding and need close monitoring.
