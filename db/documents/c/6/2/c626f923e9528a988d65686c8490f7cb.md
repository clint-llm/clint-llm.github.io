Radionuclide cystography (RNC) is a diagnostic imaging examination to identify the ureters and bladder specific abnormalities. This procedure uses a radiopharmaceutical agent to image the ureters and bladder. RNC can be performed either through retrograde instillation of the radiopharmaceutical directly into the bladder via a catheter or administered intravenously, allowing excretion by the kidneys into the urinary collecting system. Images are acquired through the detection of photons emitted from the radiopharmaceutical with a gamma camera. RNC is most commonly performed to diagnose vesicoureteric reflux (VUR), which, if untreated, can result in renal damage, including chronic renal failure, recurrent infections, and hypertension.
