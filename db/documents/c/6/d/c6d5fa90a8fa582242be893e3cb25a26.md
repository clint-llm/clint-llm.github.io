A truly isolated fracture of the fibula, one that has no other associated ligamentous or other bony injuries, are quite rare. They are typically the result of a direct injury to the leg, usually a fall or direct blow or blunt trauma like a sports injury or motor vehicle accident. Gunshot wounds are another mechanism from which an isolated fibula fracture can be sustained.
