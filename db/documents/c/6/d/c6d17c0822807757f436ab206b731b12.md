Breathing regulation occurs by a dense network of bilateral, symmetrical neurons locatedÂ in the ventrolateral area of the medulla oblongata.

The hypothesis is that pre-Botzinger neurons generate respiratory oscillations from voltage-dependent Na channels activated at a subthreshold level.

The cerebral respiratory center is constantly accepting neural impulses from other CNS regions and centrifuges impulses from the periphery. Feedback impulses to the respiratory center classify into three categories: chemical, mechanical, and from higher cortical centers.
