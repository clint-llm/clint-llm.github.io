Bupivacaine is administered to patients by many healthcare professionals, including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, pain specialist, emergency department physician, and nurse practitioner. However, all interprofessional healthcare team members involved in administering and dispensing the drug must know its potential side effects and toxicity.

Resuscitative equipment must be in the room at the time of the injection, and surgical nurses must be familiar with the proper use of this equipment in an emergency. The most common reason for a complication is an injection of the drug into the artery or vein, which can result in adverse cardiac and CNS effects.

Pharmacists can be involved in preparing the agents and verifying proper dosing and administration, working with the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist. They can also assist in cases of toxicity with the needed drugs to address toxic states.

Bupivacaine use requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
