Socioeconomic factors, low-income status, unemployment, cultural and religious beliefs, false perceptions about vaccinations, educational status of mothers, premature birth, and parental absent-mindedness are some of the hindrances that affect the immunization status of an individual and, in turn increasing the likelihood of infection with a toxigenic strain of C. diphtheria. Certain health conditions, including dental caries, a heart condition, diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased risk for infection with a non-toxigenic strain of C. diphtheria. Among these, intravenous drug or alcohol abuse and homelessness are major risk factors for contracting the disease.

Strengthening public health measures to ensure adequate immunization in toddlers, the adult population, and travelers to an endemic region is necessary to control disease outbreaks. An effective monitoring strategy should be in place to detect outbreaks in vulnerable populations. In addition, patient education through counseling, mass media, and other measures are essential to break the perception about vaccination and improve compliance.
