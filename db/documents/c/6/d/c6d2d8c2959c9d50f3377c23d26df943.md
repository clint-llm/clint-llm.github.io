Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), for example, dalteparin, enoxaparin, among others, are anticoagulants. These drugs are used in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) on acute or elective admission to the hospital, and they are used in the treatment of deep vein thromboses (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of LMWH, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with conditions where this agent is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of various low molecular weight heparin agents.
- Summarize the indications for using LMWH agents.
- Review the adverse event profiles of various LMWH agents, summarizing the key differences.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients when using low molecular weight heparins.
