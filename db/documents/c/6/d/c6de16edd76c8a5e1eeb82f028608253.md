# Introduction

Plasma cells are differentiated B-lymphocyte white blood cells capable of secreting immunoglobulin or antibodies. These cells play a significant role in the adaptive immune response, namely, being the main cells responsible for humoral immunity. Without their presence, an individual is said to have agammaglobulinemia and is highly susceptible to recurrent infection. Here the hematopoietic lineage, structure, and function of plasma cells are reviewed, along with the clinical presentations arising from improper plasma cell growth and development.

# Function

Plasma cells develop from antigen-activated B lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, such as the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes, after antigenic stimulation. Blimp-1, IRF4, and XBP-1 transcription factors are known to be essential for the differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells.

The most immature blood cell of a plasma cell lineage is the plasmablast. Plasmablasts can proliferate and secrete small amounts of antibodies. The terminally differentiated or mature plasma cells are non-proliferating, are much larger than B cells, and can secrete large amounts of antibodies. During their lifespan of 2 to 3 days, they continuously synthesize and secrete antibodies with specificity for the antigen that stimulated the plasma cell precursor to proliferate and differentiate. Estimates are that a single plasma cell can secrete hundreds to thousands of antibody molecules per second, a remarkable measure of the power of the immune response for combating pathogens. Plasma cells, as antibody factories, are important contributors to humoral immunity.

Though the production and secretion of antibodies were long thought to be the sole functions of plasma cells, recent studies indicate plasma cell involvement in immune response regulation. Within this capacity, research has found plasma cells to inhibit the development of follicular T-helper cells.

# Histochemistry and Cytochemistry

All plasma cells, albeit normal or malignant, are distinguished by their expression of CD38 and CD138.

An additional noteworthy marker of plasma cells is CD79a. The protein plays a critical role in B-lymphocyte antigen signal transduction and overall B-lymphocyte development and stabilization.

# Microscopy, Light

Plasma cells vary in size from 14 to 20 micrometers. They are round-to-ovoid cells containing abundant deep blue cytoplasm with a pale perinuclear area corresponding to the Golgi apparatus. They have a round, eccentrically placed nucleus with coarse chromatin arranged in a clock face (art wheel) pattern.

# Microscopy, Electron

Electron microscopy reveals that the plasma cells contain an eccentric round nucleus with condensed chromatin and a well-developed nucleolus. The nuclear membrane-associated chromatin gives the nuclei of mature plasma cells a cartwheel appearance in histologic sections. The cytoplasm contains parallel arrays of rough endoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasmic fibrils, and numerous polymorphic mitochondria. The cytoplasm also contains a Golgi complex immediately adjacent to the nucleus. Intracytoplasmic inclusions of various types—elliptical, round, or needle-like crystalline—are present. A significant accumulation of immunoglobulins forms these inclusions.

# Clinical Significance

Deviation from proper plasma cell proliferation can lead to a number of clinical pathologies. These classify as plasma cell neoplasms and plasma cell immunodeficiency.

Plasma cell neoplasms are characteristically an aberrant proliferation of clonal plasma cells producing monoclonal, heavy-chain, class-switched immunoglobulin, referred to as M-protein.

**Plasma Cell Neoplasms**

**MGUS**

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, also known as MGUS, is the least severe manifestation of plasma cell neoplasm. MGUS classifies as a clonal population of plasma cells secreting immunoglobulin, though serum M-protein concentration does not exceed 3 g/dL.

Immunofixation studies of monoclonal proteins indicate that approximately 70% of MGUS cases are IgG, 15% are IgM, 12% are IgA, and 3% are biclonal.

**Smoldering Myeloma**

As plasma cells continue to proliferate aberrantly, an individual may progress beyond the criteria of MGUS, a stage defined clinically as smoldering myeloma. In contrast to MGUS, serum M-protein levels are equal to or greater than 3 g/dL, and clonal plasma cells comprise 10% to 59% of the bone marrow.

Similar to MGUS, the presence of criteria for smoldering myeloma manifests asymptomatically.

**Multiple Myeloma**

The most severe presentation of plasma cell neoplasm is that of multiple myeloma. Though similar to smoldering myeloma in having serum M-protein concentrations of at least 3 g/dL, multiple myeloma criteria require the presence of at least one additional characteristic. Such include the presence of one or more CRAB lesions, bone marrow clonal plasma cells exceeding 60%, a serum-free light chain ratio equal to or greater than 100, and at least one focal lesion detected in MRI.

Multiple myeloma represents approximately 10% of all hematopoietic neoplasms.

**Other Plasma Cell Neoplasms**

Amyloidosis is classified as the deposition of immunoglobulin light chain fibrils from clonal plasma cells, often of lambda composition. Such can occur independently or as sequelae of MGUS, smoldering myeloma, or multiple myeloma.

**Plasma Cell Deficiencies**

Counter to the preceding disorders, characterized by excessive plasma cells or their byproducts, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) results from a lack of adequate plasma cell numbers. The diagnosis of the disorder is established by reduced levels of IgG, IgA, and/or IgM.Haemophilus influenzae, MMR, varicella, and pneumococcus) should have consistent testing.

In addition to CVID, over 100 primary immunodeficiencies are attributable to improper B-lymphocyte development and/or function, including improper immunoglobulin production. X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is characterized by a mutant BTK gene (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), inhibiting pre-B cell formation.
