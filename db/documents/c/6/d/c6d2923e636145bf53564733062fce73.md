The annular ligament is a musculoskeletal structure and like the other ligaments throughout the body is derived from mesenchymal cells. The synovial membrane lining the space between the radial head and the annular ligament is also derived from mesenchymal cells. The annular ligament develops as a densification of the elbow joint capsule and becomes defined by week 12.
