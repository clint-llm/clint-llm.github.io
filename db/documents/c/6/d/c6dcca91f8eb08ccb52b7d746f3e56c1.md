Zellweger syndrome is caused by mutations in various genes required for peroxisome biogenesis. Mutations in at least 13 different PEX genes have been associated, and the PEX genes encode for proteins called peroxins (a peroxisome assembly protein). The most common mutations are PEX1 or PEX6 gene, which is seen in approximately 65 percent of patients.

Peroxisomal disorders are subdivided into 3 groups based on functional disturbances in peroxisome as follows:

- ZS, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsumâ€™s disease associated with generalized loss of peroxisome function

- Adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy (ALD/AMN) associated with a single enzymatic defect in peroxisome

- Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata associated with multiple enzymatic defects in peroxisome
