Hemoglobin A1c levels may appear falsely low in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Chronic inflammation may result in a shorter red blood cell life cycle resulting in a falsely normal hemoglobin A1c level. Relying on a hemoglobin A1c level will also miss individuals with impaired glucose tolerance that present with only abnormal postprandial glucose levels but normal fasting glucose levels. Hemoglobin A1c levels are not sensitive enough to screen for CFRD; however, it can be a useful tool to measure the response to treatment in CFRD. A high suspicion should be maintained for type 1 diabetes in combination with CF in any individual with CF who is experiencing hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and positive diabetes autoantibodies. These individuals should be treated as type 1 diabetes patients until proven otherwise.
