Pain is minimal after non-surgical rhinoplasty and pain medication is typically not required. Bleeding can be easily controlled with pressure, and bruising is uncommon though self-limiting if it does occur. In order to minimize edema and complications, however, the patient should avoid excessive manipulation of the nose, sleep with the head elevated, and avoid rigorous activity for the first 2-3 days. Pre-procedural Arnica montana and/or Bromelain may help lessen bruising and swelling.
