All types of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia originate from the placenta. Hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinoma emerge from villous trophoblast, while placental-site trophoblastic tumors arise from the interstitial trophoblast. First-trimester complete moles show aberrant budding villous structure with trophoblast hyperplasia, crumpled villous blood vessels, and stromal karyorrhectic debris. On the other hand, early partial moles show patchy villous hydrops, dispersed abnormally-shaped erratic villi, patchy trophoblast hyperplasia, and trophoblastic pseudo inclusions.

Morphological differentiation of non-molar miscarriage from a partial hydatidiform mole can be complicated, as villous dysmorphism can present without the characteristic trophoblast hyperplasia that is seen in the partial mole. Furthermore, ploidy analysis shown by in-situ hybridization or flow cytometry can differentiate diploid from triploid conceptions but can not make a distinction between a complete mole and diploid non-molar miscarriage, or molar and non-molar triploidy, which indicate the need of molecular investigations.

Choriocarcinomas are malignant HCG-releasing epithelial tumors that have central necrosis and a characteristic biphasic structure. Intraplacental choriocarcinoma can also happen and is probably the one responsible for metastatic disease occurring after term pregnancies. The majority of neonatal choriocarcinoma arises from metastatic spread from intraplacental choriocarcinoma.

Placental-site trophoblastic tumors are malignant tumors, and they form uterine lesions with less hemorrhage and necrosis and lower HCG concentrations than choriocarcinoma.

Molar pregnancy could infrequently coexist with a normal pregnancy. The diagnosis is usually made through an ultrasound. Despite the high risk of spontaneous abortion, 40 to 60% of the cases result in live births. The risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasm in coexisting molar and normal pregnancy compared to a singleton molar pregnancy increases from 15 to 20% to 27 to 46%, respectively. Pregnancy can proceed if there are no complications, and there are normal genetic and ultrasound findings.
