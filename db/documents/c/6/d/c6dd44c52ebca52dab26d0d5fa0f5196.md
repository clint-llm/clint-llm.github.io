Neurogenesis begins around the third week of intrauterine life with primary neurulation. During this time, the notochord, via molecular signaling, induces the overlying ectoderm to differentiate and become the neural plate.

At the end of the fourth week of development, the fusion of neural folds and closure of the cranial and caudal neuropores completes neural tube closure and primary neurulation. The primary brain vesicles develop from the cranial end of the neural tube, whereas the spinal cord develops from the caudal end. Dorsal thickening of the mantle layer of the caudal neural tube forms the alar plate from which the grey matter structures of the dorsal spinal horns, including the SGR, are embryologically derived.
