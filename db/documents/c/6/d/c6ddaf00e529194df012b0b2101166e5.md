All neonates have reduced vitamin K at birth. The first reported classic VKDB was in 1894 as a bleeding disorder that occurred on day 2 or 3 of life. In combination with sepsis-induced bleeding, the incidence was 600/100,000 infants with a 62% fatality rate. Late VKDB occurs in 4.4 to 72 infants per 100,000 births with an increased risk in exclusively breastfed infants and the highest incidence occurring in Asian populations. Early VKDB has been associated with mothers on anticonvulsants or other vitamin K interfering substances, and incidence without vitamin K supplementation has been reported as high as 12%. The mortality rate for late VKDB is 20-50%. Late VKDB also has a significant neurologic morbidity rate. Without Vitamin K supplementation, the current day incidence of classic VKDB is estimated to be 0.25-1.7%.

VKCFD is extremely rare with less than 30 cases worldwide and affects males and females equally.

In normal healthy adults, 8-31% have vitamin K deficiency. However, it is very rare to result in clinically significant bleeding. Cases are limited to individuals with malabsorption syndromes and those treated with drugs that interfere with vitamin K metabolism.
