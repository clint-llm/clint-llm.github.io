Aortic dissection presents with severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back. It is one of the complications of TAA because of increased stress and aortic wall weakness. A tear develops in the intima leading to the creation of true and false lumens. Patients can also present with hypotension, nausea, shortness of breath with a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arm.

Thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm is an aortic rupture contained by the thin layer of adventitia. They develop following trauma or due to erosion of an atherosclerotic ulcerated plaque. Patients can present with chest pain or deficits due to embolization. CT scanning and angiography can visualize this anomaly. Surgical repair is necessary to prevent aortic rupture.

Aortic intramural hematoma is a hematoma located in the medial layer of the aorta. Usually, no intimal tears are present. They can occur because of a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer or by thrombosis of the false lumen after a dissection. Surgical correction is required to restore the architecture of the aortic wall as the hematoma is also a precursor for aortic dissection.
