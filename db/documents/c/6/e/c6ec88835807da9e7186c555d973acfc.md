Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma (EPA), also known as Dabska tumor (DT) and papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), represents a borderline entity between hemangioma and angiosarcoma. DT has an overall favorable prognosis; however, there is potential for local recurrence and low-grade metastasis. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of endovascular papillary angioendothelioma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of endovascular papillary angioendothelioma.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of endovascular papillary angioendothelioma.
- Outline the management options for patients with endovascular papillary angioendothelioma.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients with endovascular papillary angioendothelioma.
