A large primary tumor, the presence of nodal or distant metastases, male sex, and HIV positivity are poor prognostic factors.

Surveillance following definitive treatment involves a DRE between 8 and 12 weeks after completion of chemoradiation. Patients then get classified according to whether they have a complete response, partial response, or progressive disease. If they have persistent disease at that timeÂ without progression, patients should be managed with close follow up to determine if further regression occurs. Persistent disease may continue to regress even at 26 weeks from the start of treatment, thus avoiding APR in these patients
