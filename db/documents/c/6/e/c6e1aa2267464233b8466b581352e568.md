Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is a disease process that results in acute hypoxia secondary to a rapid deterioration in respiratory status. The disease process has multiple etiologies, all of which require prompt recognition and intervention. This activity describes the evaluation and management of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiologies of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Outline the epidemiology of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Describe the typical history of a patient with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
