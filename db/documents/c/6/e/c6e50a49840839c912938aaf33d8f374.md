Findings that may be associated with the history and physical in patients with Lown-Ganong-Levine are rather scarce. Occasionally, while taking a history, some patients will note occasional palpitations or endorse a prior history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or other atrial arrhythmias. On physical exam, again, findings are limited in LGL. During cardiac auscultation or palpating pulses, the examiner could potentially sense the irregular rhythm with a change of underlying rhythm. The diagnosis of LGL requires the use of a resting EKG, where these patients typically display a pattern of short PR interval but normal QRS complex duration.
