The ideal alloplastic implant for augmentation should have the following characteristics:

- Easily shaped and secured

- Biologically inert

- Noncarcinogenic

- Noninflammatory

- Nonallergenic

- Easily available

- Maintain its desired form and consistency in situ

- Resistant to mechanical strain

- Integrate into the surrounding tissue

The most common alloplastic implant materials used for chin augmentation consist of:

- Silastic (solid silicone) - nonallergenic, minimally reactive, nonporous (i.e., does not allow for fibrovascular ingrowth) and easily manipulated; causes a local inflammatory response resulting in the formation of a surrounding fibrous capsule; exist in a variety of shapes, sizes (small, medium, large), and styles (narrow button style, extended with tapering lateral wings) and come with sizers as well to help gauge the three-dimensional contouring change that will occur.

- High-density porous polyethylene - nonallergenic and nonabsorbable implant with large pores (150 micrometers) which allows fibrovascular ingrowth of surrounding tissues; difficult to contour; difficult to remove

- Meshed materials such as polyamide - flexible material that can be easily shaped and manipulated; elicits a moderate foreign body reaction; allows ingrowth of fibrous tissue

- NOTE: Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), a once commonly used biomaterial, is now off the legal market in most locales

**Preoperatively**

- Standard photography capturing straight, oblique, and lateral/profile views

- Preoperative antibiotics (e.g., weight-based cefazolin)

- Alcohol solution or pad (cleanse skin before injection and marking landmarks and proposed incisions)

- Surgical marker (marking planned incision sites)

- Local anesthesia (such as lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1 to 100,000; maximal dosage of lidocaine with epinephrine is 7 mg/kg)

- Topical antiseptic, such as povidone-iodine

**Intraoperatively**

- Variety of curved dissectors and periosteal elevators

- Scalpel (e.g., #15 blade)

- Forceps (with teeth for atraumatic soft tissue handling)

- Electrocoagulation/electrocautery device

- Skin hooks and/or small retractors

- Suture (e.g., 4-0 absorbable for deep layers, and 5-0 nonabsorbable for skin)

- Antibiotic-impregnated solution for soaking the implant and irrigating the wound

**Postoperatively**

- Antibiotic ointment

- Chin dressing materials (non-stick dressing, adhesive tapes)
