**Tests for Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction**

Jones 1 and Jones 2 tests are used to determine if there is blockage of the nasolacrimal system as has been described elsewhere. The Jones 2 test with irrigation of the lacrimal system is especially helpful in determining the site of the obstruction. On rare occasions, a dacryocystogram may be needed, especially in the presence of fistulas, iatrogenic trauma, or suspected lacrimal sac tumors.

**Preoperative Clinical Examination**

- Alternative causes for epiphora, such as evaporative dry eye, reflex tearing, eyelid malposition, and punctal stenosis, must be excluded.

- The eyelids should be examined for malposition and evidence of Meibomian gland dysfunction.

- The punctum is inspected for size and location, specifically as to whether it is in the tear lake.

- Examine for the absence of puncta and any fistulae or accessory puncta, especially so in all children

- The cornea should be examined for punctate epithelial staining, tear film quality, tear break up time, epithelial defects, and infiltrate/keratitis.

- The fluorescein dye disappearance test should be evaluated. This is a physiological test of tear flow.

- The nasolacrimal sac area should be inspected for the presence of swelling or a mucocele. Any swelling above the medial canthal tendon is atypical and may represent malignancy of the sac mucosa or other pathology. This should be investigated with imaging prior to proceeding to DCR.

- Digital pressure is applied to the sac area, and the punctum is observed for any mucoid reflux indicative of a mucocele.

**Diagnostic Irrigation of the Lacrimal System**

A diagnostic syringing of the nasolacrimal system consists of the following steps:

- Anesthetize the conjunctiva with oxybuprocaine or tetracaine.

- If the punctum is stenosed or very small, gentle dilation with a punctal dilator may be required.

- Using a lacrimal cannula on a saline-filled syringe (2 ml or 3 ml), place the cannula through the lower punctum and into the mid canalicular area. Syringe and observe for:

- Passage of saline into the nose (should be graded as a percentage)
- Reflux via the lower punctum
- Reflux via the upper punctum
- Quality of reflux, e.g., mucoid or clear
- The ease of syringing.
- The pressure needed to irrigate: this is known as the "educated finger" that the examiner acquires over time.

- Advance the cannula into the sac. Determine whether the cannula truly is in the sac by feeling for a hard stop. A soft stop is indicative of a distal canalicular obstruction or, more commonly, a normal kinking of the distal common canaliculus, preventing the cannula passing into the sac.

- Once the cannula is within the sac, withdraw slightly to avoid abutting the wall of the sac and syringe again. Observe the same features as described in step 3.

- If there truly is a soft stop, syringing should be repeated via the upper punctum.

- Repeat on the opposite side.

**Diagnostic Nasoendoscopy**

Nasoendoscopy must be included in the preoperative workup. This is essential when an endonasal DCR technique is being considered, but also important even if an external DCR is planned. A decongestant plus anesthetic spray (oxymetazoline and lidocaine) gives the best decongestion and anesthesia in nasal endoscopy.

A 30 degree, 2.7 mm slim nasoendoscope is introduced into the nose.

The anterior nose is observed for polyps or other abnormalities. The endoscope is then advanced, and the following observations are made:

- Is the septum straight, or does it deviate? Deviation towards the operative side may make access difficult and require a septoplasty.

- Is the mucosa healthy?

- Can the middle turbinate be identified?

- Is there sufficient space to perform endoscopic DCR?

- Are there any other abnormalities that may hinder surgery?

**The Pediatric Patient**

In the pediatric patient, most of the above investigations cannot be performed while the patient is awake. A thorough history from the child's caregiver is often diagnostic. The eyelids and periocular area should be inspected for mattering on the lashes and signs of excoriation secondary due to epiphora. The level of the tear film is observed and compared to the other side: a high tear film is indicative of NLDO. Sometimes a fluorescein dye disappearance test can be performed. For this, one drop of fluorescein is instilled into the eye, and its disappearance from the ocular surface is observed over the following minutes. It should always be compared to the contralateral eye.

All findings should be documented, and the patient counseled appropriately regarding their surgery. Informed consent must be obtained.

**Evaluating the Patient for****External vs. Endoscopic DCR**

To effectively and permanently cure troublesome epiphora, a large fistula between the lacrimal sac and the nose is required. This can be achieved via the external and endonasal approach, with high success rates. The time taken for a DCR procedure varies with the experience of the surgeon. While less experienced surgeons take longer to perform an endoscopic DCR (95.7 ± 27.3 minutes), compared to an external approach, more experienced surgeons have comparable operating times (35 minutes).

**Considerations for an External DCR**

- In the elderly patient, unfit for general anesthesia, an external DCR is an ideal option as it can be performed with minimal sedation under local anesthesia. Any intraoperative bleeding can be controlled easily. While some centers perform endoscopic DCR under sedation, we do not advocate this option, as sedation may dampen the gag reflex, increasing the risk for pulmonary aspiration.

- Biopsy of the lacrimal sac, when needed, is perhaps somewhat easier with the external approach. Furthermore, biopsies can be performed prior to breaching bone, thus reducing the risk of spreading potential malignancy.

- In patients with previous facial fractures or unusual anatomy, the external approach may make surgery easier and more predictable.

- Where a septoplasty is required for adequate access to perform successful endonasal-approach DCR, an external approach may be preferred to avoid the need for a septoplasty.

- In patients with proximal or mid canalicular stenosis, external DCR allows for retrograde intubation.

**Considerations for an Endoscopic DCR**

Endoscopic DCR is favored for most clinical situations, as the rate of success is as high as external DCR.

Several indications for endoscopic DCR include:

- Primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction.

- Secondary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- Persistent congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- Functional nasolacrimal duct obstruction

- Acute dacryocystitis, unresponsive to medical treatment

- Chronic dacryocystitis

- In the setting of acute dacryocystitis, endoscopic DCR is particularly useful, as it drains an anaerobic abscess cavity into an aerated space, creating excellent drainage without involving other tissue planes and giving long term relief from epiphora.

**Contraindications**

- Other causes for epiphora, such as evaporative dry eye, must be excluded before DCR surgery.

- In the setting of previous cutaneous malignancy of the medial canthus, DCR surgery should only be carefully considered after follow-up confirms no suspicion of recurrence.

- Breaching the bony barrier (and skin in the setting of external DCR) may potentially spread tumors in the setting of recurrent disease.

- Prior radiotherapy in the medial canthal region may reduce vascularity and healing in this area.

**Anesthesia**

**General Considerations**

Bleeding, when operating in a confined space such as during endoscopic or even external DCR, can obscure the surgical view and make a procedure much more difficult. Surgical bleeding can be categorized into arterial, venous, and capillary bleeding. Especially when performing surgery under general anesthesia, the anesthetist is essential. The anesthetist may induce controlled hypotension to reduce intraoperative bleeding; This is defined as a reduction of the systolic blood pressure to 80 to 90mmHg or a 30% reduction baseline mean arterial pressure. As to what is safe, controlled hypotension, much discussion exists and depends on the patient's general health and cardiovascular status. Especially for venous and capillary bleeding, heart rate is an important variable. When performing endoscopic DCR in children, it is essential to recall that children require their faster heart rate to maintain perfusion and cardiac output. Therefore, heart rate should not be reduced in children and may, in turn, lead to more intraoperative bleeding.

Both external and endoscopic DCR can be performed on anticoagulated patients, but the cessation of anticoagulation must be individualized depending on patient risk factors.

All non-essential supplements that may contribute to bleeding including garlic, ginkgo bilbo, turmeric, ginger, ginseng, fish oil and krill oil, evening primrose, and St John's wort should be stopped several weeks pre-operatively.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to increase the risk of perioperative hemorrhage.

**Perioperative Considerations**

The patient should be placed in a reverse-Trendelenburg position of approximately 10 to 15 degrees to increase venous return to the heart and reduce intraoperative bleeding.

Adjunct medications such as tranexamic acid have a beneficial effect on intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. The authors give tranexamic acid routinely during endoscopic DCR surgery.

Postoperatively, most patients are comfortable if appropriate intraoperative and local anesthesia has been administered. Acetaminophen is effective in treating postoperative pain post-DCR surgery in most patients. It reduces the need for opioid analgesia, has a favorable side effect profile, and does not affect bleeding. Opioid analgesia is rarely if at all necessary. Antiemetics tend to be rarely necessary with total intravenous anesthesia but should be available, to avoid precipitating bleeding.

**External DCR**

External DCR can be performed under general anesthesia (GA) or local anesthesia (LA) with some sedation. It is essential to remember that some blood will accumulate in the patient's nasopharynx, and airway protection (either self or via an endotracheal tube with cuff or throat pack) is important to prevent aspiration. If general anesthesia is used, it is useful for the blood pressure to remain in the slightly hypotensive range, as this aids hemostasis. For local anesthesia of the nasal mucosa, oxymetazoline spray, Moffett's solution, or cocaine paste/drops may be used. These help to both decongest and aid with hemostasis. A useful technique is to soak neurosurgical patties or ribbon gauze and gently pack the nose, including the middle meatus, above the middle turbinate, anterior to the middle turbinate, and on the nasal septum under direct visualization.

For local anesthesia of the skin, any product such as bupivacaine 0.5% with 1:200 000 epinephrine can be used. We like to perform a medial peri-bulbar block, along with infraorbital nerve block and subcutaneous injection for adequate analgesia. Care should be taken to not pierce the angular vein during LA injection, to avoid hematoma formation. Once the nasal mucosa is visible intraoperatively, further LA can be injected under direct visualization to provide analgesia and hemostasis.

**Endoscopic DCR**

The authors perform endoscopic DCR under general anesthesia, although other surgeons use sedation anesthesia. Anesthetic personnel should be aware of the possible accumulation of blood in the nasopharynx, and appropriate precautions should be implemented to avoid aspiration. The nasal mucosa requires decongestion for adequate visualization and should be prepared as described above. Further, hemostasis and analgesia are achieved with injection of 2 ml of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine, using a dental syringe above and anterior to the middle turbinate under endoscopic visualization as part of the procedure.

**Personnel**

Only surgeons adequately trained in the relevant procedure, and with an understanding of the anatomy should attempt DCR surgery. A competent scrub nurse trained in the set up of endoscopic equipment is invaluable, and a good anesthetist can contribute considerably to a relatively bloodless surgical field.
