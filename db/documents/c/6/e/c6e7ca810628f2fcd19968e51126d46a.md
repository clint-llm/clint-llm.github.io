Healthcare professionals should monitor patients for antimuscarinic effects on the cardiac and central nervous systems. These effects include tachycardia, palpitations, prolonged QT intervals (more common in females), hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, and more. This vigilance is vital for elderly patients taking multiple medications and who are at risk for drug-to-drug interactions.

Patients should be explained the most common adverse side effects, such as dizziness, after administration of tolterodine, as it can put them at risk if they are about to perform a potentially dangerous task.
