- Spinal intramedullary tumors such as hemangioblastoma, ependymoma, gliomas: Tumors may secrete exudative fluid (high in protein content) causing micro-cysts that can eventually coalesce. Most of these intramedullary tumors will enhance on contrast MRI (a syrinx does not enhance on contrast MRI). However, a true syrinx can occur within a tumor)

- Spinal intramedullary cysts

- Myelomalacia

- Arachnoid cysts

- Glio-ependymal cysts

- Residual central spinal canal: The central canal of the spinal cord involutes with age. A persistent central canal is NOT an anomaly.
