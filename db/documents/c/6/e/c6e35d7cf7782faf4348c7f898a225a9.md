There are no known adverse effects of excessive intake of dietary vitamin K. Phytonadione is a synthetic derivative of vitamin K1 and is available as an oral tablet or injectable emulsion that is available for administration by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. Reports of anaphylactoid reactions are rare but are an estimated incidence of 3/10,000 doses, and associations point to the intravenous route in more severe cases. The emulsifying agents, specifically polyoxyethylated castor oil, have been implicated as the cause of the anaphylactoid reaction in most cases.
