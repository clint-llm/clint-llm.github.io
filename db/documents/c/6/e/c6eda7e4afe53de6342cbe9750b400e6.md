Sinus arrhythmia is a common incidental finding on routine EKG. It is most prevalent in young, healthy patients and is a prognostic indicator of good cardiac health. It decreases in prevalence in older patients and those with multiple comorbid conditions, including diabetes and heart failure. Typically asymptomatic, patients rarely require evaluation by a cardiologist or additional treatment.
