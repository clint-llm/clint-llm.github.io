PEDs, while uncommon, can have disastrous consequences if not treated. Avoiding these requires timely, stringent management, good adherence to therapy, and close monitoring. They are frequently resistant to standard treatment regimens causing the disease to progress and necessitating more aggressive treatment with frequent follow-up visits. A step-by-step management algorithm and newer interventions can help with re-epithelialization in suchÂ patients. Given that PEDs treated earlier heal faster, it may be prudent to consider prophylactic treatment and a more aggressive approach at the outset in certain at-risk eyes.
