**Trichoscopy**: Hair examination using trichoscopy may provide useful information for the correct diagnosis by differentiating pseudonits from nits.

**Direct microscopic examination (DME)**: DME of the crushed nodules under 10% KOH shows branched hyphae (4 to 8 microns) held together by a cement-like substance. The dematiaceous filamentous hyphae appear as chains of stout thick-walled cells resembling arthrospores. Visualization enhancement can be via lactophenol cotton blue and other colored dyes.

**Fungal Culture**: The culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) medium at room temperature shows a smooth greenish-black colony with a raised and cerebriform center. The reverse side of the colonies is blackish. While performing the culture, it is noteworthy that cycloheximide does not inhibit this fungus.

The microscopic examination of the colonies shows round, dark brown, globus ascus with ascospores.
