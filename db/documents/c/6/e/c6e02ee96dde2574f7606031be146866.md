During “Tet spells” or if the patients develop heart failure, they can present with signs and symptoms of respiratory distress, cyanosis, failure to thrive, making another diagnosis a plausible cause, such as bronchiolitis, pneumonia (viral/bacterial), pneumothorax, or severe pulmonic or aortic stenosis. Other cardiac malformations that can cause similar symptoms are those causing right-to-left shunt, including complete (d-) transposition of the great arteries with pulmonary stenosis; double outlet right ventricle, including Taussig-Bing anomaly; tricuspid atresia; Ebstein anomaly; and pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. Causes of the bi-directional shunt that can also have similar symptoms are total anomalous pulmonary venous return, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and single ventricle and truncus arteriosus.
