The prognosis of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is generally favorable, with most patients returning to their baseline thyroid state with the time of recovery varying.Â Thyroid function will return to normal within weeks or months, and patients are advised to follow up with their physicians. A small percentage of patients, however, could suffer permanent sequelae from iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, and that is why most patients will need to be followed closely and re-evaluated with repeat thyroid function tests.
