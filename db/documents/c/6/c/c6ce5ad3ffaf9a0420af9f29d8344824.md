In the technique of SFIOL, the optic of the IOL is placed in the posterior chamber. At the same time, the haptic is fixed to the sclera approximately 1.5Â to 2 mm from the limbus, which is the external landmark for the ciliary sulcus. Placement of IOL in the sulcus region is considered safer for the corneal endothelium and iris.
