The prognosis for the eradication of body lice infestation is very good if patients are provided with regular access to showering and at least weekly access to laundered clothing and bedding.

Significant morbidity and mortality are associated with louse-borne diseases but can be reduced substantially with early recognition and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Epidemic typhus can cause vasculitis leading to limb ischemia, gangrene, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and multiorgan failure. Mortality ranges from 20% to 40% in untreated patients but decreases to 3% to 4% with appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Louse-borne, relapsing fever mortality rate is approximately 40% if untreated, while the mortality rate with treatment drops to around 4%.

Trench fever, caused by B.Â quintana, tends to be self-limited in immunocompetent people but can result in the development of endocarditis, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality.
