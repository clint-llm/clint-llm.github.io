There should be high suspicion for Holt-Oram syndrome in individuals who present with a family history and/or the following malformations:

- Upper-limb malformation

- Congenital heart malformation

- Cardiac conduction disease

- Family history of a relative with congenital heart defects

Upper-limb malformations can involve the carpal bones, thenar bones, and radial bones. These abnormalities may be unilateral or bilateral and symmetric or asymmetric. Most cases are unilateral and affect the left side.

Congenital heart malformations are present in 75% of individuals with Holt-Oram syndrome, most commonly ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD). The septal defects may be mild or can be more severe and lead to further problems such as pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, or infective endocarditis.

Individuals with Holt-Oram syndrome are also at an increased risk for cardiac conduction abnormalities. These may manifest at birth as sinus bradycardia or first-degree atrioventricular block and can progress to complete heart block without warning. Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, are also seen.
