The vagina has multiple functions, including

- Menstruation- as a canal for menstrual fluid and tissue to leave the uterine cavity

- Immune defense- protection against harmful pathogens via acidic pH, local flora, and chemical signaling

- Reproduction functions- as the receptacle for sperm and canal for parturition

- Sexual functions - for female arousal response and sexual pleasure
