A complete osteopathic structural exam can reveal tissue texture changes in body areas related to specific visceral structures. Identification of the regions of greatest restriction during a structural exam, along with recognition of relevant TART findings, suggest somatic dysfunction and warrant further evaluation.

An important diagnostic aid related to viscerosomatic reflexes and specific to osteopathic medicine is the identification of Chapman’s points. Chapman’s points are small, tender, palpable fascial congestions deep to the subcutaneous tissue. While their exact mechanism is not completely understood, they appear to represent the somatic manifestation of a visceral dysfunction.
