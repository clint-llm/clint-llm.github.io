In general, the patient's BUN, electrolytes, serum creatinine, and blood pressure require routine monitoring.

If captopril is initiated in patients with impaired renal function and/or collagen vascular disease, the complete blood count with differential should be evaluated before starting treatment and at two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically after that.

All patients treated with captopril receive counsel to report any signs of infection, including sore throat or fever. Patients with heart failure should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of captopril is titrated, especially in patients with preexisting hypotension, hyponatremia, diabetes, azotemia, or those taking potassium supplements due to the potential for excessive hypotension, arrhythmia and conduction defects.

According to the latest hypertension guidelines, patients with or without CVD or increased ASVD risk should maintain a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg while on therapy. On the other hand, according to the diabetes guidelines, adult patients (18 to 65 years) with both diabetes and hypertension have a goal blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg.
