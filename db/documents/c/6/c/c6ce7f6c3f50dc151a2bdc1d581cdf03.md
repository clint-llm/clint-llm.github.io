Netarsudil ophthalmic solution (0.02%) is instilled in one drop into the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. Netarsudil may be used with other eye drops to lower intraocular pressure. If the patient is using more than one ophthalmic medication, they should be instructed to wait at least five minutes between the application of each medication. Clinicians should direct the patient to remove contact lenses before instilling netarsudil solution and wait for fifteen minutes post-administration before reinserting the contact lenses. Strict aseptic precautions are necessary to minimize contamination of the dropper tip to avoid the risk of bacterial keratitis.

Nasolacrimal punctual occlusion is a beneficial technique to reduce side effects by decreasing systemic absorption of the netarsudil drops. The patient should lie down for 3 minutes or longer to ensure efficacy. This technique would reduce the amount of netarsudil solution entering the nose. The punctual occlusion also increases the contact time of netarsudil with the eyes to ensure maximum efficacy with a single dose.
