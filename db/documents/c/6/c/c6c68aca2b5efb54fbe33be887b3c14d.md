The complement system is a double-edged sword. While it acts as a host defense system, it also has the potential to cause immune and inflammatory diseases due to its inflammatory mediators, which can turn this defensive system into an attacking one for its host.****These host-offensive actions become more pronounced with age and become exacerbated by a variety of genetic factors and autoimmune responses. Several complement components are discovered and numbered according to the order of discovery. Various aspects and functions of the complement system and its role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases have been the topic of research. One of the most important reasons for tissue insults and end-organ damage in autoimmune diseases is the excessive activation of the complement pathway.

Paradoxically, deficiencies of specific components of complement pathways also result in manifestations of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
