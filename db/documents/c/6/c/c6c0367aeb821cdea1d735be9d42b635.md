The microorganism causing Q fever is Coxiella burnetii, a gram-negative pleomorphic intracellular coccobacillus, phylogenetically related to Legionella. It can survive in the low pH of the host cell, which is also essential for its survival. It transforms into a spore-like form to survive in the rigid external environment for long periods. It undergoes two types of phase variation in response to its environmental changes. First is a virulent phase seen in lab animals and nature, associated with a delayed IgG response. The second is an avirulent phase (via alterations in capsular lipopolysaccharide) seen in culture media after repeated passage.
