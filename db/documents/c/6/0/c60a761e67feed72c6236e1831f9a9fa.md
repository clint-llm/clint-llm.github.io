The decision regarding the diagnosis and management of ischemic stroke is made with an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department provider, nurse practitioner, neurologist, and radiologist. The current guidelines recommend intravenous alteplase within the first 4.5 hours after the onset of symptoms.

A review of the exclusion criteria for thrombolytics should be performed before administering alteplase. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis include active internal bleeding, recent intracranial surgery or serious head trauma, intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding, bleeding diathesis, severe uncontrolled hypertension, current intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a history of a recent stroke.

The prognosis for patients treated with alteplase is good, but for those who do not receive thrombolytic medication, the outcomes are guarded.
