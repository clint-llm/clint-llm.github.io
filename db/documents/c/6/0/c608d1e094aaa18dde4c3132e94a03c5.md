Treatment of both IH and CH is supportive and aims to address potential complications, as both lesions generally resolve without intervention. Treatment is indicated in cases where complications are present.

Historically for IH, corticosteroids were the treatment of choice. In the case of cutaneous IH causing either disfigurement or interfering with vision, oral propranolol has become the treatment of choice. The exact mechanism is not understood but is theorized to regulate the VEGF pathway implicated in the lesionâ€™s development.

Surgical resection and embolization of IHH are reserved for cases of severe complications, including high output heart failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, and respiratory failure. Complications of surgical resection include bleeding, while embolization may lead to hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis, and sepsis. Infants with diffuse IHH with hypothyroidism will require thyroid replacement.

In congenital hemangioma, no medical therapy has been noted to induce regression of the lesion. Corticosteroids have been trialed in the past without success. Surgical resection or embolization may rarely be indicated in the setting of active bleeding or severe heart failure.

In both cases, serial ultrasounds should be performed to document regression. IH grows rapidly in early infancy, typically reaches peak size by nine months, and is expected to regress by 80% by age 4, whereas RICH is expected to regress completely by 12 to 14 months.
