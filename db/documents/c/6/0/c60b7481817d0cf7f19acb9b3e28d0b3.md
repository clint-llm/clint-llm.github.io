Patient education is crucial in getting patients to understand both the short- and long-term risks of using MDMA. Many users incorrectly perceive MDMA to be a safe drug with few adverse effects. The truth is that tolerance develops rapidly, and those who respond by ingesting larger doses are at risk for complications that include sympathetic hyperactivity, potentially resulting in hyperthermia, arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability.

Patients must also understand the long-term psychiatric implications that accompany regular use. There are reports of depression, paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia lasting years following cessation of MDMA use. Additionally, research shows correlations between impaired concentration and memory and using MDMA.
