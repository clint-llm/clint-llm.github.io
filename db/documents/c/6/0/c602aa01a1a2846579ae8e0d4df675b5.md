Through recent uses of transmission electron microscopy, ion-milled samples of cortical bone have demonstrated polycrystalline mineral structures enshrouding the collagen fibrils. Approximately 80% of the minerals, composed of hydroxyapatite juxtaposed with type 1 collagen, are outside the fibrils. The remaining amount of minerals that resides inside the fibrils are shown to be in the gap zones. These gap zones are between the C and N terminals of the collinear collagen proteins in the fibrils. Their arrangement is as crystals that are not as large as those outside the fibrils.

Electron tomography is also an alternative that utilizes bright-field images to build 3D models. In tissue samples where the mass thickness is dominant, such as in bone, the lattice planes from the crystals produce Bragg diffractions that lead to visualizations of wavering thicknesses. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging, or Z-contrast imaging, is, likewise, another way of conceptualizing tomographic images of osseous tissue and is very useful in understanding the 3D relationship amongst the different biochemical systems at play.
