The nurse has a crucial role in assisting the clinician before the test by preparing the patient. During the test, she assists the clinician by holding the light source and helps the clinician observe the changes in the opposite pupil. After the test, the nurse alerts the clinician, if any untoward changes in the condition of the patient. The nurse confirms that the patient is fully informed about his care plan and gives the patient all the necessary contact details.
