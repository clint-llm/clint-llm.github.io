Coronary artery flow depends on the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system activation will increase the effects of catecholamines, which will induce vasoconstriction and further decrease the blood flow. It is thought that coronary artery spasm can develop if there is unopposed alpha constriction.

Microembolization typically has associations with coronary artery disease with emboli originating from coronary plaques and obstructing the small vessels and distal circulation.
