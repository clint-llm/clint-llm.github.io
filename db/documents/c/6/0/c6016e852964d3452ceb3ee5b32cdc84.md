The average prevalence of tardive dyskinesia is estimated at least 20% of all patients treated with first-generation neuroleptics. However, other medications responsible for tardive dyskinesia have been less studied, and published data indicate a prevalence ranging from 1% to 10%. Women risk developing tardive dyskinesia more than men, especially in middle-aged to senior patients. Post-menopausal women have incidence rates as high as 30% after almost a year of exposure to antipsychotic medications suggesting estrogen may have an antioxidant effect protecting against tardive dyskinesia. Elderly patients are more likely to develop tardive dyskinesia due to age-related changes in the brain and body. Several studies indicate African Americans are more likely to develop tardive dyskinesia after long-term exposure to dopamine-blocking agents than White-race individuals.

Other factors increasing tardive dyskinesia diathesis include the duration of exposure to the neuroleptic agent, the manifestation of EPS, and using first-generation antipsychotics--instead of second-generation antipsychotics. Of note, the long-term use of anticholinergic medications may increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia.
