Complete excision with preservation of the cranial nerve function should be the goal of the management of epidermoid tumors. Total removal may not be possible without inducing severe deficits; therefore, subtotal resection is acceptable in most cases. Neurophysiological monitoring aids in preventing cranial nerve and brainstem injury. The extent of resection is determined by the tumor adhesion to surrounding structures and by the pattern of extension. Tumors with extensive supratentorial invasion who undergo a suboccipital approach, usually have an incomplete resection even if the tentorium is opened.

Supratentorial located tumors are usually excised by the pterional or frontotemporal approach, mesencephalic located tumors by either a supratentorial posterior interhemispheric transtentorial approach or an infratentorial/supracerebellar approach, and posterior fossa located tumors by either a medially or laterally positioned suboccipital craniotomy.

These lesions are prone to regrowth because the residual epithelial tissue will continue producing keratin. Tumor recurs in approximately 25% of the patients after an average interval of 8 years.

Adjuvant fractionated external beam radiotherapy for recurrent intracranial epidermoid tumors has been recommended for those patients with multiple recurrent disease, rapid recurrence following prior resection, increased risk of further surgical morbidity, and malignant transformation.
