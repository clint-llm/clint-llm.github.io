Complications occur in about 50% of the patients who undergo vertebroplasty, but about 95% of them are clinically asymptomatic.

- Infection and bleeding: Universally recognized risks of any interventional procedure.

- Radiculopathy or neurological deficit: If the spinal needle violates the inferior or medial wall of the pedicle during entry, there is a significant risk of damage to a nerve root or the spinal cord.

- The most common complication associated with vertebroplasty is PMMA leakage into the surrounding tissue, intradiscal, and spinal canal. This is more common for VP because no cavity is created as in kyphoplasty and increased pressure is needed to inject the PMMA.
- Pulmonary embolization: Cement particles introduced into a vein have the potential to embolize to the lungs, however, this is a rare complication
- Spinal stenosis: Cement leakage into the epidural space can essentially cause iatrogenic spinal stenosis, however, this is a rare complication.
