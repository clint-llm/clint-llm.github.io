Enterobacter is a genus of gram-negative, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic bacteria of theÂ Enterobacteriaceae family. It is also described as non-spore-forming, flagella-containing, urease positive, and lactose fermenting.

Virulence of this bacterium depends on a variety of factors. Like other gram-negative enteric bacilli, the bacteria use adhesins to bind to host cells. The presence of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) capsule can aid the bacteria in avoiding opsonophagocytosis. The LPS capsule can initiate a cascade of inflammation in the host cell and may further lead to sepsis.

The presence of beta-lactamases in Enterobacter spp. is the primary mechanism of antimicrobial resistance. Beta lactamases can hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring seen in penicillin and cephalosporins. The presence of this enzyme has contributed to an increase in the number of resistant Enterobacter pathogens.
