An interprofessional team should be involved in the care of patients that undergo EMB. This team includes interventional cardiologists, cardiac pathologists, radiologists, and cardiology nurses and technicians. Decision-making regarding EMB should balance the risk of this invasive procedure, its treatment implication, and its diagnostic power compared to other diagnostic methods. EMB is one part of the evaluation of cardiac pathology. As histology illustrates cellular appearance, science evolves with trying to take a more detailed look at the subcellular and molecular levels. The findings of the genetic basis of cardiac diseases led to the common pathway hypothesis of hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy and long QT syndromes.
