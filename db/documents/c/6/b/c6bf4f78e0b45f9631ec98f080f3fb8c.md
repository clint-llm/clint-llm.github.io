Pregnancy testing before the initiation of therapy and periodically during the therapeutic course is recommended in females of the reproductive age group.

A liver function test is necessary at baseline and within the first three months of therapy initiation. After which, regular monitoring should be performed at least every 6Â to 12 months or as clinically indicated.

The optimal time to assess treatment response is not well defined. Clinicians should perform routine monitoring with pulmonary function tests (PFT), 6-minute walk tests (6MWT), home spirometry, as well as subjective exercise tolerance and physical exam findings.

Changes in the patient's clinical condition may reflect superimposed infection, malignancy, or even the development of pulmonary artery hypertension and not just the progression of the underlying ILD.

Quantitative HRCT is also a sensitive tool used to quantify the disease progression and response to treatment in SSc-ILD.
