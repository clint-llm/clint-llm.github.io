The differential diagnosis of MOH would include any form of chronic daily headache, whether it is a primary or secondary headache diagnosis, including migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), hypnic headache, nummular headache, and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Always ask patients about a history of head trauma, and if a patient’s history or physical examination causes concern, then appropriate diagnostic testing should be performed to rule out the possibility of a severe medical or neurologic condition. Some differentials that should be under consideration are venous sinus thrombosis, subdural hematoma, carbon monoxide poisoning, brain tumors, hydrocephalus, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
