Extracorporeal life support (ECLS), which is also known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), is essentially a functioning heart and lung machine for a patient in whom their own anatomy or physiology is impaired. ECMO can be used for many different pathologies, which may require either venovenous (VV) or venoarterial (VA) for the support of the patient. ECMO can provide a bridge for the patient to resolve their disease process or provide the patient time to receive a long-term device or transplant.

The ideas of ECMO have been around for years. Until recently, we as a healthcare team have started to master the use of ECMO and truly learned how to administer this artificial oxygenation machine. The entire process of ECMO requires a large, very well-organized team that can provide cannulation, management of the ECMO machine, weaning the patient, decannulation, and any possible complication that can arise. This article will focus on weaning adult and pediatric patients from ECMO.
