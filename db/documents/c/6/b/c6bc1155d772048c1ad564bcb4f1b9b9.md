The therapeutic range of quetiapine is between 100 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL. As mentioned before, patients commonly experience somnolence, dizziness, and orthostatic hypotension. Within this therapeutic range, the patient might experience other common side effects such as tachycardia, dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis, rhinitis and nasal congestion, dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, leukopenia, neutropenia, lethargy, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, peripheral edema, sedation, weight gain, and tardive dyskinesia. Monitor the metabolic panel with a specific focus on fasting glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, blood pressure, and weight. Patients should also receive a lens examination every six months during long-term treatment for cataract monitoring. Agranulocytosis is a very rare but reported side effect associated with quetiapine use.
