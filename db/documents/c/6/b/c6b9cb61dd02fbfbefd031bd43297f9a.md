The following conditions can also present with muscle weakness and should be excluded by history, physical exam, and investigations before a definitive diagnosis of dermatomyositis can be made:

- Inclusion body myositis: unlike the symmetric and proximal involvement in dermatomyositis, muscle weakness in inclusion body myositis is usually asymmetric and involves distal muscles like the wrist and finger flexors. Muscle atrophy may be prominent during the examination, which is rare in dermatomyositis. A muscle biopsy will show the characteristic inclusion bodies. Unlike dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis is refractory to treatment with corticosteroids.

- Drug-induced myopathy: Eliciting a drug history is essential to rule out drug-induced myopathies. The most common offending drugs are statins, alcohol, penicillamine, colchicine, glucocorticoids, zidovudine, and antimalarials. Drug-induced myopathy may cause mild myalgia, or it may even be severe enough to cause rhabdomyolysis. The absence of skin findings and muscle biopsy can differentiate this condition from dermatomyositis.

- Hypothyroidism: like dermatomyositis, hypothyroidism can present with proximal weakness and elevated muscle enzymes. The presence of other signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, muscle biopsy, and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels can be used to differentiate this condition from dermatomyositis.

- Myasthenia gravis: Unlike dermatomyositis, myasthenia gravis predominantly causes muscle weakness of the ocular and bulbar muscles, is associated with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, and does not cause elevation of muscle enzymes.

- Polymyalgia rheumatica: can present with pain and stiffness of the muscles around the shoulder and pelvic girdle. This condition can be differentiated from dermatomyositis by the presence of inflammatory markers, absence of elevated muscle enzymes, and normal muscle strength. Moreover, this condition mainly affects people more than 50 years of age.

Other differential diagnoses include muscular dystrophies, motor neuron disease, neuropathy, inherited metabolic myopathies, and myasthenia gravis.

The presence of characteristic skin findings in addition to symmetric muscle weakness should help to distinguish dermatomyositis from these conditions. Electromyography helps differentiate dermatomyositis from neuropathic causes of weakness. Muscle biopsy showing the hallmark pathological features of dermatomyositis also helps to exclude other causes.
