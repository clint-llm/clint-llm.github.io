Before performing any brachial plexus block, a description of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure before obtaining informed consent. The skin over the injection site should be cleansed with chlorhexidine 2% or povidone-iodine and allowed to dry. The sterile gel shouldÂ be applied to the probe; then, a sterile probe cover should be placed with additional sterile gel on the exterior surface of the probe cover. Draw up the desired volume of local anesthetic into a syringe, then connect the extension tubing with a short bevel block needle attached. Prime the tubing and needle by ejecting all of the air from the system, as injecting air into the site will inhibit insonation.

For the interscalene, superior trunk, supraclavicular, and RAPTIR infraclavicular approaches, the patient should be supine with the head and neck rotated slightly toward the contralateral side. A towel roll may be used under the ipsilateral shoulder to allow more room for needle manipulation. The ipsilateral arm should be adducted.

For the traditional infraclavicular and axillary approaches, the patient should be supine with the head and neck rotated slightly toward the contralateral side. The ipsilateral shoulder may be abducted to 90 degrees with the elbow flexed to increase visualization of the axillary artery and facilitate needle passage.
