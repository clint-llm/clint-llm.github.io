Tooth mobility, color, tenderness to manual pressure, and the position or displacement of the tooth/teeth should be recorded at the initial assessment. The color of injured and uninjured teeth should also be recorded at every clinic visit. Discoloration is a recognized common complication following luxation injuries. It is usually seen 10 to 14 days after the original injury.

Clinically, teeth with grey discoloration can recover to their original color, become yellowed or remain grey.

Radiographs are an important diagnostic tool for diagnosing TDIs and serve as a baseline when compared to follow-up appointments. Intra-oral radiographs may include periapical radiographs (size 0 sensor/film, paralleling technique) or occlusal radiographs (size 2 sensor/film). Conventional radiology may not be possible in young children due to compliance, and a clinician may consider alternative views, such as lateral obliques. However, it is important to consider if taking an image and exposing the child to radiation will positively affect the diagnosis or treatment provided. Clinicians must work within the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principles to minimize radiation doses. The use of pulp testing in children is challenging; it is subjective and relies on the child’s understanding and cooperation.
