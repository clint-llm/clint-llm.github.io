Tinea barbae is a contagious disease where an individual can be infected from either an animal or human source via direct or indirect contact. Once the diagnosis of tinea barbae is made, the emphasis should be placed on identifying the source of the infection. Patients and family members should be screened for other dermatophyte infections like tinea capitis, tinea pedis, onychomycosis, etc. Domestic and farm animals should be checked for zoonotic dermatophytoses and treated appropriately with the help of a veterinarian to prevent reinfections.
