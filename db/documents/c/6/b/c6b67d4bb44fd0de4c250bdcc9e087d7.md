Substance Abuse Disorder: An intoxicated individual using psychostimulants such as methamphetamine, cocaine may present with an episode that may mimic frotteurism. If recurrent such episodes continue, a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder may be considered, in the absence of acute substance intoxication.

Traumatic Brain Injury: Frontal and frontotemporal deficits resulting from a traumatic brain injury can present with a similar lack of inhibition and increased sexual behaviors. However, cognitive deficits are typically present as a result of brain injury.

Conduct disorder and Anti-social personality disorder: A lack of a moral compass, disregard for the law, and societal norms can be important to distinguish from frotteurism. The key distinction is the lack of sexual interest or arousal by touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual by someone with a personality disorder.

Additional differential diagnoses may include:

- Obsessive-compulsive disorder

- Mood disorders

- Other sexual dysfunction disorders

- Other paraphilic disorders
