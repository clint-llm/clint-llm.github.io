Treatment mainly depends on the extent and severity of the disease and includes lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, and procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Subtotal coronary occlusion is usually managed medically along the line of stable angina. Beta-blockers are preferred for initial treatment for the prevention of anginal symptoms.

Total coronary occlusion or subtotal occlusion refractory to medical therapy is managed by either percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting.

In single-vessel disease, PCI is preferred over CABG. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves an incision in the groin or wrist area. A wire is passed through the main blood vessel to the blocked artery in the heart. An opening is created in the blocked region with the help of guidewire. After this, a catheter is passed over the wire, then a balloon is inflated at the site of blockage to displace the plaque, and a stent is placed to normalize the blood flow and keep the artery open. In multivessel disease, CABG is the preferred.
