The differential diagnosis of wrist injury is broad, underscoring the importance of proper history, physical exam, and radiographic evaluation. Wrist pain after an injury can be the result of intrinsic or extrinsic ligament sprains or tears, triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries, osteochondral cartilage injuries, lunotriquetral ligament instabilities, or scapholunate dissociations, to name a few. Radiographic evaluation aids in ruling out fractures of the proximal or distal carpal rows, of which scaphoid fractures are the most common. Distal radius fractures and metacarpal base fractures can also be seen. Treatment is entirely dependent on the appropriate diagnosis. Therefore, keeping an appropriate differential in mind is essential.
