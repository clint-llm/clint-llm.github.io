- The most frequent side effect of sodium oxybate is nausea and vomiting. Other reported symptoms include dizziness, headache, urinary incontinence, and confusion. Overall, the incidence of side effects increases at higher doses and tends to subside with treatment discontinuation.

- More serious side effects are rare, but researchers have noted severe acute psychosis, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.

- Additionally, patients taking sodium oxybate often experience weight loss. The speculation is that the weight loss is due to increased physical activity and decreased caloric intake. In the study, weight loss was most significant in patients with a higher body mass index (BMI). In conclusion, weight loss might be a possible benefit of sodium oxybate treatment in patients with a high BMI who suffer from narcolepsy.

- Most reported serious side effects of sodium oxybate are due to illicit drug consumption. Abuse or misuse of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) with other agents that cause changes in alertness (or consciousness) has implications pointing to severe side effects such as respiratory depression, seizures, altered mental status (AMS), and death.

- Parasomnias have been reported. The clinician should inquire about episodes of sleepwalking. Sodium oxybate has also been linked to sleep-driving and sleep-related eating disorders.
