Bone is the primary anatomical structure comprising of the human skeletal system. Functionally, it assumes a significant mechanical role by the skeleton, and represents a stock of mineral salts to mobilize for maintenance of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. It protects several vital organs (skull, vertebrae and rib cage). Through the medullary spaces, it hosts, the bone provides structural and functional support for hematopoiesis

Several classifications can be proposed to separate bone subtypes. Overall, there are five generalized varieties of human bones (long, short, flat, sesamoid, and irregular) and two architectural subtypes, cortical and trabecular bones.
