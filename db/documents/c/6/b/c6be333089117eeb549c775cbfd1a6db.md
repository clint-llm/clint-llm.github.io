The etiology of NMOSD is still unclear. In the past, NMOSD was characterized as a variant of MS, but recent studies have elucidated the differences in the disease process, manifestations, and management. Whole-genome sequencing has identified some at-risk genotypes for NMOSD, and two major histocompatibility complexes have been identified.
