Nicotine is an alkaloid and is only produced in tobacco. It is a tertiary amine that has pyrrolidine and pyridine rings. It binds selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors in multiple locations. The brain, neuromuscular junctions, adrenal medulla, and ganglia have these receptors. When a person inhales nicotine by smoking cigarettes, it diffuses through the lungs into the circulation, eventually going to the brain. It affects the reward center in the limbic system and has a stimulating effect on the cortex. Dopamine in the frontal cortex, mesolimbic area, and corpus striatum is released - dopamine helps deliver the pleasurable experience. A recent study also suggested that MAO-A and B enzymes are modulated by nicotine. This enzyme helps to degrade dopamine, which is primarily responsible for dependence.
