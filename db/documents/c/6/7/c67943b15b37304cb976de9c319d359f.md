PCV is a relatively uncommon disease in the general population, with one study estimating that its prevalence in Europe is 0.04% of the entire population.

The association of PCV with other diseases is debatable. PCV has been reported with thrombocytopenia, sickle cell anemia, irradiation, and hypertension. However, to establish such an association, further studies are warranted.
