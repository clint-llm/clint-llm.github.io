Vancomycin has been available for more than 70 years. It was an empiric therapy to treat most gram-positive organisms until recently. It is a very effective drug but requires intravenous administration. However, drug resistance to vancomycin is becoming more common, and there need to be limitations on its use. The pharmacist is vital for ensuring that the clinician does not empirically order vancomycin when other alternatives are available.

Most hospitals have a drug committee composed of physicians and pharmacists who ensure that vancomycin use is under controlled circumstances. In fact, in many hospitals, one has to require permission from the infectious disease expert or the pharmacist before using vancomycin. Vancomycin is one of the few drugs that are still active against MRSA. The other issue with vancomycin is that the drug concentrations require monitoring as it is both ototoxic and nephrotoxic; the pharmacist has to ensure the healthcare provider orders serum drug concentrations.

The only way to control drug costs and empirical prescribing is by having a drug committee that oversees what drugs healthcare providers prescribe and why. Finally, the committee should have a list of drugs that cannot be prescribed without a special need when less expensive alternatives are available to control healthcare costs.
