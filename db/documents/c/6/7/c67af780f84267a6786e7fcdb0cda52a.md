Differential diagnoses include new onset of a mood disorder or psychotic disorder that precipitate excessive indulgence in negative behaviors and hostility toward others. CD should be excluded if the problems occur only during episodes of mood or psychotic disorder.

Furthermore, untreated depressive disorder or ADHD leads to substance abuse and can be the precursor to CD.
