The ergosterol inhibitor class of medications ("conazoles") is used to manage and treat fungal infections. These drugs inhibit ergosterol in the cell membrane to help kill fungi. This drug comes in both topical and systemic formulas. This drug can cause hepatotoxicity and should, therefore, be monitored via interprofessional communication. This activity examines these antifungal agents and covers their indications, contraindications, interactions, and adverse event profile so that clinicians can make informed decisions regarding their use in patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of conazole drugs.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of the conazole antifungal drugs.
- Review the necessary patient monitoring when prescribing conazole drugs.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes of treatment with conazole drugs.
