When utilizing pressure control ventilation, respiratory therapists, as well as nursing, should be actively involved in the co-management and surveillance of the patient on the ventilator while in the ICU or emergency room. Discussion as a collective team should take place at the time of deciding to place the patient on pressure control. Concerning features that require immediate intervention should also be discussed as a team at that time.
