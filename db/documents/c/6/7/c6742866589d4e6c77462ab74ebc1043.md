The cells in chromaffin tissue produce and store catecholamines i.e.norepinephrine and epinephrine. Some tumors may also produce dopamine

The normal adrenal medulla secretes about 85% epinephrine and 15% norepinephrine, but norepinephrine is the predominant catecholamine secreted by PCC

Most PCC are intra-adrenal and solitary. As per the traditional "10 percent rule" for pheochromocytoma: 10% of pheochromocytomas are familial, 10% are malignant, 10% are extra-adrenal, and 10% are in children. However, this 10 percent rule is oversimplified and incorrect as the prevalence of extra-adrenal tumors (paragangliomas) is as high as 20%, and about 20 to 30% of these tumors are hereditary

Familial syndromes associated with pheochromocytomas include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and 2B, neurofibromatosis (Von Recklinghausen disease), and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
