Pneumomediastinum is usually diagnosed on chest X-ray. The most common finding is air outlining mediastinal structures (90% of cases).

- Subcutaneous emphysema

- Elevation of the thymus in pediatric patients (spinnaker sign)

- Air surrounding the pulmonary arteries of the lung (ring sign)

- A hyperlucent V shape between the descending aorta and the left hemidiaphragm

- Double bronchial wall

- Continuous diaphragm sign

- Pleural effusion (which may indicate esophageal injury)

If chest x-ray findings are equivocal, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest can definitively rule in or rule out pneumomediastinum.

In emergent situations, ultrasound may be helpful in identifying pneumomediastinum. The “air gap sign” may be present, which appears as broadband of sonographic echoes that obscure the cardiac structures beneath. Other findings may include air adjacent to the heart or diaphragm and subcutaneous hyperechoic white foci suggestive of air bubbles in the soft tissue.

Additional studies such as bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy, or esophagography are typically not required in most cases of pneumomediastinum.
