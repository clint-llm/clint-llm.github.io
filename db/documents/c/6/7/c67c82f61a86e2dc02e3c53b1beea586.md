Individuals with oppositional defiant disorderÂ can experience significant impairments in social, academic, and occupational life and also frequently experience conflicts with parents, teachers, and peers. Disruptive behaviors are also associated with increased costs to society and poor psychosocial adjustment in adulthood. Mild to moderate forms of ODD often improve with age, but more severe forms can evolve into conduct disorder in a subset of individuals. Low intellectual capabilities and lack of proper supervision indicate a poor prognosis, while adequate treatment of comorbidities (including ADHD or mood disorders), individual and/or family therapy, and positive parenting are associated with a good prognosis.
