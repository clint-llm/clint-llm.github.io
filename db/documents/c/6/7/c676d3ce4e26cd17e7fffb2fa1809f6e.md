Preparing a dose calculation is best done with the use of a calculator, particularly in a stressful situation. If not, errors are likely. One wrong decimal place can become a ten-fold error that can cause life-threatening complications for patients.

Dose calculations should always be performed before the medicine is mixed if the practitioner is giving an infusion. Doing the math before mixing allows a person to change the numbers to reach a better drip-rate. It is difficult to count 600 gtt/min using a 60 gtt/set but changing the drip set to a ten gtt/set can decrease your rate to 100 gtt/min and make your treatment more manageable.
