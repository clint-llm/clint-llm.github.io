The mainstay of evaluation and diagnosis includes imaging studies such as chest x-ray, ECG and echocardiography, angiography and left and right heart catheterization.

**Chest X-Ray**

A chest x-ray is the initial investigation of choice. The findings include:

- Pulmonary congestion with haziness (Kerley B-lines)

- Ground glass appearance of acute pulmonary edema

- Prominent pulmonary vessels

- Pleural effusion

- Left atrial enlargement

- Cardiomegaly

**Electrocardiography (ECG)**

ECG findings are non-specific in cor triatriatum. Can range from atrial fibrillation and no specific P-wave changes to right axis deviation due to pulmonary congestion and right ventricular hypertrophy.

**Echocardiography**

Echocardiography is the diagnostic modality of choice as it not only allows for definitive diagnosis, but the 3-dimensional reconstruction of echocardiographic images pinpoints the exact location of the defect and appendage, helps direct the surgical approach to the disease. The left atrial appendage and its fenestrations can be easily visualized along with the presence of an atrial septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, or regurgitation. Pulmonary arterial and venous drainage patterns can also be seen on echocardiography. Echocardiography differentiates between cor triatriatum and supravalvular mitral stenosis by clear visualization of the left atrial appendage in the left atrium.

Transesophageal echocardiography outlines the precise nature and anatomy of the defect; especially in older patients, but if unavailable, transthoracic echocardiography can be performed.

**Angiography**

Angiography helps determine the severity of obstruction and the time of surgical intervention needed.
