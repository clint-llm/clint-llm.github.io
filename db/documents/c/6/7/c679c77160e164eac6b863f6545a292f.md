Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder of B or T cell origin. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2017 classification system categorizes these disease entities under precursor lymphoid neoplasm. The WHO 2017 classification of precursor lymphoid neoplasm includes 4 distinct entities: B-ALL/LBL not otherwise specified (NOS); B-ALL/LBL with recurrent genetic abnormalities; T-ALL/LBL; and NK-ALL/LBL. Lymphoblasts are the characteristic cells of this disease entity. The lymphoblasts are usually small to medium-sized with scant cytoplasm, moderately condensed to dispersed chromatin, and inconspicuous nucleoli. The lymphoblasts traditionally involve the bone marrow (BM) and/or blood in ALL and involve the lymph nodes in LBL. The diagnosis is of ALL is rendered when the blast count exceeds 20%. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
- Review the presentation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
- Summarize the treatment options for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
