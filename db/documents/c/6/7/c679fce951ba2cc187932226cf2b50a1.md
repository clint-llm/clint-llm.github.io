History is very important when considering a diagnosis of EoE as there are many overlapping symptoms of EoE that coincide with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). The most common manifestation in adults is dysphagia to solid food. An emergency department visit due to food impaction has been the most common presenting symptom in patients with EoE. Other symptoms such as chest pain or heartburn are common as well. Pediatric patients can present with nausea, vomiting, food intolerance, abdominal pain, and weight loss. A history of various atopic conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, seasonal allergy, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and eczema may be present as well.

A physical exam is less useful than the history in making the diagnosis of EoE. The most common finding is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen without signs of peritonitis.
