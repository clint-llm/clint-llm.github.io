Hepatic angiosarcoma is primarily made up of vessels or lymphatic endothelial cells, so it is composed of abundant vasculature. Spindle or pleomorphic cells line or grow into the lumina of preexisting vascular spaced like sinusoids and terminal hepatic venules, causing hepatocyte atrophy and formation of vascular channels. It can sometimes form into solid masses of a tumor. Hepatic angiosarcoma should be considered when a hepatic bleeding mass is encountered. Metastatic spread usually occurs in the lungs and hilar lymph nodes but can also spread to the spleen and bones.
