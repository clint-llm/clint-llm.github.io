Every case of Treacher Collins syndrome is unique and needs unique, individual assessment ideally by an interprofessional team.

- Visual examination: eyelid as well as visual acuity exams

- Comprehensive hearing testing, as conductive hearing loss is very prevalent, and early intervention can facilitate normal language development and auditory rehabilitation.

- Upper airway examination, as micro and retrognathia, can predispose to obstructive sleep apnea.

Postnatal diagnosis is usually made via a blood sample for DNA isolation from the individual and family members based upon either family history or characteristic facies. Once a pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected individual, it is possible to offer prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing.

The diagnosis of TCS in about 96% of patients is made through molecular genetic testing and detection of a heterozygous (in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance) pathogenic variant in TCOF1 or POLR1D or biallelic (in an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance) pathogenic variants in POLR1C or POLR1D.

A full craniofacial computed tomography (CT) scan is usually conducted during the first six months of life to determine the extent of dysmorphology. Hypoplasia or aplasia of the zygomatic arch can be detected by a watersâ€™ view radiograph, and mandibular retrognathia can be seen on an orthopantomogram, though in the era of widespread CT availability, these plain-film X-rays are rarely relied upon.

If there is a concern for obstructive sleep apnea, polysomnography, and a thorough ear, nose, and throat examination are in order to decipher the level of upper airway obstruction.
