The key vessel involved in pancreatic pseudoaneurysms is the splenic artery since it runs along the course of the pancreas before reaching the spleen. A pseudoaneurysm differs from a true aneurysm because the wall does not contain arterial tissue but consists of fibrous tissue which contains a hematoma that can enlarge or rupture. This damage occurs as a consequence of autodigestion and weakening of the arterial wall by pancreatic juices or a leak from a pancreatic anastomosis. Eventually, if the autodigestion continues, this leads to the formation of a total or partial vascular cystic structure. Because the splenic artery runs its course along with the pancreas towards the spleen, it is affected in pancreatitis. This anatomical positionÂ explains why the splenic artery is the commonest site of developing pseudoaneurysm in any visceral artery. The pseudoaneurysms can enlarge and rupture into an associated pseudocyst filling the biliopancreatic ducts. In such a case, bleeding occurs through the ampulla of Vater into the gastrointestinal tract. The pseudoaneurysms can also rupture into the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum. When there is bleeding through the ampulla of Vater from the pancreatic duct, it is known as Hemosuccus pancreaticus or pancreatitis.
