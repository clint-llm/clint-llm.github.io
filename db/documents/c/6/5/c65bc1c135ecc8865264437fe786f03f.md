Any alteration of the corneal surface or tear film composition can lead to mucus plaque formation.

The common causes of mucus plaques are:

- Aqueous tear deficiency as in keratoconjunctivitis sicca

- Systemic diseases with ocular surface effects as in Sjogren syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis

- Herpes zoster keratitis

- Superficial limbic keratoconjunctivitis

- Vernal keratoconjunctivitis

- Post corneal surgery eg, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and penetrating keratoplasty (PK)

- Contact lens overwear

- Staphylococcal blepharitis
