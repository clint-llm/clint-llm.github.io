Cardiac calcifications carry different diagnostic and prognostic significance depending on their location. They can involve the coronary arteries, cardiac valves, myocardium, and pericardium. They are commonly observed on image modalities done for various reasons. To avoid the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiac calcifications (whether in the coronary arteries, cardiac valves, or myocardium/pericardium), they must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of cardiac calcifications in various locations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these calcifications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cardiac calcifications.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of cardiac calcifications and their diagnostic and prognostic importance.
- Review the management options available for cardiac calcifications.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cardiac calcifications and improve outcomes.
