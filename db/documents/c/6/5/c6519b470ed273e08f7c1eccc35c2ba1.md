Febrile seizures are seizures that are caused by a sudden spike in body temperature with fevers greater than 38C or 100.4F, with no other underlying seizure-provoking causes or diseases such as central nervous system (CNS) infections, electrolyte abnormalities, drug withdrawal, trauma, genetic predisposition or known epilepsy. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of febrile seizures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the etiology of febrile seizures.
- Describe the investigation of a child with febrile seizures.
- Summarize the treatment option for febrile seizures.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by febrile seizures.
