The major complication is non-accidental falls, which might be serious due to the CSH elderly population (taking anticoagulants, osteoporosis, poor candidates for surgical intervention, or high risk for postsurgical complications). Another issue to consider is while performing carotid massage for diagnosis, ignoring good carotid evaluation (excluding bruits and carotid artery stenosis) may evoke a stroke.
