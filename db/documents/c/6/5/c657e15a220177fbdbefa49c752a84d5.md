There are usually three phases in brachial neuritis. In phase 1, the patient will complain of severe pain that is usually unilateral and is described as aching that is sudden in onset and involves the lateral aspect of the shoulder as seen in axillary nerve involvement, scapular pain in the suprascapular nerve, the superolateral thoracic wall in long thoracic nerve, antecubital fossa in anterior interosseous nerve, and lateral arm or forearm in musculocutaneous nerve. The pain usually is not positional and is worse at night, causing the patient to wake from sleep. The average time between the trigger and the symptoms is 1 to 28 days; however, 66% of patients report the trigger within seven days. According to van Alfen et al., early identification permits medical treatment that may repeal the severity of the clinical course. The acute pain is self-limited and subsides after a few days to weeks. In general, the longer the pain lasts the longer it will take for the patient to recover. In a typical course, after the pain resolves, patients will enter phase 2 of the disease and will start to develop weakness that is painless such as arm and shoulder girdle weakness. The forearm and hands can also be involved but are much less common. Atrophy of the muscles also starts to occur but there is usually a slow steady recovery of muscle function afterward following 6 to 18 months known as phase 3 of the disease.

On physical examination, typically 2 or more nerves will be involved. One unique characteristic that can differentiate brachial plexus neuritis from other conditions is that in brachial neuritis there is differential involvement of the different muscles that are innervated by the same peripheral nerve (pathy paresis). Lower motor neuron signs can be appreciated later on in the disease course on physical exam (hypotonia, areflexia, atrophy, and fasciculations) mainly in the upper brachial plexus (C5,6,7). For weakness that occurs after the acute pain phase, shoulder abduction and external rotation will be decreased signifying involvement of the deltoids, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles. When the long thoracic nerve is involved you will get medial scapular winging due to involvement of the serratus anterior muscle. Sensory changes can also be present in about 78% of patients consisting of paresthesias and hypoesthesia over the lateral arm, deltoids, and radial forearm. Patients may not notice sensory changes due to severe severe pain.
