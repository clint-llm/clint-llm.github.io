DUR programs play an important role in serving healthcare systems to understand the prescribing, administration, and drug utilization process. Employers and health care plans have found DUR programs valuable and used the results to foster efficient use of health care resources.

Pharmacists performing DUR play an important role in this process, as their main expertise is medication therapy management. The pharmacist uses the DUR to evaluate prescribing trends of clinicians within a specific patient population by medicine-specific criteria or disease state (i.e., hypertension, asthma, diabetes, depression).

Concurrent evaluation, collecting data during care delivery and sometimes as a component of the care process, is usually preferred over retrospective methods. Concurrent evaluation allows organizations to select relevant outcomes for collection rather than rely on outcomes routinely documented within patient medical records. For example, quality-of-life measures remain an infrequently documented measure in medical records. Only through concurrent evaluation can that outcome measure be reliably captured.

Medications recently added to the formulary should be evaluated, especially if there is the potential for inappropriate use or concerning adverse effects. This review should occur 6 to 12 months after their addition to the formulary. High-cost, high-use, and problem-prone medications also are good candidates for evaluation.
