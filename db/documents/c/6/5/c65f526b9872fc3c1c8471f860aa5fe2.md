Pancytopenia is a hematologic condition characterized by a decrease in all three peripheral blood cell lines. It is characterized by a hemoglobin value of less than 12 g/dL in women and 13 g/dL in men, platelets of less than 150,000 per mcL, and leukocytes of less than 4000 per ml (or absolute neutrophil count of less than 1800 per ml).

Leukopenia is primarily seen as neutropenia since neutrophils constitute the majority of leukocytes. Pancytopenia is not a disease but a manifestation of other underlying conditions.
