Seizures are caused by episodic, excessive, and disorderly neuronal activity in the brain. Ordinarily, electrical impulses are transmitted by an action potential that involves a net positive inward ion influx causing depolarization in the neurons. Hyperexcitability is usually prevented by several inhibitory mechanisms, involving negative ions like chloride ions and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Alteration in voltage-gated ion channels is causing increased excitatory and decreased inhibitory transmission causes hyperexcitability. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and GABA, the inhibitory. Excitation of neurons along with too little inhibition causes hyperexcitability. Epileptic focus along with hyperexcitability and hyper-synchronization of neurons causes seizures.
