Techniques to ensure proper urinary catheter placement must account for anatomic variations and differ when approaching male and female patients.

In women, the primary difficulty commonly encountered in catheter placement is identifying and cannulating the urethral meatus, which can be retracted or stenosed in cases of atrophic vaginitis or obscured by obesity, pelvic organ prolapse, or from scarring related to prior surgeries or radiation therapy. Similarly, identifying and cannulating the urethral meatus can be difficult in men in the setting of penile edema, buried penis, phimosis, meatal stenosis, and fossa navicularis strictures.

Some patients will need to be positioned with special care. For example, in patients with significant congestive heart failure (CHF), a reverse Trendelenberg position (lying flat but bed tilted 15 to 30 degrees with the head up) is preferred to minimize CHF exacerbations.

**Females**

For female patients, proper positioning and retraction create the best opportunity for direct visualization and intubation of the urethral meatus. The patient should be in a supine, frog-leg position with the head of the bed slightly lower than the feet. If a frog-leg position is impossible due to comorbid conditions or recent surgery, visualization can be improved by an alternative technique. One leg is bent at the knees and abducted at the thigh, with the heel drawn towards the pelvis. It may be necessary to recruit assistance to retract a large abdominal or suprapubic pannus and provide focused lighting to visualize the urethral meatus. When atrophic vaginitis or vaginal contraction is present, the urethra commonly retracts posteriorly and anteriorly, making it difficult to view directly. If the meatus cannot be visualized, a small catheter, particularly one with a coude tip, can be slid over a finger placed in the vagina with gentle manual pressure maintained against the anterior vaginal wall. The urethral meatus will feel like a buttonhole on the anterior midline surface of the vagina which will allow for catheter introduction. In rare cases, access to the vagina and urethral meatus may actually be easier from behind, with the patient lying on her back or side.

A soft guidewire, often one with an angled tip, can be placed into an anteriorly retracted urethral meatus if needed. In cases with a stenosed and retracted meatus, a firmer, smaller caliber catheter (usually silicone or vinyl) can often be more easily placed than larger, softer ones. A coude tip catheter is recommended for this purpose. The use of a catheter guide to stiffen the Foley is sometimes helpful as well.

In addition to obscuring direct visualization of the urethral meatus, anterior prolapse can also cause an inferior angulation of the urethra as it joins the bladder neck. This can cause kinking of the catheter. To pass a catheter in such cases, placing a finger into the vagina to elevate the prolapsing bladder or placing a pessary can help align the urethra and bladder neck for direct intubation with a urinary catheter. In some cases where the urethra is retracted anteriorly or when the urethra is obscured by prolapse, the patient may need to be placed prone for easier access.

**Males**

Male patients should be placed in the supine position, and the penis prepped using an aseptic technique.

**Phimosis:**If the urethral meatus is obscured by tight phimosis, gentle downward pressure can be placed on the suprapubic fat adjacent to the base of the penile shaft to expose the urethral meatus. If the phimosis remains unrelieved by gentle pressure to retract the foreskin, carefully placing a hemostat into the preputial opening and gently spreading it can often allow for adequate exposure of the meatus sufficient to allow for catheter introduction. The entire glans of the penis does not need to be exposed; just enough so the meatus can be visualized.

An alternate technique involves grasping the foreskin on the right and left sides and then pulling them outwards. This will tend to extend and separate the lips of the phimotic foreskin, which may allow visualization of the urethral meatus. A coude-tipped catheter can sometimes be introduced into the distal urethra through the phimosis and enter the meatus just by touch, as the anatomical location of the opening in the glans is known to be slightly below the midline. Rarely, when all of these techniques fail, and the phimosis is particularly tight, a dorsal slit procedure in the prepuce may be required under local anesthesia at the bedside to expose the meatus. A dorsal penile nerve block will provide satisfactory anesthesia to allow for this instrumentation at the bedside.

**Buried or Hidden Penis:**In a buried or hidden penis, such as from edema, anasarca, or lymphedema, exposure of the urethral meatus can often be achieved through downward pressure along the lateral edges of the base of the penile shaft with one hand on either side. If this allows visualization of the urethral meatus, an assistant can introduce the Foley catheter. In those cases where this does not provide sufficient visualization, a blind attempt to pass a catheter or a guide wire may be successful.

The most reliable method for assuring entry of a g guide wire or catheter into the urethral meatus is using direct visualization. This can be done with the assistance of a flexible cystoscope or ureteroscope placed into the preputial opening. Once the meatal opening is found, it can be catheterized with an 0.035" guide wire after which the cystoscope or ureteroscope is removed. A council tip Foley catheter is then passed over the wire and into the bladder.

Another technique utilizes a laryngoscope to directly visualize the glans. This has the advantage of allowing direct catheterization of the urethral meatus with a Foley catheter under vision rather than having to use a guide wire.

**Meatal Stenosis and Fossa Navicularis Strictures:**The next area of possible difficulty in catheterization in a male will be encountered at the urethral meatus and fossa navicularis, areas which may be strictured due to prior instrumentation, lichen sclerosis, or chronic irritation. If the meatus is visualized and narrowed, gentle dilation can often allow for the introduction of the urinary catheter. Dilation of the urethral meatus can be achieved using graduated meatal dilators, male urethral sounds, or even female dilators. Liberal use of lubricating jelly with lidocaine provides adequate analgesia for meatal dilation if performed slowly and gently.

Starting with the dilator's largest caliber that will fit, place the dilator carefully into the meatus and gently advance into the fossa navicularis and distal penile urethra. Hold in place for twenty seconds for gentle dilation without tearing the tissue. If placing a dilator is not easy, confirming the urethra's path with a soft guidewire or a pediatric dilator can help direct the instrument intraluminally. Sometimes a tear duct probe or similarly small-sized dilator is needed to initiate the process.

Continue gradual dilation with sequentially larger dilators until the urethra is calibrated to 2 French sizes larger than the desired catheter to be placed. The Foley catheter is then placed using gentle traction on the penis and slowly advancing the catheter into the bladder. Urology consultation may be necessary if unable to place a catheter after reasonable attempts at gentle meatal or fossa navicularis dilation have been attempted.

**Standard Placement Technique:**Difficulties in placing a urethral catheter once beyond the fossa navicularis may arise from urethral stricture disease, prostate cancer, an elevated bladder neck, bladder neck contractures, or anatomic disturbances caused by recent instrumentation, false passages, radiation therapy, trauma, or surgery. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is not generally a cause for difficult catheterization, as the enlarged prostatic lobes are easily bypassed by catheters. Proper technique using either a standard or a Coude tip catheter will generally bypass most obstructions.

The penis should be held under gentle traction at a 90-degree angle to the body with the provider's non-dominant hand to straighten the urethra. A 4 x 4 gauze pad can help maintain a firm grip on the penis. A Toomey syringe filled with 20 mL of sterile lubricant, 2% lidocaine jelly, or a mixture of the two can optionally be injected directly into the male urethra. This will help separate the walls of the urethra as well as provide generous lubrication and possibly some additional analgesia. A well-lubricated 16 French catheter is then placed using the dominant hand and gentle pressure. As the catheter advances into the bulbous urethra, the penis should be gently pulled inferiorly towards the feet to straighten the passage as much as possible. A gentle twisting back-and-forth motion on the catheter will sometimes help, but extreme pressure should be avoided as it will only cause false passage formation and bleeding. Placing gentle upward pressure on the perineum can help direct the catheter anteriorly in cases where there may be an elevated bladder neck. If the catheter still does not easily pass, attention should be paid to identifying the point of obstruction, which will most commonly be in the pendulous urethra or at the bladder neck, and the Foley should be removed. If the catheter passes into the bladder, it should be advanced all the way to the hub before trying to inflate the balloon. This minimizes the risk of inadvertent balloon inflation inside the prostate or urethra.

**If Standard Placement Fails:**

- A 16 or 18 French coude catheter should then be gently inserted into the urethra with the curve facing the ceiling anteriorly.

- If still unable to pass the catheter, an attempt using a smaller caliber (12 Fr) silicone Foley catheter may be successful due to its smaller size and greater catheter rigidity, which may resist recoil.

Many clinical environments have guidelines for catheter placements and for when urologic consultation is recommended. After the unsuccessful placement of a catheter with the above techniques, a urologic consultation is typically recommended. Successful catheter placement may be achieved after passing a guide wire, either using the direct visual guidance of a flexible cystoscope or with a simple blind passage. Sequential dilation of strictures in the urethra or at the bladder neck may be required.

An initial attempt at passing a soft 0.035" guidewire directly into the urethra is quite safe and highly beneficial when successful as it gives clear, protected access to the bladder.

At the bedside, a hydrophilic guidewire with a soft tip may be placed into the urethra. The soft tip can be passed beyond obstructions and into the bladder. Any obstruction will either be bypassed by the guide wire, or the wire will reverse direction and pass back out through the urethral meatus. If the guide wire is able to pass into the bladder, a council catheter or sequential urethral dilators can be passed over the wire.

**Retrograde Urethrography Assisted Catheterizations**

In difficult situations, a retrograde urethrogram can be of help. In a recent study, Almost 70% of otherwise intractable cases were successfully catheterized with the assistance of retrograde urethrography. This is not a perfect solution as there are logistical problems and delays associated with obtaining imaging, especially in the middle of the night, but it can be helpful in selected cases.

**Flexible cystoscopy**is recommended when standard passage techniques have failed, possibly including the blind passage of a guide wire that was not successful. The use of a flexible cystoscope permits the identification of any obstructions or false passages, which can often be bypassed under direct vision with a guide wire which can then be advanced directly into the bladder.

When using a flexible cystoscope, the patient is prepped sterilely, and the lower extremities are covered with a sterile drape. The cystoscope is assembled and lubricated. With direct vision, the cystoscope is maintained in the center of the urethral lumen to avoid trauma to the urethra. If a false passage is encountered, angling the cystoscope anteriorly towards the ceiling will frequently bypass the damaged urothelium. A guide wire should be placed through the narrowed lumen if a stricture is encountered rather than attempting to force the cystoscope through the narrowed lumen. Once the wire is in place, the cystoscope is removed, and a Heyman or Goodwin sound is placed over the wire and advanced gently into the bladder. Sequential dilation then continues as above. A high-pressure balloon dilator may also be used.

**Direct vision video-assisted Foley catheters**have been developed to facilitate placement in difficult patient situations. These catheters are designed to be used with an integrated fiberoptic video system and monitor. They are used with lighting and allow irrigation through a side port. The irrigation port can also be used to advance a guide wire. The image is very similar to a flexible cystoscope, although the tip cannot be adjusted and does not have any maneuverability or angulation potential that a cystoscope does.

**"Soft" dilation**refers to the technique of leaving a small French-size catheter, as in a very strictured urethra, for 24 to 48 hours and then replacing it with the next larger-sized Foley. Just leaving a catheter in the urethra for 24 to 48 hours will gently dilate the strictures and allow easy replacement with a slightly larger catheter. This is then replaced again in another 24 to 48 hours, and the process is repeated until the optimal French-size Foley is successfully placed. While it takes time and may be inconvenient, this technique is a very safe, painless, and effective way of dilating a strictured urethra.

**Follow-up and self-dilation**after successful catheterization will depend somewhat on the nature, severity, and location of the stricture or obstruction. For most patients with significant strictures, the final Foley catheter size is usually 16 French to 20 French. If the catheter is not at the optimal size, the "soft" dilation technique described above can be used. The initial catheter is generally left in place for 10 to 14 days and then removed. (This can be extended to four or even six weeks if necessary.) The patient is taught self-intermittent catheterization. A catheter size (usually 14 French to 20 French) and material (latex (soft) or vinyl (stiff)) are selected. The patient is started on self-catheterization daily for at least a week to ensure he has learned the technique. The catheter should remain in place for about 20 to 30 seconds. The daily catheterizations are then converted to twice a week for six weeks, then weekly for six weeks, then twice a month for six weeks, and then monthly.

**Suprapubic tube placement**is the treatment of last resort when all other methods of gaining access to the bladder through the urethra have failed. If a wire cannot be passed through the lumen of a urethral stricture or bladder neck contracture, the patient will most likely require suprapubic catheter placement to decompress the bladder. In the United States, about 15% of all men with acute urinary retention due to urethral strictures will be treated with suprapubic tubes.

Finally, if significant instrumentation was required to achieve urinary catheterization, the use of antibiotics should be considered. If a male patient is uncircumcised, returning the foreskin to the anatomic position following catheterization is mandatory to avoid paraphimosis. For male patients, the catheter should be completely inserted "to the hub" before the Foley balloon's inflation. The balloon should be inflated slowly to ensure it is not malpositioned in the prostatic urethra. A bladder ultrasound should be used to verify the final catheter position if there is any doubt about its location.

**Recommended Algorithm and Summary for Difficult Male Foley Catheterizations:**

- First, make sure that a Foley catheter is indicated and absolutely necessary. It is very discouraging to utilize significant, painful urological instrumentation to place a catheter for a minor or temporary condition, but it leaves the patient with long-term problems due to permanent urethral scarring and stricture formation.

- Premedicate the patient for pain if safe to do so prior to painful manipulations.

- Determine from the patient's history and the experience of others who have attempted catheter placement the likely location and nature of the difficulty.

- If the problem is a buried penis, consider using a laryngoscope or flexible cystoscope.

- If there is a very distal stricture, the problem can generally be handled relatively easily with blind Van Buren sounds or Hegar dilators; usually without the need for guide wires or cystoscopy.

- Consider injecting 20 mL of sterile lubricant, 2% lidocaine jelly, or a mixture of the two directly into the urethra with a Toomey syringe. (Recommended)

- If the problem is in the penile urethra or more proximal, consider trying to gently use a straight or coude catheter with proper technique and optimal lubrication.

- A 16 or 18 French coude catheter is typically tried next.

- If not successful, a smaller catheter (12 French silicone) generally follows.

- A direct vision video-assisted Foley catheter can be used if available.

- Passing a guide wire and using a council tip Foley catheter is usually the next step.

- If a catheter is passed successfully, insert it into the hub before inflating the balloon.

- If a guide wire is passed, but the catheter cannot be advanced, or if all previous steps fail and a catheter is still deemed necessary, a urology consult is indicated for further treatment.

- Urology will usually review the indications and will often first attempt a standard or coude Foley insertion. Even if this fails, it provides the urologist with important information on the location and nature of the problem.

- Placing a guide wire either blindly or with cystoscopic guidance will likely be attempted next.

- Alternatively, a retrograde urethrography-assisted technique may be attempted.

- Blind dilations without guide wires are not generally recommended anymore except for extremely distal strictures at the meatus or fossa navicularis.

- Once a guide wire is in place, Heyman or Goodwin sounds can be used to sequentially dilate the stricture, usually to 2 French sizes larger than the intended Foley catheter.

- Urethral balloon dilators may also be used for gentle dilation of urethral strictures.

- The "Blitz" technique or council tip Foley catheters are then advanced into the bladder over the wire.

- The "soft" dilation technique, where the Foley is changed every 24 to 48 hours to the next larger size, can be used if only a very small catheter can be placed initially.

- If no opening or lumen can be seen cystoscopically and the guide wire cannot be passed, consideration should be given to placing a suprapubic tube.

- Don't forget to replace the foreskin when all the procedures are concluded.
