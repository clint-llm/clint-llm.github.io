The superior intercostal artery (SIA), also known as the highest intercostal artery or the supreme intercostal artery, is the first branch off of the costocervical trunk, which itself originates from the subclavian artery bilaterally. The superior intercostal artery courses inferiorly and posteriorly from its origin along the medial and posterior aspect of the thorax, between the pleura and the necks of the first and second ribs, typically dividing into two posterior intercostal arteries as it crosses the neck of the first rib. These arteries function to supply blood to the upper intercostal spaces of the first and second ribs in an analogous approach as the lower posterior intercostal arteries.
