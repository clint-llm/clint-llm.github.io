An imbalance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can result in infertility and hypogonadism. Primary hypogonadism (also referred to as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism) results from a gonadal failure to produce adequate testosterone or spermatogenesis despite high LH and FSH levels. Congenital causes of primary hypogonadism include Klinefelter syndrome, androgen synthesis disorder, or cryptorchidism. Acquired causes include hepatic cirrhosis, renal failure, drugs, autoimmune disease, irradiation, infections, trauma or commonly, age. These result in failure of the testes to develop properly, injury to the testes or impaired function. Hence, loss of testicular function results in damaged or underdeveloped Leydig or Sertoli cells that cannot respond to stimuli to maintain reproductive function.

Secondary hypogonadism results from a disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis where low GnRH, LH or FSH leads to low testosterone and spermatogenesis. These disorders can arise from congenital isolated GnRH, LH or FSH deficiency (such as in Kallmannâ€™s, Prader-Willi, Lawrence-Moon, GnRH receptor mutations, beta-subunit mutations in LH or FSH, or the kisspeptin/G protein-coupled receptor fifty-four mutations, which play a role in GnRH release). Acquired causes notably include hyperprolactinemia, panhypopituitarism, drugs (i.e., steroid use or opiates), systemic diseases, tumors, infection, trauma or irradiation. Notably, hyperprolactinemia can suppress GnRH release and is commonly due to prolactinomas, but can also result from hypothalamic-pituitary stalk lesions, drugs (dopamine antagonists, psychotropic agents, etc.) or systemic diseases.

Other causes of infertility in men include defects in androgen action, hyper/hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, disordered sperm transport (i.e., ductal obstruction), and systemic disease. Defects in androgen action, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome, result in a female phenotype despite male genotype due to an inability of the body's tissues to respond to testosterone. Hence, despite high testosterone levels in circulation, the clinical presentation is that of a patient with low testosterone and typically female as the disorder arises from birth.
