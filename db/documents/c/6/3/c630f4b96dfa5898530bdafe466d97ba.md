Bleach refers to a large class of compounds used to whiten or color-lighten materials. They are frequently used for cleaning and disinfection; bleaches kill or control most types of viruses, bacteria, molds, mildews, and algae. Other, less documented, uses include weed killing and preservation of cut flowers. As such, bleaches are ubiquitous. Bleach is chlorine-based such as calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder) and non-chlorine (peroxidase-based). This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of bleach toxicity and stresses the importance of an interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of bleach toxicity.
- Review the exam findings typically seen in patients with bleach toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options for bleach toxicity.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients affected by bleach toxicity.
