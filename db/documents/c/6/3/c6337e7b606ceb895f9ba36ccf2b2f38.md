According to the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, this medication has a high risk of causing significant patient harm. The entire interprofessional team, including physicians and specialists (MDs, DOs), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and nurses, must work together to monitor these patients for potential untoward cardiac and extracardiac events. Given the serious nature of both the conditions for which ibutilide is given and the serious potential for dangerous arrhythmias, the pharmacist should carefully review all orders for ibutilide and perform medication reconciliation to rule out potential drug-drug interactions. In most cases, nursing will deliver the IV and can verify the administration duration and dose and monitor closely for any adverse effects. Should there be any concerns, nursing must report these immediately to the interprofessional healthcare team for further clinical evaluation and intervention. Ordering clinicians need to rely on nursing and pharmacy to ensure optimal therapy results, creating a collaborative interprofessional team environment. [Level 5]
