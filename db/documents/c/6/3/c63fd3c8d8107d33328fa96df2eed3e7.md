Altered mental status is a common presentation. It is important to recognize the early signs of altered mental status, identify the underlying cause, and to provide the appropriate care to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. The differential diagnosis is broad, and health care providers should be aware of this breadth. Underlying etiology can be as subtle as a urinary tract infection and as life-threatening as an embolic or hemorrhagic stroke. This activity outlines the approach toward differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment plans for patients presenting with altered mental status.

**Objectives:**
- Summarized the importance of history taking and physical exam in the formation of a differential diagnosis.
- Outline the differential diagnosis for altered mental status in different age groups.
- Explain when the assessment of the Glasgow coma score should be done in conjunction with a mental status exam.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care in the hospital and at the time of discharge for patients with mental status changes.
