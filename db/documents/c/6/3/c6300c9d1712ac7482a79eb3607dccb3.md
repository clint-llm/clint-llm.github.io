Fluoroscopy-guided angiography is an interventional procedure that provides an assessment of the arterial system via injected contrast material. Myriad arterial pathologies may be diagnosed by angiography. Fluoroscopy-guidance is critical to the success of these procedures. Understanding how to use fluoroscopy helps determine anatomy and maintain adequate diagnostic image quality while lowering patient and operator radiation dose. This activity reviews the general principles of fluoroscopy-guided angiography and its use by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common indications for angiography.
- Outline how different two-dimensional fluoroscopy views can be used to determine the three-dimensional anatomical orientations.
- Review fluoroscopy techniques to minimize radiation exposure while obtaining diagnostic image quality.
- Summarize how interprofessional communication and coordination can improve diagnostic results for patients who need fluoroscopic angiography assessment.
