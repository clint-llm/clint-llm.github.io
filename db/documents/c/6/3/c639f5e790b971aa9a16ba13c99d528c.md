Evaluation for foreign bodies in the vaginal canal is necessary when patients present with a self-reported foreign body or complain of pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, or discharge. It should also be a consideration in patients with urinary and rectal complaints. In pre-pubertal patients with vaginal bleeding or persistent vaginal discharge despite antimicrobial treatment, imaging, and a gynecology referral for examination under anesthesia should be considered by primary care and emergency physicians.

The examination includes a genital exam, which may include a pelvic exam with a speculum.Â Imaging is an option if the diagnosis is unclear or complications are suspected; this includes X-ray, CT scan, MRI, and ultrasound. The choice of imaging will vary based on presenting symptoms and patient age. Transabdominal ultrasound is the preferred modality in pediatric patients due to the lack of radiation, increased availability, and decreased level of invasiveness when compared to a transvaginal ultrasound. It has an overall sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 53%, which improves when the foreign body is over 5 mm in size. This percentage is significantly better than X-ray, which may only detect 23% of foreign bodies.
