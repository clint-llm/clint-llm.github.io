Parathyroidectomy involves a multidisciplinary team to achieve the best clinical outcome. The team includes surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, anesthesiologists, operating room nursing staff. This joint patient management minimizes the delay from diagnosing to operation decision, leading to efficient pre-operative imaging localization, ensuring patient suitability for surgery, managing intraoperative nerve monitoring and PTH level monitor, and optimizing postoperative care.
