Cavernomas can be seen in either familial or sporadic cases. Between 40% to 60% of cases are familial.CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2/Malcavernin, and CCM3/PDCD10 genes located respectfully on the 7q, 7p, and 3p chromosomes.CCM genes interact in neural tissue with capillary endothelial tight junctions and cytoskeletal proteins during angiogenesis.CCM2 was found to be responsible for clustering among Ashkenazi Jews.

Recently, genetic studies on the surgically-resected lesions from sporadic cases lacking inherited germline mutations have shown somatic mutations of the same three CCM genes. This could point towards identical molecular mechanisms in both familial and sporadic cavernomas.
