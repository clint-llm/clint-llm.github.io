Beta-lactamase inhibitors work by one of two primary mechanisms. They may become substrates that bind the beta-lactamase enzyme with high affinity but form sterically unfavorable interactions, such as the acyl-enzyme. They may also become “suicide inhibitors,” which permanently inactivate the enzyme through secondary chemical reactions in the active site. Avibactam and relebactam work by the former mechanism, while sulbactam, tazobactam, and clavulanic acid work by the latter mechanism.****Beta-lactamase inhibitors are generally renally excreted and do not undergo significant hepatic or GI first-pass metabolism. Their metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties are influenced by their co-administration with beta-lactam antimicrobials as well as by the length of infusion, as most are delivered intravenously.

Avibactam has a half-life of approximately 2 hours, and administration is in combination with ceftazidime in a 1:4 combination. It is cleared renally with dose adjustment for patients with renal disease. The ceftazidime MIC is 8 mg/L at 4 mg/L avibactam concentrations. A dosing regimen of 2/0.5g ceftazidime/avibactam is used every 8 hours with a 2 hour infusion period for patients with normal kidney function.

Clavulanic acid has a half-life of approximately 47 minutes with and without amoxicillin, with 37% unchanged excretion in the urine alone and 57% with amoxicillin after the first 6 hours of administration. Current dosage formulations of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid use a 4 to 1 concentration ratio.

The pharmacokinetics of relebactam have been studied both alone and in combination with imipenem/cilastatin. Clearance is significantly affected by renal function as assessed by creatinine clearance. Metabolism of relebactam is not significantly affected by body weight or health status. A MIC of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/milliliter is achievable for patient groups by modifying the dosing regimens, with an optimal dose of 250 mg.

Sulbactam has a half-life of one hour and a volume of distribution of 12 liters. Seventy-five percent of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of sulbactam are not significantly impacted by the co-administration of sulbactam with beta-lactam antimicrobials.

The pharmacological properties of tazobactam have been studied both alone and in combination with piperacillin. The mean concentrations of tazobactam in plasma at 4 hrs are 1.2 micrograms per milliliter with piperacillin and 0.6 micrograms per milliliter alone. The clearance of tazobactam alone is 203.5 ml/min, while that with piperacillin is 134.2 ml/min. There appears to be no significant difference in the volume of distribution, elimination half-life, the volume of distribution, or AUC from 0 to infinity hours between tazobactam alone and tazobactam with piperacillin. The total renal clearance is 73 micrograms/milliliter, the half-life is 1 hr, and the AUC from 0 to infinity is 237 micrograms*hours/ml. The maximum concentrations of tazobactam is 6.4 micrograms/ml alone and 11.3 micrograms/ml with piperacillin. Tazobactam is excreted renally, both alone and with piperacillin. The mean 24-hour urinary excretion of tazobactam is 63.7% alone and 56.8% with piperacillin.

Vaborbactam concentration has been shown to increase in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting first-order kinetics, and does not accumulate with multiple doses. The terminal half-life of vaborbactam is 2.25 hours. Both the volume of distribution and the plasma clearance is independent of dose. With a 2000 mg dose, the plasma clearance is 7.95 liters/hour, the AUC from 0 h to infinity is 835 mg*h/liter, and the Vss is 18.6 liters. Vaborbactam undergoes renal excretion, and urinary recovery was 80% or greater over 48 h across all dose groups.

Tebipenem shows a dose-proportional plasma concentration, with a maximum concentration reached within 1.5 hours. Between 55 and 60% of the drug is recovered in the urine. The half-life ranges from 0.8 to 1.1 hours. Renal clearance is not affected by food.
