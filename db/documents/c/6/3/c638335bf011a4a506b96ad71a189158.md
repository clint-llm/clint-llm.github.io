Better outcomes are likely if patients are educated on the following:

- Avoid rubbing the eyelid, as this can exacerbate eyelid laxity.

- Adherence to treatment, including topical ointments, eyelid shields, and eyelid taping at night.

- A sleeping position that does not disturb the eyelid during the night. This most likely involves avoiding sleeping on the side or face down on the pillow.

- Adherence to CPAP therapy might reverse FES in patients on CPAP for OSA.
