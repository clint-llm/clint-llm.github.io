The pathophysiology and pathoanatomy result from the site of the deformity, as noted in the anatomy subheading. The critical lesion in forefoot driven pes cavus is thought to be the unopposed contraction (or passive contracture) of the peroneus longus and resultant plantarflexion of the first ray. Hindfoot driven pes cavus is the result of varus malalignment of the hindfoot, often in a compensatory pattern. Pes calcaneocavus, where the hindfoot is dorsiflexed and the forefoot plantarflexed in a compensatory fashion, is caused by calf weakness and is classically found after polio. Finally, the spasticity caused by cerebral palsy can result in a variety of foot shapes, including various types of cavus.
