Diagnosis of PIOL is very challenging as various infectious and non-infectious diseases can mimic the clinical condition. Various differentials include

**Inflammatory Diseases**

- Posterior uveitis/panuveitis

- Intermediate uveitis

- Sarcoidosis

- Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease

- Behçet disease

- Multifocal choroiditis

- Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome

- Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy

- Birdshot choroidopathy

- Serpiginous chorioretinopathy

- Frosted branch angiitis

**Infectious Diseases**

- Tubercular uveitis

- Endophthalmitis

- Syphilis

- Toxoplasmosis

- Acute retinal necrosis

- Herpetic uveitis

**Neoplasms**

- Amelanotic melanoma

- Metastatic cancers

In a study, the most useful signs to differentiate lymphoma from simulating conditions listed above were – better vision, less anterior chamber flare, less posterior synechiae, and less optic disc swelling, retinal vasculitis, or disc involvement.
