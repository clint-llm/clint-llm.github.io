Iatrogenic injury to the ICBN is most common during surgical procedures which involve the axilla. Of note, breast cancer procedures, especially for diagnostic and treatment reasons, increase ICBN susceptibility to injury.

The ICBN is a major anatomic structure involved in the surgical evaluation, imaging, and treatment of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the number two cause of cancer-related mortality in women and the most common site-specific malignancy in women overall. It is among the leading causes of death in women between the ages of 20 and 59 years old and accounts for nearly 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women.

It is important to take surgical precautions to avoid postoperative pain and loss of sensation following breast-related procedures. Postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS), for example, is a postoperative condition secondary to sensory nerve injury, including ICBN.
