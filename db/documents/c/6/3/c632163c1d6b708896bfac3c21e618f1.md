# Continuing Education Activity

Chronic pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, and neuropathic pain states like chronic regional pain syndrome, causalgia, and diabetic neuropathy, afflict a large group of the population. They pose a substantial economic burden on society. Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) offers a relatively safe and effective treatment modality in the treatment of such chronic pain conditions. This activity describes the importance of peripheral nerve stimulators and highlights the role of the interprofessional team, including the pain physician, anesthesiologist, and primary care physician, in evaluating and treating chronic pain patients who undergo peripheral nerve stimulators.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for peripheral nerve stimulator and when it is most beneficial. 
- Summarize the risks associated with peripheral nerve stimulator placement. 
- Review the most common adverse events associated with peripheral nerve stimulator placement.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance chronic pain patient care with peripheral nerve stimulator placement.

# Introduction

The concept of nerve stimulation/peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is not new and has been in practice since the early 19 century. However, clinical studies were done much later in this field. In 1976, Campbell et al. published the reports of the first set of clinical studies done in the field of pain management using PNS.

# Anatomy and Physiology

The determination of the nerve to be stimulated corresponds with the area where the pain relief is required. Any focal area of pain in the body can be managed by stimulation of the peripheral nerve supplying that particular dermatome. Nerve stimulation is broadly divided into electrical nerve stimulation and magnetic nerve stimulation.

**Electrical Nerve Stimulation**

The mechanism of electrical nerve stimulation is not fully understood, but the idea originates from the "gate control theory."

**Magnetic Nerve Stimulation**

A magnetic stimulator is not an implantable device and works by a different mechanism compared to an electrical nerve stimulator. The transcranial magnetic stimulator is a commonly used application of this technology. It consists of a capacitor that may be able to discharge current through a hand-held wire coil, which then produces a magnetic field lasting 100 to 200 microseconds. When held against the skull, this magnetic field can produce depolarization of cortical neurons. The following mechanisms have been proposed for the therapeutic effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation.

- Changes in brain monoamines

- Changes in cerebral blood flow

- Reduction of oxidative stress to neurons

For the purpose of this article, we will be describing implantable electric peripheral nerve stimulators in detail in the upcoming sections.

# Indications

PNS limits the amount of energy by using focalized current and has been used to treat a variety of chronic pain disorders.

Recently results of a study evaluating the use of PNS in the treatment of low back pain were reported. PNS was used to stimulate the medial branches of the dorsal ramus for 30 days, and after that, the leads were explanted.

There have also been reports of the effectiveness of Gasserian ganglion stimulation in the treatment of post-stroke facial pain.

# Contraindications

One of the main contraindications to performing this procedure is the presence of local infection at the site of stimulator lead placement. Performing this procedure in patients with active bleeding disorder requires extra caution as it can lead to hematoma formation.

# Equipment

PNS requires the availability of a nerve stimulation kit that usually includes a transducer needle and a stimulation electrode. After the patient is prepped under sterile conditions using a chlorhexidine/iodine solution, a sterile drape is used to cover the area of surgery. We identify the desired location of needle entry and administer local anesthesia. The target nerve is identified with the help of ultrasound guidance. A transducer needle is used to access the target nerve. The ideal target of stimulation is approximately 1 cm away from the target nerve. A PNS electrode is introduced through the transducer needle and is ideally set parallel to the nerve. The battery source is connected to the proximal end of the electrode. Once a connection is established, the electrode is tested intraoperatively to assess the distribution of paresthesia. If the paresthesia corresponds to the area of pain, the electrode is tunneled under the skin and secured in place using a suture.

This procedure is also performed by the direct exploration of the nerve where a surgeon (usually a neurosurgeon) dissects the area surrounding the nerve and places the electrode on top of the nerve.

Recently, surgeons have directed focus on using wireless nerve stimulation devices that preclude the use of an implantable pulse generator. These wireless devices use an implantable electrode that has inbuilt microelectrodes, which are stimulated by an external source generator, usually in the form of a patch or wearable device. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has approved 4 devices for wireless peripheral nerve stimulation.

# Personnel

Typically neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists trained in interventional pain medicine, and interventional radiologists perform peripheral nerve stimulator implantation. It is advised that physicians must have performed this procedure an adequate number of times under supervision before performing it independently.

# Complications

Like any other invasive procedure, common complications include infection, bleeding/hematoma formation, surgical site pain, and nerve injury.

Device-related complications include migration of the stimulator lead, lead fracture, and device malfunction.

# Clinical Significance

Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems and poses a considerable burden on the economy and society. Amid the current opioid crisis, there is a need for the exploration of alternative pain therapies. Peripheral nerve stimulation offers a relatively safe option for the management of such painful pain conditions. The use of peripheral nerve stimulation can provide regional anesthesia without exposing the patient to the systemic side effects of opioid medications. Since these procedures are minimally invasive, they offer an alternative for patients who are not candidates for major joint replacement surgeries secondary to contraindication to general anesthesia.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

For the success of this therapy, the physician performing PNS must be adequately trained in the procedure. A prior discussion is vital with the patient explaining all the risks and benefits of the procedure. A realistic expectation needs to be set with the patient about the outcomes of the therapy regarding his/her pain relief. PNS is best treated by an interprofessional team which may consist of primary care providers, neurologists, anesthesiologists, specialty pain and neuroscience nurses, and pharmacists.

There is a need for more randomized controlled trials to assess this novel therapy's full potential completely.
