The pericardium serves multiple functions. It acts as an anchor to the heart within the thoracic cavity, forms a barrier to extrinsic infection, and enhances dynamic interaction between the cardiac chambers.

Due to the parietal layer's rich innervation, any inflammatory process mediated by an infectious, autoimmune or traumatic insult can result in severe retrosternal chest pain, as is commonly seen in acute pericarditis.
