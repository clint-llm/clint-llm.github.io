Bowditch effect is essential to understanding the dynamics of a failing heart. A healthy heart can induce a positive Bowditch effect due to its alterations in sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca load, whereas a negative Bowditch effect is pathological. This negative Bowditch effect occurs from a diminished expression of the SERCA protein and is a characteristic ‘hallmark of heart failure’ in humans.

Testing with muscles from hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy exhibited reduced tension in the cardiac muscle, attributed to up to 45% less myofibrillar protein and reduced activation of the contractile proteins in myocyte in a failing heart. Other mechanisms proposed in changes to the tension-frequency relations can be due to the reduced number of SERCA pumps, decreased cAMP production, intracellular acidosis, or metabolic buildup secondary to the increased diffusion distances in hypertrophied myocytes.
