Cannabinoids function by stimulating two receptors, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2), within the endocannabinoid system. This system is a complex network of organs throughout the body, expressing the cannabinoid receptors and playing a homeostatic role. Functions of the endocannabinoid system include pain,

Endogenously, endocannabinoids serve as neuro-regulatory modulators responsible for retrograde neurotransmission. Here, a post-synaptic neuron releases endocannabinoids that bind to predominantly CB1 receptors on the presynaptic neuron. This binding results in inhibited presynaptic calcium channel activation and subsequent presynaptic neurotransmitter release.

Binding to the different parts of the central nervous system mediates different psychotropic properties of cannabinoids, particularly THC. These areas and end-effects include

- Hippocampus: impairment of short-term memory

- Neocortex: impairment of judgment and sensation

- Basal ganglia: altered reaction time and movement

- Hypothalamus: increased appetite

- Nucleus accumbens: euphoria

- Amygdala: panic and paranoia

- Cerebellum: ataxia

- Brainstem: anti-emesis

- Spinal cord: analgesia

Other end-effects of CB1 activation peripherally include dry mouth, conjunctivitis, tachycardia, hypotension, and bradypnea.
