The blood supply to the forearm is from the brachial artery. The brachial artery then branches into the radial and ulnar arteries. These arteries will descend into and perfuse the hand. The occlusion or compromise of any of these arteries will result in ischemia and cyanotic appearing hands.Â There will be necrosis of the hands if the blood supply is not promptly restored.
