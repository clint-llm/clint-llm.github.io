Triplane ankle fractures are distal tibia physeal fractures that occur in children from 10 to 17 years of age. The physis ossifies in a predictable order, and transitional ankle fractures occur in this period of incomplete physeal closure. Treatment depends on the quality of the reduction of the articular surface with patients with under 2 mm of displacement managed nonoperatively and those with over 2 mm displacement managed with closed versus open reduction and internal fixation. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of triplane ankle fractures and reviews the healthcare team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of triplane ankle fractures.
- Review the pathophysiology of triplane ankle fractures.
- Identify imaging findings associated with triplane ankle fractures.
- Explain the interprofessional team's importance in diagnosing and managing the triplane ankle fractures and providing the best possible care and education of the patient.
