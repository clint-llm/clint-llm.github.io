Multiple classifications can be utilized to describe Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. The lateral pillar, or Herring, classification is widely accepted with the best interobserver agreement. It is generally determined at the beginning of the fragmentation stage, approximately 6 months after initial symptom presentation. It cannot be used accurately if the patient has not entered the fragmentation stage radiographically. The goal is to provide prognostic information. This classification is based on the height of the lateral pillar on the AP X-ray image.

- Group A: The lateral pillar is at full height with no density changes. This group has a consistently good prognosis.

- Group B: The lateral pillar maintains greater than 50% height. There will be a poor outcome if the bone age is greater than 6.

- Group C: Less than 50% of the lateral pillar height is maintained. All patients will experience a poor outcome.
