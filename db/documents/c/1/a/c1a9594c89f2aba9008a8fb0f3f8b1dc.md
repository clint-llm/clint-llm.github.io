There are no significant contraindications except for hypersensitivity to clobazam. The Canadian labeling mentions contraindications with myasthenia gravis, narrow-angle glaucoma, severe hepatic or respiratory disease, sleep apnea, history of substance abuse.

Warnings/precautions for clobazam generally include: History of drug/alcohol abuse, hepatic impairment, concomitant use of other sedating drugs (BZD, opioids), muscle weakness/ataxia, psychiatric diseases (as it can cause paradoxical reactions like aggressive behavior), respiratory disease, and use in special populations like geriatric and/or poor CYP2C19 metabolizers. As with other benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation of clobazam can lead to withdrawal seizures and behavioral changes.

Clobazam crosses the placenta. It was considered Category “C” in pregnancy per the previous FDA grading system for pregnancy. Both clobazam and N-CLB are present in breast milk, but there is no contraindication against breastfeeding.
