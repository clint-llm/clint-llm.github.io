A pertinent history must be acquired when dealing with shoulder complaints. This includes age, arm dominance, location and intensity of pain, when the injury occurred, aggravating and alleviating factors, radiation of pain, and the mechanism of the injury.

Patients should be fully undressed to expose both shoulders and allow for a complete inspection. Assessment of the range of motion should be performed to evaluate the limits of internal and external rotation along with flexion and extension of the shoulder. Up to 50% of posterior dislocations are missed on the initial evaluation. On exam, assess for any associated neurovascular injuries. Inspection and palpation of the anterior, lateral, and posterior shoulder may show the posterior prominence of the shoulder with the loss of the normal anterior contour along with a prominent coracoid and acromion. The arm is usually adducted with slight internal rotation. Patients will not allow external rotation or abduction secondary to severe pain.
