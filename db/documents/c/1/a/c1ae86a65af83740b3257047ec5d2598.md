Treatment for tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis consists primarily of agents that promote surface hydration of the damaged cornea. Artificial tears (AT) and lubricants are commonly used. Topical corticosteroids can also be included in the treatment regimen to provide quick relief from discomfort by disrupting the inflammatory cycle. However, corticosteroid use is associated with increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma in susceptible individuals; therefore, a short course is generally advised. In severe cases of epithelial defects, bandage contact lenses may also be used. The contact lens acts to protect the cornea from injury as well as any shearing effects by the lids.

In a case study done by Johnson S. et al., a patient with a history of lung cancer was treated with erlotinib.

The use of human epidermal growth factor (EGF) drops is a novel treatment for EGFR-TKI keratitis. In Kawakami’s report, a patient developed filamentous keratitis shortly after starting cetuximab for metastatic colorectal cancer.
