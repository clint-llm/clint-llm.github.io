Indications for urodynamic testing include:

- Complicated SUI

- Failed surgical treatment

- Patients over 60 years old

- Continuous/unpredictable leakage

- History of radical pelvic surgery or pelvic irradiation

Evidence indicates that urodynamic testing is not necessarily needed before surgical management because it may not affect treatment outcomes.

Referral to a urogynecologist or urologist should be considered for several reasons:

- If the diagnosis is uncertain

- Equivocal urodynamic testing

- Medical therapy fails

- Neurologic condition

- Failed prior surgery

- Hematuria without infection

- Recurrent UTI

Inexperienced providers may refer the patient for medical or surgical treatment and opt to co-manage.
