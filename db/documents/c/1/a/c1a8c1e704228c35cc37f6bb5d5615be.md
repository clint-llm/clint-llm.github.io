**Modes of Transmission**

**Occupational Exposures**

HIV transmission occurs through direct exposure to infected blood or secretions. This can happen in an occupational setting through accidental needlesticks or cuts with a sharp object.

**Potentially Infectious Body Fluids**

Exposure to blood or other bodily fluids, including vaginal secretions, semen, CSF, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and amniotic fluid, can expose healthcare workers to bloodborne pathogens like HIV.

**Risk Factors Associated with Increased HIV Infection**

Following established recommendations and protocols is necessary to decrease the risk of occupational exposure to HIV infection. Factors associated with increased risk include:

- Lack of universal precautions

- Failure to follow safety protocol

- Use of sharp devices without safety features

- Exposure to a higher quantity of blood or large-bore needle

**Practices that Prevent HIV Exposure**

**Overview**

There is no vaccine for HIV. However, prevention of HIV exposure is the best way to prevent transmission in the healthcare setting. Among healthcare laboratory personnel, bloodborne viruses are responsible for most laboratory-acquired infections. Education, training, and biosafety protocols should be in place to reduce the potential risk of disease transmission.

**Engineering Controls**

Engineering controls are tools made to remove equipment from the workplace that may be contaminated.

- Dispose of sharps in sharps containers

- Avoid recapping used needles

- Use shields and retractable needles

- Use plastic blood tubes instead of glass

Exposure prevention is critical to preventing transmitting HIV and other bloodborne pathogens.

**Sharps**

Sharp injuries may result from needles, scalpels, razors, or lancets. All sharps must be disposed of in a specified, puncture-proof container.

**Work Practice Controls**

These controls reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens.

- Wear gloves when there is direct contact with blood and bodily fluid.

- Wear masks, eyeglasses, and waterproof gowns during procedures where blood splashing may occur.

- Do not perform mouth pipetting.

- Avoid contact with mucosal surfaces, such as eating, drinking, smoking, applying lip balm, or handling contact lenses.

**Handwashing**

Proper hand hygiene is one of the most effective ways to control infection and prevent disease transmission after exposure. CDC guidelines recommend handwashing with soap and water for 20 seconds or using an alcohol hand rub with 60% alcohol. Hand hygiene should occur after touching a patient, cleaning a soiled site, contacting bodily fluids, and touching contaminated surfaces.

**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

PPE is essential in the laboratory. It protects healthcare workers from potential exposure by creating a physical barrier. Basic PPE includes masks, gowns or coats, gloves, and face shields.

**Gloves**

Healthcare workers must wear gloves when encountering bodily fluids, collecting blood or fluids, and contacting contaminated surfaces. Gloves must be changed when there is a tear, damage, or contamination. They must also be changed before leaving the work area and between patient encounters.

**Disinfection**

HIV can persist on dry surfaces for more than seven days.
