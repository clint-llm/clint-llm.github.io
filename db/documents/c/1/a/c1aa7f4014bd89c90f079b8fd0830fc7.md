Aside from commonly associated symptoms mentioned previously, more serious CNS complications have been correlated to cases of spontaneous ICH. These complications are thought to be secondary to the deformity of CNS structures as a result of compression. These rare manifestations have presented clinically as galactorrhea, hyperprolactinemia, ataxia, quadriparesis, cerebellar hemorrhage, posterior circulation infarction, movement disorders, decreased level of consciousness, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
