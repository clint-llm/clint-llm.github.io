There have been studies of various suspected risk factors associated with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. Approximately two-thirds of the observed studies on ANUG have been surveys or case reports, the remaining being case-control studies. Only a few longitudinal and population-based studies are available, mostly in high-risk populations. The findings of many of these studies pertain to gingivitis in general rather than acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis specifically. Other existing studies are based on small numbers or solely on case histories without the inclusion of control subjects, which leaves much to be desired in this field of research. However, as mentioned above, the epidemiology and low observed prevalence of ANUG in the population severely limits most longitudinal studies at this time.
