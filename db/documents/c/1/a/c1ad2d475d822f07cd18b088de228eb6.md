Alcohol use syndrome is one of the most common causes of both acute and chronic pancreatitis but likely requires other factors such as smoking and diet to manifest.

- Alcohol-induced pancreatitis likely results from alcohol causing increased, viscous secretions that block small pancreatic ducts and by premature activation of digestive and lysosomal enzymes within acinar cells.

- Diagnosis of AP requires meeting at least two of the following three criteria: characteristic clinical features, lipase levels three times the upper limit of normal, and/or imaging suggestive of pancreatitis.

- Treatment includes a combination of goal-directed fluid therapy, pain control, antiemetics, electrolyte replacement, early enteral nutrition, and alcohol cessation counseling.
