The fibula is a long bone situated in the lateral aspect of the distal lower extremity; it is closely articulated to the tibia via the interosseous membrane as well as proximal and distal tibiofibular joints. The proximal tibiofibular joint is synovial in nature and reduces torsional stress in the lower extremity; the distal tibiofibular joint is considered syndesmotic and possesses very limited mobility.

The fibula is composed of three parts:

- Head

- Neck

- Shaft

- Distal end of the fibula

The fibula has three surfaces:

- Lateral

- Medial

- Posterior

The shape of the fibular shaft is determined by the muscle attachments. The distal end of the fibula comprises the lateral malleolus, which articulates with the lateral talus, creating part of the ankle. Mean fibula length is 387.4 ± 23.7 mm in male patients and 361.5 ± 12.3 mm in female patients; close to 30 centimeters can often be harvested.

Ossification of the fibula takes place in three areas, in the center and at the epiphyses at either end. The process of ossification ends in the second decade of life. The common peroneal nerve courses around the neck of the fibula, and this is clinically relevant because the nerve may be injured in fractures of the neck of the fibula.

Understanding the blood supply of the fibula is critical when planning the transfer of vascularized fibula flaps. Long bones generally possess three separate blood supplies: endosteal nutrient vessels, penetrating periosteal vessels typical of the metaphysis and epiphysis, and nonpenetrating periosteal vessels typical of the diaphysis.

**Joints and Supporting Structures**

Proximal Tibiofibular Joint

The synovial joint between the head of the fibula and lateral condyle of the tibia is supported by a joint capsule, anterior and posterior superior tibiofibular ligaments, the lateral collateral ligament, and the biceps femoris.

Distal Tibiofibular Joint

The fibrous joint between the fibular notch and distal tibia is supported by an interosseous membrane, anterior and posterior inferior tibiofibular ligaments, and the inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament.
