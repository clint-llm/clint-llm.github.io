Radiological examination using a single or double-contrast technique is more sensitive than the endoscopic exam in diagnosing esophageal intramuralÂ pseudodiverticulosis (EIP) because diverticular orifices can be tiny and hence difficult to visualize with endoscopy.

Furthermore, endoscopy is important in diagnosing or excluding coexisting conditions like strictures, Barret esophagus, esophagitis, or cancer by direct visualization and/or biopsy.
