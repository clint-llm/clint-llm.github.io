Amlodipine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amlodipine or its dosage form components. In addition, amlodipine is relatively contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, severe aortic stenosis, unstable angina, severe hypotension, heart failure, and hepatic impairment. According to the manufacturer's labeling, patients with severe coronary artery disease may have worsening angina after initiating amlodipine therapy.

In cardiogenic shock, the heart cannot pump effectively, which is exacerbated by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into cardiac cells. In severe aortic stenosis, amlodipine can cause ventricular collapse and dysfunction. Amlodipine causes a reflexive increase in cardiac contractility in unstable angina, increasing myocardial oxygen demand and worsening ischemia. Amlodipine can further reduce blood pressure, hypoperfusion to vital organs, and syncope in patients with severe hypotension.

Patients with hepatic impairment may not metabolize amlodipine effectively, leading to a longer half-life with possible increases in plasma concentrations.
