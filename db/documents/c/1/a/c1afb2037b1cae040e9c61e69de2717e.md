Clinical manifestation of different myeloproliferative neoplasms are as follows:

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): Patient may be asymptomatic with an abnormal blood test, but common clinical manifestations include easy fatiguability, anorexia, weight loss, generalized malaise, sweating, abdominal discomfort or pain, abdominal fullness, early satiety, easy bruising, and bleeding. Physical examination may be positive for pallor, ecchymoses, and hepatosplenomegaly. In addition, priapism and sweet syndrome are rare findings.

Polycythemia vera (PV): Patients with PV have increased red cell mass which contributes to hyperviscosity, hypoxia, and thrombosis. Clinical manifestations of PV include headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, pruritus, malaise, tinnitus, paresthesia, erythromelalgia, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, bleeding, and symptoms related to thrombosis. Patients often present with aquagenic pruritus, which is itching/stinging or burning sensation after warm bath or shower. Physical findings may include hepato-splenomegaly, facial plethora, superficial thrombophlebitis, gouty arthritis, conjunctival injection, and hypertension.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET): Clinical symptoms of ET varies from asymptomatic presentation to symptoms due to thrombosis, bleeding, and vasomotor symptoms. Common symptoms include a headache, dizziness, visual changes, paresthesia, fatigue, and easy bruising. Microvascular occlusions involving vessels of distal extremities may cause erythromelalgia and gangrene. A patient may present with stroke symptoms due to thromboembolic complications. Physical examination findings may include splenomegaly, which is more common than hepatomegaly.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF): The common symptoms include fatigue, night sweats, low-grade fever, early satiety, weight loss, abdominal fullness or discomfort, dysuria, hematuria, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, arthralgia, and bony pain. PMF is characterized by extramedullary hematopoiesis and BM fibrosis. Physical examination findings include pallor, petechiae, ecchymoses, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites, pulmonary edema, seizure, altered mental status, and spinal cord compression.

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL): Most patients are asymptomatic, but common symptoms on presentation include fatigue, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, easy bruising, and bone pain. A patient may have splenomegaly at diagnosis on physical examination.
