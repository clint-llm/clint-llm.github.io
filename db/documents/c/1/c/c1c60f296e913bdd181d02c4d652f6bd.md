Rheumatic heart disease commonly causes MS, thought to be related to an exaggerated immune response secondary to cross-reactivity between streptococcal antigen and MV tissue.

Clinicians can best accomplish quantification of MS with echocardiography, based on mean diastolic transmitral pressure gradient, MV area, and LA and right-sided chamber sizes and pressures.

MR can be defined as primary or secondary depending on whether the abnormality is located at the level of the mitral valve apparatus or the left ventricle, respectively. In developing countries, mitral valve prolapse is the most common cause of MR requiring surgical repair, while degenerative disease is most common in the United States.

MR leads to LA and LV volume overload, depending on the time course of the MR (acute vs. chronic) and the magnitude of the regurgitant volume. Acute MR leads to a sudden increase in preload and LV filling pressures that can cause pulmonary edema. Cardiac output also becomes reduced since blood flow now gets directed to the LA, which can precipitate cardiogenic shock; this is a common presentation in patients with infective endocarditis, chordae tendinae rupture, or papillary muscle rupture following myocardial infarction (MI). Chronic MR divides into three stages: a compensated stage where most patients are asymptomatic, a transitional stage with LV remodeling, and a decompensated stage marked by insidious symptom development. Chronic MR also leads to LA enlargement, which increases the risk for atrial arrhythmias and thromboemboli. Carpentier developed a functional classification of MR based on leaflet motion.[11]

Echocardiography is the modality of choice for the categorization of MR. Color Doppler is useful in assessing the jet area, as well as its ratio to the LA area. A jet over 40% of the LA area suggests severe MR. In severe MR, measured peak mitral inflow velocity is usually more than 120 cm/sec, and diastolic reversal of pulmonary venous flow is present.
