APUDomas, currently known as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), are a group of heterogeneous tumors that arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Although these tumors are relatively rare, their incidence has been increasing. The workup, diagnosis, and management of this disease process require an interprofessional approach. They occur mainly in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. Therefore, these patients are typicallyÂ evaluated by endocrinologists, oncologists, and gastroenterologists. Primary care clinicians and pain management specialists should also be aware of this clinical entity. Management of these patients requires an interprofessional approach by surgeons, oncologists, and endocrinologists. They are assisted at each step by nurses, technicians, and anesthesia providers. Finally, the medical management of this disease is facilitated by pharmacists and their staff.
