Scapular fractures are uncommon, accounting for less than 1 percent of all fractures. This may be because they typically result from high-energy trauma which often occurs with multi-system injuries. Treatment for most scapular fractures is conservative, with the use of short-term immobilization along with motion exercises to prevent adhesive capsulitis, also called frozen shoulder. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of scapular fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of scapular fractures. 
- Review the common presenting features of scapular fractures. 
- Identify the best management strategies for scapular fractures. 
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to conservatively manage scapular fractures which will result in higher quality care and better patient outcomes.
