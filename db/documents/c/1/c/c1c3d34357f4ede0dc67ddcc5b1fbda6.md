In Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, the primary defect is the loss of proteins in the kidney. Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type is due to mutation of the NPHS1 gene on chromosome 19 encoding nephrin, one of the structural proteins that form the kidney filtration barrier. The kidney filtration barrier has three layers of epithelial cell layer composed of (podocyte) with distal foot processes and slit diaphragms (SD) interspersed, glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and fenestrated capillary endothelium. Nephrin localizes to the slit diaphragm, and its defect leads to proteinuria.

Proteinuria leads to albuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Hyperlipidemia is due to the increased lipoprotein synthesis secondary to hypoalbuminemia, which causes increased platelet aggregation and thrombosis. The loss of minerals and vitamins predispose to malnutrition and infections.
