The hinge joints, just like most joints of the body can undergo degeneration of articular cartilage and develop OA, especially the knee and IP joints of the hands and feet. Trauma, activity level, weight, lifestyle, and genetics all play a role in the development of OA. Treatment centers around activity modification, physical therapy, NSAIDs, steroids, and replacement.

Dislocation of any hinge joint is also possible but occurs most often in the IP joints. Treatment of IP dislocations usually involves reduction and splinting as opposed to elbow, knee, and ankle dislocations that often require surgical treatment to repair surrounding structures.

All hinge joints become less stable as ligaments become compromised. The ligaments of the ankle are commonly injured when one sustains an ankle sprain. The lateral collateral ligaments of the ankle are injured most commonly with the majority of ankle sprains being low grade and managed with conservative treatment.
