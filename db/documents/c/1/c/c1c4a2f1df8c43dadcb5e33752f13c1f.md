The acute care surgeon needs to coordinate care with the intensive care team involved in the resuscitation of these critically ill patients to identify changing fluid goals to achieve fascial closure. Soon after resuscitation is complete, active fluid management must become the prime focus of all concerned. Many patients are kept intubated with an open abdomen, but sedation can be weaned to maintain a Richmond agitation sedation score (RASS) of 0, a calm state, especially with the common use of NPWT. This helps to minimize fluid from sedation infusions, and it will help the rehabilitation of the patient once fascial closure is achieved. Lastly, since the bowel may be in discontinuity, it is absolutely critical that the surgeon evaluates the patientâ€™s baseline nutritional status and discusses with the team a strategy using enteral or parenteral nutrition to aid in wound healing.
