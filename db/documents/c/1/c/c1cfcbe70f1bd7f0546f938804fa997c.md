Reduction of strenuous physical requirements is the main primary prevention for mechanical back strains; however, secondary prevention rather than primary prevention is more practical due to the high prevalence of the condition. The greatest risk factor is the recurrence of a previous episode. Some interventions by employers that may aid in injury prevention are stretching exercises at the workplace, appropriate rest breaks, and ergonomic modifications. Ergonomic modifications refer to adaptations in the work environment to reduce the physical stress of the employees. Also, educating patients regarding the importance of maintaining proper posture and correct lifting techniques may aid in prevention. Other prevention techniques that patients can use aim to reduce the risk factors of having a poor prognosis, including exercising, smoking cessation, weight loss for obese patients, and resuming normal physical activity.
