The phrenic nerve is a peripheral nerve that originates from the neural crest cells and is derived from the neural plate. Neurulation, or the development of the neural plate, begins after the third week of fertilization. At weeks 5 through 6, the septum transversum, forming the thoracic diaphragm, descends from the cervical vertebrae to the thoracolumbar vertebrae. The phrenic nerve descends along with the septum transversum, carrying innervation from the ventral rami from C3 through C5.
