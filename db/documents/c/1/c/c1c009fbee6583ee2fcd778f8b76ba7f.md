Infiltrating lobular breast cancer has low rates (0 to 11%) of complete pathological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The positive resection margins after breast conservation surgery are relatively frequent. 17% to 65% of the cases undergo another surgical intervention. The detection rates of mutations in CDH1/E-cadherin range between 12% and 83%. Several additional molecular factors, namely TP53, PIK3CA, FOXA1, ZNF703, FGFR1, and BCAR4, have been linked to infiltrating lobular breast cancer or the evolution of lobular carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer.
