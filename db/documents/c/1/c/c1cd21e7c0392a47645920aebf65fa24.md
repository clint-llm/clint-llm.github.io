A cerebrovascular accident, more commonly known as a “stroke,” is broadly classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic. In either category, the result is a loss of blood flow, nutrients, and oxygen to a region of the brain, resulting in neuronal damage and subsequent neurological deficits. There are numerous causes of stroke, such as prolonged hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and emboli, that have formed as a result of atrial fibrillation or rheumatic fever (see images 2 and 3). In younger patients, the possible list of causes may be broadened to include clotting disorders and various forms of vasculitis. In children, sickle cell anemia is also a common cause of stroke. In the event of a possible stroke presentation, a precise history and physical must be performed alongside emergent neurological imaging before administering any form of treatment. With early, focused treatment based on the stroke etiology, rehabilitation programs, and long-term lifestyle changes, one can maximize their chances for a meaningful recovery.
