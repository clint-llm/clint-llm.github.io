There is a lack of robust clinical trial data describing the toxicity associated with remdesivir. However, aÂ randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, phase I study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety profile of single-dose and multiple-dose remdesivir compared to placebo in healthy subjects reported that remdesivir was well tolerated in both study groups with no serious toxic effects or associated mortality with its clinical use.
