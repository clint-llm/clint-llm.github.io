Preparation begins with consent, either from the patient or a delegated individual making decisions on behalf of the patient. Once it is agreed to carry on with the procedure, the patient’s medical optimization becomes the next course of action. This includes ensuring that the patient is medically stable before the procedure. With scheduled procedures, the patient should be made NPO 12 hours before reducing the risk of vomiting or, worse, aspiration.
