Management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis centers around the decision to initiate antimicrobials based on the physician's clinical assessment and with the consideration of benefits of treatment, the natural course of the disease if left untreated, antibiotic resistance, and the philosophy of antibiotic stewardship. Several clinical features make the diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis more likely; however, the presentation remains variable. Distinguishing bacterial conjunctivitis from other etiologies can be difficult, and practitioners often err on the side of empiric antibiotic therapy.
