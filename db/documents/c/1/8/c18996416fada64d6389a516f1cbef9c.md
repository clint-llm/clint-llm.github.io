Patient education and reassurance are essential as the majority of serous cystadenomas are considered benign. Most of these lesions are discovered incidentally on cross-sectional imaging; however, patients knowledge of their own personal and family history in regards of previous episodes of pancreatitis that may lead to the formation of pseudocysts or any hereditary or genetic familial syndrome that may be associated with pancreatic lesions as in Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) syndrome can be very helpful. Patients should be counseled about the importance of reporting new symptoms such as jaundice, abdominal pain, and early satiety that warrant further investigation to assess for complicated disease and rule out pancreatic tumors. In addition, patient education about the importance of regular surveillance imaging is essential, given the great impact on the prognosis and survival rates in case the tumor grows in size or has any degree of dysplasia.
