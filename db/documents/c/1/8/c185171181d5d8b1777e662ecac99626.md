Cochlear implants are contraindicated in several patient populations. It merits mentioning that patients who meet criteria but wish to avoid surgery are not candidates. There are alternative forms of communication that require explanation, such as sign language. Patients born without a cochlea (cochlear aplasia) or cranial nerve VIII would not be candidates. Conversely, cochlear hypoplasia (a form of altered cochlear anatomy) is not a contraindication to cochlear implantation; such as a Mondini malformation (incomplete turns or partitions of the cochlea, a congenital defect). Patients who cannot tolerate general anesthesia are not candidates. Patients who have conductive hearing loss, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, or hearing loss serviceable by hearing aids would all be better served by an alternative management plan that an otolaryngologist would be able to recommend. Cochlear implants do not fix all types of hearing loss. Thus it is imperative to have a thorough evaluation by an otolaryngologist in conjunction with an audiologist to ascertain the type and severity of hearing loss and then provide measures to correct the hearing loss.
