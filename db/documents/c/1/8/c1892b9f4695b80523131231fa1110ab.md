Blood vessels must maintain their integrity to effectively deliver blood to the body’s vital organs and tissues. When damage occurs to the walls of a blood vessel, the physiological, reparative mechanism of hemostasis prevents further bleeding. Hemostasis occurs in two phases: platelet activation to form a static plug and stabilization of this plug through extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways, known as primary and secondary hemostasis, respectively. This article reviews the physiological components of platelet activation during primary hemostasis.
