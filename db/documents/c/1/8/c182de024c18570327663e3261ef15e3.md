As with any blunt head injury, rehabilitation can be a critical part of recovery after a temporal bone fracture. Patients may require physical and occupational therapy after concussion; vestibular rehabilitation may also be useful, particularly in the event of otic capsule disruption. If hearing loss occurs as a sequela of temporal bone fracture, audiological care will be needed, and this may include fitting hearing aids or programming and managing cochlear implants. Follow-up should also include monitoring for CSF leaks or observing a known leak and ensuring signs of meningitis do not develop. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks do not necessarily require prophylactic antibiotics, but a high index of suspicion should be maintained for meningitis because the risk of infection is higher in patients with CSF fistulae.

With respect to facial paralysis, patients who recover some movement but do not recover completely normal function may require rehabilitation therapy for synkinesis or chemodenervation.
