Also known as chondroid hamartomas, the histological makeup of these tumors is a mixture of mature mesenchymal tissue, like adipose tissue, cartilage, bone, or smooth muscle bundles, and fibromyxoid tissue, with varying proportions of each component. They are non-invasive, slow-growing, nodular lesions, sometimes displaying cleft-like spaces within, lined by respiratory epithelium.
