The flexor digitorum profundus physiologic variants are causes of spontaneous flexor tendon ruptures as described in the literature. The two ulnar flexor digitorum profundus tendons usually originate from the same muscle belly and separate in the forearm or carpal tunnel. However, several case reports have described a variant of the flexor digitorum profundus little finger tendon in which the tendons of the little and ring finger are fused together at the midpalmar level.
