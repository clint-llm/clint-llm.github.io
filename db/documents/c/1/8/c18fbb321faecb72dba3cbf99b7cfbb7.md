MET is most commonly used for treating low back pain complaints associated with sacral dysfunctions. However, due to the close relationship between the sacral plexus innervation in the pelvis, the sacrum, and surrounding structures, dysfunctions may also lead to changes in parasympathetic tone, affecting the large intestine and genitourinary systems.
