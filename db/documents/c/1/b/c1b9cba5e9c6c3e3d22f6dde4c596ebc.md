Certain precautions need to be taken when using an incentive spirometer. Although there is no absolute contraindication for spirometry, the following conditions are considered a need for caution when performing inspiratory muscle training: the presence of a respiratory tract infection, hemoptysis of unknown origin, pneumothorax, uncontrolled hypertension, aneurysm, recent thoracic, abdominal, or eye surgery, nausea, vomiting or pain, and confusion or dementia.

Patients with bullous emphysema should be cautious of using an incentive spirometer with high intensity. There has been a report of a patient with emphysema that was thought to sustain a partial lung collapse following aggressive use of an incentive spirometer. The development of the pneumothorax may have been related to the patient's repeated forceful inspirations under resistance in the setting of emphysema and lung hyperinflation. Inspiratory breathing under resistance can cause large swings in intrathoracic pressure, resulting in increased stress on the lung tissue.
