According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), 85% of flight-related accidents in the last 20 years have been due to “pilot error”, despite the aviation culture having the motto of “Safety First.” This is thought to be attributable to the training focused primarily on flight skill and proficiency and less so on risk identification strategies, disclosure, and mitigation of identified risks. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires all aviators to complete a preflight risk assessment checklist, evaluating the individual risk factors affecting the safety of flight as they relate to the environment, the airframe, mission complexity, external pressures on the crew (mission, supervisor, home, etc) and the pilot. This activity will focus on the human factors relating to flight safety decisions, mitigation strategies, and the GO-NO GO decision.  I-M-S-A-F-E is a common mnemonic to help review these factors.
