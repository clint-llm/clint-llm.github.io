Magnesium serves as a co-factor for over 300 biochemical reactions within the body. Magnesium's importance is in protein synthesis, nerve and muscle functioning, bone growth, regulation of blood pressure and glucose, and normal cardiac rhythm. An average adult has approximately 22 to 26 grams of magnesium. Approximately 60% of the total is stored in bone, 39% is stored intracellularly, and only 1% is found in its free or ionized active form in blood vessels. Magnesium is also involved in sodium, potassium, and calcium channels. The homeostasis of magnesium depends on kidney and small bowel function and storage in bone and cells. When these processes are affected, whether it is due to under-excretion by the kidneys, over-absorbance by the small bowel, or displacement of stored magnesium into the serum, hypermagnesemia occurs and leads to magnesium toxicity. The most common findings of early-onset toxicity are diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, muscle weakness, and low blood pressure. However, as levels continue to rise, patients experience loss of deep tendon reflexes, sinoatrial (SA) or atrioventricular (AV) node blocks, respiratory paralysis, and, eventually, cardiac arrest.
