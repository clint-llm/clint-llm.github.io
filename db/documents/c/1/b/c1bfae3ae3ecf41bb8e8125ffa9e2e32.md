Understanding the branching of the bronchial tree and pulmonary vasculature is integral to understanding surgical techniques for lung resection. The right lung comprises three lobes, while the left lung has two lobes. The right-sided airway has a relatively short right mainstem bronchus with the first branch into the right upper lobe (RUL) followed by bronchus intermedius (BI). The bronchus intermedius then branches into the right middle lobe (RML) anteriorly and right lower lobe (RLL). The left side has a longer (approximately 4Â to 5 cm) and more horizontally oriented left mainstem bronchus, which divides into a left upper lobe (LUL), and a left lower lobe (LLL) bronchus.

A standard PSR is considered when a formal lobe is resected with a portion of the bronchus followed by re-anastomosis of the bronchi's cut-ends. Extended sleeve resection is considered with multiple lobes resected, for example, RUL and RML bi-lobectomy with bronchial reconstruction.
