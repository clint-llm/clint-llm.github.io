Beryllium is a naturally-found alkaline earth metal and can be released from the Earth's crust into the air and waterways. Individuals working in certain fields, such as nuclear, defense, electronics, biomedical, and semiconductor industries, are at higher risk for occupational exposure and subsequent disease development.

Beryllium is toxic as both a skin irritant and an inhaled substance and can result in dermatitis, acute pneumonitis, and chronic pulmonary disease. The first signs of serious or life-threatening acute beryllium exposure may involve difficulty breathing, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Despite increasing governmental regulations limiting exposure to beryllium in high-risk occupations, any amount of beryllium can cause short-term and long-term diseases.

In cases of suspected beryllium poisoning with acute symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain, transfer to the nearest emergency department.

The Poison Control Center may be contacted for further recommendations.

If there is concern about a hazardous amount of occupational beryllium exposure, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) may be contacted for further investigation.
