Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic catecholamine that exerts its pharmacologic effects on both alphaÂ and beta-adrenergic receptors using a G protein-linked second messenger system. It has a greater affinity for beta receptors in small doses. However, large doses produce selective action on alpha receptors. Through its action on alpha-1 receptors, epinephrine induces increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, pupillary dilator muscle contraction, and intestinal sphincter muscle contraction. Other significant effects include increased heart rate, myocardial contractility, and renin release via beta-1 receptors. Beta-2 effects produce bronchodilation, which may be useful as an adjunct treatment of asthma exacerbations and vasodilation, tocolysis, and increased aqueous humor production.
