GV or torsion of the gallbladder is a rare condition. It presents a challenge for early diagnosis preoperatively, despite advances in imaging and laboratory investigation. A high index of suspicion in all elderly patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute or non-resolving symptoms of cholecystitis will enhance early diagnosis, especially when gallstones are absent. The best patient outcome is achieved with the early use of diagnostic imaging and prompt surgical intervention for removal of the gallbladder. The surgeon's alertness to consider the possibility of this diagnosis will avoid treatment delays that may result in a fatality.
