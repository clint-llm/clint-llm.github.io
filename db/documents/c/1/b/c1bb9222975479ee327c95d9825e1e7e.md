Anterior elbow dislocations require communication within the interprofessional team. Anterior elbow dislocations should be urgently examined by the clinician to make sure the patient's upper extremity is neurovascularly intact, with no compartment syndrome, and no fracture or open fracture. The closed reduction and splinting can be done by the emergency provider or by the orthopedic surgeon. Close follow-up with the orthopedic surgeon is very important, and this is where effective communication within the interprofessional team is essential. The team needs to make sure they are informed about the patient and make sure the patient has the information they need to follow up in a timely manner for re-evaluation. This effective communication within the team improves patient outcomes.
