BNP and NT-proBNP levels may be affected by specific comorbidities, such as chronic renal failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

The body mass index (BMI) is another variable influencing the reference intervals for BNP and NT-proBNP. Patients with a BMI in the obese range have lower BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations than patients with a normal or underweight BMI. There have been several theories as to the mechanism for these observations.

All immunoassays for BNP and NT-proBNP are heterogeneous, using a separation step between bound and free antibodies; there are no problems with photometric interferents such as hemoglobin, bilirubin, or lipemia.

proBNP also exists in the blood of heart failure patients as an O-linked glycoprotein. There are seven potential glycosylation sites from the center of the molecule (from the non-BNP amino acid sequences).

The relative composition of blood with regard to the various BNP, NT-proBNP, proBNP, and glycosylated forms present in the blood of patients with heart failure is not known.
