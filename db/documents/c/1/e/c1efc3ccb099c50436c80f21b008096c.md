There are many staging systems that have been used for the classification of pelvic organ prolapse. However, many systems rely on interobserver reliability, require multiple measurements, and make the agreement in stage among different examiners difficult.

The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system was created in 2002.

- Stage 0: no demonstrable prolapse

- Stage 1: the most distal portion of the prolapsed segment is >1 cm above the level of the hymen

- Stage 2: the most distal portion of the prolapsed segment is >1 cm or less proximal or distal to the hymen

- Stage 3: the most distal portion of the prolapsed segment protrudes >1 cm below the hymen but 2 cm less than the total length of the vagina

- Stage 4: complete eversion of the vagina
