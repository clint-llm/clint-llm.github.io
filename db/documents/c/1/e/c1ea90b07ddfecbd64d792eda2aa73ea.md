The primary goal of treating psychiatric disorders is to improve the functionality of the patients in the society. While the stigma due to the origins of psychosurgery still looms, the utilization of neuromodulatory surgery to treat the psychiatric disorder is nowadays backed by not only a more profound understanding of brain structure and function, but also the development of new stereotactic microsurgical technique and results about successful management of other neurological disorders through neuromodulation. This fountain of knowledge has led to the development of treatment options that target a particular region of the brain and effects that can be reversible, unlike the earlier process like prefrontal leucotomy that involves the permanent removal of parts of the brain.

Only patients with severe, chronic, disabling, and treatment-refractory psychiatric illness should be considered for surgical intervention. Psychiatric disorders that might benefit from surgical intervention include OCD and major affective disorder (unipolar major depression or bipolar disorder). Schizophrenia diagnosis is not currently considered a clear indication for surgery. Ablative procedures, including cingulotomy, anterior capsulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and limbic leucotomy, are psychosurgical procedures still used today in some cases.

The concept of DBS in treating psychiatric disorders can be attributed to its success in treating movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.

DBS modulation can use several different targets, but current literature does not demonstrate clear superiority among these targets.

For OCD, traditional ablative lesions include anterior cingulotomy, capsulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and limbic leucotomy. DBS to anterior limb internal capsule, ventral capsule, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, subthalamic nucleus, inferior thalamic peduncle, or globus pallidus internus produces a positive response in 40-90% of the patients.

Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is a recognized idiopathic neuropsychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population. Dysfunction in the cortico–basal ganglia–thalamocortical network is thought to be the pathophysiologic basis of impairment. DBS of the thalamus, globus pallidus internus, globus pallidus externus, internal capsule, or nucleus accumbens has been used to treat refractory TS.

Case reports for neuromodulation of the nucleus accumbens, and the anterior limb of the internal capsule has successfully been used for preventing heroin use relapse.

DBS to the subcallosal cingulate or the nucleus accumbens for AN had been used with promising results in mood with a significant increase in body-mass index.

Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) was initially developed to treat medical treatment-resistant epilepsy.

Other neuromodulation techniques that have been used for the treatment of psychiatric disorders that do not involve the application of a surgical device are TMS and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has been widely reported in the literature as one of the most effective treatments for chronic major depression and pharmacotherapy-resistant major depression.

Ongoing research in the pathophysiologic understanding of these circuits and targets is critical for the potential neurosurgical treatments of schizophrenia. The possibility of targeting the associative striatum, anterior hippocampus, and ventral striatum for therapeutic neuromodulation with DBS is being considered for schizophrenia.
