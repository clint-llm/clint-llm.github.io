Peripheral blood eosinophilia may be found in some patients. Direct immunofluorescence staining on skin biopsy specimen is similar to the other forms of pemphigus: interkeratinocytic deposits of IgG and C3 most often seen in the superficial layers of the epidermis. Less commonly, these immunoreactants can be seen in the lower layers of the epidermis, mainly when circulating autoantibodies against Dsg3 are present. Indirect immunofluorescence with healthy human skin, the monkey/guinea pig esophagus or rat bladder as a substrate may reveal intercellular binding of IgG antibodies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and/or immunoblotting can reveal circulating antibodies targeting epidermal proteins, mainly Dsg1, less commonly Dsg3. Recently, other target antigens have been reported such as Dsc1, Dsc3, 178-Kd antigen, BP 180 C-terminus, and laminin 332 gamma2 subunit.
