Type 2 diabetes in children is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, primary care provider, diabetic nurse, endocrinologist, and relevant specialists. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends lifestyle modifications and metformin as first-line therapy. Lifestyle changes include moderate to vigorous exercise for 60 minutes per day, limiting screen time to less than two hours per day, and a dietary referral.

It is vital to ensure that these children are also evaluated by the ophthalmologist, nephrologist, cardiologist and dental surgeon. Complications of type 2 diabetes in children are similar to that of adults. Complications tend to occur after a person has had the disease for many years. Those who are diagnosed in childhood have the disease for longer periods of time. Therefore, strict control and management of blood glucose are crucial to help prevent these complications. All people with diabetes should have regular dilated eye exams (to examine for diabetic retinopathy), urine microalbumin screening at appropriate intervals (evaluated for renal involvement), hyperlipidemia screens/treatment, hypertension screening/treatment, and regular monitoring.
