Ulnar collateral ligament injury of the thumb, also known as skier's thumb or gamekeeper's thumb, is an injury of the ulnar collateral ligament of the first metacarpophalangeal joint. This injury was originally named gamekeeper's thumb because gamekeepers would develop the injury as a result of repetitively twisting and breaking the necks of small game, such as birds and rabbits. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ulnar collateral ligament injuries of the thumb. It highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.
