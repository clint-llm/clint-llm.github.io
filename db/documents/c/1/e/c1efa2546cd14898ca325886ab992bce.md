Diagnosis of aphthous stomatitis is clinical, and laboratory testing is usually unnecessary, although diagnostic testing might be considered in persistent, severe, or recurrent cases.

A complete blood count demonstrating anemia might suggest hematinic deficiency such as iron, folate, or vitamin B12. Neutropenia might prompt consideration of cyclic neutropenia as a cause of ulcerations.

Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease) present in fewer than 5% of recurrent aphthous stomatitis cases and can be identified with serum anti-endomysium antibody and transglutaminase assay.

Consider HIV testing in cases with complex or severe involvement, persistent herpetiform or major aphthous stomatitis, or those involving keratinized mucosa (adherent gingival, dorsum of the tongue, hard palate).
