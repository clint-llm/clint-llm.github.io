Several treatments for trichodysplasia spinulosa have been attempted, but a widely accepted treatment plan still evades the medical community. The three seemingly most effective approaches include topical cidofovir, oral valganciclovir, and reduction of immunosuppression.

Topical cidofovir 3% has been recommended as a first-line treatment for trichodysplasia spinulosa based on a trend of treatment success in case reports. Topical cidofovir as a possible treatment is further supported by in vitro evidence that cidofovir inhibits human polyomavirus replication. Oral valganciclovir has also been effective in several cases and is more accessible than topical cidofovir but lacks the evidentiary support of in vitro or in vivo studies showing activity against human polyomavirus. Regarding reducing immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of sub-therapeutic dosing, transplant rejection, and progression or relapse of underlying disease often outweighs the benefit of reversing trichodysplasia spinulosa.

Various other topical treatments have been tried with inconsistent efficacy, such as leflunomide, topical retinoids, steroids, imiquimod, keratolytics, emollients, green tea extract, and other anti-virals.
