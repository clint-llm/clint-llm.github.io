Several factors impact the outcome of acute limb ischemia secondary to thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm including patient comorbidities, the severity of ischemia at the time of presentation, duration of ischemia, the use of thrombolytics, availability of saphenous vein graft, etc.  The incidence of limb loss in those who present with ALI vary greatly among the literature, but reports are as high as 20 to 60%, although most recent studies report an incidence of approximately 14 to 17%.  In recent years with advancements in technique and the use of thrombolysis multiple studies have demonstrated favorable long-term outcomes with approximately 68 to 80% 5-year bypass patency rates and greater than 95% limb salvage among those who undergo urgent revascularization.
