It is important to consider the relative duration of action of neuromuscular blocking agents when administering neostigmine as a reversal agent. Administering neostigmine after a relative degree of spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function is important to prevent "recurarization," which can manifest as increased weakness in the post-operative recovery unit due to the lasting effect of the neuromuscular blocking drug. Of note, up to 70% of acetylcholine receptors may still be blocked with an apparently normal train of four from the peripheral nerve stimulator. The duration of action of neostigmine is increased in patients with renal failure as it is excreted by the kidneys.

Ways to use acetylcholinesterase reversal agents to reduce the risk of residual neuromuscular blockade:

- Train-of-four counts less than one or no response. Do not use neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Wait until the train-of-four count is greater than one.

- Train-of-four count of two or three. Administer the proper dose of Neostigmine (or another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and extubate when the adductor pollicisÂ train-of-four ratio is 0.9 or greater.

- Train-of-four count is greater than 0.4. Administer a moderate dose of neostigmine and extubate when adductor pollicis train-of-four ratio is 0.9 or greater.

- Train-of-four count is greater than 0.7. Avoid using neostigmine as the risk of anticholinesterase-induced muscle weakness is greater.
