The number of people with obesity is increasing rapidly on a global scale, and obesity is one of the top causes of preventable death worldwide.

Body mass index (BMI) has historically been used to categorize obesity. However, this should be used cautiously in patients with very high or very low muscle mass. BMI is calculated using the formula weight in kilograms, divided by height in meters squared. It is recommended that BMI is used alongside waist circumference and the presence of comorbidities (CVD, HTN) to risk-stratify patients. Weight management can be an area that is difficult to navigate without offending. However, it is important to highlight that use of the term “obese” refers to a clinical diagnosis that has specific health implications and is not an observation of the appearance of the individual.

It is important to recognize that the development of obesity is often multi-factorial, and a thorough history is indicated to explore any modifiable contributory factors such as lifestyle, medication, comorbidities, and psychological health. Meta-analyses have shown that dieting does not lead to sustained weight loss or improved health benefits.
