Advance directives were developed to respond to the increasing sophistication of medical technology. Numerous studies have documented critical deficits in the care of the dying, finding it unnecessarily expensive, prolonged, painful, and emotionally stressful to patients and families. Many potential interventions can be done for the patient that may not actually improve the quality or duration of life. Aggressive medical intervention may leave patients confined to nursing homes or dependent on feeding tubes for survival. Many patients are kept alive in a comatose or permanent vegetative state with a poor quality of life. Having an advance directive completed before approaching the end of life can reduce the amount of and subsequent cost of medical interventions incurred in the last months of life.

The legality and scope of advance directives can vary by state, creating difficulty for patients that may cross state borders to receive medical care. Some states only recognize living wills and health care proxies in a hospitalized setting. Some states require EMS providers to provide resuscitative care unless state-approved advance directive documents are provided.
