An accurate diagnosis of OLP must be based on thorough history taking, clinical examination, and histopathologic findings. In patients presenting with the characteristic reticular form of OLP, the clinical presentation alone can be sufficiently diagnostic. However, an oral biopsy is still advisable to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to rule out evidence of dysplasia and malignancy.

For patients who present with desquamative gingivitis, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) may be necessary to rule out autoimmune vesiculobullous diseases that share similar clinical features.
