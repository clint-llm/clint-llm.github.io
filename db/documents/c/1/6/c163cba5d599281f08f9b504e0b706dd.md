The prognosis of adenocarcinoma depends on the type of adenocarcinoma as well as the stage of cancer at diagnosis. The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging by far has the greatest impact on prognosis. Other independent factors that determine prognosis are the performance status of the patient, site of metastasis, tumor burden, eligibility, and tolerance of treatment.

Below are the SEER data on survival on different sites of adenocarcinoma, where a significant survival difference is noted between different adenocarcinoma depending on the site of origin.

- Adenocarcinoma of Breast: the 5-year survival rateLocalized: 98.9%Regional: 85.7%Distant: 28.1%

- Adenocarcinoma of Prostate: the 5-year survival rateLocalized: 100%Regional: 100%Distant: 30.2%

- Adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin: the 5-year survival Localized: 90.2%Regional: 71.8%Distant: 14.3%
