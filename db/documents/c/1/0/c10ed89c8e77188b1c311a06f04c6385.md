Ocular tuberculosis is a clinical disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). It has various modes of transmission, and it can infect virtually any ocular tissue. Much like the ability of syphilis to mimic various skin conditions, TB should be thought of as “the great imitator” of ocular pathologies.

Choroidal tubercles were first anatomically described in 1855 and identified with an ophthalmoscope in 1867. One year after the discovery of the organism, TB was identified in the eye in 1883.

More than 1.7 billion people are estimated to be infected with TB. Globally, it is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent and the leading cause of death among persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
