Bronchiectasis complications include pneumonia, lung abscess, empyema, septicemia, cor pulmonale, respiratory failure, secondary amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome, and recurrent pleurisy.

**Prognosis**

The disease is progressive when associated with ciliary dysfunction and cystic fibrosis, and eventually causes respiratory failure in other patients. The prognosis can be relatively good if postural drainage is performed regularly, and antibiotics are used judiciously.
