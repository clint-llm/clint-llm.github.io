In 2015, the American Cancer Society (ACS) recommended that

- Women with an average risk should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 (strong recommendation).

- Women who are between 45 to 54 years should undergo screening annually, and women 55 years and older can undergo biennial or annual screening.

- It recommends that women aged 40 to 44 are to be given a choice to start annual mammography.

- Routine screening strategies are not strongly advised for women in age groups of 40 to 49 or those above the age of 70.

**The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)**

It recommends biennial mammography in women of age group 50 to 74. For the age group 40 to 49, group screening can be considered after discussing and evaluating the risks and benefits of this test with their physician.

**WHO**

It advises biennial mammography screening for women aged 50 to 69 years in well-resourced settings.

**American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists**

It recommends twice-annual screening mammography after 55 years of age, which prevents harm as long as the patient is informed.

The USPSTF and ACS differ markedly in terms of recommendations for clinical breast examinations (CBE). ACS does not recommend them, while the USPSTF recommends a clinical breast examination with mammography in women with an average risk of developing breast cancer.

The panel of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)****recommends women with average risk in the age group of 25 to 39 years to have a clinical assessment, risk reduction counseling & clinical breast examination every 1 to 3 years. They should also be recommended to inform about any changes in their breast to their health care provider immediately.
