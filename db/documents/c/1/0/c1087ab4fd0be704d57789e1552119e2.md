The prognosis of the trunk's liposarcomas, including the intra-abdominal region, is worse than liposarcoma of the extremities. In one study mean 5-year survival rate for liposarcoma of the trunk was 41.9% as compared to that of extremities, where it was 66.7%. The prognosis is also dependant on the histological subtype of the liposarcoma. The 5-year disease-free survival is worse for tumors of the high-grade group (dedifferentiated, round cell, and pleomorphic) than for low-grade tumor groups (well-differentiated and myxoid type).

Because of the rarity of omental EGISTs, their malignant potential and overall prognosis is difficult to ascertain.

The prognosis of malignant mesothelioma of omentum is extremely poor because effective treatment is still not present. Most patients die in one year of diagnosis. According to some retrospective studies, the median survival after surgery aimed at palliation combined with systemic or intraperitoneal chemotherapy is about one year. In patients where aggressive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy was done, the median survival has approached five years.
