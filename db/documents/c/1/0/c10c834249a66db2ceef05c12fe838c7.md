As stated previously, the semilunar ganglion plays a critical role in expressing various neuropeptides and signaling molecules that are important in gene expression, modulation of sensory information, and peripheral and central sensitization.

The semilunar ganglion is also known to become latently infected with the herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1).

The semilunar ganglion is also known to incur damage in patients with the trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS).
