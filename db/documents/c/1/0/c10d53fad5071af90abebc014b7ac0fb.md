These patients (pediatric patients in particular) frequently have multiple comorbidities, and it is important to have a full multi-disciplinary team in place both pre- and post-operatively. This team will involve specialists in otolaryngology, cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, pulmonology, gastroenterology, critical care, anesthesiology, speech and language pathology, and care coordination.

In the pediatric population, in particular, these patients should be managed through a multidisciplinary aerodigestive clinic. This allows for collaboration and care coordination amongst physicians and other medical personnel, thus allowing expeditious care and minimization of risks and complications.
