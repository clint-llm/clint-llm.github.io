Primary care clinicians are the first to care for patients with nasal polyposis. Therefore, they must have the clinical knowledge to detect this disease and begin the patient on appropriate therapy before referring them to the otolaryngologist. Since impaired QOL might affect the patient’s emotional well-being, there are times psychiatric evaluation might be warranted. Cooperation between allergists, pulmonologists, and otolaryngologists is required to improve patient management and treatment outcomes. Pathologists help establish the etiology of nasal polyps and are valuable for ruling out neoplasia.

Diagnostic radiologists play an integral role in the care of nasal polyposis patients. The intricate anatomy of the paranasal sinuses with its anatomical variants may pose risks during endoscopic sinus surgery. Accurate interpretation of PNS CT scans may assist the otolaryngologist in avoiding surgical complications. Pharmacists involved in the care of patients with nasal polyposis should be familiar with drug compounding, as different medications can be added to nasal saline irrigations to help control the inflammatory process within the sinuses. Nurses play a pivotal role in educating patients regarding their condition and assist the clinician with treatment compliance. Excellent interprofessional communication is essential in the management of nasal polyposis patients.
