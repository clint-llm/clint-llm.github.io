Dental nurses play a vital role in all extractions, such as providing a second check of the patient's details and allergies and confirming the tooth to be extracted. Techniques such as counting teeth aloud and confirming that the dentist is about to work on the same tooth as specified on the consent form rely on dental nurses being involved in providing confirmation.

Dental nurses may also be responsible for the decontamination of instruments following a procedure. All dental team members should be aware of cross-infection protocols to ensure the safety of the patient and the team.

It is the operator's responsibility to remove their sharp instruments, and the dental nurse should feel able to prompt the dentist to do so.

Dental nurses can also check for hemostasis following the extraction and provide post-operative instructions should they feel comfortable doing so.
