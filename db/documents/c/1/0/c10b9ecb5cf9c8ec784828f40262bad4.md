The nervous system develops from the ectoderm of the trilaminar embryo. From there, the neural plate folds and forms the neural tube. The rostral neural tube divides and forms the three primary vesicles (prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon). The rhombencephalon (or hindbrain) divides into the metencephalon (pons and cerebellum) and the myelencephalon (medulla oblongata). The vestibular nuclei develop within both the metencephalon and the myelencephalon.

The developing hindbrain creates two longitudinal columns of neurons that receive fibers from the vestibular part of the ear. These longitudinal columns subdivide into functionally specified rhombomeres (the transverse boundaries), derived from the rhombic lip. The rhombic lip is known as the source of migratory cell populations that give rise to the major dorsal and ventral nuclei in the hindbrain. Vestibular nuclei form from several of these rhombomeres and are highly analogous across vertebrates, from fish to humans.
