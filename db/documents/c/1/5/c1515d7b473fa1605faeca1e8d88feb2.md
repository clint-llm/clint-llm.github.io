The definitive management in the AP windowÂ would be corrective cardiac surgery, which is performed typically in the neonatal period. Medical management of the congestive heart failure is an option if the patient's conditions are conducive to perform corrective surgery. Earlier surgeries can prevent irreversible changes in the pulmonary vasculature. Surgical techniques are quite simple in isolated defects, which involves division and separation of the great vessels with patch closure of the defect.

The surgical approach involves cardiopulmonary bypass and median sternotomy. Surgical outcomes are excellent with 10-year freedom from cardiac re-operation, reaching up to 100% in an isolated AP window.
