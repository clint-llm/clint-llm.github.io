The exact cause of Fox-Fordyce disease remains unknown. Obstruction of the apocrine gland duct resulting from keratin accumulation in the follicular infundibulum seems to be central to its etiopathogenesis.

The following are etiological factor hypotheses:

**Familial Inheritance**

Although FFD is typically a sporadic condition, there are rare instances of it occurring in sisters, monozygotic females, male twins, and daughter-father duo.

**Hormonal**

FFD typically presents in post-pubertal adolescent girls and women. It is rare in prepubertal and post-menopausal women and men. Further credence to the hormonal involvement comes from premenstrual flare-ups andÂ improvement with pregnancy, post-menopause, and oral contraceptive pills.

**Laser Hair Reduction (LHR)**

FFD has been described to result from different kinds of lasers used for LHR.

**Trigger factors for Itch**

Stress, excitement, sweating resulting from exercise, and hot and humid weather are all triggers.
