Absolute contraindications to the use of peripheral nerve blocks include allergy to local anesthetics, inability to cooperate, or patient refusal. It is advised to postpone or reconsider a nerve injection when there is an active infection at the injection site, pre-existing neural deficits along with the distribution of the block, and in patients with coagulopathies or on antithrombotic drugs.
