The placenta functions as the primary organ for air exchange in the fetus. The lungs have to rapidly assume this role after birth. Persistent pulmonary hypertension occurs due to failure of normal transition from intrauterine circulation. It is characterized by persistently elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), resulting in decreased pulmonary blood flow (PBF).

Symptoms range from mild respiratory distress to severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn is a potentially life-threatening condition in the early neonatal phase. It is essential for the healthcare provider to promptly identify and provide appropriate care to neonates.
