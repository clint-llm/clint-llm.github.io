Acute and tardive dystonic reactions occur less frequently than other related EPS manifestations, such as Parkinson's-like symptoms and akathisia. There is some debate regarding the chances of developing tardive dystonia, with studies suggesting it is somewhere between <1 to 2%  of patients taking antipsychotics.

One study revealed the interval between the age at first exposure to the neuroleptic and the age at onset of tardive dystonia ranged from four days to twenty-three years, with a mean of about six years. In this same study, researchers noted that younger patients experienced a shorter interval from neuroleptic exposure to symptom presentation.
