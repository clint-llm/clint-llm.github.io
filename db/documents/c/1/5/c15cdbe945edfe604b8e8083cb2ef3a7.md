Rib fractures occur when a significant enough force directed at the rib causes a break. There are a total of 12 pairs of ribs in the thoracic region. The first seven ribs attach anteriorly to the sternum and posteriorly to the spinal column. Rib numbers 8 through 10 attach similarly but connect to the costal cartilage of the sternum anteriorly. Ribs 11 and 12 have the name of “floating” ribs as they only attach posteriorly but do not attach anteriorly. Underneath each rib lies the intercostal nerve, artery, and veins which supply to blood supply and innervation. The ribs function to protect the underlying organs and structures of the thoracic cavity. Any rib fracture should warrant a thorough evaluation of any concomitant injury, including lungs, heart, kidney, spleen, liver, and neuro-vasculature.
