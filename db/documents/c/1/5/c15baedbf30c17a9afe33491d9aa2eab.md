Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). It is an autoimmune disease which is characterized by a triad of hypoparathyroidism, Addison disease, and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. APS-1 is due to mutations in the autoimmune regulatory gene (AIRE); so far about 60 different mutations have been described; this is a potentially underdiagnosed condition due to the rarity and enormous variability in its presentation. Besides the above triad, a host of other autoimmune diseases may present with APS-1. Diagnosis is made by finding antibodies against interferon-omega or interferon- alpha or by detecting disease-causing mutations in the AIRE gene. Management of this disorder requires collaboration among multiple specialties because of the multiplicity of organs affected.
