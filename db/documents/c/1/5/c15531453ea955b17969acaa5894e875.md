Management of pulsus alternans secondary to underlying cardiac pathology will require an interprofessional approach. Prompt evaluation with cardiology should be an important component of any initial assessment for pulsus alternans. If the patient has associated respiratory distress, coordination with respiratory therapy will be necessary for the treatment plan. Nursing staff will need to closely monitor the patient’s vitals and perform strict monitoring of the patient’s intake and output. If ischemic heart disease or severe valvulopathy is suspected, consultation with interventional cardiology would also be warranted. If a large pulmonary embolism is identified, coordination with interventional radiology for catheter-directed anticoagulation may be considered. Depending on the degree of cardiac dysfunction, a surveillance echocardiogram may be a consideration. Given the cardiac dysfunction associated with pulsus alternans, a multidisciplinary approach is of great importance to monitor and treat patients with complex cardiac disease.
