Muscle contraction of the lower limb is important in maintaining adequate venous blood flow to the heart. Contraction of calf muscles, like the gastrocnemius and soleus, cause an increase in pressure in veins of the lower leg such as the posterior tibial vein. This increased pressure creates a gradient by which the blood can move proximally into the popliteal vein and back towards the heart.
