It is important to understand the pathophysiology of sideroblastic anemia, heme biosynthesis, and the consequences of the defective enzyme/transport genes. Before glycine gets to join the succinyl-CoA, it is transported by the mitochondrial transporter into the mitochondria by SLC25A38.

Hereditary sideroblastic anemia occurs when there is a defect in the gene forming some of these enzymes, genes on autosomal chromosomes and genes in mitochondria.

Non-syndromic:

- SIDBA1 has been reported to be caused by various mutations including missense, nonsense mutations and mutations at promoter or enhancer regions.

- SIDBA2 is caused by a mutation in SLC25A38. Various mutations have been reported including nonsense, frameshift and missense mutations.

- SIDBA3 is as a result of a mutation in GLRX5. This type is very rare,  as only two families have been reported having it. It is caused by a homozygous mutation which interferes with the splicing of GLRX5 mRNA which reduces the function of GLRX5 which is to produce ISC in the mitochondria.

- SIDBA4 is caused by a mutation of HSPA9. Various mutations occur as in previous types including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and in-frame deletion mutations. The absence of HSPA9 in erythroid cell lines is reported to inhibit the differentiation of erythroid cells.

Syndromic:

- XLSA/A is caused by a mutation in ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCB7). ABCB7 is involved in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis which helps to transport iron to the cytosol during heme production. A missense mutation in this gene would lead to X-linked sideroblastic anemia with cerebellar ataxia.

- PMPS is due to a deletion of mitochondria DNA. The mechanism causing sideroblastic anemia is unknown, but it was reported that the deletion of the mitochondria DNA causes a defect of the respiratory chain fo the mitochondria causing anemia.

- TRMA is caused by a mutation of the  SLC19A2 gene which aids in the transport of thiamine. Thiamine is needed for the production of succinyl CoA. A defect in this protein will lead to megaloblastic anemia, diabetes mellitus, and deafness.

- MLSA1 is due to a mutation of PUS1 which helps in the translation of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria and is called a missense mutation. It is not known why it causes sideroblastic anemia.

- MLSA2 is due to a mutation in the YAR2 gene which encodes mitochondrial tyrosyl tRNA synthase. The mutation of this enzyme will deplete the quantity of this enzyme. The cause of sideroblastic anemia is also unknown with this type.

- SFID is due to a mutation of the TRNT1 gene which encodes CCA-adding transfer RNA nucleotidyltransferase. The pathology of sideroblastic anemia is unknown.

- NDUFB11 deficiency is due to a deletion of 3 nucleotides in the NDUFB11 gene leading to phenylalanine deletion in the NDUFB protein causing normocytic sideroblastic anemia and lactic acidosis.

Clonal hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblast,  are caused by SF3B1 gene mutation. SF3B1 is one of the spliceosome proteins that are inserted into the spliceosome during the arrangement of a pre-splicing complex to become a type of U2 snRNP.
