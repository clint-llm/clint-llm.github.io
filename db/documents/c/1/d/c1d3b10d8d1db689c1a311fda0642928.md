Ketoconazole works as an antifungal agent by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 14Î±-demethylase enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for inhibiting the biosynthesis of triglycerides and phospholipids by fungi.

Ketoconazole inhibits the activity of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase. This enzyme is essential for synthesizing mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, in the adrenal cortex.
