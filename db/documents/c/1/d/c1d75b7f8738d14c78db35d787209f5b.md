Significant cerebellar hemorrhage may haveÂ peri-hemorrhagic edema and mass effect, which, unfortunately, can cause multiple complications, including brainstem compression, cerebellar herniation, compression of the fourth ventricle with resultant obstructive hydrocephalus, an extension of hemorrhage into the ventricular system, and recurrent hemorrhage typically within the first 24 hours. There are two options for managing the mass effect from the cerebellar hemorrhage: (1) hyperosmolar agents or (2) decompressive surgery.

Osmolar therapy is used to reduce the space-occupying effects of hemorrhage and edema by increasing serum osmolality and facilitating an osmotic movement of water into the vasculature with resultant reactive vasoconstriction. The goal is an overall reduction in intracranial pressure and tissue shrinkage. There is no superiority of hypertonic saline over mannitol or vice versa for the treatment of intracranial hemorrhage. Hypertonic saline concentrations typically utilized for treatment are 3% (250 mL bolus), 10% (75 to 150 mL bolus), and 23.4% (30 mL bolus). Boluses and continuous infusions have the goal of sodium levels of 145 to 155 mmol/L and osmolality of 310 to 320 mOsm/kg.

Decompressive surgery of choice is a suboccipital craniectomy with hematoma evacuation.
