Loperamide is an over-the-counter oral antidiarrheal agent made in 1969, first used medically in 1976, and became available without a prescription in 1988.

**Medical use:**The FDA approved loperamide for the treatment of various forms of diarrhea, including travelerâ€™s diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome associated with chronic diarrhea, acute nonspecific diarrhea in patients two years of age and older, and is indicated for reducing ileostomy output.

**Illicit drug use and self-medication use:**In recent years, there has been a noticeable incline in the use and abuse of loperamide as a means of self-management of opioid withdrawal and an inexpensive method to induce euphoria i.e., to achieve a euphoric state. Vakkalanka et al. found a 91% increase in reported loperamide exposures, including eight deaths, from 2010 to 2015 across Poison Control Centers in the United States.
