Distal radial fractures are often the result of a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Colles fractures are frequently associated with a typical FOOSH injury. On the other hand, Smith fractures commonly occur either as a fall onto a flexed wrist or as a direct blow to the dorsal aspect of the wrist.
