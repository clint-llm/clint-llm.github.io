Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis, usually manifesting in the third decade of life with multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. Because of the risk of malignancies later in life, these patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, dermatologist, nurse practitioners in dermatology, urologist, and primary care providers including internists, family physicians, and nurse practitioners. Specialty trained nurses in dermatology and genetics need to provide education to patients to avoid smoking and have regular imaging studies to detect cystic/solid lesions. Patients with this syndrome have an increased susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma, lung cysts, and spontaneous pneumothorax. Caution against air travel should be exercised.
