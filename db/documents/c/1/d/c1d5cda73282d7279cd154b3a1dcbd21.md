**Placenta previa**is the implantation of the placenta over the cervical os, which usually presents as painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester. Additionally, the uterus is soft and non-tender on physical exam. The fetus is usually not in distress. Risk factors include a history of cesarean section or multiple vaginal births. A transabdominal ultrasound localizes the placenta, but placenta previa diagnosis is by transvaginal ultrasound. In these cases, mother and fetus must undergo careful monitoring and delivery is often by cesarean section.

**Placental abruption**(abruptio placentae), complete or partial, is the premature separation of the placenta from the decidua basalis, which is the number one cause of vaginal bleeding late in pregnancy. Unlike placenta previa, uterine bleeding is painful with uterine contractions and fetal distress is usually present. Commonly, bleeding is due to rupture of maternal vessels, but fetal-placental vessels can also cause the separation. Ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic tool. Conditions affecting circulation act as risk factors and include hypertension, tobacco, cocaine, trauma, and premature rupture of membranes. Treatment includes the delivery of the baby. However, placental abruption frequently results in stillbirth.

**Placenta accreta spectrum**(PAS), formally known as morbidly adherent placenta, describes the improper attachment and separation of the placenta to a defective decidual layer of the endometrium. Women with maternal age, multiparity, or history of C-section or uterine surgery are at high risk for abnormal placenta adherence. Discovery of this condition is on ultrasound before delivery; however, there is difficulty with placental separation after birth which causes postpartum bleeding. Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is important to prepare for difficult labor, which may involve surgery. If findings are unclear with ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can clarify the diagnosis. There are three types of morbidly adherent placenta ranging from various depths of infiltration.

- **Placenta accrete**, the most common type is the implantation of placenta onto the myometrium rather than the decidua.

- **Placenta increta**describes the placenta intervening the myometrium but avoiding invasion outside the uterus.

- **Placenta percreta**is the deepest penetrating of the three types as the placenta pushes through the myometrium and into the uterine wall. In some cases, the placental cells can reach out of the uterus and invade the rectum or bladder.
