Although transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has the reputation of a safe imaging modality, it does carry the risk of complications that range from mild to potentially life-threatening. The physical insertion and manipulation of the TEE probe in the intraoperative setting can cause a variety of gastric, esophageal, and oropharyngeal complications. According to several large studies, the overall rate of TEE related complications ranged from 0.2% to 1.4%. Intraoperative TEE does carry slightly different risks in comparison to TEEs performed in the ambulatory setting because patient's that undergo TEE in the operating room (OR) are typically under general anesthesia and have received neuromuscular blocking agents. These patients are unable to swallow and potentially protest dangerous probe manipulations. In addition, the TEE probe is often kept inserted for a prolonged period in the operating room, particularly in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Despite these challenges, the rate of TEE related compilations appears to be similar in the ambulatory and operating room settings. Many of the gastrointestinal injuries related to TEE may not present until after the first twenty-four hours and may have previously led experts to underestimate the overall risk of TEE related complications.

TEE related injuries include:

- Laceration of lip

- Loose or chipped tooth

- Tongue ulceration

- Laceration of the oropharynx

- Dysphagia

- Odynophagia

- Pharyngeal edema

- Vocal cord palsy or paralysis

- Gastritis

- Stomach ulceration

- Esophagitis

- Esophageal perforation

- Mallory-Weiss tear

- Dysrhythmias

- Compression of the mediastinal structures

- Inadvertent extubation
