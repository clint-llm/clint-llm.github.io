The femoral artery supplies blood to the anterior compartment of the thigh. The artery enters the thigh by passing under the inguinal ligament at the mid-inguinal point, the halfway point between the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the pubic symphysis. The largest branch of the femoral artery is the deep femoral artery. It branches further into the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, with significant inter-individual variability of their origins. It runs around the head of the femur to supply the surrounding musculature.

The external iliac lymphatic plexus is the lymphatic system that drains the muscles in the anterior compartment of the thigh, which merges into the common iliac plexus, further draining into the cisterna chyli and then the thoracic duct.
