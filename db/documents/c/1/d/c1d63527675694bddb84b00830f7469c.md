The prognosis depends on the size and type of the clefts.

- Type I (closed-lip) has a milder course. It can be asymptomatic or diagnosed only in adult patients and presents with epileptic seizures and mild motor deficits.

- Type II (open lip) has a more severe presentation, manifested by epilepsy (often refractory), intellectual disability, varying degrees of paralysis, hemiparesis in unilateral schizencephaly, and quadriparesis in bilateral schizencephaly.

Type II clefts are associated with poor seizure outcomes, and a larger cleft is associated with the development of epilepsy in an early stage of life compared to a smaller one. Hence, the type and size of schizencephaly should be considered in treating epilepsy.
