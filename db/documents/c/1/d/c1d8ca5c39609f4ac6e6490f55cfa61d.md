High-Velocity Low-Amplitude (HVLA) incorporates rapid thrust techniques over a short distance through a pathologic barrier. HVLA techniques require a physician to locate immobile or asymmetrical joints using his or her hands. The physician controls the pathologic barrier by setting it in motion and applying rapid but short thrusts until usually a pop sound is heard, confirming the restoration of motion in the affected joint. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of exhalation dysfunctions and highlights the role of the HVLA techniques in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the common HVLA treatment considerations for patients with exhaled ribs.
- Describe the classic exhalation physiology.
- Review the screening indications for exhaled ribs.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the MDs and DOs to enhance treatment considerations for patients affected by exhalation dysfunction.
