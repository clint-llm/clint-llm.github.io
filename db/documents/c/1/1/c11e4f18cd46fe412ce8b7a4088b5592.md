Flying after diving recommendations are designed to reduce the risk of developing decompression illness. Unfortunately, there is little consensus among experts and guidelines. The United States Navy advises a 2-hour interval prior to flying, while the United States Air Force and the Divers Alert Network recommend 24 hours. Others recommendÂ a 12-hour delay after a single dive and an 18-hour delay after multiple dives.
