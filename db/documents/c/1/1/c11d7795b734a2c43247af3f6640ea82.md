- Rest patient. Different guidelines suggest the patient should have a specific rest period before assessing ABI, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes.

- Avoid nicotine. Studies show that smoking selectively affects the ankle but not the brachial systolic pressure resulting in artificially elevated values.

- Supine position. There is a documented increase in the ABI value by approximately 0.3 with sitting instead of the supine position.

- Quiet space: Avoid underestimating systolic pressure due to difficulty with the audibility of systolic sounds.

- Supported limbs: Reduces motion, and the patient is more likely to be relaxed.

- Cover wounds: Reduce the risk of contaminating wounds or equipment.
