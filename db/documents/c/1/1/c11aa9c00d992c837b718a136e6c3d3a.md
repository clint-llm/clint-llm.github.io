Generally, RVT is considered as a result of an underlying kidney disease rather than its cause. Therapy is therefore directed at the treatment of the underlying disorder (most commonly nephrotic syndrome) and supporting renal function.

Although no randomized trials exist to evaluate the role of anticoagulation therapy in asymptomatic RVT, anticoagulation therapy should be provided to prevent the risk of progression of thrombus or occurrence of an embolic event. Patients with symptomatic RVT (such as acute RVT) should be treated similarly to patients who have Pulmonary embolism (PE) or deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Typically, initial treatment includes starting unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin and then bridged to warfarin, for a goal INR of 2 or 3. Direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors have not been studied in nephrotic patients with RVT and are not recommended for anticoagulation. Patients with documented RVT and pulmonary embolism who have contraindications for anticoagulation can be effectively treated with suprarenal IVC filters. Anticoagulation is generally given for 6 to 12 months, though most recommendations are to continue as long as a patient remains nephrotic.

Systemic fibrinolysis carries a risk of significant life-threatening bleeding and is usually not recommended. Local thrombolytic therapy with or without catheter-directed thrombectomy in patients with acute RVT is associated with acute renal failure. Surgical thrombectomy can be rarely considered in the setting of acute bilateral RVT and acute renal failure especially if percutaneous thrombectomy and/or thrombolysis cannot be performed.
