The vast majority of hamstring injuries are manageable nonoperatively. However, hamstring tendon avulsion often requires surgical intervention. Hamstring tendon avulsions are treated endoscopically with fixation of the torn segment of the hamstring tendon to the ischial tuberosity.

Ischial apophyseal avulsion fractures are extremely rare. Studies report that they account for only 1.4 to 4% of all hamstring injuries.

The hamstring muscle is harvestable as an autograft in ACL reconstruction. The quadruple hamstring autograft involves the semitendinosus and gracilis muscles and is known to be one of the strongest grafts available.
