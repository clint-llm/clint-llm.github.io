Due to caffeineâ€™s ability to affect a variety of different receptors, the side effects of caffeine overdose can be profound. Caffeine is a natural alkaloid methylxanthine that acts as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors, with A1 antagonism triggering seizures and A2 antagonism triggering cerebral and coronary vasoconstriction. Caffeine also inhibits phosphodiesterase, resulting in increased intracellular cyclic AMP and intracellular calcium levels. Caffeine can stimulate the release of catecholamines, especially noradrenaline, with beta 1 agonist activity resulting in tachycardia and beta 2 agonist activity resulting in peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.
