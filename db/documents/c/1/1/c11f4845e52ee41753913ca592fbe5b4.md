Fournier gangrene is a rare but deadly infection of the genital and perineum. Symptoms of this infectious process include swelling to the genitals and perineal area associated with significant pain. Systemic symptoms are not uncommon. While there is no specific way to prevent Fournier gangrene, certain actions can be taken to minimize the chances of suffering the disease. Diabetic patients should carefully and thoroughly assess the groin area for any signs of redness, swelling, or pain. Also, appropriate management of diabetes with optimal medication compliance is beneficial. Diabetic patients who suffer from Fournier gangrene have a better prognosis if the HgA1c is below 7. Maintaining appropriate hygiene and skincare can also prevent Fournier gangrene, as skin breakdown can be the first step in developing the disease.
