Miliaria is a generallyÂ benign skin disorder that occurs in patients of all ages and genders who are exposed to humid, warm climates. It is usually self-limited and resolves spontaneously in response to a cooler, dryer atmosphere. An interprofessional team that includes the primary clinician, nurses, and pharmacists contributes to improving outcomes in patients with miliaria. In situations where a rash appearing to be miliaria does not resolve quickly, a consultation with a dermatologist should be recommended to rule out other more serious conditions that may mimic miliaria.
