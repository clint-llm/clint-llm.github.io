In patients with a complaint of tearing, a detailed differential diagnosis should be made of the possible causes or combination of causes of a watery eye mentioned above. Some authors differentiate between "true epiphora" (obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system) and a watery eye (caused by tear film or blinking problems) to make this differential diagnosis easier by dividing the possible causes under these two possible results.

In a child with a tearing eye, one should consider the possibility of congenital glaucoma in addition to the etiologies mentioned above. The elevated intraocular pressure in this condition causes tearing, redness, photophobia, and enlargement of the eyes (buphthalmos).
