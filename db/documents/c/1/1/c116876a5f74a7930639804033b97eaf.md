The clinical impact of diagnosis timely diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy cannot be understated. There are significant morbidity and mortality associated with ectopic pregnancy, and early diagnosis can have a significant impact in reducing both of these. As previously mentioned, there is a role for bedside performance of these examinations, and this should be part of standard emergency physician and obstetrician training. After completing the ultrasounds, whether bedside or elective imaging, the images should be reviewed in detail as there are many signs of potential ectopic pregnancy to identify. The most reliable sign of ectopic pregnancy is the visualization of extrauterine gestation. However, this is found in the minority of ectopic pregnancies. A key concept to reiterate his the use of beta hCG levels when reviewing the ultrasonography images. The diagnosis ectopic pregnancy should be considered with elevated beta hCG levels with the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound. The discriminatory zone is the titer of hCG where an intrauterine sac should be seen with transvaginal ultrasonography and normal pregnancy.  There are varying standards for discriminatory zones, but 1500 to 2000 mIU/mL of hCG has been accepted in the past.
