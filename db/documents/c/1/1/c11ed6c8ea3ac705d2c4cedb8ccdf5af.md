Management of stridor should be undertaken from the time of initial assessment in the critically ill-appearing patient. Specific treatment should be tailored to the underlying diagnosis. In general, the following precautions should be maintained when managing/treating stridor.

- Avoid agitating child with stridor

- Monitor for rapid deterioration due to respiratory failure

- Avoid direct examination or manipulation of the pharynx (if epiglottitis is suspected). In such situations, securing the airway takes precedence over diagnostic evaluation.

- Skilled personnel in airway management should accompany the patient at all times. Further evaluation should be performed where definitive airway management can be achieved in a controlled environment such as the operating room.

- Consider foreign body aspirations if symptoms develop acutely, such as sudden coughing and choking in a previously healthy child.

- Avoid beta-agonists in croup; they are a possible risk of worsening upper airway obstruction.
