The orbicularis muscle consists of two well-defined parts, namely a deep and a superficial part. These two parts have different names from different authors, such as

- Deep part and superficial part

- Pars marginalis and pars superficialis

- Marginal part and peripheral part

- Intrinsic and extrinsic bundle

The deep fibers of the orbicularis oris muscle originate from the modiolus on each side. These fibers run horizontal passing from one commissure of the oral cavity to the other across the midline and lie close to the inner mucosal surface.

The superficial orbicularis oris muscle fiber originates from the muscles of facial expression. The superficial muscle fiber divides into an upper and lower bundle. The lower bundle, also known as the nasolabial bundle receives fibers from the depressor anguli oris muscle on each side. They insert in the skin forming the ridges at philtrum with short fibers ending in the ipsilateral ridge and long fibers crossing the midline to insert into the contralateral one.
