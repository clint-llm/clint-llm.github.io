Low molecular weight and lipophilicity allow opioid drugs to transfer across the placenta to the fetus easily. Due to the same reason, these drugs can accumulate in the developing fetal brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier. There appears to be a direct relationship between the gestation age and the amount of opioids transferred across the placenta. Variations in the ability to cross the placenta also exist among the opioids; semisynthetic opioids are transported across the placenta in a lower amount than synthetic opioids. Slow metabolism and longer half-life of opioids in the fetus may be one reason for severe withdrawal symptoms.
