Understanding the normal fetal heart and vasculature development is imperative to appreciate the diverse array of anatomic variations and abnormalities.

At the early stages of embryogenesis, the primordial lung buds are surrounded by the splanchnic plexus, which is the vascular plexus of the foregut. The common pulmonary vein, which forms as an evagination from the heart establishes a connection between the pulmonary plexus and the heart. Subsequently, the connections between the pulmonary venous plexus and the splanchnic plexus involute. The common pulmonary vein gets incorporated into the left atrium (LA), and four pulmonary veins individually connect directly to the left atrium. Failure of the common pulmonary vein or atresia early in its development, while the persistent of the connections between systemic and pulmonary vasculature, leads to the development of TAPVC. If only a portion of the common pulmonary vein, either right or left, becomes atretic, persisting pulmonary-systemic venous connections form PAPVC.

**Anatomic Variations**

**Normal Variants**

Normally there are two left and two right pulmonary veins that drain into the posterior wall of the heart.

**Anomalous Connections and Drainage**

In anomalous venous connections, pulmonary veins connect abnormally to the systemic venous system. In anomalous venous drainage, the veins connect to the anatomically correct location, but due to an intracardiac defect, there is a mixing of the oxygenated, and the deoxygenated blood and pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium instead of the left atrium.

**PAPVC**

The most common form of PAPVC is where the left upper pulmonary vein drains into the left innominate vein to ultimately drain into the right atrium. Other forms of PAPVC include pulmonary veins draining into the SVC, coronary sinus, IVC, or azygous veins.

**Scimitar Syndrome**

This variant of PAPVC comprises a part of or the entire or part of the right lung being drained by right pulmonary veins that connect to the IVC. The affected lung segments are often hypoplastic or have bronchial anomalies.

**Sinus venosus atrial septal defects**

They occur due to the absence of the wall separating the right-sided pulmonary vein from the superior vena cava leading to the mixing of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary vein into the systemic venous system. The right side pulmonary veins are connected normally to the left atrium.

**Malposition of the septum primum**

Leftward malposition of the septum primum, left to the orifices of right pulmonary veins, leads to their drainage into the right atrium, thereby leading to the anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. This is commonly associated with visceral heterotaxy.

**TAPVC**

TAPVC implies that all the pulmonary veins connect to the systemic veins or right atrium, either by a common vertical vein or individually. Anatomically TAPVC can be divided into four subtypes based on the level of the anomalous connection as supracardiac, cardiac, infracardiac, and mixed.

- Supracardiac: Pulmonary veins anomalously connect, most commonly to the left innominate vein. Other locations for connections include SVC and azygous vein.

- Cardiac: Pulmonary veins drain into the coronary sinus or right atrium directly.

- Infracardiac: Pulmonary veins form a vertical vein and drain into the portal vein, hepatic vein, or IVC below the diaphragm

- Mixed: In mixed-type, there is a combination of connections at different levels.

The supracardiac variety is the most common of the TAPVC.
