**Causes**

It is necessary to maintain a broad differential and a low threshold for suspicion of other inciting insults that may be the cause of delirium. The identifiable leading causes of delirium broadly include, but are not limited to:

- Infectious

- Alcohol/substance intoxication or withdrawal

- Wernicke's disease

- Metabolic

- Hypoglycemia

- Medications

- Trauma

- Neurocognitive

- Seizures

- Vascular

- Hypoxia

- Vitamin deficiencies

- Endocrinopathies

- Toxin or heavy metal ingestion

**Risk Factors for Delirium**

The literature has identified multiple risk factors. Among these, the most studied are mentioned:

- Older age

- Cognitive impairment

- Visual impairment

- Alcohol abuse

- Respiratory disorder

- Illness severity

- Terminal illnesses

- Comorbidity

- Infection

- Major surgery (e.g., complex abdominal, hip fracture, and cardiac surgery)

Interestingly, a mnemonic bundle (DELIRIUM) was proposed (Saint Louis University Geriatrics Division and St. Louis Veterans Affairs) for assessing the main causes of delirium:

D=DrugsE=Eyes, ears, and other sensory deficitsL=Low O2 states such as heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolismI=InfectionR=Retention (of urine or stool)I=Ictal stateU=Underhydraton/undernutritionM=Metabolic causes (e.g., diabetes, sodium abnormalities)

Within the ICU setting, numerous risks have been identified:

- Pre-existing dementia

- Mechanical ventilation

- Sepsis

- History of hypertension

- High severity of illness on admission

- Pain

- Stroke

- Psychiatric disorders

- Depression

- Traumatic head injury

- Myocardial infarction

- COPD

- Steroids

- Hypertension

- Psychoactive medications including narcotics

- Deep levels of sedation

- Environmental factors such as the absence of visible sunlight

- Immobility and physical restraints

- Poor sleep quality

- Social factors like alcohol abuse and smoking

- Lack of visitors

- Anticholinergic drug exposure (e.g., diphenhydramine, promethazine, and cyclobenzaprine)
