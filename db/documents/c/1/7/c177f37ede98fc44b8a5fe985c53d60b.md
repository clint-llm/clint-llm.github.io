**Transfusion:**If the patient has an antibody against the Duffy blood group system, they must be transfused red blood cells which are Duffy antigen-negative and cross-match compatible. Further, in case of mother has been sensitized to Duffy antigens from his previous pregnancy and had developed Duffy antibodies may cause HDFN in subsequent pregnancies.

In such fetuses, intrauterine transfusion of Duffy negative blood must be transfused to improve fetal anemia and outcomes. Further after the baby's birth, their exchange transfusion should be planned with the Duffy antigen-negative and cross-match compatible blood units.

Duffy antibodies (mostly Anti-Fya and Anti-Fyb) have been implicated in causing HTRs and HDFN. Such recipients who have been detected with antibodies should be issued corresponding Duffy antigen-negative blood after compatibility testing for better transfusion outcomes. In a few cases with Fy(a–b–) phenotype, recipients had been found to develop Anti-Fy3, Fy4, Fy5, and Fy6 antibodies and should be transfused Fy(a–b–) phenotyped blood whenever transfusion is needed. HTRs in the Duffy blood group system are primarily due to IgG (mostly IgG1 type), but IgM antibodies have also been reported.

HDFN is rare and mild with the Duffy blood group system after maternal immunization with Duffy antigen-positive fetal red cells. Most of the reported cases are due to anti-Fya antibodies.
