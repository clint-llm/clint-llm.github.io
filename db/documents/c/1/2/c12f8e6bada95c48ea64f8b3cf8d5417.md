Understanding the anatomical relationships between the adductor magnus and the hamstring tendons is crucial for appropriate diagnosis and surgical vs. conservative treatment of injuries in this area. Knowledge of the origin of the adductor on the ischial tuberosity can aid the surgeon in the appropriate anatomical repair of avulsion injuries of the hamstring muscles. As indicated in a study by Broski et al., radiologists also need to be aware of the presence of the adductor magnus tendon on the ischial tuberosity when visualizing the ischial tuberosity on MRI to avoid confusion during diagnostic studies.
