Hemoglobin H can cause chronic hypochromic microcytic anemia and hemolytic anemia, which can worsen in periods of oxidant stress. This can be effectively broken down as ineffective erythropoiesis and increased hemolysis. The microcytic hypochromic anemia is due to impaired hemoglobin production due to decreased alpha chain synthesis and hyperhydration of the cell. The cause of the hyperhydration in alpha thalassemia is not clear. One theory argues that the K-Cl cotransporter stops early, thereby preventing the usual loss of K-Cl and water that is part of the red blood cell remodeling process.

Hemoglobin H has also shown shortened survival down to half of normal, 12 to 19 days versus normal of 28 to 37 days. This has accounted for two main factors: abnormal red blood cell membrane with increased rigidity and increased inclusion bodies. The inclusions were thought to be aggregates of beta chain tetramers, which precipitate in the red blood cellÂ and cause damage, leading to their removal by the spleen. These inclusion bodies are also proposed to cause increased susceptibility to oxidant stress.
