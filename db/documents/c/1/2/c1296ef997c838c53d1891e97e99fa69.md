Onchocerciasis infection can be avoided by avoiding exposure or bites from the vector. This can be achieved by the use of protective clothing or applying repellants on the skin. Travelers to endemic regions should receive advice on this.

There are efforts targeted at deterring infection by abolishing vector habitats through the promotion ofÂ vector habitat control programs.

Also, population-based strategies in some endemic regions are targeted at vector elimination and yearly mass ivermectin treatment.

Patients with a high load of microfilaria should be informed of the risk of severe reaction following treatment. This can often be associated with coinfection from Loa loa and can result in severe morbidity and a threat to life. Also, when there is a heavy burden of microfilariae and ocular involvement, patients should be informed of the potential complications that can occur from ivermectin use.
