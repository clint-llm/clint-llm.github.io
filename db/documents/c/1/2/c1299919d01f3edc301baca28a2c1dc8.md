Some colloid cysts can be watched for years to decades without any issue. Others can slowly grow in sizeÂ or cause subacute or acute hydrocephalus. With complete surgical resection, the prognosis is good, and colloid cysts are rare to recur after complete resection. Rare cases of sudden death have been reported with colloid cysts, which are usually attributed to acute obstructive hydrocephalus.
