The management of phimosis is an interprofessional. Although the condition is often first seen by the primary caregiver or nurse practitioner, in many cases a referral to a urologist is recommended.  Treatment of physiological phimosis is not indicated, and reassurance and an explanation of the natural history of the healthy non-retractile foreskin should be given to concerned parents. Circumcision is the preferred treatment for pathological phimosis and represents the only absolute indication for this procedure in children.

Alternatives to circumcision are not suitable to treat phimosis due to BXO but are designed to achieve a fully retractile foreskin. These treatments can be particularly useful with patients experiencing balanoposthitis. Topical steroids have been extensively studied, and topical application to the foreskin can render it retractable at an earlier stage. An alternative surgical approach to circumcision is the preputioplasty; this approach allows preservation of the foreskin. In most infants and children, the outcomes of phimosis treatment are good.
