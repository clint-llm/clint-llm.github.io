Obesity is closely linked to genetics and environmental factors. The newest studies in the field of epigenetics further our understanding of the effect of the environment on genetics. This article describes the genetic causes of obesity, including syndromic, monogenic, and polygenic causes, and cites specific examples of epigenetic modifications associated with obesity. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of genetically predisposed obesity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the need for genome and epigenome-wide association studies to understand better how obesity can be inherited.
- Identify the important genes associated with syndromic and non-syndromic obesity.
- Describe the crucial times in human life when epigenetic modifications can occur.
- Explain the importance of a detailed history, physical examination, and genetic tests that can be used to diagnose genetically and epigenetically inherited causes of obesity.
