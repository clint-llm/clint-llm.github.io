The premise of the vagal nerve stimulation is to activate various neurochemical coordinates arising from the NTS to different parts of the brain. The FDA approved indications are:

**Epilepsy**

An implantable vagus nerve stimulator was used in 1988 in a patient with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy for the first time.

**Depression**

The use of VNS for treatment-resistant depression was approved in 2005.

**Other Investigational Clinical Applications**

The Vagus nerve plays an important role in conveying information about peripheral proinflammatory cytokines in the body to the brain (NTS) as the vagal afferents are sensitive to the presence of interleukins and prostaglandins.

**Transcutaneous Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS)**

This is a non-invasive method of delivering the transcutaneous stimulation directly to the auricular branch of the vagus nerve and has been widely discussed in recent days.

There are two subsets for taVNS that are closed-loop:

1. Respiratory-gated Auricular Vagal Afferent Nerve Stimulation (RAVANS)

2. Motor Activated Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (MAAVNS)
