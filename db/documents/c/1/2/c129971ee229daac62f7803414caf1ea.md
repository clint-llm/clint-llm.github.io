The main aim of the treatment is to eliminate the tumor, prevent recurrences, safeguard the vision, and prevent any untoward medical or surgical complications. Till a few years back, surgical excision was the only standard treatment for OSSN, but tremendous research in the medical management of OSSN has proved wonders for treating physicians and ophthalmologists.

**Medical Treatment**

The medical management is subdivided into chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapy.

**Chemotherapy -**There are various advantages of topical chemotherapy, which include-

1.The entire ocular surface is treated in a single application; hence there is no need to worry about obtaining clear tissue margins as in the case of excisional biopsy

2. It selectively targets the tumor cells. Hence the risk of limbal stem cell deficiency is eliminated as it is ocular with extensive surgical resection.

3. Chemotherapy is simple, cost-effective, and is useful in recurrent cases as compared to surgery,

The disadvantage can be limited penetration as in cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Various important chemotherapeutic agents for OSSN include:

1. **Mitomycin C (MMC)**- It is useful for primary and recurrent cases of OSSN. It is antitumor antibiotics that inhibit DNA synthesis and are effective in the G1 and S phase of the cell cycle. The usual dose of MMC is 0.02% to 0.04% 4 times per day for 1 week, followed by 1 week drug holiday. Three cycles are recommended with a maximum of 8 cycles. Some studies recommend repeat cycles at 4 to 6 weeks intervals. The 1 week on and off regimen prevents damage to slowly proliferating epithelial cells and limbal stem cells, allowing the cells to repair their DNA and prevent corneal epitheliopathy, cataract, glaucoma, and scleral necrosis. MMC induces apoptosis and necrosis and produces cell death. The effect of MMC lasts for at least 8 months, and changes persist on the surface epithelium.

**2. 5 Fluorouracil (FU)**- It is an antimetabolite and acts on the S phase of the cell cycle. It prevents DNA and RNA synthesis after conversion to 5-F DUMP, which inhibits thymidylate kinase. The dose of 5-FU is four times 1 week on and 1 week off cycle which. This regimen is better tolerated and has good efficacy.****

**Immunotherapy**

**Interferon Alpha2b (INF-a2b)**

The immunotherapeutic agent employed in the treatment of OSSN is Interferon alpha2b (INF-a2b). It is a natural glycoprotein that attaches to cell surface receptors and affects intracellular events. Interferons have antiviral and antitumor activity. It has been suggested that there is an oncogenetic link between HPV and OSSN; hence it is considered efficacious in the treatment. Off-label topical and subconjunctival interferon-a2b (INF-a2b) has been used for both primary and recurrent OSSN. It has also been used for large, diffuse, recalcitrant, and multifocal lesions. The toxicity profile is more than chemotherapeutic agents; hence it is never used as first-line therapy. Topical IFN-alpha 2b is used as 1 million international unit/ml (IU/ ml) four times a day till the subsidence of the tumor and one month thereafter. The subconjunctival dose is 3 million IU/ml/. The major advantage of interferons is that they help treat the microscopic disease present throughout the ocular surface.

**Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b**

Pegylated interferon alpha 2b has also been employed as a pilot trial in treating OSSN. It was concluded that Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b effectively treats OSSN with no to minimal side effects. A total of 3 injections were required for the complete elimination of the tumor. The practical disadvantage is the high cost of the drug, which is nearly 3 times that of interferons.

**Radiotherapy**

Earlier radium (gamma radiation) and strontium-90 (beta irradiation) were tried for OSSN treatment, but due to many side effects, longer duration of treatment, and varied complications, their use is restricted now.

**Surgical Treatment**

Surgical excision is the gold standard treatment for OSSN as it assists in tissue diagnosis and targeted adjunctive medical therapy. Excision or incisional biopsy allows for tumor removal, debulking, and also histopathological analysis and diagnosis. Primary excision entails a recurrence rate of approximately 15 to 52%

**No-touch Technique**

The surgical technique employed for perfect OSSN removal is a no-touch technique with a margin clearance of 3 to 4 mm of uninvolved conjunctiva. The primary aim is to avoid direct manipulation of the tumor to prevent tumor seeding in the surrounding. A good conjunctival margin is needed as the uninvolved tissue may still contain the residual dysplastic cells. Absolute alcohol is used to loosen the corneal epithelium from underneath the basement membrane. Post alcohol application, the surface is rinsed with saline for 30 to 40 seconds to prevent toxicity due to absolute alcohol. The loosened tumor tissue is scraped from the corneal surface with the help of either a crescent blade or Beaver blade or surgical sponges to prevent damage to underlying Bowman’s membrane and stroma. The residual conjunctival defect can be either closed primarily if the defect is less than 3 clock hours. In case of large defects (>3 clock hours), either conjunctival limbal autograft, conjunctival autograft, or amniotic membrane graft can be used. After excision, frozen sections can be used. This will help in knowing the adequacy of excision and locate the horizontal spread of the tumor. The Mohs technique of tumor excision (Bunn’s modification) can also be used for tumor surveillance.

**Cryotherapy**

Cryotherapy is used intraoperatively to destroy the residual tumor cells at the conjunctival margin. It acts by reducing the temperature and ischemic necrosis of cells. A cryoprobe tip of nitrous oxide (2.5 to 5 mm) is used. It forms an ice ball over 2 mm conjunctival tissue, 1 mm of episcleral, and 0.5 mm of the cornea. A double-free thaw technique is also recommended (freeze-thaw-freeze). The limbal application is avoided to prevent damage to limbal stem cell deficiency. The recommended duration of the contact is 3 seconds in one single application.

**Enucleation and Exenteration**

Enucleation and exenteration are rarely required in cases of intraocular or intraorbital spread.

**Current Recommended Therapeutic Strategy**

Basti et al. made recommendations based on recent advances and current treatment modalities in OSSN.

- In case of suspected OSSN of 1 to 3 clock hours – The recommendation is complete excision biopsy. In case of residual tumor in margins, MMC is administered. The patient should be followed up at 3 months to evaluate tumor resolution. The next follow-up should be every 6 months. In another scenario where tumor margins have no residual cell, a 3 monthly follow-up should be done for a year and every 6 months thereafter.

- In case of suspected OSSN of 3 to 6 clock hours - The recommendation is a biopsy to assess the invasiveness of the tumor. If preinvasive: administer MMC. Follow the patient every month with 3 monthly follow up for tumor resolution. If there is a complete resolution, 6 monthly follow-ups should be done. In case of an invasive tumor, initial chemo reduction is recommended, followed by surgical excision. The defect must be covered with an amniotic membrane graft. Follow up with the patient monthly, followed by 3 monthly evaluations for tumor recurrence.

- In case of suspected OSSN of >6 clock hours, the recommendation is a biopsy to decide whether the tumor is invasive or preinvasive. The patient should be followed up monthly with 3 monthly evaluations for tumor resolution. If there is a complete resolution, a 6 monthly follow-up must be done. In case of invasive tumor- high-dose chemotherapy with MMC is recommended. If there is complete resolution, monthly follow-up for a year followed by 3 monthly thereafter. In case of partial resolution, chemo reduction followed by surgical excision with cryotherapy is recommended. The residual defect is covered with an amniotic membrane graft.

- Thereafter monthly follow-up, with 3 monthly evaluations to confirm the absence of recurrence. Later,  every 3 months, follow up. In the case of greater than 6 months after chemotherapy, palliative radiotherapy must be done.
