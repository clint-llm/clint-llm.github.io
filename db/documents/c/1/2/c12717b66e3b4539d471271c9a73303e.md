Conscious sedation is a technique whereby patients undergo a drug-induced depression of their consciousness but retain the ability to self-ventilate, maintain protective reflexes, and respond to verbal or light-pressure stimuli. It is a valuable tool often used in dentistry due to its anxiolytic effects. It makes treatment accessible to nervous patients or those with medical requirements, increasing their cooperation and enabling the practitioner to complete complex treatment without rendering the patient unconscious. Conversely, a general anesthetic is where the patient is unconscious and unresponsive. Respiratory support is, therefore, essential to maintain the airway.

Local anesthetic (LA) controls loco-regional pain but does not affect consciousness. Conscious sedation is anxiolytic but does provide adequate analgesia, so LA must also be used.

Benzodiazepines, nitrous oxide gas, opioids, ketamine, and propofol are drugs used to provide conscious sedation. Their routes of administration include intravenous, intranasal, oral, and inhalation.

- Inhalation sedation using nitrous oxide/oxygen

- Oral sedation using diazepam

- Single-drug intravenous sedation using midazolam
