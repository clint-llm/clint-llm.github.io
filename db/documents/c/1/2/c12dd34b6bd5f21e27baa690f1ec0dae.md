Brachial neuritis could have a very wide range of etiologies. More common causes that have been reported in the literature include infection, whether bacterial, parasitic, or viral; Coxsackie B virus; mumps; variola major and minor; HIV; and parvovirus B19.

Other conditions that predispose patients to developing brachial neuritis are exposure to surgery, anesthesia, rheumatic diseases such as connective tissue disorders (i.e., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa. Trauma to the shoulder girdle and stressful exercise are other determining factors.

Additional sources include immunizations, including tetanus toxoid and antitoxin, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT) vaccine, smallpox, swine flu, pregnancy, and childbirth, radiation therapy, lumbar puncture, pneumoencephalogram, radiologic contrast dye administration, and allergy desensitization.

The majority of brachial neuritis cases are sporadic, however, there does exist a hereditary form that is autosomal dominant which is called hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy aka HNA.
