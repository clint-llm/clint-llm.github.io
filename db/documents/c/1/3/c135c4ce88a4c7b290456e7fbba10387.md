Dementia: A patient may have aphasia components as part of a diagnosis of dementia, but nfvPPA will always have aphasia as the initial and primary symptom.

- Ischemic aphasia: An ischemic process will have symptoms of aphasia occurring more acutely. In nfvPPA, a gradually progressive process develops over the years.

- Brain tumor: A brain tumor located at a site affecting speech and language may cause aphasia in a progressive course as the lesion gradually grows. However, imaging would help differentiate a tumor from nfvPPA.

- Alzheimer's disease: Dementia is an initial and prominent sign of Alzheimer disease; nfvPPA will not have dementia at the onset of the disease process, as aphasia should be the primary and initial symptom.

- Frontotemporal dementia: Dementia may develop several years after diagnosing nfvPPA; however,Â nfvPPA will always have aphasia as the primary and initial symptom.
