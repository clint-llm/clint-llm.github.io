The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a receptor of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain. It plays an integral role in synaptic plasticity, which is a neuronal mechanism believed to be the basis of memory formation. NMDA receptors also appear to have involvement in a process called excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity may play a role in the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases such as epilepsy or Alzheimer disease. Many drugs inhibit NMDA receptors, including ketamine and phencyclidine, two common drugs of abuse.
