Numerous factors affect the final visual outcome in a child with a pediatric cataract. Visually significant cataract produces blurred images on the retina and thus affect the development of visual pathways and connections in the occipital cortex. Today, with a better understanding of the consequences of cataracts in the early age group and the advancement of the surgical techniques to deal with the same, it is recommended to remove a visually significant cataract at the earliest to prevent sensory deprivation amblyopia. Unilateral cataracts are by far more amblyogenic than bilateral cataracts and thus to be operated on within the first few weeks to months.

The time of diagnosis of a pediatric cataract also plays a crucial role in prognosticating the final visual outcomeâ€”the earlier the diagnosis, the earlier the treatment, the better the prognosis, and vice versa. Associated ocular diseases include microcornea, corneal opacities, glaucoma, intraocular inflammation, posterior segment abnormalities, and ocular movement disorders such as unsteady fixation, strabismus, nystagmus, or nystagmoid movements denote poorer prognosis post-surgery.
