Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may manifest from numerous conditions or maybe the underlying etiology for some disease states.

Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) involves the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone. This excessive ADH release may stem from hypothalamic hyperactivity, or ectopic sources (e.g., small-cell carcinoma). Increased ADH promotes free-water reabsorption from the filtrate, leading to an inappropriately elevated urine osmolality (greater than 100 mOsmol/L) compared to blood plasma and by consequence, hyponatremia.

Kidney disease, in both acute and chronic contexts, impairs glomerular function, thereby reducing the production of the filtrate. Typically, this translates to increased water retention, increased potassium retention and dilution of plasma sodium concentrations due to reduced water excretion.

Edema is the presence of excess fluid in either the intracellular fluid compartment or the extracellular fluid compartment. In the case of extracellular edema, more commonly considered clinically, osmotic causes may include acute or chronic kidney failure, mineralocorticoid excess, decreased plasma proteins (e.g., nephrotic syndrome) or decreased hepatic synthesis of proteins. Symptomatically, this may present as either generalized edema, also known as anasarca; or it may be more localized, as seen in sacral, pretibial, pulmonary edema.
