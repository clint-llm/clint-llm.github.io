Management often requires a multidisciplinary and interprofessional team approach for eyelid colobomas because of their association with other ocular and systemic pathologies. An oculoplastic surgeon will be needed for surgical correction. Pediatric ophthalmology and potentially optometry will be required to manage refractive error and amblyopia. There are a multitude of medical specialists that may be needed if a syndromic condition is associated with eyelid coloboma. Pediatricians (including pediatric NPs and PAs) are often the first to recognize the eyelid abnormality and refer the patient to the appropriate specialists. Interdisciplinary liaison should be adopted to ensure the proper treatment, thus improving the ultimate cosmetic and visual outcome.

Nursing staff can play a vital role in addressing eyelid coloboma by assisting before, during, and after surgery, providing a patient contact point for the clinicians, answering patient questions, and providing patient counsel. Thus, interprofessional coordination will help drive improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
