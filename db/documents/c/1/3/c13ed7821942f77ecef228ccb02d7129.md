A diagnosis of guttate psoriasis can usually be made on history and clinical grounds alone. Skin biopsy is typically not necessary; however, lesions should demonstrate the histopathological findings discussed above. An elevated antistreptolysin O, anti-DNase B or streptozyme titer can indicate a recent streptococcal infection, further guiding the diagnosis towards guttate psoriasis.
