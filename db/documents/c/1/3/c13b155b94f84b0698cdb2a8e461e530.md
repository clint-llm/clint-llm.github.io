Nitroglycerin is a vasodilatory drug used primarily to provide relief from anginal chest pain. Nitroglycerin has been FDA approved since 2000 and was first sold as a brand-name agent. It is currently FDA approved for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis of angina pectoris secondary to coronary artery disease. Off-label, non-FDA-approved uses include treatment for hypertensive urgency/emergency, coronary artery spasm, angina secondary to cocaine use, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic anal fissures. Along with hydralazine as a combination therapy, it is also indicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection in whom ACE inhibitors are contraindicated. Nitroglycerin is occasionally given to reduce radial spasms during coronary angiography through the radial approach.  Nitroglycerin was first used in 1879 as a treatment for angina and since it has been part of management to relieve anginal chest pain.

Although nitroglycerin has a vasodilatory effect in both arteries and veins, the profound desired effects caused by nitroglycerin are primarily due to venodilation.
