More than 90% of the patients experience considerable improvement in their hearing ability after the surgery. Occasionally, there may be a few cases in which the surgery yields no particular benefits. Worsening of the hearing loss has also been reported rarely. Improved results have been recorded when making use of laser techniques and vein grafts.

Additionally, there is a chance of recurrence of the conductive hearing loss, which may be due to the displacement of the prosthesis out of its original position. The cause is likely to be the contraction of collagen in the neomembrane formed between the prosthesis and the labyrinth. It has been observed that revision surgery is less successful than the first surgery.
