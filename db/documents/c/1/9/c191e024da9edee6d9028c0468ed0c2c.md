An interprofessional team evaluates the patients and performs pre-procedural testing to determine candidacy for the procedure. The inquiry related to the past history of allergy to seafood or contrast agents is vital. Important pre-procedure laboratory tests include PT and PTT, serum electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine. The patient is required to be well hydrated. Medication review is essential including cessation of anticoagulants if possible. Also, common medications including NSAIDs, or ACEIs can be held to prevent worsening renal insufficiency. The diabetes medication metformin is held prior to cardiac catheterization to avoid worsening renal insufficiency and lactic acidosis. Fluids and food are restricted 6 to 8 hours before the procedure. When cases are performed via radial artery access, patients are often given intra-arterial calcium channel blocker, nitroglycerin, and heparin to prevent vasospasm. The health care provider should thoroughly explain the procedure and its associated risks and complications to the patient to obtain a signed informed consent.
