Trauma resulting in valgus stress on the elbow, such asÂ falling on an outstretched hand or through throwing or wrestling, causes an avulsion fracture of the medial epicondyle. These injuries are frequently associated with elbow dislocations. Medial epicondylar fractures are most commonly caused by the pull of the attachments at the medial epicondyle during valgus stress - the ulnar collateral ligament and flexor-pronator mass. The medial epicondyle fracture typically displaces anteriorly as a result of the pull of these muscles. A less common mechanism of medial epicondyle fracture occurs from a direct blow to the elbow.
