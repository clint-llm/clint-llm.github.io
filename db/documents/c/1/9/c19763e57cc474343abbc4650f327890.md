The physiatrist/technician orients the patient on the indications of the electrodiagnostic studies that will be performed to confirm the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy and get consent after complications are explained. EMG needle testing and sensory/motor NCS in proximal and distal muscles are performed bilaterally to compare findings.

For electrodiagnostic studies, there are three electrodes used to record nerve potentials. These are the active electrode, reference electrode, and ground electrode. The active electrode is placed, covering the muscle belly directly. The reference electrode is placed on a nearby tendon or bone, approximately three to four centimeters from the tested muscle. The ground electrode is important to minimize artifact when recording potentials. It is placed between the stimulating and recording electrode.

For the needle exam, the needle should be inserted quickly into the muscle belly. Monitor for exertional activity. Electrical stimulation occurs via a cathode and anode, along with the use of conduction gel. A cathode is a negative pole, and an anode is a positive node. Electrical impulses are created by stimulating the tested nerve, and the action potential is recorded onto the screen. Several factors are measured on the potential created, such as amplitude and onset latency. When testing for cervical radiculopathy, six muscle groups are tested, where one must be a cervical paraspinal muscle.
