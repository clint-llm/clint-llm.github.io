Since PPV is always carried out in the operating room, standard operative equipment is required. However, since the surgery is very specialized, there is additional equipment needed. The following is a list of the standard equipment for PPV from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, along with some additional updated modifications.

- Eyelid speculum

- Fine toothed forceps

- Wescott scissors

- Toothed forceps

- 20-gauge micro-vitreoretinal blade: this is rarely needed nowadays and mainly used to make larger sclerotomies. This blade may be needed for fragmatome lifting when removing intraocular foreign bodies.

- Infusion cannula with an inserter-cannula system

- Vitrectomy suction/cutting system

- Corneal lens ring

- Contact lenses focal or wide angles

- Trocar and cannulas. Gauges include 23, 25, and 27g.

- Indirect ophthalmoscope lenses with 20 and 30 diopter lenses

- Intraocular instrumentation for forceps, scissors, and pick

- Endolasers or indirect lasers

- Cryotherapy probes if required

- Perfluorocarbon liquid, gases, or silicone oil if necessary

- Inverting system for wide-angle vitrectomy lenses

- Visualization through microscopes. More recently, a heads-up display with 3 dimensional systems has gained popularity. Those provide advantages such as better ergonomics for surgeons and less light needed for visualization. It also improves teaching for students, residents, and fellows since everyone can see the 3-dimensional details of the procedure. It may even confer specific benefits for selected cases.

- Intraocular light pipes

Other specialized equipment may also be necessary in combined cases. Examples include PPV with anterior segment surgery or combined with oculoplastic surgery for lid and orbital cases.
