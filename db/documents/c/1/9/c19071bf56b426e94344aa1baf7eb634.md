By far, the most important aspect of the workup forÂ linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is obtaining biopsies for histopathological examination. The provider should obtain two punch biopsies, one for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining and the other for direct immunofluorescence (DIF). The biopsy for routine H and E should be obtained from an actual skin lesion, while the sample for DIF should be obtained from the perilesional skin. Additional workup may include indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) to test for the presence or absence of circulating IgA anti-basement membrane zone antibodies, which may be found in up to 70% of LABD patients but are not found in patients with DH. In the lamina lucida subtype of LABD, these antibodies will adhere to the roof of a salt-split skin test (epidermal side), while in the sub-lamina densa variant the antibodies will adhere to the floor (dermal side).

A thorough history and physical examination may significantly help guide the provider towards a diagnosis of LABD, even before the pathology report returns. A complete review of medications, including all over-the-counter medications along with vitamins and mineral supplements, is crucial to help rule out drug-induced LABD.
