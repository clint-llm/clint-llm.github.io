The kidneys are located in the retroperitoneum between the 12th thoracic and fourth lumbar vertebrae. The right kidney is more inferior than the left due to the position of the liver. Grossly, the kidneys consist of a cortex, medulla, and hilum. On ultrasound, the cortex is homogeneous and should be isoechoic relative to the liver parenchyma. The medullary pyramids appear as hypoechoic triangular structures with intervening tissue that is contiguous with the cortex. The central collecting system is formed of small minor and major calyces that are buried within the hyperechoic fat of the renal pelvis when no obstruction is present. At the renal pelvis, the ureters (also indistinguishable in the absence of obstruction) travel slightly medially and inferiorly in the retroperitoneal space. Distally, the ureters enter the posterior-inferior aspect of the bladder at the ureterovesical junctions (UVJs). Occasionally, the UVJs can be seen in a transverse view of the bladder as “humps” that protrude into the bladder lumen bilaterally from the posterior wall. In this view, the bladder appears rectangular, contains anechoic urine, and is just superior to the pubic symphysis. In a sagittal plane, the bladder appears more triangular.
