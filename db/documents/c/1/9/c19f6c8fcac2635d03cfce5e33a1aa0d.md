In some patients, fetal circulation shunts remain patent after delivery. Usually, patients with an open fetal shunt are asymptomatic and may only have a cardiac murmur upon auscultation. A patent foramen ovale connects the right and left atria and is usually found as an incidental finding on echocardiogram or after a cryptogenic stroke. In patients with a patent foramen ovale, there is a possibility that a thrombus from the lower extremity may bypass the lungs. This can be accomplished when the blood enters the right atrium, flows through the foramen ovale, and empties into the left atrium.

The most worrisome complication of pulmonary circulation dysfunction is a pulmonary embolism which usually arises as a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity. Rarely do DVTs occur without satisfying at least one of the three components of Virchowâ€™s triad: hypercoagulability, endothelial damage, and venous stasis.
