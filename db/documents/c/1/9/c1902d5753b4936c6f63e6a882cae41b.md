PS/PSA is one of the areas of medicine that exemplifies medicine as an interprofessional team sport. Ideally, there are two physicians available, one to perform the procedure and one to administer the sedation and monitor the patient. In resource-constrained settings and many emergency departments, a properly trained nurse can monitor the patient and can, under the supervision of a qualified physician, administer these medications. However, the operating physician must be ready to abandon the procedure and support the patient, paying particular attention to the airway. A nurse or another staff dedicated to the monitoring of the patient during the procedure is mandatory. Additionally, the nurse should ensure that all resuscitative equipment and antidotes are in the room before the procedure starts.  Interprofessional team communication is crucial among all interprofessional team members for patient safety and positive outcomes.
