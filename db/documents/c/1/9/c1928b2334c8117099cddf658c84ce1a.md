There is no reliable laboratory test, or consistent electromyography findings can be used to diagnose arachnoiditis formally. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and symptoms, along with supporting MRI or CT myelography. Pathological radiologic features do not always correspond to clinical findings and their severity. The diagnosis of adhesive arachnoiditis should start by taking a thorough history to identify possible associated causes and risk factors. It is important to exclude other possible treatable conditions responsible for the symptoms. The MRI scan remains the imaging modality of choice. However, in conditions where MRI was negative, thecaloscopy can also be used to help diagnose loculated arachnoid cysts for the diagnosis of arachnoiditis.Â It is worth noting that neurophysiological tests such as EMG and NCV, are not useful to make a reliable diagnosis of arachnoiditis, especially in the later stages of arachnoiditis.
