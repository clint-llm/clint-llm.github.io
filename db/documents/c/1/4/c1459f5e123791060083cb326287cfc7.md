For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. If necessary, laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results.Â Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance.

Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. If a run is declared out of control, investigate the system (instrument, standards, controls, etc.) to determine the cause of the problem. Do not perform any analysis until the problem has been resolved.

Consider all specimens, control materials, and calibrator materials as potentially infectious. Exercise the standard precautions required for handling all laboratory reagents. Disposal of all waste material should be in accordance with local guidelines.
