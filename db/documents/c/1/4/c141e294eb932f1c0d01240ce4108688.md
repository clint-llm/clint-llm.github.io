In general, electrical stimuli applied during routine NCS are safe.  However, in patients with external pacers, microcurrents can trigger dangerous arrhythmias, and therefore nerve conduction studies should not be performed until external pacer wires are removed.  Implantable pacemakers and defibrillators, as well as central lines, have been shown to be safe. Reasonable caution should be taken with proximal stimulation near these internal devices.

There are no absolute contraindications for needle EMG. Anticoagulation poses potential risks and represents a relative contraindication. Safely measures should be taken to avoid hemorrhagic complications.
