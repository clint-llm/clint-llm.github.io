Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a congenital heart defect that accounts for 8 to 14 percent of all cases of congenital aortic stenosis. It involves a narrowing of the portion of the aorta located just above the aortic valve. The three types of SVAS that have been recognized are hourglass, membranous, and hypoplasia of the aortic arch. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of supravalvular aortic stenosis and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of supravalvular aortic stenosis.
- Outline exam findings consistent with supravalvular aortic stenosis.
- Identify treatment considerations for patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by supravalvular aortic stenosis.
