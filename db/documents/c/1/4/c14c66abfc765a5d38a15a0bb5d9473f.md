Sympathomimetic agents may categorize as direct or indirect. Direct sympathomimetics function as agonists upon one or more adrenergic receptors. The pharmacological profile of direct sympathomimetics has its primary basis on the subtype of adrenergic receptors. Adrenergic receptor activity largely depends on the receptor's molecular structure, signaling pathway, anatomic distribution, and dosing concentration. Adrenergic receptors include the alpha and beta families. Direct sympathomimetics may act as selective or mixed agonists at the alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha-adrenergic receptors subdivide into alpha-1 and alpha-2.

Beta-adrenergic receptors subdivide into beta-1, beta-2, and beta-3. Adrenergic receptors are G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors that use guanosine triphosphate as a cofactor.
