The GALT gene on chromosome 9p13 encodes for galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, which is responsible for metabolizing galactose-1-phosphate to UDP-galactose. Deficiency of the enzyme leads to classic galactosemia. The GALK1 gene on chromosome 17q24 encodes for galactokinase, which is responsible for metabolizing galactose to galactose-1-phosphate. The GALE gene on chromosome 1p36-p35 encodes for UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, which is responsible for metabolizing UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose for use in glycogenesis. Inheritance is autosomal recessive, so both parents must be carriers, and offspring have a 25% chance of having clinical symptoms. Carriers do not typically demonstrate symptoms.

Duarte galactosemia is a variant of galactosemia due to diminished galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase enzyme activity (typically around 14% to 25%). Individuals born with Duarte variant galactosemia are thought to be asymptomatic with or without dietary intervention, and the consensus among health professionals is that affected individuals do not require treatment. However, some reports to the contrary exist, and no adequately powered study has been completed to verify or refute the possible effects of diminished GALT activity on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Duarte galactosemia may or may not be detected by newborn screening testing.
