The treatment of mucinous breast carcinoma is based on surgery associated with post-operative hormone therapy in hormone-responsive (ER/PR) tumors.

A recent study recommended axillary staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy and administration of adjuvant radiotherapy and hormone therapy after breast-conservation for mucinous carcinoma

Since most mucinous carcinomas are negative for the protein HER2/neu, they are not treated with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is approved for both the treatment of advanced breast cancer and as adjuvant therapy for early-stage HER2- positive tumors

Some authors have stated that adjuvant chemotherapy can be omitted in cases with favorable risk factors
