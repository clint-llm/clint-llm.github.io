The ankle-brachial index is measured using three arteries: the brachial artery for the upper extremity and the dorsalis pedis and or posterior tibial artery at the ankle.

Dorsalis pedis artery: The dorsalis pedis artery arises primarily from the anterior tibial artery and starts higher in the anterior compartment of the leg between the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus (EHL). In most cases, the vessel above the ankle passes under the EHL to reside between EHL and the extensor digitorum longus (EDL). Other variations include later crossing sites either at the ankle or distal.

Posterior tibial artery: The posterior tibial artery passes posterior to medial malleolus at the ankle between the tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus tendons.

Brachial artery: The brachial artery is palpable medial to biceps tendon in the antecubital fossa.
