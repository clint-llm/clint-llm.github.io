Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic disease that potentially affects about two million Americans.

CFS does not only present with fatigue but also cognitive dysfunction and impairment of routine functioning that persists for six months or more. CFS is a biological condition, not a psychological disorder. The exact pathogenesis remains to be fully understood. Various mechanisms and biochemical changes have been implicated that affect immune function, hormonal regulation, and response to oxidative stress. It also includes natural killer cell dysfunction and/or T-cell dysfunction, elevated cytokines, and autoantibodies.

Patients with CFS can sometimes present to the emergency department with a list of complex symptoms, such as orthostatic intolerance, postexertional malaise (PEM), fatigue, and diarrhea.
