Brachytherapy involves suturing a plaque to the sclera to deliver focal radiation to the tumor. It is the most frequently employed modality in the United States. Iodine-125 is the preferred isotope in the U.S. and emits gamma radiation, which penetrates deeply into tumors. Following treatment, a regular ophthalmologic examination should be performed to monitor for complications, including radiation-induced retinopathy, cataracts, neovascular glaucoma, and macular edema, which can develop up to 5 years after therapy. The use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after brachytherapy has been shown to reduce or delay the rate of macular edema andÂ vision loss.
