There are two primary pathologies of the aortic valve; the valve can either be stenotic or insufficient (aka regurgitant). When the valve leaflets become stiff, it leads to a reduced orifice, and the pressure gradient across the valve increases, sometimes leading to decreased anterograde flow during systole; this can lead to several clinical consequences, usually beginning with left ventricular hypertrophy, which can later include dilation, decreased cardiac output, arrhythmias, ischemia, etc. Aortic insufficiency occurs due to inadequate closure of the aortic valve during diastole leading to retrograde blood flow from the aorta into the left ventricle. The consequences of this are an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and wall stress.
