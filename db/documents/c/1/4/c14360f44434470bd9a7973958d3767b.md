The most common causes of sternal fractures are blunt anterior chest wall trauma and deceleration injuries. Motor vehicle collisions, athletic injuries, falls, and assaults are the mostÂ frequent causes.

Anterior chest wall pain is typically present with sternal fractures. Shortness of breath is a presenting symptom in up to one-fifth of cases. Deep breathing and coughing may aggravate pain. Pain reported in sternal stress fractures or acute insufficiency fractures may mimic other serious medical conditions as there is no obvious mechanism of injury, and the pain is typically more diffuse.

Point tenderness over the sternum is frequently present in sternal fractures. Soft tissue swelling, ecchymoses, or palpable deformity may also be present in approximately half of the reported cases. Fracture-related crepitus may be present upon palpation.

Assessment for other associated injuries is paramount, including rib fractures, flail chest, sternoclavicular dislocation, pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, cardiac tamponade, myocardial contusion, pulmonary contusion, intra-abdominal injuries, spinal compression fractures, as well as other traumatic injuries.
