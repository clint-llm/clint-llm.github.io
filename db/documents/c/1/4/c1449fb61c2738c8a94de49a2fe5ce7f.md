School children with early-onset myopia usually have higher axial length and refractive error. On the contrary, the course of progression in patients with congenital myopia (myopia more than -5 D at less than six years of age) is different. Shih et al., in their observation, found faster rates of myopia progression in children with lower grades of myopia, 5.0 to 7.75 D, compared to children with higher grades of myopia (maximum of 11.0 D).

Patients with pathological myopia, thinned-out choroid, and posterior staphyloma have worse visual outcomes in the long term.
