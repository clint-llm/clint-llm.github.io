Rubella, orÂ German measles, is a mild viral infection that typically occurs in children and non-immune young adults. It typically begins with low-grade fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy, followed by a brief generalized erythematous maculopapular rash.

In nonpregnant individuals, rubella is generally a self-limited and benign infection. However, maternal rubella infection, especially during the first 10 weeks of gestation, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, or severe birth defects collectively known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

After the introduction of the live attenuated rubella vaccine in 1969, the incidence of rubella infection has decreased dramatically in many countries and was effectively eradicated from the United States; however, rubella remains a public health concern and a significant source of disability around the world.
