Doxorubicin (most common with pegylated lysosomal preparation), cytarabine, docetaxel, capecitabine, or 5-fluorouracil (mostly infusional regimen) are the most frequently implicated agents

Other drugs causing acral erythema are bleomycin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, doxifluridine, etoposide, fludarabine, gemcitabine, hydroxyurea, idarubicin, ixabepilone, methotrexate, mitotane, paclitaxel, tegafur, thiotepa, and vinorelbine.

It is also postulated that genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in the metabolism of some fluoropyrimidines like Capecitabine are the culprit in developing PPE

PPE seems to be dose-dependent, and both peak drug concentration and total cumulative dose determine its occurrence.Â Drug formulation and administration schedules that result in sustained serum levels of cytotoxic agents are more frequently associated with acral erythema

Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors and others that target angiogenesis are associated with hand-foot skin reactions (This is not discussed in the current article). However, clinical and histologic patterns differ from the typical acral erythema that develops with standard cytotoxic agents.
