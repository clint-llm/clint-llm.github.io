**Metabolic Consequences of Proteinuria**

Following are the metabolic consequences of the nephrotic syndrome:

- Infection

- Hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities

- Hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis

- Hypercoagulability

- Hypovolemia

Acute kidney injury may suggest underlying glomerulonephritis but is more commonly precipitated by hypovolemia or sepsis. Another proposition is that the edema of the kidneys causes a pressure-­mediated reduction in the GFR. Additional consequences include the following:

- Hypertension due to reduced kidney function and fluid retention

- Edema of the gut could cause defective absorption resulting in malnutrition

- Ascites and pleural effusions

- Generalized edema

- Respiratory distress

- Sepsis

- Peritonitis

- Thromboembolism

- Failure to thrive
