Some substances interfere with drug testing (e.g., poppy seeds interfere with opioid testing). In these cases, a confirmatory or metabolite test may be required through mass spectrometry or immunoassays to verify the correct substance in the patient's system.

- Amphetamine immunoassays: amantadine, bupropion, ephedrine, labetalol, phentermine, pseudoephedrine, ranitidine, selegiline, and trazodone metabolites

- Benzodiazepine immunoassays: oxaprozin, sertraline, efavirenz

- Cannabis immunoassays: ibuprofen, naproxen, efavirenz, pantoprazole, baby washes

- Cocaine immunoassays: few interferences are known, but the medical use of cocaine as a local anesthetic or drinking tea from coca leaves is a possible cause of interference.

- Opioid immunoassays: quinolones, verapamil

- Tricyclic antidepressant immunoassays: carbamazepine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine, phenothiazines

On the other hand, immunoassays can fail to detect related substances. Some examples are:

- Amphetamine immunoassays: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), synthetic amphetamines (cathinones, bath salts, etc.)

- Benzodiazepine immunoassays: certain higher potency benzodiazepines might be missed depending on the cut-off value used

- Cannabis immunoassays: synthetic cannabinoids will be missed

- Opioid immunoassays: buprenorphine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, methadone, oxycodone, propoxyphene, tilidine

- Tricyclic antidepressant immunoassays: All newer antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine) will not be detected

Even with confirmatory testing, interferences are possible.
