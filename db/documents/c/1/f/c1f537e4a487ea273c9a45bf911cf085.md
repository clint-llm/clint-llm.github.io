The most feared complication of tetracaine toxicity is the progression to local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) syndrome marked by all previously mentioned features of CNS and cardiovascular toxicity. The provider administering the medication must exercise prompt recognition of the progression of this syndrome.

Care is necessary to quickly secure the patientâ€™s airway and breathing and support hemodynamics. It is important to note that hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis can worsen cardiac contractility, exacerbate arrhythmia, and lower the seizure threshold. Controlled ventilation can attenuate hypoxia and hypercarbia, mitigating such effects. Additionally, benzodiazepines may be prudent when administering high doses of tetracaine as they raise the seizure threshold and have the added benefit of anxiolysis during a nerve block or surgical procedure.

While there is no direct reversal agent or treatment for tetracaine toxicity, the recommendation is to begin lipid rescue therapy immediately. Intravascular administration of concentrated lipids theoretically acts as a sump to freely circulating local anesthetic allowing for rapid clearance of the drug from systemic circulation. 20% lipid emulsion should be immediately started at 1.5 mL/kg, followed by infusion at 0.25 mL/kg/min. The bolus dose may be repeated, and the infusion increased if the patient persists with hemodynamic compromise or arrhythmia.
