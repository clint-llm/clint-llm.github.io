Two distinct pathological mechanisms for calcifications anywhere in the body are dystrophic calcifications, calcification of dead and dying tissues and metastatic calcification, calcification of normal living tissue. Metastatic calcification is usually related to disturbances in homeostasis of calcium. While dystrophic calcification is not related to any disturbance in calcium metabolism and can occur with normal calcium and phosphorous levels in the blood.
