Monoclonal gammopathy of undeterminedÂ significance (MGUS) is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes primary care providers, hematologists, medical oncologists, and nurses. There is no specific treatment for these patients, they only need long-term follow-up because of the potential to progress to myeloproliferative disorders and numerous other complications.
