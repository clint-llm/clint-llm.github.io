A dilated pore of Winer (DP), first described by Louis H. Winer in 1954, is a commonly occurring benign adnexal tumor of follicular differentiation.  Although most commonly located on the head and neck, a dilated pore of Winer can also be found on the trunk of middle-aged and elderly individuals.  These clinically present as an asymptomatic, solitary, enlarged pore with a keratin plug and normal surrounding skin.  Prognosis is excellent for these lesions as they are benign and typically do not require any further testing or work-up.  Histopathologic evaluation can confirm the diagnosis in uncertain cases.  Removal can be performed via excision for cosmetic purposes.
