Treatment aims to remove or significantly reduce the intracanal microbes and prevent re-infection by placing a root canal filling.****Apical periodontitis lesions are expected to heal completely within six months to two years, but some may persist.

Follow-up appointments are essential to assess the progression and efficacy of treatment. Further management is indicated when a periapical radiolucency remains unchanged after one year of root canal treatment, when it has increased in size, or if it appears in an endodontic-treated tooth without a prior apical disease.

A periapical radiolucency often persists when the root canal treatment cannot control the infection because some clinical steps were not adequately followed, such as insufficient aseptic control, poor instrumentation, inadequate access cavity design, unreached canals, and restoration leakage.

However, some periapical lesions may persist despite following the most strict and careful clinical protocol due to the complex anatomy of the root canal system.

Antibiotic use is generally contraindicated, except in cases with rapid onset or systemic involvement.
