The larynx develops during the fourth week of development from both the endoderm and the mesoderm. The internal lining of the larynx originates from the endoderm while the cartilages and muscles develop from the third, fourth, and sixth pharyngeal arches. At the fourth week, an outgrowth known as the laryngotracheal groove appears from the developing foregut. This groove deepens and eventually forms the esophagotracheal septum, allowing the esophagus to lie on the dorsal side of the septum and the rest of the respiratory tract anteriorly. The groove's length continues to become the laryngotracheal diverticulum which eventually will give rise to the larynx, trachea, and lungs. The laryngeal lumen at first is obliterated due to the epithelial proliferation. However, it becomes re-canalized between weeks 7 to 10. The arches give rise to the nerves, cartilages, and musculature in the larynx. They are:

Third Branchial Arch

- Cranial nerve IX

- Greater horn of hyoid, epiglottis

Fourth Branchial Arch

- Superior Laryngeal Nerve

- Thyroid cartilage, cuneiform cartilage, epiglottis

- Cricopharyngeus muscle, cricothyroid muscle

Sixth Branchial Arch

- Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve

- Cricoid cartilage, arytenoid cartilages, corniculate cartilages

- Intrinsic musculature of the larynx

Interestingly, no part of the larynx is ossified at birth. The first to ossify is the hyoid around the second or third year of life. The teenage years are when the thyroid cartilage ossifies, while the cricoid does not ossify until the fourth decade of life.
