Several imaging modalities are available for establishing the diagnosis of chondroblastoma. They include:

- Plain radiographs

- Computed tomography (CT)

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

A well-demarcated eccentric and lytic lesion with a thin rim of sclerotic bone is the typical radiologic presentation of chondroblastomas. Chondroblastomas are relatively small (3 to 6 cm) and occupy less than half of the epiphysis. There is generally no expansion of the bone.

**Plain radiographs:**

Plain radiographs show a fuzzy, round-to-oval, well-delineated lesion with a sclerotic rim.

**Computed tomography:**

Computed tomography can demonstrate calcifications that are not detectable on plain radiographs. It can depict cortical erosion, matrix mineralization, and soft tissue extension.

**Magnetic resonance imaging:**

In chondroblastomas, MRI  demonstrates extensive edema surrounding the lesion. The signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted MRI images depends on the levels of various components within the lesion. Most cases show variable intensity on T2-weighted images.
