The entire human body derives from either ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. Nerves specifically come from ectoderm. The neural tube and neural crest cells form from ectoderm. These structures will eventually become the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.

The spinal and brain nerves begin their development around the end of the first embryonic month. During this period, the neuroblasts of the basal lamina of the spinal cord emit neurites, applying themselves to developing myotomes. These are the primordial motor fibers intended to constitute the anterior roots of the spinal nerves. The sensory component begins to form around the second embryonic month.
