DED may lead to a number of symptoms.

- Stinging, burning, or a feeling of pressure in the eyes.

- A sandy, gritty, or foreign body sensation.

- Epiphora, or tearing, is a symptom that is often counterintuitive. This is due to dryness leading to pain or irritation that results in intermittent excess tearing or epiphora.

- Pain is a broad term, and sharp and dull pain can be described as localized to some part of the eye, behind the eye, or even around the orbit.

- Redness is a common complaint and is often made worse by the rebound effect of vasoconstrictors found in many over-the-counter eye drops designed to reduce redness. Vasoconstrictors may decrease redness for the short term by constricting the vessels of the episclera but can have a rebound effect and increased redness after the drops wear off in a relatively short time period.

- Blurry vision, particularly intermittent blurry vision, is a common complaint and may also be described as glare or haloes around lights at night.

- Vision fluctuation and difficulties in reading.

- A sensation of heavy eyelids or difficulty opening the eyes.

- Excessive blinking.

- Eyelid twitching.

- Dryness is a common problem for contact lens wearers, and irritation may make contact lenses uncomfortable or even impossible to wear.

- Tired eyes. Closing the eyes may provide relief to some individuals with dry eyes.

- Inability to cry in severe DED.
