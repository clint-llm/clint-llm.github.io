The gluteus minimus, gluteus medius, and tensor fasciae latae muscles receive innervation from the superior gluteal nerve. Functionally, both the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles are integral to the gait cycle as they provide a significant stabilizing force during the terminal swing phase. Damage to this nerve results in characteristic loss of motor function that presents as a disabling gluteus medius limp, a phenomenon known as the Trendelenburg or gluteal gait. In this condition, the weakened gluteus medius muscle causes a shift in the center of gravity to the unaffected limb. Bilateral superior gluteal nerve lesions often result in a waddling gait.

The gluteus medius is a thick, fan-shaped muscle originating from the outer aspect of the ilium superiorly from the iliac crest, the middle gluteal nerve inferiorly and the gluteal line posteriorly. The muscle then travels inferolaterally towards the lateral surface of the greater trochanter. The gluteus medius works synergistically with the gluteus minimus and tensor fasciae latae to allow for forceful hip abduction. The anterior fibers of the gluteus medius enable medial rotation of the thigh as well. Functionally, the gluteus medius muscle works with the gluteus minimus and tensor fasciae latae to allow walking and running. While walking or running, the lower extremity limb not in contact with the ground does not tilt downwards due to the contraction of the contralateral gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae.

Similarly, the gluteus minimus is also a fan-shaped muscle located deep to the gluteus medius, arising from the lateral aspect of the ilium between the inferior and middle gluteal lines. The muscle fibers travel inferolaterally towards the anterior surface of the greater trochanter. The function of the gluteus minimus mirrors that of the gluteus medius and is responsible for hip abduction and medial rotation of the thigh.

The tensor fasciae latae is a small muscle found between the iliac tubercle and anterior superior iliac spine, originating from the outer aspect of the iliac crest. The muscle travels inferiorly and posteriorly and is encased within a sheath composed by the iliotibial tract of the fascia lata located on the lateral thigh. The tensor fasciae latae allows traction on the iliotibial tract, assisting the gluteus maximus with hip and knee extension. This action is crucial in maintaining the knee in the fully extended position.
