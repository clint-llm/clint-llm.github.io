Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), also known as preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), is used to screen embryos for genetic defects before implantation. This technique is a common method used in couples who are at high risk of producing children with genetic disease. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is used to produce the embryos, and a single blastomere gets removed during the cleavage stages targeted for testing. After a biopsy, the fresh or frozen-thawed blastomere then gets transferred into the uterus based on the results of genetic testing.

PGD is commonly used to screen for monogenic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, it can also be used to determine embryo quality in IVF and for HLA matching of the embryo to a sick sibling. Structural chromosomal abnormality including translocation in embryos of a couple with a balanced translocation, or deletion/duplication and de novo aneuploidy (e.g., subchromosomal deletions and duplications) in embryos of couples presumed to be chromosomally normal are other PGD objectives.
