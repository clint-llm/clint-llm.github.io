Porokeratosis is an uncommon diagnosis. It usually occurs on sun-exposed skin, most commonly in the fifth decade of life, but can occur at any age and has similar frequencies in males and females.

The eruptive form of porokeratosis correlates with immune suppression, transplantation patients, inflammatory states, and malignancy.

Porokeratosis will progress to nonmelanoma skin cancer in 6.9% to 30% of cases, most frequently squamous cell carcinoma and less frequently basal cell carcinoma.

While porokeratosis is usually an acquired disease, there is often a familial predisposition that could signify a hereditary component.
