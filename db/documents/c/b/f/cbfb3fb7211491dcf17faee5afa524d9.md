For early-onset in areas where newborn screening is not available (see below), creatine kinase (CK) serum and urinary oligosaccharides can be the first step

An acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme assay can be performed in whole or dried blood

Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) gene sequencing confirms the diagnosis

Due to the variant and often misleading nature of the late-onset phenotype, mimicking or sometimes overlapping with other muscular disorders, initial testing most of the time includes EMG, nerved conduction studies (results are normal for motor and sensory pathways); and muscle biopsy
