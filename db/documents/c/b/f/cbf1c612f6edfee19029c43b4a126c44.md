All equipment needed for intubation should be readily available, including two to three different sizes of ETTs, bag-mask with positive end expiratory-pressure (PEEP) valve, airway bougies, tube exchangers, traditional direct laryngoscope, video laryngoscope, flexible bronchoscope, drugs needed for induction, and suction catheters.

Ideally, an airway bag should be available in all ICUs. It should include supraglottic airways, video laryngoscopes, and cricothyrotomy kits.

Equipment for oxygenation post-extubation should be available, either a nasal cannula, oxygen mask, venturi mask, high-flow oxygen system, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP).
