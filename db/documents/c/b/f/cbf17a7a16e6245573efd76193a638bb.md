When observing a specimen of the male urethra under light microscopy, there are several vital elements to identify. In a standard cross-sectional preparation, the first thing to look for is the lumen. The lumen will appear as empty white space on the slide surrounded by epithelial cells. In a well-prepared slide that doesn't contain artifacts, nothing should be within the lumen. Next, it is important to determine the type of epithelium that is lining the lumen to determine from which region of urethra the specimen came.

In the urethra, there will be two types of epithelium. The proximal epithelium is transitional epithelium (uroepithelium). These cells appear columnar near the basement membrane and become more rounded and dome-shaped towards the lumen. The more distal epithelium is pseudostratified columnar epithelium and appears as multiple layers of columnar cells. In reality, each cell makes contact with the basement membrane, and therefore, there is only one layer of epithelium. Single layers of epithelial cells are normally referred to as simple, but since the cells overlap in such a unique manner in vivo and during histological preparation, they tend to take on the appearance of being stratified. Because of these characteristics, this type of epithelium is referred to as pseudostratified.
