Streptococcus pyogenes is a major human-specific bacterial pathogen that causes a wide array of manifestations ranging from mild localized infections to life-threatening invasive infections. Ineffective treatment of S. pyogenes infections can result in the postinfectious sequela acute rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Moreover, it causes invasive infections like necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome that is associated with and high morbidity and mortality. This activity describes the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) and reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestations of S. pyogenes infections, evaluation, and management of clinical infections caused by S. pyogenes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of S. pyogenes.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of Streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Review the management options available for Streptococcal pharyngitis.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve the outcome of severe invasive infections caused by S. pyogenes.
