Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are uncommon neuroendocrine epithelial malignancies accounting for less than 1% of all lung cancers. They divide into two subcategories: typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids. Typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids are, respectively, low- and intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumors. Approximately 80% of pulmonary carcinoids occur centrally, and 20% are peripheral.
