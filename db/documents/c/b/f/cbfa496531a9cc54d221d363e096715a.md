To ensure the protection of the heart during cardiopulmonary bypass, administration and even distribution of cardioplegia solution to the myocardium is imperative. To accomplish this, a cardioplegia solution can be given anterograde, retrograde, or both. This activity focuses on the relevant anatomy, applications, and complications of retrograde cardioplegia for cardiac surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how retrograde cardioplegia is administered
- Review the indications for retrograde cardioplegia
- Summarize the clinical relevance of retrograde cardioplegia.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing open heart surgery and receiving retrograde cardioplegia.
