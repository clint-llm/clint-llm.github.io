The brain develops from the anterior terminus of the neural tube. In early development, the neural tube expands into three primary vesicles atÂ four weeks, forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon) and hindbrain (rhombencephalon). Ultimately, the rhombencephalon divides into two secondary vesicles at five weeks, the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. The myelencephalon constitutes of the medulla oblongata and the lower part of the fourth ventricle.
