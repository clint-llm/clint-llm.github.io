First and foremost, it is essential to educate individuals on a heart-healthy lifestyle. LDL-C is one of the major culprits in the development of atherosclerotic heart disease. The target level of LDL-C is between 50 to 70mg/dl to prevent plaque formation in the blood vessels. Patients should undergo evaluation for 10-year risk and those with more than 10 percent risk; guidelines strongly recommend statin therapy. Low levels of HDL-C are related to an increased risk of CVD; however, according to recent studies,Â HDL-C raising therapy showed no clinical benefit; therefore, routine use is not recommended.
