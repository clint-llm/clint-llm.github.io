The eyelid is derived from secondary mesenchyme and surface ectoderm. Secondary mesenchyme is produced when the cranial neural crest cells invade the mesoderm. The surface ectoderm gives rise to the eyelid skin epithelium, conjunctival, hair follicles and accessory glands. The mesenchyme gives rise to the tarsal plate, the muscles in the eyelid and the orbital septum. The eyelid begins to form during week 6 of gestation and continues to develop until nearly complete at 36 weeks. The stages of development are formation, fusion, development, separation, and maturation.
