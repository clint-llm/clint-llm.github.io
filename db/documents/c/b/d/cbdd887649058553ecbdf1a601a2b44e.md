The major contributor of innervation to the larynx is the vagus nerve, cranial nerve X, which innervates the intrinsic laryngeal musculature. The extrinsic musculature innervation divides between the vagus nerve and the cervical rootlets.

The laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve are the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The superior laryngeal nerve has two main branches - the external branch and the internal branch. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve carries somatic motor fibers to the cricothyroid muscle as its sole function.

The cervical rootlets comprise the plexus known as the ansa cervicalis. The ansa provides innervation to many of the extrinsic muscles of the larynx such as the infrahyoid and suprahyoid musculature. The pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve innervates the pharyngeal constrictors, which act with the suprahyoid muscles to elevate the larynx during swallowing.
