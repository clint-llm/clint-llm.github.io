Manual manipulative techniques involve a patient sitting upright or lying supine while they are passively manipulated or actively engage in the manipulative technique with their provider. A patient, the physician provider, and preferably a cushioned manipulation table are best for successful osteopathic manipulative treatments. If an appropriate treatment table is unavailable, it is possible to perform osteopathic techniques from a supine floor or seated position.
