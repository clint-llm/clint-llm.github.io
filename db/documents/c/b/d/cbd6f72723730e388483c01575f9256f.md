Penetrating cardiac injuries management has evolved recently, affecting the patients' outcomes significantly. Simple clinical observations are no longer accepted, and diagnostic measures, including focused assessment sonography for trauma (FAST), trans-thoracic echocardiogram, and CT scan, have assisted in more precise diagnostic measures. Collectively, the survival rate of penetrating cardiac traumas improved significantly. However, the mortality rate of penetrating cardiac trauma is still up to 40%.
