The mediastinum is contained within the thoracic cavity and has a high concentration of major vascular and visceral structures. Traumatic injury to any of these can be immediately life-threatening. The majority of patients with thoracic trauma are treated conservatively without surgical intervention, but a high index of suspicion should be maintained for patients with a potential mediastinal injury. While all patients with mediastinal injury should be treated according to Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, blunt mediastinal injuries are not as deadly as penetrating mediastinal injuries, where there are high rates of operative intervention and mortality. This activity reviews the causes of mediastinal trauma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of mediastinal trauma.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with mediastinal trauma.
- List the treatment and management options available for mediastinal trauma.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of mediastinal trauma and improve outcomes.
