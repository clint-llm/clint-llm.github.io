G-tube malfunction is commonly encountered in clinical practice both in inpatient and outpatient settings. At some institutes, G-tube replacement is exclusively done by either the gastroenterology service or interventional radiology service depending on who initially placed the tube. However, if the patient is seen in the clinic, emergency department, or a nursing home for malfunctioning G-tube, an appropriate service, either gastroenterology or interventional radiology, should be consulted. If the tube has dislodged or come out, the gastrocutaneous fistula track will start to close as soon as in 8 hours but definitely in 24 hours. The longer the duration the tube has been out of place, the higher the chances that the track has narrowed or closed. If more than 24 hours have elapsed after G-tube has been displaced, a blind forceful attempt to put a Foley or G-tube should not be done, and replacement should be referred to specialized services (gastrointestinal or interventional radiology). If G-tube has been dislodged for less than 24 hours, consider putting a temporary tube such as a Foley catheter (similar size as G-tube) to prevent the closure of the track and contact a specialty service for replacement. Once the tube is replaced, gastric placement confirmation with contrast-enhanced abdominal x-ray is recommended.
