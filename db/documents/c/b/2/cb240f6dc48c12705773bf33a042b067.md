Genu valgum is often a clinical diagnosis. Patients with this condition are typically asymptomatic but may present with medial-sided knee and/or ankle pain. While a history and physical exam are sufficient for diagnosis, there are certain indications that warrant further evaluation for pathologic conditions. While the primary care provider is usually the first clinician involved in the care of these patients, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include an orthopedist, geneticist, and a pediatric endocrinologist depending on the underlying etiology. The radiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause. Without providing a proper history, the radiologist may not be sure what to look for or what additional radiologic exams may be needed. The Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America recommends long-leg alignment imaging for evaluating pathologic genu valgum. Further, hemiepiphysiodesis is the treatment of choice in patients who are skeletally immature and osteotomies in patients who are skeletally mature. Outcomes are improved with prompt consultations and good communication with subspecialty groups.
