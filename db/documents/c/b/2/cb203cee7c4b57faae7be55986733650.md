This Romberg test illustrates a diagnostic, non-technical, physical test that identifies a specific neurologic impairment. The purpose of this evaluation, administered by any trained individual, is to identify a particular impairment in patients with specific proprioception difficulties for purposes of intervention and improving patient outcomes. The Romberg sign removes the visual and vestibular components that contribute to maintaining balance and can thus identify a proprioception-related neurologic disease. The Romberg sign is said to be positive in a patient who is able to stand with his feet placed together and eyes open but paradoxically sways or falls while closing his eyes. This activity covers the proper execution and interpretation of the Romberg test as a diagnostic tool.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the types of conditions that would lead a practitioner to perform the Romberg test. 
- Describe the process for performing the Romberg test. 
- Review the potential results of the Romberg test and their clinical significance.
- Summarize how interprofessional discussion can incorporate the results from the Romberg test may lead to a better understanding of the etiology of the patient's proprioception difficulties and may lead to developing a more narrowed strategy for improving care coordination and the patient's overall outcome.
