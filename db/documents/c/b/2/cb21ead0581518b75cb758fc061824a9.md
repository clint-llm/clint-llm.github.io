The provider should educate the patient before the procedure. A pudendalÂ nerve block is a safe and cost-effective method of obtaining regional anesthesia in the targeted area; however, patients require counseling that the response to the block is somewhat unpredictable, and they might not experience complete pain relief. When using a pudendal nerve block, the nursing staff will play a vital role in the entire process, from preparing the patient for the procedure to monitoring them during the block while assisting the clinician and providing post-injection care, patient education, and advice. With an interprofessional team approach, pudendal nerve blocks can achieve a higher rate of successful patient outcomes. [Level 5]
