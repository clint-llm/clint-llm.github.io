Patients with cutaneous or tendinous xanthomas often present to their primary care clinician or a variety of specialty providers including dermatology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and ophthalmology. It is not uncommon for these patients to present to specialty clinics for the treatment of a visible lesion and then be diagnosed with an associated metabolic condition such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, providers of various disciplines must be familiar with the presentations of these fairly common lesions and their associations with systemic disease.

On clinical exam, xanthomas have been generally described as lesions that are eruptive, tuberoeruptive, tuberous, tendinous, or planar.

These lesions are also reported to resolve spontaneously, although this may only occur after several months. Tendinous xanthomas commonly affect the Achilles tendons, elbows, and extensor tendons of the hand.

Planar xanthomas can be on the palmar creases and flexure surfaces of fingers, and skin folds and are typically seen with biliary cirrhosis.Â They can occur in a variety of anatomic regions and can be pathognomonic for different systemic conditions based on their presentation. For example, palmar crease xanthomas can be pathognomonic for familial dysbetalipoproteinemia type III.
