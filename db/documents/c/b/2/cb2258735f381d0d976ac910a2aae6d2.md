The interatrial septum receives vascular perfusion from the branches of the coronary arteries. Both the left and right coronary arteries, as well as the posterior descending artery, contribute to the network of blood that nourishes the tissues of the atrial septum. Since the exact blood supply of the heart varies between individuals, the assumption is that the right and left coronary arteries contribute blood for the interatrial tissue to varying degrees among people.

Blood gets drained from the heart by cardiac veins that meet at the coronary sinus on the posterior end of the heart and funnel into the right atrium.
