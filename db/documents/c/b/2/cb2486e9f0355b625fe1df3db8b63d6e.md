Several skin receptors play specific roles in our ability to physically perceive the changes in the external environment.

- Meissner receptors detect light touch.

- Pacinian corpuscles perceive deep pressure and vibrational changes.

- Ruffini endings detect deep pressure and stretching of the skin’s collagen fibers.

- Free nerve endings located in the epidermis respond to pain, light touch, and temperature variations.

- Merkel receptors associated with the Merkel cells respond to sustained light touch induction over the skin.

Dermatomes are areas of skin mainly supplied by a single spinal nerve. Eight cervical nerves contribute to the dermatomes (except for C1), 12 thoracic nerves, five lumbar nerves, and five sacral nerves. Each of these nerves relays sensation (including pain) from a particular region of the skin to the brain.
