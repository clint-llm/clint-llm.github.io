Patients presenting with VGS following CABG typically present with symptoms of angina. When the vein graft fails, patients may experience chest pain or a pressure-like sensation over their sternum with minimal to no exertion. Symptoms of ischemia may also include shortness of breath, palpitations, generalized weakness, diaphoresis, nausea, and epigastric discomfort.

Physical examination findings of the patient experiencing acute coronary syndrome include diaphoresis, pallor, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, S3 or S4 cardiac heart tones, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

Patients that develop VGS following PABG typically present with rest pain, claudication, and non-healing wounds. On physical examination, patients may demonstrate thinning of the skin, decreased leg temperature, hair loss, decreased or absent peripheral pulses, chronic non-healing wounds, subjective sensation loss, decreased motor function, and abnormal neuronal reflexes.
