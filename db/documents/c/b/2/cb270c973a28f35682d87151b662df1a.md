Myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart diminishes or stops altogether, causing irreversible damage to the heart muscles. Acute myocardial infarction involving only the right ventricle is a much less common condition than left ventricular infarction. However, this is becoming a more commonly detected entity as the diagnosis and options for treatment evolve. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of right ventricular myocardial infarction and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the cause of right ventricular myocardial infarction.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with right ventricular myocardial infarction.
- Summarize the treatment options for right ventricular myocardial infarction.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve the hemodynamics, provide ionotropic support and reduce pulmonary vascular resistance which will improve outcomes for patients affected by right ventricular myocardial infarction.
