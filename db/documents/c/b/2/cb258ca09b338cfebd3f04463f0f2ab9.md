Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening disorder that can lead to very high morbidity and mortality if not recognized. The varied presentation is best managed by a multidisciplinary team that consists of an endocrinologist, radiologist, an infectious disease specialist, intensivist, and a pharmacist. While the cause of adrenal insufficiency is being investigated, the patient should immediately be managed with corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids because even with treatment, mortality rates remain high. Once treatment is initiated, patients need close monitoring. Any type of infection or stress can precipitate adrenal crises leading to death. Hence patients should be educated about the symptoms and when to return immediately to the emergency department. Finally, all patients with a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency should be urged to wear a medical ID bracelet.
