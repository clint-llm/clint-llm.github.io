Branchial cleft cystsÂ are congenital anomalies arising from the first through fourth pharyngeal clefts. The most common type of branchial cleft cyst arises from the second cleft, with anomalies derived from the first, third, and fourth clefts being rarer. As this is a congenital anomaly, it is present at birth, though it may not be obvious or symptomatic until later. The majority of lesions present in childhood as a visible punctum on the skin though they may present as cysts or neck masses, occasionally mistaken for neck abscesses. Branchial cleft anomalies present in one of three forms: cysts, sinuses, or fistulae. Cysts have an epithelial lining without external openings, and as such, may be asymptomatic and only noticed incidentally. Such cysts may not present until adulthood. Sinus tracts may communicate either externally with skin as a visible punctum or internally with the pharynx or larynx, where the punctate opening will be visible only on endoscopy. Branchial cleft fistulae are true communications connecting the pharynx or larynx with the external skin.
