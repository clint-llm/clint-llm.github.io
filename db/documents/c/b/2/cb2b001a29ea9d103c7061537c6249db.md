With the advent ofÂ the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the prognosis of the CML has significantly improved.

Patients with ET usually have a good prognosis with normal life expectancy.

Triple-negative PMF patients have been observed as a worse prognosis. Furthermore, Kampfl et al. reported better survival benefit in patients with CALR exon 9 mutations as compared to JAK2 or MPL mutations.

Patients with PV who transform to MDS or AML have a very poor prognosis. As per one of the retrospective studies, older age (greater than 70 years), leukocytosis, and thrombosis are prognostic factors for worse survival in patients with PV.
