The prognosis of high-output cardiac failure is dependent on the cause of the condition. As referenced above, Reddy published a retrospective analysis of patients with high-output cardiac failure, reporting an increased 3-mortality rate compared to the control group (subjects free of heart failure). The study reports a hazard ratio of 3.4 (1.6 to 7.6). The study further stated that among patients with high-outputÂ cardiac failure, causes related to obesity had the lowest 5-year mortality at 19%, compared to liver disease (58%), and heart failure associated with shunt formation (59%) which carried the highest 5-year mortality.
