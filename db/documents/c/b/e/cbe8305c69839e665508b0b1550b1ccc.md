Although medullary sponge kidney is generally a benign condition, 10% of patients with medullary sponge kidney will ultimately develop renal failure. The majority of patients will have normal renal function throughout their lives. Renal failure is thought to arise from recurrent severe infections and extensive calculi formation.

A small number of medullary sponge kidney patients will describe chronic, severe pain.  This group tends to produce substantially more renal calculi than other MSK patients (3.1 stones per patient per year) and often require multiple hospitalizations for pain control.  This suggests that 24-hour urine testing and aggressive metabolic treatment directed at nephrolithiasis prevention may be particularly worthwhile in this group of MSK patients.
