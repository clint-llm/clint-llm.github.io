Chronic liver disease represents a continuous and progressive process of hepatic fibrosis, liver tissue architectural distortion, and regeneration nodule formation. While fibrosis is usually irreversible, but it can be reversible in the initial stage of development. The transition time point of reversible fibrosis to irreversible fibrosis is still not completely understood. In chronic liver disease, if not treated, the endpoint is usually irreversible fibrosis, regeneration nodule formation, and development of cirrhosis liver. The development rate of fibrosis is dependent on the underlying etiologies, environmental, and host factors. The evolution of liver fibrosis was studied in 4852 patients with different underlying etiology in one study. The author observed significant differences in the rate of development of fibrosis and its progression. The rate was most rapid in patients with coinfection with HIV- HCV, while primary biliary cirrhosis was the slowest. Fibrosis progression rate was higher with increasing age, and females demonstrated a more gradual progression of liver fibrosis in all but alcoholic liver disease.

Hepatic fibrosis is the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in response to chronic liver injury by any etiology. The common pathway is initiated by hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which usually are vitamin A storing dormant cells found in space between sinusoids and hepatocytes. In response to chronic liver injury, HSC gets activated into proliferative fibrogenic myofibroblast and upregulates the expression of inflammatory receptors such as chemokine receptors, ICAM-1, and other inflammatory mediators by releasing chemokines and other leukocyte chemoattractants. This pro-inflammatory phase or initiation phase also changes gene and phenotypic expression of the liver cells, making them more responsive to these inflammatory cytokines, and perpetuation of activated HSC cells results in the accumulation of ECM and progressive fibrosis.
