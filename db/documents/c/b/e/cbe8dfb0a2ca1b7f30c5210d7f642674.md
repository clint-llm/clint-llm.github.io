The clinician and physical therapist must customize a rehabilitation plan for each patient. How long therapy will be needed and which exercises your treatment team prescribes will be based on the type of tear, the surgical repair, the patient's overall medical condition, and specific post-surgical needs. Patients must understand the role they must play in their recovery.

Complete recovery generally takes at least four months., with most repairs nearly healed in 6 months. Many patients report that it took 12 months to reach their recovery goals.
