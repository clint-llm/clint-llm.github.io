As opposed to the sporadic medullary thyroid cancer which is usually unilateral, the medullary thyroid cancer associated with multiple MEN syndromes is usually multicentric and bilateral. Often these tumors involve the upper portions of both lobes because the C cells reside predominantly in the upper poles of the thyroid gland. Paraneoplastic syndromes like Cushing syndrome and carcinoid syndrome can occur as medullary thyroid cancer, and can also produce hormones such as corticotropin, serotonin, prostaglandins, and melanin.
