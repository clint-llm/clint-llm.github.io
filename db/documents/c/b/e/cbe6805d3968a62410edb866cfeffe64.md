The severity of swan neck deformity is commonly classified by using the Nalebuff classification system. This classification system is based on the PIP joint stiffness with associated MCP joint positions.

- Type 1: PIP joint is flexible in all positions of the MCP joint.

- Type 2: PIP joint flexion is limited in certain positions of the MCP joint.

- Type 3: PIP joint flexion is limited irrespective of the position of the MCP joint.

- Type 4: PIP joints are stiff and have a poor radiographic appearance.
