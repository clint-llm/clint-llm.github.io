The definitive laboratory evaluation of XLA involves quantitating serum immunoglobulin levels, enumerating lymphocyte subsets, performing provocative antibody response tests, and conducting molecular and genetic analyses.

A typical diagnostic test sequence would evaluate serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA, the number of CD19-positive or CD20-positive B cells in circulation, humoral vaccine responses, BTK protein expression in peripheral monocytes, and Btk gene sequencing.

Test results consistent with a diagnosis of XLA in a male patient with a history of recurrent bacterial infections would include finding:

- Serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA that are more than two standard deviations below age-matched controls

- Absence of mature B lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation (i.e., fewer than 1-2%)

- Little or no increase in antibody titers 3-4 weeks after protein- or polysaccharide antigen vaccines (e.g., immunizing against pneumococcal pneumonia or diphtheria-tetanus)

- Low or absent BTK protein or mRNA expression levels

- Detection of disease-causing mutations in the Btk gene

Researchers have isolated several different mutations in the Btk gene. The finding of Btk gene mutations alone does not constitute a diagnosis.

Findings which suggest a diagnosis of XLA in males whose B cell levels are below the 1 to 2% threshold include all or most of the following:

- A history of recurrent bacterial infections requiring one or more hospitalizations before the age of 5 years

- Poor humoral responses to vaccines

- No palpable tonsils or cervical lymph nodes

Tests with abnormal results should be repeated by independent testing for confirmation before beginning treatment or seeking referrals.
