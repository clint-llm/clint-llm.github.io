**Clearance of CK from Blood or Plasma**

Creatine kinase (CK) and its isoenzymes are inactivated in the lymph by proteolysis.

CK-MB can also be elevated in circulation in the absence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI),

Rhabdomyolysis, intense exercise, and trauma result in transient elevation of CK and CK-MB; CK-MB is present in skeletal muscles as well, albeit in lesser concentrations.
