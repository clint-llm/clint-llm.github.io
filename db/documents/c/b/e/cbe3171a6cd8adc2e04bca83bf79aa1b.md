Advances in motor vehicle safety have reduced the rate and severity of facial injuries observed in developed countries, with the ubiquitous presence of airbags playing a vital role. Continued education should be directed at patient populations most likely to be affected by severe facial injuries, as this may further reduce the rate and severity of fractures. Improving young driver awareness and teaching about the often underappreciated long-term implications of interpersonal violence may affect the key demographic population affected by these injuries. The wear of helmets when operating motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles and when playing sports involving hard balls flying through the air, like baseball, cricket, jai-alai, and others, can reduce the frequency and severity of facial injuries, as well.
