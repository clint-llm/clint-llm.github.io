Prevention and treatment of QT prolongation require an interprofessional approach. Genetic causes require a specific diagnosis, which allows for avoiding aggravating factors. The usage of beta-blockers may lower the risk of torsades de pointes.

Pharmacological etiologies of QT prolongation are treated by ceasing the offending medication. Any coexisting electrolyte abnormalities should be treated. Optimization of potassium, magnesium, and calcium is essential to minimize the risk of torsades de pointes.

At the time of admission and discharge, the nurse should note all medications that affect the QT interval and notify the team. Cardiology nurses are responsible for monitoring patients, administering treatments, and reporting any change in clinical status to the clinician. Similarly, the pharmacist must keep track of the patient's medications and speak to the provider if any drugs can alter the QT interval. In most cases, medication-induced prolonged QT intervals can be prevented by an interprofessional, proactive approach. [Level 5]
