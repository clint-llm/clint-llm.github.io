Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a defect of cellular adhesion molecules resulting in clinical syndromes. It is a combined (B cell) and cellular (T cell) immunodeficiency disorder.

Major immunologic features

- There is an inability to form pus.

- There is a deficiency of various glycoproteins including LFA-1/Mac-1, glycoprotein 150/95.

- Leukocytes cannot migrate to infection sites to kill invading microorganisms due to mutations in the CD18 glycoprotein.

- Adhesion molecules deficiency results in an abnormal inflammatory response and eventually recurrent bacterial infections.
