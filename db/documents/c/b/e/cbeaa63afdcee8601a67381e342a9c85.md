Before performing an electrodiagnostic study, a clinician must conduct a comprehensive review of the patient’s history, including any applicable clinical course and a physical exam. A systematic and empathetic physician will inform the patient, and any relative involved in decision-making, of the indications for the studies and provide an overview of the procedure to be performed.

A comprehensive electrodiagnostic test includes motor conduction to the EDB muscle above and below the knee to assess a conduction block at the fibular head.

EMG should also sample muscles from the sciatic nerve's branches, including the short head of the biceps femoris, to distinguish it from more proximal fibular nerve lesions.
