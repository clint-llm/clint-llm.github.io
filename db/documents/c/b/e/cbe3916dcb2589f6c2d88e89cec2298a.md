- Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is an autosomal dominantly inherited condition that presents with sporadic episodes of pain, conjunctival hyperemia and corneal edema, which can lead to decreased visual acuity. These incidents last two to five days.

- A corneal opacity, keratic precipitates, pseudoguttata, and a ‘beaten silver’ appearance of the endothelium are common findings

- Patients are generally children to teenagers of Finnish descent with a strong family history, though sporadic cases exist.

- Episodes are self-resolving, with minimal acute complications; however, permanent corneal scarring and decreased visual acuity may develop after recurrences.

- The condition is usually unilateral, though there have also been bilateral episodes reported.

- The condition is likely the result of an NLRP3 gene mutation that causes easily activated inflammatory responses.

- Treatment is aimed at symptomatic relief using a topical steroid, topical NSAIDs, and/or oral antihistamine medications.

- Molecules that inhibit the effects of NLRP3 may help to treat this disease, though more research is necessary to understand the effect of these drugs on corneal cells.
