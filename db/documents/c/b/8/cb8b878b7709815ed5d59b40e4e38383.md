When patients are placed on inverse ratio ventilation, the nurse must be aware of the potential complications. The patient's hemodynamic status must be closely monitored. Barotrauma may occur, and the patient may require an immediate chest tube. There should be clear communication between the pulmonologist,Â respiratory therapist, intensivist, and nurse when any ventilatory changes are made.
