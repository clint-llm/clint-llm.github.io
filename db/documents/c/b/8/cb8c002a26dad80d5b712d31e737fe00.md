The prevalence and distribution of gastric polyps vary widely between sources, but from the review of several high-powered studies, the prevalence of gastric polyps in patients undergoing endoscopy was between 2% to 6%. Of those, GHPs represent 17% to 42%, FGPs represent 37% to 77%, adenomas represent 0.5% to1%, and malignant neoplasm represented approximately 1% to 2%. Gastric polyps are most likely to be found in the fundus and have an increasing prevalence associated with increased age. Distribution amongst the sexes varies widely in the literature. However, females are more likely to have FGPs, and males are more likely to have adenoma. Variation in diet and lifestyle across different populations contributes to the wide variations reported between studies.
