Diagnosis of ARVC/D is challenging. No one test can make the diagnosis, and multiple diagnostic tools are utilized including history, ECG, echo, MRI, and endomyocardial biopsy.

- ECG - The most common ECG abnormality seen in ARVC/D is T wave inversion in the precordial leads V1 to V3.

- Echocardiography - Echocardiography may reveal an enlarged right ventricle (RV), hypokinetic RV, and paper thin RV free wall.

- Cardiac MRI - Cardiac MRI is an excellent tool for visualizing the right ventricle. It may reveal a transmural diffuse bright signal in the RV free wall due to myocardial atrophy with fatty replacement.

- Endomyocardial biopsy - Transvenous biopsy of the right ventricle can be highly specific for ARVC/D, but it has low sensitivity.

The diagnosis of ARVC/D is based on a combination of major and minor criteria. Diagnosis of ARVC/D requires two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria or four minor criteria.

**Major Criteria**

Right ventricular dysfunction

- Severe dilatation and accompanying reduction of RV ejection fraction with minimal or no LV impairment

- Localized RV aneurysms

- Severe segmental dilatation of the RV

Tissue characterization

- Fibrofatty replacement of myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy

Conduction abnormalities

- Epsilon waves in V1 - V3

- Localized prolongation (greater than 110 ms) of QRS in V1-V3

Family history

- Familial disease confirmed on autopsy or surgery

**Minor Criteria**

Right ventricular dysfunction

- Mild global right ventricular dilatation and/or reduced ejection fraction with a normal left ventricle

- Mild segmental dilatation of the right ventricle

- Regional RV hypokinesis

Tissue characterization

Conduction abnormalities

- Inverted T waves in V2 and V3 in a patient over 12 years old, in the absence of right bundle branch block

- Late potentials on signal-averaged ECG

- Ventricular tachycardia accompanied by left bundle branch block morphology

- Frequent PVCs (greater than 1000 PVCs per 24 hours)

Family history

- A family history of sudden cardiac before age 35

- A family history of ARVC/D
