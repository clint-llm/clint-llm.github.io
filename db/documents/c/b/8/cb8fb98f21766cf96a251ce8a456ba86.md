Body water is lost through the skin, lungs, kidneys, and GI tract. The loss of body water without sodium causes dehydration. Water is lost from the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Dehydration results when water losses from the body exceed water replacement. It may be caused by failure to replace obligate water losses. There are several forms of dehydration.

The source of water loss may also understand the etiologies of dehydration:

- Failure to replace water loss: altered mentation, immobility, impaired thirst mechanism, drug overdose leading to coma

- Excess water loss from the skin: heat, exercise, burns, severe skin diseases

- Excess water loss from the kidney: medications such as diuretics, acute and chronic renal disease, post-obstructive diuresis, salt-wasting tubular disease, Addison disease, hypoaldosteronism, hyperglycemia

- Excess water loss from the GI tract: vomiting, diarrhea, laxatives, gastric suctioning, fistulas

- Intraabdominal losses: pancreatitis, new ascites, peritonitis

- Excess insensible loss: sepsis, medications, hyperthyroidism, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), drugs
