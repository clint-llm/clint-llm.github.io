While the neonatologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with hydranencephaly, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include an obstetrician, neurologist, physiatrist, neurosurgeon, and social worker. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will assist patients with their daily care, while social workers assist with the education of the family.

The radiologist also plays a vital role in determining the diagnosis. The outcomes of a patient with hydranencephaly depend on its cause and the severity of the disease. To improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
