An acute demyelinating polyneuropathyÂ is a condition often seen in the inpatient setting and sometimes requires outpatient follow up. Patients frequently come with complaints of pain, weakness, paresthesias, and weakness in the extremities. Imaging, cerebrospinal, and electrodiagnostic studies are routinely ordered. Physicians must be cautious, as imaging findings might not correlate with the patient's symptoms.

It is essential to take an interprofessional team including a team of physicians (general neurologists, neuromuscular neurologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management physicians), therapists, (physical and occupational therapists), social workers, and case managers who can work together to coordinate mobilization with outpatient therapy and aggressive multifaceted rehabilitation so we can improve a patient's functional status.
