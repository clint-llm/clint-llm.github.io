Given its origin in the cerebellum with the propensity of locally spreading into the fourth ventricle, patients most often present with a combination of cerebellar signs like clumsiness, gait disturbances, and obstructive hydrocephalus, for example, early morning headaches, nausea/vomiting, double vision, or blurry vision.

Since the majority of medulloblastomas arse in the fourth ventricle, obstructive hydrocephalus is not uncommon. These patients may present with emesis, headache, and lethargy. Time from symptom onset to diagnosis is usually short, usually two to three months.

Almost all patients have early signs of elevated intracranial pressure that is associated with headache early in the morning and relieved over the course of the day. Patients with Cushing triad usually have impending herniation and need immediate treatment.

The tumor in the cerebellum can also lead to ataxia and truncal unsteadiness. If the brain stem is involved, it may lead to cranial nerve palsies that may present as diplopia, hearing loss, facial weakness, and head tilt.

Fundoscopy may show optic pallor or papilledema. Paralysis of the abducens nerve may lead to an inability to abduct the eye. The sun setting sign may be seen in some infants. Measurement of the head circumference in infants may reveal macrocephaly.
