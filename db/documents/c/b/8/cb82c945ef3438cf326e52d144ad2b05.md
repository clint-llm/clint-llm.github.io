Atopic dermatitis has a complex etiology including genetic and environmental factors which lead to abnormalities in the epidermis and the immune system. Atopic dermatitis is part of the atopic triad (atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and asthma) which may start simultaneously or in succession in what is known as the "atopic march." Patients with the atopic triad have a defective barrier of the skin, upper respiratory, and lower respiratory tract which leads to their symptomatology. If one parent is atopic, there is more than a 50% chance that their offspring will develop atopic symptoms. If both parents are affected, up to 80% of offspring will be affected. Genetic alterations include loss of function mutations of filaggrin (Filament **Ag**gregating Prote**in**), an epidermal protein that is broken down into natural moisturization factor. Filaggrin mutations are present in up to 30% of atopic dermatitis patients and may also predispose patients to ichthyosis vulgaris, allergic rhinitis, and keratosis pilaris. Food hypersensitivity may also cause or exacerbate atopic dermatitis in 10% to 30% of patients. Ninety percent of such reactions or flares are caused by eggs, milk, peanuts, soy, and wheat.

Recent studies indicate that there may be an association between smoking and adult-onset AD.
