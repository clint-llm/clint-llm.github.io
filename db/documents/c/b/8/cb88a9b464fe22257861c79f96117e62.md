With a chevron osteotomy, if the capital fragment is excessively displaced lateralward, a hallux varus deformity can develop. Likewise, with a proximal osteotomy, the distal segment can be translated too far laterally. For classical McBride procedure, the fibular sesamoid is excised which causes MTP joint hyperextension, interphalangeal (IP) joint flexion and medial deviation of the hallux.

With time, the deformity becomes fixed, and it is difficult for the patient to obtain comfortable footwear. The deformity usually manifests itself as the medial deviation of the great toe, supination of the phalanx and claw tow deformity.

Anatomically, cadaveric biomechanical studies reveal theÂ restraints in descending order are the lateral capsule, the adductor hallucis, and the lateral flexor brevis tendon.
