Addison disease is a life-threatening condition that requires accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. If the diagnosis is delayed, it carries high morbidity and mortality. Thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers that include an endocrinologist, an intensivist, an infectious disease specialist, and a pharmacist. The education of the patient is critical for patients with chronic conditions. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists can share this responsibility. Nurses need to administer treatments, monitor patients, and provide updates to the team. Once the diagnosis is established, the outcomes depend on the primary cause. Any delay in initiating the treatment can lead to poor outcomes. All patients who have Addison disease must be urged to wear a medical alert bracelet. Patients should be educated regarding the signs and symptoms. They should be urged to contact their primary care provider if there are any warning symptoms. Finally, in times of stress, such as fever, patients should be instructed to double the dose of steroids and see their primary care provider.
