Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is characterized by the formation of new blood vessels over the iris and the angle of the anterior chamber. These new blood vessels form as a result of ocular ischemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), ischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), and ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) contribute to the majority of the cases of NVG. The prevalence of NVG is on the rise due to an increasing prevalence of diabetes. NVG is a potentially blinding disease. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are crucial aspects of the management of NVG. This activity describes the systemic and ophthalmic evaluation and treatment of NVG and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing care for patients with NVG.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of neovascular glaucoma.
- Describe the ophthalmic and systemic evaluation of neovascular glaucoma.
- Outline the management options available for neovascular glaucoma.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance studies on neovascular glaucoma and improve outcomes.
