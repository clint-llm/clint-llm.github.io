Treatment of JIA requires anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs and physical therapy, and eventually, surgery, nutritional support, and psychosocial support may be needed. The choice of pharmacological treatment depends on the disease subtypes, disease severity and damage, associated disease, and family acceptance. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of initial symptomatic treatment for all subtypes. The NSAID use in JIA has decreased over time with modern aggressive treatment, including methotrexate and biologics.

Physical therapy emphasizes range of motion with minimal stress on joints. Swimming is often a good option. Patients should participate in moderate fitness, flexibility, and strengthening exercises.
