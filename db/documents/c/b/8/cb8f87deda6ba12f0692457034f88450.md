An auto-refractor or optometer is an instrument that helps in the automated assessment of refraction. This is an alternative method of finding out the refraction error in contrast to the conventional refractive technique. The procedure is called refractometry or optometry. The auto-refractors can be of various types depending on the underlying principle. The various indications of performing optometry are myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia, spectacle prescription, and contact lens prescription, which serve as a starting point for subjective refraction for ophthalmologists and optometrists in pediatric refraction and people with a disability requiring spectacles. This activity covers the various commercially available subjective and objective auto-refractors and provides information for healthcare providers who work with ocular disorders that auto-refractors can address.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications of the auto-refractor.
- Summarize how an auto-refractor functions and the types of auto-refractors.
- Outline the clinical significance of auto-refractor.
- Explain the interfering factors in auto-refractor.
