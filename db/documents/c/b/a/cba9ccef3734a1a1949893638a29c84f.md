The adverse effects of fibric acids vary depending on the particular agent selected for the patient. Some of the most common adverse effects include headache, dizziness, back pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and abnormal liver function tests. Comparatively, gemfibrozil is associated with a more significant percentage of gastrointestinal reactions (34.2%), including dyspepsia, abdominal pain, and acute appendicitis. Fenofibrate may be a more suitable agent in patients with a past medical history significant for gastrointestinal diseases. However, fenofibrate is associated with a statistically significant increase in liver transaminases (7.5%), which requires monitoring in patients initiating therapy.
