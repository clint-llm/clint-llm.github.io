Jugular venous pressure measurement is a part of the cardiovascular examination, although its utility varies among the examiner and clinical setting. Its most common use is to estimate the right atrial pressure, especially in patients with heart failure, and also to measure the response to diuretic therapy. It is also helpful in the evaluation of conditions such as superior vena cava obstruction, tricuspid valve disease, and pericardial disease.
