Early surgical correction of pectus excavatum was based on the aggressive resection and chest wall reconstruction performed for asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune's syndrome). The current trend is to delay the repair until pubertal growth, and the technique is modified to perform limited cartilage resection. Impaired cardiopulmonary function, not cosmesis, is the most common indication for surgical correction.  It is pertinent that surgical repair occur after the child's pubertal growth spurt.

The first documented surgical repair of pectus excavatum was performed by Ravitch in 1949.  Based on the aggressive chest wall resection used to manage asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune's syndrome), Ravitch performed a subperichondrial resection of all deformed costal cartilages and the xiphoid process, along with a transverse sternotomy.

The minimally invasive technique described by Nuss and Kelly involves inserting a metal bar under the sternum at the most depressed zone and most everted costal line on both sides of the chest.in situ for 3 years.

Additional modifications to both the Ravitch and Nuss procedures have been described.  The Leonard modification to Ravitch's procedure entails excision of the lower costal cartilage, leaving the perichondirum in place, after mobilization of the pectoralis muscles.

The application of negative pressure to the thorax offers a non-surgical alternative to pectus excavatum.
