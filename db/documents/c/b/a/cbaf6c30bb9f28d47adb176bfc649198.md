For disk diffusion, measuring the zone of inhibition is done by using a dedicated caliper.  Correctly measure the diameter by the edges of the inhibition zone.  For MIC panels, reading each set of wells for an antibiotic drug is done.  MIC determination is by either a clear or slight whiteness on the well.  Reporting the results of the inhibition zones and MIC breakpoints is made using either the terms “susceptible” or “resistant” based on the set cut-off range for zone diameter in the nearest whole millimeter and microgram per milliliter, respectively.  The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) developed expert-approved guidelines on breakpoints for reporting results of these methods (e.g., CLSI M100-ED29:2019 Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, EUCAST Clinical breakpoints for bacteria).
