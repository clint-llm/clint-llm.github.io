The human placental lactogen is a hormone released by the placenta during the pregnancy. It holds a comparable composition to growth hormone and induces important metabolic changes during pregnancy to support the maintenance of fetal nutritional status. This hormone is capable of provoking alterations and modifications in the insulin receptors. The following molecular variations appear to have links to diminishing glucose uptake at peripheral tissues:1) molecular alteration of the beta-subunit insulin receptor, 2) diminished phosphorylation of tyrosine kinase, 3) remodelings in the insulin receptor substrate-1 andÂ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Maternal high glucose levels cross the placenta and produce fetal hyperglycemia. The fetal pancreas gets stimulated in response to the hyperglycemia. Insulin anabolic properties induce fetal tissues to growth at an increased rate.

There are reports that a higher body mass index and obesity can lead to low-grade inflammation. Chronic inflammation induces the synthesis of xanthurenic acid, which is associated with the development of pre-diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus.
