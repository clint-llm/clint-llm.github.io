- Postoperative ileus is a common benign postoperative complication.

- Normal physiologic recovery should occur within 72 hours with supportive treatment.

- It is imperative to distinguish ileus from more severe or reversible problems such as mechanical obstruction.

- Management is mainly supportive treatment, optimizing care, correcting predisposing factors, and clinical follow up.
