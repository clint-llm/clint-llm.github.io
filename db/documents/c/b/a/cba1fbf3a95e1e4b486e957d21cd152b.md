Human physiology is significantly altered during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. The physician should be aware of the physiological changes associated with the postpartum period. The clinician should be able to tell the difference between healthy and abnormal to effectuate a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm, especially in cases of acute emergencies such as postpartum hemorrhage, sepsis, amniotic fluid embolism, or uterine inversion. Furthermore, one should be aware of the hormonal changes related to the puerperium and lactation to formulate an effective contraception plan in the postpartum period. Thromboprophylaxis in the postpartum period is a constant topic of debate due to the high incidence of venous thromboembolism in the postpartum period, and females are risk-stratified into low-risk, medium-risk and, high-risk. Females with a history of no coagulation anomalies or low-risk don't require any thromboprophylaxis. Intermediate-risk females should be instituted thromboprophylaxis after delivery up to 7 days of puerperium. The females that are high risk receive thromboprophylaxis throughout pregnancy and up to 7 days of postpartum. The conduct of anesthesia for surgery also varies according to the timeline post-delivery. Patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia within 48 hours of delivery should be treated as full stomach and should receive anti-aspiration measures, including non-particulate antacid and rapid sequence induction of anesthesia.
