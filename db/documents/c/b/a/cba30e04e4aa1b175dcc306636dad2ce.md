Phenoxybenzamine is FDA approved for the treatment of paroxysmal hypertension and sweating associated with the rare adrenal gland tumor, pheochromocytoma, which caused autonomic nervous system dysfunction as well as surges in catecholamines from the chromaffin cells located in the adrenal medulla.

Phenoxybenzamine was first used in 1976 to treat benign prostate hyperplasia because of its known alpha-adrenergic blockade, although now, it is rarely used for this purpose.

**Off-Label Use**

- Sympathomimetic amines causing hypertensive crises

- partial prostate obstruction

- Micturition problems associated with neurogenic bladder

- functional outlet obstruction

- Phenoxybenzamine has also been used in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a congenital disability that develops during pregnancy in which the left side of the heart is malformed, affecting blood flow through the heart.

- Complex regional pain syndrome is a chronic pain condition (> or = 6 months) that commonly affects one limb, usually after an injury.

**Further Studies**

Researchers are studying phenoxybenzamine to determine its utility as a male contraceptive. The hypothesis is that because of its known alpha-adrenergic blockade; this would result in blockage of the vas deferens muscles.
