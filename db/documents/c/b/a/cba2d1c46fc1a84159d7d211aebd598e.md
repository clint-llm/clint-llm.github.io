Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias (HHT) is an autosomal dominant bleeding disorder due to the presence of malformed vessels. The condition manifests as telangiectasias affecting the skin and mucosa and arteriovenous malformations involving organs like the lung, brain, and liver. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of the disease and emphasizes the importance of an interprofessional teamâ€™s approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pertinent history and physical exam findings associated with HHT and additional tests to diagnose the condition.
- Review the pathophysiology of HHT and its clinical manifestations.
- Explain medical treatment options available for HHT.
- Describe the procedures or surgical interventions for HHT and how to select the best treatment based on patient presentation.
