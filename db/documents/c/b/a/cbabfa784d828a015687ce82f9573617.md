The use of double J stents in urology is now standard practice, yet the optimal technique for their placement has not been described previously. After a careful analysis, the technique mentioned earlier, that includes exact ureteral length measurements for ideal stent length selection, use of the dangler/safety thread to help manipulate the stent into optimal position, and partial extraction of the guidewire to promote proximal stent tip coiling while maintaining total control of the stent, guidewire, and pusher, is recommended. This technique optimizes patient safety and comfort and facilitates easy stent replacement, if needed, without losing ureteral access.
