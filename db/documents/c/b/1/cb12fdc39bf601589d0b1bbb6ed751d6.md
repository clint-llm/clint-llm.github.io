Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma is a benign proliferation of smooth muscle cells, organized in haphazardly-oriented bundles among the reticular dermis. It is a sporadic condition that generally presents as a single lesion in the lumbosacral area. It is often confused with Becker's hamartoma and congenital melanocytic nevus. This activity article reviews the evaluation and management of congenital smooth muscle hamartoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of congenital smooth muscle hamartoma.
- Review appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of the congenital smooth muscle hamartoma.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for the congenital smooth muscle hamartoma.
- Outline the importance of improving collaboration and communication amongst the inter-professional team to enhance early and accurate diagnosis for patients affected by congenital smooth muscle hamartoma and to avoid further evaluation and unnecessary medical intervention.
