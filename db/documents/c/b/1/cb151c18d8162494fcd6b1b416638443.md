Velocardial facial syndrome is the result of a microdeletion of DNA on a single copy of chromosome 22q11.2.

The actual break in the chromosome occurs during an unequal meiotic exchange. An area of the chromosome with low copy number repeats is particularly susceptible to loss during meiosis.

Without the 22q11.2 region, abnormal neural crest migration occurs, resulting in the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches improperly migrating. Subsequent thymic hypoplasia, parathyroid hypoplasia, and conotruncal cardiac anomalies occur and lead to immunodeficiency and hypocalcemia. A gene known as T-box transcription factor (TBX1) is thought to be responsible for some of the abnormal neural crest migration.
