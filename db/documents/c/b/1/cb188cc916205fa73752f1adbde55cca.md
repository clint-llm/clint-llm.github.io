Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is acquired in an autosomal recessive fashion. Abnormality is noted in the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. 2 SMN genes have been identified. Both these genes are located on chromosome 5. SMN1 gene is located at locus 5q11-q13. SMN2 is located next to the SMN1 gene. SMN1 is believed to cause SMA, while SMN2 is believed to affect the severity of the disease; higher SMN2 copies result in a milder form of SMA. In addition, other genetic mutations have been identified to play a role in the severity of SMA. 1, and such identified mutation is the deletion of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene.
