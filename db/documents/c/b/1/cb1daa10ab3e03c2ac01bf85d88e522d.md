**Oral candidiasis**

White coated tongue, leukoplakia, lichenoid reactions, and secondary syphilis may mimic pseudomembranous candidiasis. The differential diagnosis for erythematous candidiasis includes thermal burns, erythroplakia, anemia, and oral mucositis.

**Aspergillosis**

Histologically, granulomatous inflammation observed in aspergillosis can be similar to that seen in tuberculosis, syphilis, Wegener's granulomatosis, or leprosy.

**Mucormycosis**

Palatal necrosis can be seen in other conditions like bacterial infection (actinomycosis), viral infection (herpes zoster), radiation, and trauma. Mucormycosis and aspergillosis often pose a diagnostic challenge that can beÂ solved by evaluating the histopathological appearance of the fungal hyphae.

**Histoplasmosis**

Chronic histoplasmosis primarily affects the lungs causing clinical manifestations similar to tuberculosis: fever, weight loss, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Oral histoplasmosis is clinically indistinguishable from malignancy.

**Blastomycosis**

Blastomycosis lesions resemble oral carcinoma both clinically and histopathologically. Hence careful histological demonstration of yeasts is essential.

**Cryptococcosis**

Clinically oral cryptococcosis appears similar to histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis, and malignancy.

**Paracoccidiomycosis**

Oral lesions mimic malignancies and other granulomatous lesions.

**Geotrichosis**

Oral geotrichosis resembles oral candidiasis.
