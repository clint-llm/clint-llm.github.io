With the evolution of anesthetic care teams, it is vital to maintain open communication in the pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative periods between the interprofessional healthcare team members. Choosing the anesthetic modality as a team pre-operatively on a case-by-case basis is essential to theÂ overall outcome of each case. Maintaining flexibility to allow for changes in the intraoperative period requires optimal communication within the anesthetic care team. Reanalyzing the case as a team in the post-operative period allows for improved outcomes in future cases. Overall, communication is essential to improving outcomes within anesthetic care teams that include the nurse anesthetist, surgeon, recovery room nurses, and the anesthesiologist, all working as a cohesive unit to drive optimal patient outcomes when using these anesthetics and preventing adverse cardiac outcomes.
