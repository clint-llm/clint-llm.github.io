The mainstay of evaluation of Buphthalmos patients is performing an examination under anesthesia. The following examinations should be done:

- Refraction using streak retinoscopy

- Corneal Examination

Measurement of corneal diameter using calipers may show an increase. A corneal diameter greater than 12 mm is considered abnormal. Corneal edema may be seen due to raised intraocular pressure.

Breaks in the Descemet's membrane or Haab's striae may be seen, which are typically horizontal or parallel to the limbus.

- Examination of the anterior segment may reveal other underlying causes of Buphthalmos like aniridia and Lisch nodules of neurofibromatosis.

- Measurement of intraocular pressure in the first few minutes of anesthesia to avoid falsely low readings.

- Gonioscopy with a direct gonioscope may demonstrate anterior insertion of the iris onto the trabecular meshwork, the "Loch Ness monster" phenomenon (vascular loops in the angle), and "Lister’s morning mist" (fine, fluffy tissue on the peripheral iris).

- Ophthalmoscopy may demonstrate the presence of optic disc cupping. It is interesting to note that optic disc cupping may be reversed with appropriate treatment in many cases of primary congenital glaucoma.

- Ultrasound biomicroscopy may be done in cases of an opaque cornea to evaluate the anterior segment structures.

- Clinical genetics consultation may be advised.
