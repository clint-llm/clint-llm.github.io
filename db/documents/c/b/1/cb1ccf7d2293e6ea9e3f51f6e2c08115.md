There are multiple current clinical uses of pulse oximetry in primary care. In stable underlying lung disease patients, pulse oximetry (SpO2) is helpful for the following

- To establish a baseline value.

- Monitoring the patients with exercise-related dyspnea.

- A screening tool to identify patients with underlying lung disease (with SpO2 less than 92%)

- Stable underlying lung disease or recovering from an exacerbation; a SpO2 88% or less qualifies for oxygen therapy

- Titrating the rate of flow of oxygen in patients on long-term oxygen therapy - the target is resting and ambulatory pulse oximetry around 88% to 92%

During a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or an asthma exacerbation, pulse oximetry is helpful to:

- Evaluate patients with severe disease (defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1) of less than 50% predicted), cyanosis, or cor pulmonale for possible respiratory insufficiency/failure

- Assess patients with acutely worsening symptoms, especially shortness of breath

- Determine how severe is the exacerbation based on pulse oximetry and partial pressure of oxygen in an arterial blood gas - based on this physician can determine whether the patient is treatable on an outpatient basis or needs in-hospital treatment

- Titrating oxygen therapy during exacerbation of any underlying lung disease - COPD, asthma, interstitial lung diseases, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.

Clinical uses of Capnography

- Confirmation of tracheal intubation

- Assessing tracheal tube and tracheostomy patency and position

- Monitor adequate ventilator support

- During percutaneous tracheostomy placement

- Monitoring patients with raised intracranial pressure

- Monitoring response to treatment of bronchospasm

- Estimation of cardiac output

- Use during cardiac arrest

- Measures kinetics of carbon dioxide (CO2) elimination on a breath-by-breath basis
