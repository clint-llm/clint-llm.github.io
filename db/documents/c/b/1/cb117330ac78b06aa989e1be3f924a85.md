First-degree heart block is often an incidental finding on the ECG. The majority of patients may have no symptoms. Because these patients may present to almost any medical or surgical specialty, an understanding and management of this benign heart disorder is necessary by all healthcare workers. The prognosis for patients with first-degree heart block is excellent. Progression to a second-degree heart block is very rare. For those who have acquired Lyme-induced heart block, the condition usually resolves spontaneously in 2-10 days. While first-degree heart block has always been considered to be a benign disorder, epidemiological data from the Framingham study suggest that it may be associated with atrial arrhythmias, need for pacemaker implantation and all-cause mortality.
