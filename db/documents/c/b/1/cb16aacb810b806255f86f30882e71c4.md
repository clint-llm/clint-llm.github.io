The main advantage of TEG testing is its potential to deliver immediate goal-oriented and individualized care to a bleeding patient:

- Global assessment of blood coagulability, including coagulation cascade, platelet function, and fibrinolysis

- Rapid real-time bedside test with a simple methodology (point-of-care testing)

- Diagnosis of coagulopathic bleeding

- Guide transfusion therapy and decrease the use of blood products

- Detect dynamic changes in blood coagulation during resuscitation

- Predict the clinical efficacy of therapeutic agents affecting blood coagulability

TEG has convincingly demonstrated its usefulness to help improve outcomes in cardiac surgery. A meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated that TEG decreases blood product transfusions and surgical re-exploration due to postoperative bleeding in cardiac surgery patients.

There is conflicting evidence for TEG's usefulness in trauma patients. A recent Cochrane database systematic review found insufficient data to compare the accuracy of TEG and RoTEM versus PT/INR in the diagnosis of trauma-induced coagulopathy.

There is expanding evidence of using different TEG and RoTEM assays in other additional clinical scenarios. A small RCT has demonstrated the ability of TEG to better guide anticoagulation during ECMO compared to aPTT, reducing the dose of heparin.

**Clinical Guidelines**

NICE guidelines recommend thromboelastography to help detect, manage and monitor hemostasis in cardiac surgery patients. Other clinical guidelines do not currently strongly recommend TEG for use in other settings due to the lack of high-quality evidence. Recently updated guidelines of the European Society of Anesthesiology recommended viscoelastic hemostatic assays (TEG/RoTEM) to guide the management of perioperative bleeding and manage severe peripartum hemorrhages, albeit with a low level of evidence.

**Limitations**

An ideal test on blood coagulation does not yet exist. TEG measures blood coagulation in vitro, with or without an additional activator. An important component of the coagulation cascade, tissue factor, cannot be quantified in vitro. Moreover, blood coagulation potential is only one component in such complex processes as clinical thrombosis and bleeding. Blood coagulation also depends on the size of the injured vessel, blood flow characteristics, and local vessel wall biology that determines the quantity and functional activity of the membrane-bound pro- and anticoagulation factors. In other words, there are significant aspects of coagulation that are not components of the blood. An abnormal TEG in a patient without clinically relevant bleeding does not require transfusion of blood components. A single test or patient-related factor rarely guides the decision to transfuse blood components or initiate/correct antithrombotic therapy.

TEG has a sensitivity and specificity that may vary significantly in different populations. Patients taking anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are a major concern in the trauma setting. Warfarin is a commonly prescribed medication

**Future Directions: Guiding Anticoagulation and Antiplatelet Therapy**

Anticoagulation therapy is a field where TEG may become more applicable pending future clinical studies. Up to one-third of patients on warfarin therapy may have subtherapeutic anticoagulation at some point of treatment.

Prediction of platelet inhibition by antiplatelet agents (such as aspirin, clopidogrel, abciximab, eptifibatide, or tirofiban) is another promising avenue for TEG application. Most antiplatelet agents are used with a standard dose despite several known issues associated with this approach. For example, up to 25% of patients with STEMI may be resistant to clopidogrel, increasing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

A novel concept of individualized health care applies to both anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy monitoring. Using a standard dose of the same medications to treat patients with different medical conditions and comorbidities may not be an ideal approach. The potential of TEG to improve the quality of antithrombotic therapy is a promising avenue for experimental and clinical research.

**Future Directions: Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism**

Another potential application of TEG is to improve the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism. The most appropriate evidence-based practice to prevent VTE is to stratify patients based on the VTE risk using one of the risk prediction models elaborated for surgical and medical patients. None of these models includes conventional blood coagulation tests since they do not predict VTE. A number of initial reports suggest that TEG may be a useful tool to help with risk stratification. TEG may have a VTE predictive value in critically ill patients, gynecological oncology patients, and prostate cancer.

Despite an appropriate prophylaxis, VTE is still a frequent concern in hospitalized patients. In one study, the R time of TEG was significantly shorter in critically ill patients on LMWH prophylaxis who develop DVT compared to those patients who do not.
