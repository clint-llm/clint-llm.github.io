Complications can arise from cervical biopsy include excessive bleeding or infection, but are rare. Surgical treatments such as a cold knife cone or LEEP carry increased risks, including risks of anesthesia. In those individuals treated with an excisional procedure, there have been concerns regarding the risk of pregnancy complications such as preterm delivery or cervical incompetence.  However, the risk factors for these complications overlap those for cervical dysplasia, so it is difficult to discern the actual impact of the excisional procedure on preterm delivery.
