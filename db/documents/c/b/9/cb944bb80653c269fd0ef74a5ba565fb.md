All interprofessional dental team members play a vital role in dental extraction and patient management. Extracting unerupted teeth can be challenging, and delivering safe and effective surgical care is a team effort. Each team member should have an assigned role and be trained to manage possible perioperative complications and emergencies. Team members can also act as an extra barrier to patient safety by re-verifying the surgeon's consent, patient information, and allergies. Anyone from the care team should be vigilant and comfortable to stop the surgeon if they think patient safety is at risk.

Not all unerupted or impacted teeth must be managed by an extraction. Therefore, a thorough patient assessment is imperative to a successful patient outcome. A clinical and radiographic evaluation could indicate alternative treatment options. Alternative treatment modalities include surgical exposure, coronectomy, surgical repositioning, reimplantation, transplantation, orthodontic intervention, or observation. These managements may require interprofessional involvement.
