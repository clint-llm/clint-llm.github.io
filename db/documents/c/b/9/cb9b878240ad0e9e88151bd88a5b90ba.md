Treatment of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema involves addressing the underlying cause of the event. There are currently no treatment options to address the vascular permeability in ARDS. Therefore management involves supportive care and treatment of the underlying disease process until there is the resolution of the acute lung injury. Inhaled nitric oxide, prostacyclin, anti-inflammatory therapy, and high-frequency ventilation have not shown consistent clinical benefit.
