Patients with Liddle syndrome can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. It usually presents with early-onset resistant hypertension between the ages of 11 to 31 years old due to sodium reabsorption at the level of the distal nephron. It may take years or even decades for healthcare providers to diagnose it. Providers can often misdiagnose the symptoms. Hypertension due to Liddle syndrome is sensitive to a salt-restricted diet

Resistant hypertension can cause muscle weakness, polyuria, and polydipsia due to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis happen due to excessive potassium loss in the urine at the expense of sodium reabsorption.

The incidence of hypertension and hypokalemia in patients with Liddle syndrome is about 92.4% and 71.8%, respectively.
