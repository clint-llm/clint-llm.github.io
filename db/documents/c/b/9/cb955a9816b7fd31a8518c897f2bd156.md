Ephedrine is a medication used to manage and treat clinically significant hypotension. It is in the sympathomimetic class of drugs. The FDA-approved primary indication for ephedrine is the treatment of clinically significant hypotension perioperatively. Induction of general anesthesia and ongoing anesthesia during operative cases results in vasodilatation and hypotension, requiring treatment with vasopressors. This activity illustrates ephedrine's indications, action, and contraindications in treating clinically significant hypotension. This activity highlights the mechanism of action, administration, contraindications, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional healthcare team members involved in caring for patients with clinically significant hypotension and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for treatment with ephedrine.
- Recognize common complications of managing clinically significant hypotension intraoperatively with ephedrine.
- Identify alternative options to treat significant intraoperative hypotension.
- Apply effective interprofessional team communication to improve outcomes for the patient requiring ephedrine.
