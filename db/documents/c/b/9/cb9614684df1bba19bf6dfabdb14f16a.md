There are five cardinal signs of inflammation, namely redness (rubor), heat (calor), swelling (tumor), pain (dolor), and loss of function (functio laesa). The sensation of heat is caused by the increased blood movement in dilated vessels into environmentally cooled extremities. This reaction will also lead to redness due to an increase in the number of erythrocytes passing through the injured area. The swelling of the area occurs due to an increase in the permeability and dilatation of the blood vessels. Pain is due to an increase in the pain mediators, either due to direct damage or resulting from an inflammatory response itself. Loss of function occurs due to either simple loss of mobility due to either edema or pain or replacement of the cells with scar tissue.
