Mechanical ventilation, despite the unavoidable need, tends to cause ventilator-induced lung injury. In positive pressure ventilation, the most common mechanisms that lead to lung injury are barotrauma, volutrauma, and atelectrauma (due to repeated opening and closing of alveoli). Thus high tidal volumes and high pressures (plateau and peak air pressures) cause and aggravate ventilator-induced lung injury. The most proven preventive method is to use low tidal volume ventilation, as proposed by the ARDS network.

In HFV, this is avoided as the entire cycle of aeration operates in the safe zone, thus preventing overdistention, which causes VILI. It also prevents derecruitment and avoids atelectrauma and barotrauma. It not only prevents barotrauma but also helps in improving the ventilation/perfusion(V/Q) ratio by allowing uniform aeration of the lungs.

Few trials have been done to study the risks and clinical benefits of HFOV  in ARDS. In the OSCILLATE trial, adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS were randomized to receive conventional ventilation with ARDS  protocol or HFOV. This study noted significantly higher mortality in the HFOV group (41%) than in conventional ventilation (35%). The trial concluded that early institution of HFOV  in moderate to severe ARDS was not beneficial and could be harmful.

The RESTORE study done in pediatric ARDS patients found that the use of HFOV in ARDS  led to increased sedation requirements and length of ICU stay.
