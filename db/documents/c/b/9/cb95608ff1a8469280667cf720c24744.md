With the advent of penicillin, rates of syphilis reached a nadir at the end of the 20th century but since then have steadily climbed, particularly in the MSM population. Although syphilis is a reportable condition, rates of neurosyphilis in the United States are not known partially due to surveillance definitions requiring data that is often unavailable. Before the advent of antibiotics, neurosyphilis was prevalent and occurred in up to 25 to 35 percent of patients with syphilis. Now, it more generally presents in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly in those who are either untreated, have low CD4+ counts, or detectable HIV RNA levels. Even so, the early forms of neurosyphilis are more frequent than the late forms. High-risk sexual behavior makes individuals vulnerable to syphilis as well as HIV. Thus neurosyphilis is more prevalent among individuals who are also at high risk for HIV, such as MSM.

The risk of neurosyphilis is 2-3 times more in whites than in blacks and is 2 times more common in men than in women.

In some parts of Africa, the incidence may be approximately 2300 cases per 100,000 population.
