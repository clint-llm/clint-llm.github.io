Toxicity is treated primarily with supportive care and acute stabilization using the following therapies, depending on the clinical features. Symptomatic bradycardia or heart block requires treatment with isotonic fluid and intravenous (IV) atropine administration. Beta-sympathomimetics (as aerosol or IV) or IV aminophylline are options for bronchospasm cases. Depending on the extent of hemodynamic instability, it may require the insertion of a temporary pacemaker or the use of inotropic or vasopressor medications. Intravenous glucagon is commonly used to reverse the effects of beta-blocker toxicity as first-line therapy and adjunct to supportive treatment.

Beta-sympathomimetics (as aerosol or IV) or IV aminophylline are options for bronchospasm cases. Carvedilol is lipid soluble and can cause neuropsychiatric manifestations, including depression and seizures. Intravenous lorazepam is the recommendedÂ choice for generalized tonic-clonic seizures, according to the American epilepsy society.
