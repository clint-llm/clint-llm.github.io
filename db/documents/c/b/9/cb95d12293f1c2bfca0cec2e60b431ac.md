Transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare, acquired focal inflammatory disorder often presenting with rapid onset weakness, sensory deficits, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. Generally occurring independently; often as a complication of infection; however, it may also exist as part of a continuum of other neuro-inflammatory disorders.
