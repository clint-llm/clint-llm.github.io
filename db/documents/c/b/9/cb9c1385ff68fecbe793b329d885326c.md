However, population norms are published to help clinicians determine which adolescents fall outside two standard deviations of the mean and require further investigation. Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of Tanner 2 secondary sexual characteristics before age 8 years in females or age 9 years in males if the continued progression of pubertal development occurs soon after. Delayed puberty should be considered if females have not reached Tanner 2 thelarche by age 13 years old or if males have not reached Tanner 2 gonadarche by age 14 years.
