The cardioinhibitory component of neurocardiogenic reflex provoked during tilt testing is a significant concern for attending doctors because the decision to pace or not to pace needs to be considered. The proper management of patients with a cardioinhibitory form of neurocardiogenic reflex is still a matter of debate. Cases of pacemaker implantation in young people with a single syncopal event were reported during cardiology conferences. They were justified by the doctors who worry about the risk of cardiac arrest. However, this approach may lead to infectious complications, need for future reimplantation procedures, reduced quality of life, anxiety, and depression. The cardioinhibitory component may be related both to inhibition of sinus node presenting as sinus bradycardia or sinus standstill or inhibition of an atrioventricular node presenting as an atrioventricular block. The patients with an atrioventricular block during neurocardiogenic reflex provoked by tilt table tests have shorter prodromal symptom duration. They tend to have a longer PR interval on an electrocardiogram at baseline. At present, the appropriateness of pacing the patients with tilt table test induced asystole should be assessed in a clinical context. Elderly patients may be considered to be paced because of the risk of overlapping sick sinus syndrome or concealed dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. Pacing in patients atÂ an age younger than 40 years is usually not indicated.
