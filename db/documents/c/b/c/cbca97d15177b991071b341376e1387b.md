Mercury toxicity can be very difficult to diagnose due to nonspecific signs and symptoms and the variability of the onset of the symptoms.  These can easily mimic several other disease processes affecting multiple systems, including renal, gastrointestinal, nervous, and pulmonary.  This is why it is imperative to obtain a complete, thorough history.  A differential diagnosis includes the following list.

Alzheimer disease, senile dementia, Parkinson disease, CVA, cerebellar tumor, metabolic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleed, acid or alkali ingestion, iron toxicity, arsenic toxicity, phosphorus toxicity, cerebral palsy, vertigo, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, intrauterine hypoxia, brainstem gliomas, carbon monoxide poisoning, and alcohol or drug withdrawal.
