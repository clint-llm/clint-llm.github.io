**Chronic Gout (refractory to conventional therapy)**

- 8 mg IV every 2 weeks

The recommended dosage of pegloticase for chronic refractory gout is 8 mg/mL (1 mL) administered intravenously (IV) every two weeks.  The pegloticase diluted solution is to be infused gradually over no lower than 120 minutes intravenously. Infusion should be delivered through gravity feed, syringe-type pump, or infusion pump.

Patients receiving pegloticase should be treated with pre-infusion medications, antihistamines, and corticosteroids to decrease the risk and prevent anaphylaxis and infusion reactions from occurring. Patients starting pegloticase are recommended to discontinue treatment with any oral urate reducing agents. Concomitant use of pegloticase with other oral urate-lowering agents is not recommended. Infusion should be slowed or halted in the event an infusion reaction transpires and restarted at a more gradually slower rate. Monitoring patients for an hour after finishing an infusion is recommended as infusion reactions may also occur during this period.
