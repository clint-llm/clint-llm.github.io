The patient should be informed about the risks and benefits of trigger point injections. Obtain written consent by the patient or guardian decision maker before the start of the procedure. Equipment should be ready at the bedside, and another medical staff member should be available for time-out prior to starting the procedure. Depending on the trigger point location, the patient may be sitting or laying down. Cleanse the area with alcohol pads or chlorhexidine 2%, allowing it to dry. Some providers prefer to mark each trigger point with a skin marker or retracted pen tip as a guide prior to starting the procedure. If using a topical anesthetic spray, make sure to anesthetize the trigger points before starting the procedure.
