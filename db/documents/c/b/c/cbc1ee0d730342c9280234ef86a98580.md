Morbidity and mortality depend on the etiology of the childâ€™s symptoms. Appropriate and timely care will significantly impact the development of complications. Osteomyelitis can progress to bone abscess formation, sepsis and even result in death. Children with septic joints can develop gait disturbances that are permanent, impacting the quality of life. Oncologic processes necessitate treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, surgical procedures, or both. This process involves multiple hospitalizations, and children receiving such agents are at risk for significant bacterial and viral infections. Rheumatologic etiologies can produce a significant impact on activities of daily living; the treatment agents used for these children also may place them at risk for significant infections.
