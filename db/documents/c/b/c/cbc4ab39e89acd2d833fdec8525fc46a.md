Poor bowel preparation canÂ be a potentially severe limitation on the usefulness of colonoscopies. Proper bowel preparation leads to clean identifiable mucosa, and as a result, there is a greater ability to detect polyps and other lesions. Contrary, poor bowel preparation can potentially cause missed identification of lesions or polyps that can have morbidity and mortality effects on the individual.
