Berry aneurysms are due to outpouchings in the blood vessel wall, which be due to either hereditary factors or acquired disease. Repetitive trauma and shearing forces against the weak point in the blood vesselâ€™s wall cause aneurysms to enlarge.

Older dogma considers berry aneurysms to be passively enlarging vascular structures. More recent evidence suggests that berry aneurysms, along with other forms of aneurysms, are created and enlarged through a continuous process of inflammation and tissue degradation.
