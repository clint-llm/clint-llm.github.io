The main complications to consider when treating a patient with electrosurgery are the possibility of delayed bleeding and scarring with hypopigmentation. Patients can be reassured that delayed bleeding can be controlled with 20 minutes of constant direct pressure over the wound.

Other potential complications of electrosurgery include fire, thermoelectric burns, infectious transmission from the electrode, or smoke plume inhalation. Fire risk is greatest in the presence of alcohol, oxygen, or bowel gases. Aluminum chloride used commonly in hemostasis may contain 90% alcohol; therefore, clinicians must be sure the surgery site has dried completely before using electrosurgery. Also, care should be taken when using electrosurgical devices in the perianal area due to highly flammable bowel methane gas.

Research studies have confirmed surgical smoke by-products contain toxic gases and vapors, including benzene, cyanide, cellular material, and viruses. These contaminants can be controlled by using smoke evacuators.
