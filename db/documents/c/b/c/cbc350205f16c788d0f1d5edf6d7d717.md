Similar to any sonographic examination, the appropriate configuration is necessary to acquire detailed images of the abdominal aorta. Place the patient in the supine position with the bed adjusted to the level of the provider’s waist. Darken the room and apply sufficient gel.

Initially, maximize the depth to visualize the most important landmark, the vertebral body. It should be hyperechoic with posterior shadowing. Once identified, adjust the depth accordingly to enhance your image. Particularly, as you scan inferiorly towards the umbilicus, the aorta moves to a more superficial position, and less depth is needed.

Continuous, firm pressure will displace impeding bowel gas; and adjustments to the gain will reduce artifact. Modify the probe angle or move slightly off midline. Then angle or rock back medially to improve image acquisition. Or slide caudal to hindering bowel and then tilt cephalad to enhance sonographic visualization. The opposite technique works similarly.  Finally, turn the patient into the left lateral decubitus position. This may improve your images as well. Nevertheless, the aorta will not be visible in 5% of individuals. In these instances, advanced diagnostic imaging modalities, such as CTA or MRA, will supplement the evaluation.
