Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis typically occurs in children younger than the age of 5 years, but can also occur in adolescents and adults. HSV-1 is usually acquired in childhood by coming into contact with oral secretions. It is estimated that almost 90% of the worldâ€™s population is seropositive for HSV-1 by 35 years of age, and half of the individuals carrying the virus will experience reactivation in the form of herpes labialis. Herpetic gingivostomatitis is equally distributed amongst gender and race groups and is not found to have a particular seasonal or geographic distribution.
