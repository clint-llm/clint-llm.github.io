The overall incidence of periprosthetic proximal femur fractures ranges from 0.1 to 18%. Revision arthroplasty, surgical technique, and implant type each can increase the incidence of fracture. Canton et al. found that revision total hip arthroplasty often requires extensive soft tissue and bony dissection and raises the incidence of periprosthetic fracture to 4 to 11%.
