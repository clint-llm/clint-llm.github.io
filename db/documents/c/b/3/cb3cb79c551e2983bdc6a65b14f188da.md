Currently, there is no curative treatment available for hereditary ataxia.Â  Depending on the causes, if the ataxia results from a stroke, toxic substances, hypothyroidism, or any modifiable risk factors, treatment is targeted at the specific condition causing ataxia. Some treatable causes are reversible by medication such as vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 deficiencies, and episodic ataxia type two.

Patients may use devices to reduce functional disability, such as walking aids, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers. Patients can receive physical, speech therapy, and symptomatic treatment. Medications can reduce tremors, muscle stiffness, and sleeping disorders. There is evidence that physical and mental exercises can improve the lives of patients with ataxia.
