Amaurosis fugax may occur due to the following:

- Thromboembolism from a carotid plaque

- Hypoperfusion

- Vasospasm

- Elevated plasma viscosity, for example with leukemia, multiple myeloma

- Atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease

In amaurosis fugax, the loss of vision is usually unilateral, painless and transient. In most cases, the vision loss may vary from a few seconds to a few minutes. The embolus in most cases is from an atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid bifurcation. Hypoperfusion from any cause can also mimic amaurosis fugax.
