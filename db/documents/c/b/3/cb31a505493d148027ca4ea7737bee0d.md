The etiology of gout is usually multifactorial, including genetic risk factors, medical comorbidities, and dietary factors. In rare cases, a single genetic defect may be responsible for causing gout, usually associated with other medical complications.  Whatever the cause, the result is elevated serum uric acid, which in some patients ultimately causes clinical gout.

**Genes Associated with Gout**

The heritability of hyperuricemia and gout is about 73%, and about 40-50% of patients have a family history of gout.

**Risk Factors**

The final step of purine metabolism is the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then uric acid by xanthine oxidase and then to allantoin by uricase. Allantoin has a much higher solubility than uric acid. Humans, other primates, giraffes, and dalmatians have gene mutations and do not produce uricase.

**Relationship Between Serum Uric Acid Concentration and Incident Gout**

Hyperuricemia is not the only risk factor for gout, in fact, only a minority of these patients develop gout. The lower physiological uric acid range can assess the impact of diet on the uric acid levels in other non-uricase-producing species. Dietary sources that can contribute to hyperuricemia and gout include the consumption of animal food such as seafood (e,g., shrimp, lobster), organs (e.g., liver and kidney), and red meat (pork, beef). Some drinks like alcohol, sweetened beverages, sodas, and high-fructose corn syrup may also contribute to this disease.

Epidemiological studies reported an increased disease burden of gout, largely explained by lifestyle changes like increased protein consumption and a sedentary lifestyle.

Other factors implicated in gout and/or hyperuricemia include older age, male sex, obesity, a purine diet, alcohol, medications, comorbid diseases, and genetics. Offending medications include diuretics, low-dose aspirin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and cyclosporine.

**Risk factors of hyperuricemia and gout**

**Causes of Hyperuricemia**

**Causes of hyperuricemia due to decreased uric acid clearance**

Fructose                            (high fructose corn syrup)

**Triggers**

Every condition that causes alterations in extracellular urate concentration can trigger a flare-up. These conditions include stress (medical illness especially cardiovascular illnesses, surgical procedure, recent trauma, dehydration, or starvation), dietary factors (e.g., high purine foods such as organ meats or seafood, beer, wine, and spirits), and drugs (e.g., aspirin, diuretics, or even allopurinol).

**Dietary Factors That May Lower Serum Uric Acid**

Certain dietary practices have been shown to lower serum uric and reduce the risk of incident gout. Higher total meat and seafood intake are associated with increased incident gout in men.  Also, increased intake of dairy intake is associated with a decrease in incident gout in men.
