Hairy leukoplakia is commonly found in association with HIV infection and/or immunosuppression. It has been observed that the risk of developing hairy leukoplakia increases almost two times with every 300-unit decrease in the CD4 count. It has also been seen in patients with other forms of severe immunodeficiencies, such as those on chemotherapy or who have had an organ transplant or leukemia. It has rarely been seen in immunocompetent patients.

Moreover, hairy leukoplakia has also been seen associated with Behcet syndrome and ulcerative colitis. In HIV-positive men, smoking more than a pack of cigarettes/day has been correlated positively with the development of hairy leukoplakia.
