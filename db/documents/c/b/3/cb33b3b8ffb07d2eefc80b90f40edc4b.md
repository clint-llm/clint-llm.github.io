It is essential to communicate the findings of Todd paresis with all treating clinicians. Unilateral symptoms should always be addressed and discussed with treating clinicians and nursing staff when they occur. A careful history and physical exam can help exclude other causes of symptoms such as cerebrovascular accidents and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. Clinical evaluation and assessment are needed to avoid misinterpretation of the data. Clinicians must be educated that this phenomenon will resolve spontaneously to prevent unnecessary over-testing.

The interprofessional care provided to the patient by the primary care clinician, the neurologist, and the nurses must use an integrated care pathway for evaluation and detecting earlier signs and symptoms to improve prognosis and outcome.
