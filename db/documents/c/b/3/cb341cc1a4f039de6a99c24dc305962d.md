Scrotal complaints are relatively common in the emergency department, comprising at least 0.5% of all emergency department visits. Testicular torsion is a time-dependent diagnosis, a true urologic emergency, and early evaluation can assist in urologic intervention to prevent testicular loss. Ultrasound is the ideal imaging modality to evaluate the scrotal contents.

Testicular viability significantly decreases 6 hours after the onset of symptoms, hence early diagnosis is key. Testicular torsion is most common in young people, but rarely may be seen in older individuals. Surgery is the only treatment.
