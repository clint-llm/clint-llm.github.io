Diagnosis of child abuse, neglect, or maltreatment may be difficult as the victim may be unable to provide information due to pre-verbal or nonverbal status, fear, or severe injuries. Also, the perpetrator rarely admits to the abuse, and witnesses are uncommon. Physicians may see children of maltreatment in a variety of situations that include:

- An adult or mandated reporter brings the child in for evaluation when they are concerned about abuse.

- A child or adolescent comes in disclosing the abuse.

- A perpetrator brings the patient for medical care with concern that the abuse is severe.

- A child presents for care unrelated to abuse, and abuse may be found incidentally.

Physical abuse should be considered in the evaluation of all injuries of children. A thorough history of present illness is vital to make a correct diagnosis. Information about the child's behavior before, during, and after the injury should be obtained. History-taking should include the interview of the verbal child and each caretaker separately. The parent or caretaker should be allowed to provide their history without interruptions to not be influenced by the physician's questions or interpretations.

Pediatric physical abuse should be considered in the following:

- Injury in a non-ambulatory infant

- Injury in a nonverbal child

- Injury inconsistent with the child's physical abilities

- A statement of harm from the verbal child

- Mechanism of injury not plausible

- Multiple injuries, particularly at varying stages of healing

- Bruises on the torso, ear, or neck in a child younger than 4 years of age

- Burns to genitalia

- Stocking or glove distributions or patterns of injury

- The caregiver is unconcerned about the injury.

- An unexplained delay in seeking care

- Inconsistencies or discrepancies in the histories provided

"**TEN 4**" is a useful mnemonic to recall which bruising locations are of concern in cases involving physical abuse: bruises of the Torso, Ear, or Neck in a child < 4 years of age or any bruising in a child < 4 months of age are concerning for abuse.

Other injuries that are highly suggestive of abuse include:

- Retinal hemorrhages

- Posterior rib fractures

- Classic metaphyseal lesions

**Signs And Symptoms Of Child Abuse**

**Physical Abuse**

**Pediatric Abusive Head Trauma (PAHT)**

Pediatric Abusive Head Trauma (PAHT) or “shaken baby syndrome” is a common cause of abusive head injury in children and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. PAHT is an injury to the intracranial contents or skull of an infant or young child inflicted by blunt impact or violent shaking. An evaluation may begin with a skull X-ray or head ultrasound but often requires a head CT for definitive diagnosis, particularly in an emergency setting or in an unstable child. Common head CT findings in PAHT include subdural hematomas and diffuse axonal injury. The evaluation should also include an ophthalmologic examination to evaluate for retinal hemorrhages.

Signs and symptoms of PAHT are often non-specific and may include:

- Absence of hair due to vigorous hair pulling

- Apnea

- Bulging fontanelles

- Coma

- Decreased appetite

- Irritability

- Unexplained injury to the frenulum, jaw, nose, or teeth

- Lethargy

- Retinal hemorrhages

- Seizures

- Vomiting

Long term sequela of PAHT includes:

- Blindness

- Cerebral palsy

- Developmental delay

- Hearing loss

- Learning difficulties

- Seizures

Glutaric aciduria type 1 is a rare metabolic disease that can cause retinal hemorrhages and subdural hematomas and may be mistaken for PAHT.

**Skeletal Trauma**

The majority of abusive fractures occur in non-ambulatory infants and toddlers < 18 months of age. Any unexplained fracture in a child should raise suspicion for child abuse. The following fractures may be concerning for physical abuse:

- Skull fractures

- "Bucket handle" fractures or "corner" fractures due to twisting of the ends of the long bones.

- Long bone fractures in a non-ambulatory child

- Greenstick fractures

- Posterior or lateral rib fractures

- Scapular fractures other than those caused by birth trauma

- Spinal fractures

- Sternal fractures

- Multiple fractures in various stages of healing

- Facial fractures

- Skeletal trauma with other injuries

Symptoms that raise suspicion for fracture include:

- Red, swollen, painful joint or limb

- Patient crying with pain or irritability

- Local tenderness to palpation

- Unwillingness to move the limb

Organic causes of fractures that may be mistaken for child abuse include:

- Osteogenesis imperfecta

- Osteopenia

- Metabolic bone disease: Rickets, vitamin C and copper deficiency

- Oncological disorders

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

- Injury sustained during resuscitation: rib fractures, internal organ contusions, retinal hemorrhages

**Abdominal Trauma:**

Abdominal injury may result in significant morbidity and mortality. The most commonly injured organs are the spleen (over 60%), liver, pancreas, kidneys, and, less frequently, small bowel and bladder.

**Bites**

Human bites are a “2 to 5 cm oval or circular mark, made by two opposing concave arcs, with or without associated ecchymosis”.

**Bruising**

A bruise is the most common soft tissue injury in cases of physical abuse. Bruises can be characterized as:

- Petechiae: very small, pinpoint erythematous, non-blanching bruises caused by broken capillaries.

- Purpura: small bruises occurring in groups or a single bruise up to 1 cm

- Ecchymoses: larger bruise > 1 cm.

Bruising in non-abused children is most commonly found on the knees, shins, and bony prominences. Bruising in non-ambulatory children is uncommon and is concerning for non-accidental trauma. Commonly in abuse, bruises will be found on the backside of the child, beginning at the neck and continuing down to the knees, including shoulders and the child's arms. This area has been referred to as the child's "primary target zone." The following pattern of bruises are potentially worrisome:

- Clustered or patterned

- Inconsistent with history

- Large or numerous

- Present in various stages of healing

- Present in non-ambulatory children

A pediatrician needs to differentiate bruises from “pseudo-bruises" such as Mongolian spots (grey-blue, can be found anywhere on the body and have clear cut margins), maculae cerulae (bluish spot on the skin due to pubic lice), and allergic shiners (more brown than blue, may be confused with black eyes). Also on the differential diagnosis for bruises are bleeding disorders, vasculitides, hypersensitivity syndromes, and various cultural practices such as spooning, coining, and cupping.

**Burns**

Burns are often accidental and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in children. Burns that cannot be explained by history, present with a significant delay in seeking care, have characteristic sharp lines of demarcation (also called the line of immersion), or have a symmetric pattern are concerning for child abuse. Other typical burns for child abuse include:

- Immersion burns: doughnut burns (as buttocks make firm contact with the base of a container) or zebra burns (a child immersed in a flexed position with spare the creases of child’s body giving a striped configuration)

- Glove-like or sock-like burns from immersion of child’s feet and hands

- Dry contact burns patterned like a household appliance, such as an iron, stove, heater, grate, radiator pipe, hot plate, or curling iron.

- Round cigarette burns

- Rope burns

The differential diagnosis of burns includes:

- Chemical and irritants: bleach, complementary and alternative therapies

- Infection: impetigo, blistering distal dactylitis, ringworm

- Stephens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis

- Dermatological conditions: diaper dermatitis

- Scalded skin syndrome

**Lacerations**

Lacerations are a pattern of injury in which skin and the underlying tissues are cut or torn. Unexplained lacerations in the following areas are potentially concerning:

- Arms, eyes, genitalia, gums, legs, lips, mouth, and torso

**Behavioral Signs of Physical Abuse**

In addition to the history and physical examination, observation of the child's behavior, and the child-caregiver interactions during the encounter can provide clues to the potential for physical abuse.

Behavioral indicators of abuse in children include:

- Aggressive, destructive, or disruptive behavior

- Apprehensive when other children cry

- Compulsions, hypochondria, phobias, and obsessions

- Fear of going home

- Fear of caregiver

- Emotionless, passive, or withdrawn

- Habit disorders

- Lack of interest in activities for age

- Overly seeks affection

- Self-injurious behaviors

- Suicide attempts

- Return of bedwetting

- Unexpected sexual knowledge for age

- Unwilling to change clothes for physical education or sports

- Wearing concealing clothing

Behavioral indicators of abuse in caregiver include:

- Alcohol or drug abuse

- Concealment of injuries

- Disciplines harshly

- Describes child as evil

- Delays medical care

- History of abuse as a child

- Lack of emotional control

- Lack of parenting skills

- Lack of support network

- Multiple providers

- Overly protective or jealous

- Poor self-esteem

- Unconcerned about child's health or well-being

- Unclear or conflicting explanation of the child's injury

- Uses the child to meet emotional or physical needs

- Unrealistic expectations

**Sexual Abuse**

Sexual behaviors are rare in infants except for hand to genital contact. They become more prevalent in children 2-5 years of age as they become aware of their body parts, and then they become less common > 5 years as children become aware of social rules. However, if a child has inappropriate behaviors such as an older child touching other children's genitals, undressing in front of others, and looking at others undressing, there should be a concern.

Sexual abuse involves the coercion of a dependent, developmentally immature person to commit a sexual act with someone older, sometimes for financial gain (i.e., sex trafficking).

A normal physical examination does not rule out sexual abuse, and the most common finding in sexual abuse is a normal physical examination. In most cases, evidence that sexual abuse has occurred is based on the child's statement. Suspicion should be raised if any of the following are present:

- Alcohol and drug addiction

- Adolescent pregnancy

- Agoraphobia

- Alopecia areas

- Anogenital trauma

- Anxiety

- Bruises

- Burns

- Bloody or torn underwear

- Bruises on the palate

- Depression and suicidal thoughts

- Diseases that are untreated or not diagnosed

- Fractures

- Head injuries

- Lacerations

- Ligature injuries

- Malnourishment

- Painful urination and bowel movements

- Painful sitting or walking

- Panic attacks

- Poor hygiene

- PTSD

- Recurrent urinary tract infections

- Sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic infections

**Epidemiology**

It may be a challenge to recognize sexual abuse as physical evidence may be overlooked or not present. Considerations include:

- Every culture, class, and race is at risk.

- Boys are less likely to report their victimization.

- Children may be reluctant to disclose abuse by a family member or friend.

- A young child may not have the language skills to describe events.

- Girls are sexually abused more often than boys.

- Perpetrators are more commonly male.

- Most perpetrators are known to the victim.

There is no average profile of a child molester or victim; any community member may be an offender.

Long-term effects of sexual abuse include:

- Anxiety

- Difficulty concentrating

- Depression

- Self-injurious behaviors

- Substance abuse

- Suicide

**Sex Trafficking**

The Trafficking Victims Protection Act defines "severe forms of trafficking in persons" as (a) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age; or (b) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. Commercial sex act means any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.

- The average age is of sex trafficking victims is 11 to 14 years.

- Frequently starts on the internet.

- The number of victims worldwide is in the millions, and half of the affected individuals are children.

- Women more commonly affected than men

**Screening Questions**

If sex trafficking is suspected, complete the physical examination in private, then consider the screening questions in the figure.

**Neglect**

Physical examination may not only demonstrate signs of physical abuse but may show signs of neglect. The general examination may show poor oral hygiene with extensive dental caries, malnutrition with significant growth failure, untreated diaper dermatitis, or untreated wounds.

Indicators of physical neglect include:

- Abandonment

- Drug withdrawal symptoms

- Delayed development

- Failure to thrive

- Hunger

- Inappropriate dressing

- Lack of supervision

- Poor hygiene

- Truancy

- Unattended physical problems

**Emotional Neglect**

Behavioral indicators of neglect in a child include:

- Alcohol or substance abuse

- Begging or stealing food

- Chronic fatigue

- Conduct disorders and delinquency

- Developmental delay

- Extended stays at school

- Habit disorders

- Hysteria

- Hypochondria

- Inhibition of play

- Absence of caretaker at home

- Obsessive-compulsive behaviors

- Overly compliant

- Overly demanding

- Passive-aggressive

- Phobias

- Runaway

- Sleep disorders

- Suicide attempt

Behavioral indicators of neglect in a legally responsible person include:

- Blaming the child for problems

- Inconsistent treatment

- Lack of caring

- Continued rejection

- Treating children unequally

**Mandated Reporters:**

All healthcare providers are mandated reporters, and, as such, they are required to make a report to child welfare when there is a reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect. One does not need to be certain, but one does need to have a reasonable suspicion of the abuse. This mandated report may be lifesaving for many children. An interprofessional approach to the evaluation with the inclusion of a child-abuse specialist is optimal.

**Forensic Evidence**

If child abuse or neglect is considered, the history and physical examination findings may be used in legal proceedings. Photographs, diagrams, and detailed findings are helpful for recall at trial. Findings should be reported accurately and without bias.

**Photographs**

New York Social Service Law allows any person or official required to take evidence for suspected abuse to take color photographs of visible trauma or radiographs. The images should be provided to Child Protective Services as soon as possible. Consent is not needed for a minor child to be photographed if child abuse is suspected and reported to the Statewide Central Register. A chain of custody should be maintained. The institutional protocol for releasing photographs should be followed.

Tips for taking photographs:

- Include the child's name, date of birth, medical record number, date and time of photographs, and name of the provider on an index card

- Take photos at various ranges: distant, mid-range, and close up.

- Use adequate lighting

- Include anatomic landmarks to identify the location of findings.

- Use a ruler placed on the skin to document the size of any findings.

- The child's face and body should be photographed for identification of the patient.

**Victim Disclosures**

If a child discloses abuse, they may only disclose part of what happened. Document in the child's own words and quote the child if possible. Avoid rushing the child or making promises you cannot keep. Explain to the child they may need to repeat the information. Methods to enhance disclosure include:

- Ask who, what, where, and when

- Ask open-ended questions

- Avoid expressing emotion

- Be a good listener

- Remain calm

- Thank them for talking to you

- Use age-appropriate language

**Indirect Hints**

- Admitting to a problem but being unwilling to share

- My father, mother, brother, or sister would not let me sleep.

- My uncle, aunt, cousin, babysitter keeps bothering me.

**Factitious Disorder**

Factitious disorder imposed on another or Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a form of child abuse. It typically occurs when a caretaker falsifies an illness in the child to gain attention. There generally are no obvious external monetary rewards.

Typical findings****in factitious disorder include:

- Deceptive behavior is evident in the absence of obvious external rewards.

- Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms

- History of many hospitalizations with unusual signs and symptoms

- History of unusual death or illness in the family

- Improves when hospitalized but worsens when returns home

- Lab samples do not match the child.

- Not better explained by another mental disorder.

- Presents another individual to others as ill, impaired, or injured

- Signs and symptoms do not agree with the test results.

- Toxic or abnormal chemicals in the child's blood, stool, or urine

- Worsening of the child's symptoms by the perpetrator but not witnessed by healthcare professionals
