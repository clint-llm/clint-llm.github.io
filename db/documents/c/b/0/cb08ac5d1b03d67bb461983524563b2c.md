Research findings should have excellent external validity, i.e., where the results extrapolate to the general population. Equally important is the robustness of the methods used, especially statistical analysis. Biostatistics should be an integral part of the curriculum at all levels of the university. The assistance of a biostatistician or a public health expert can be instrumental in choosing the appropriate design for the study, the analytical tools to be used, and the usefulness of the results. The inclusion of a statistician in the research team also develops a multi-disciplinary approach and can lead to better outcomes for the research.
