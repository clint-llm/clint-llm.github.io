Mediastinoscopy is a surgical procedure that is performed in the operating room. It requires a cardiothoracic or general surgeon trained in mediastinoscopy capable of performing an emergency thoracotomy and/or sternotomy. The procedure also requires general anesthesia and thus requires an anesthesiologist and operating room support staff.

Mediastinoscopy can be performed under local or general anesthesia. General anesthesia is the technique of choice at most institutions if the patient has no preoperative signs or symptoms of airway obstruction.
