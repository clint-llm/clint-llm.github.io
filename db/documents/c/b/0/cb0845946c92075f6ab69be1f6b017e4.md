The fastigial nucleus constitutes one of the primary cerebellar nuclei and is situated closest to the midline toward the anterior segment of the superior vermis and over the roof of the fourth ventricle.

- Large glutamatergic projection neurons that transmit their axons to different parts of the brain

- Large glycinergic projection neurons that are situated in the rostral portion of the fastigial nucleus and transmit signals to ipsilateral vestibular nuclei and the caudal brainstem

- Medium-sized GABAergic projection neurons that offer feedback to the inferior olive

- Small GABA/glycine interneurons that restrict their axon terminals in the nucleus and are responsible for signaling and integration in the fastigial nucleus

- Small non-GABAergic interneurons that have faster repolarization and spontaneous firing than GABAergic neurons

As previously mentioned, the fastigial nucleus is essential in motor control by sending signals to the medial descending systems and eye movement nuclei and the maintenance of many activities within the human body, such as feeding, immune, defecation and micturition, and cardiovascular and respiratory functions.
