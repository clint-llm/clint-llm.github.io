A nasal hematoma usually presents within the first 24 to 72 hours after trauma. However delayed presentation has also been reported. The most common symptom is the nasal obstruction (95%) which can be either unilateral or bilateral depending on the type of hematoma. Other symptoms include pain (50%), rhinorrhea (25%), and fever (25%). In many cases, symptoms are non-specific. Therefore, a high index of suspicion should be kept especially if a patient presents with nasal deformity and/or nasal pain following trauma. Also if a post-traumatic nasal obstruction does not resolve with a local vasoconstrictive agent or blood clot removal, the possibility of a nasal hematoma should be strongly considered.

Clinical examination is usually confirmatory. It can either be accomplished with a nasal speculum or otoscope.  Blood clots, if any should be suctioned. Asymmetry of the septum with bluish or reddish mucosal swelling suggests a hematoma. A newly formed hematoma is not always ecchymotic and can only be picked up by palpation. Direct palpation is carried out by gently inserting the little finger into the patient's nose. A hematoma feels soft and fluctuant in contrast to deviated nasal septum which will be firm and concave on the opposite side. Another important feature of septal hematoma is the lack of reduction in size on the application of decongestant sprays like oxymetazoline 0.05%.
