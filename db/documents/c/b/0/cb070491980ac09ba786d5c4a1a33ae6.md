Thoracic duct leaks are most often due to traumatic injury and iatrogenic injury. Surgery of the esophagus and the heart are the most common source of injury. Untreated high-volume leaks have a significant mortality rate. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of thoracic duct leaks and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of thoracic duct leaks.
- Review the evaluation to diagnose and confirm a thoracic duct leak.
- Outline the management of low output and high output thoracic duct leaks.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of treatment in patients with thoracic duct leaks.
