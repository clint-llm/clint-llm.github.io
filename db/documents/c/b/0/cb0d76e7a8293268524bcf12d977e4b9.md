A myocardial infarct is mainly caused by rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque in any of the blood vessels supplying oxygen to theÂ heart. Pathophysiology involved in this process includes movement of inflammatory cells in the vessel wall, engulfment of cholesterol products causing these macrophages to become foam cells, releasing growth factors which causes fibrin and smooth muscles to become part of the plaque. Plaques may have a thin or thick fibrous cap, rupture of these plaques causes devastating injury.
