There are several hypothesized pathophysiological mechanisms. Currently, the most widely accepted theory is the direct mechanical compression of the optic nerve by the edematous Extra-Ocular Muscles (EOMs) and intra-orbital fat, leading to the deceleration of the axonal flow and the resultant ischemia.****The subsequent crowding at the orbital apex also often results in increased orbital pressure. Substantial evidence to support the above theory can be derived from the fact that the visual acuity, as well as the retrobulbar pressure significantly, improves after orbital decompression, a surgery that relieves the crowding and the congestion in orbit.****

The traditional hypothesis of optic nerve inflammation as the implicated mechanism is obsolete due to a lack of strong evidence of inflammatory cells in the histopathological specimen of the optic nerve in patients with suspected or clinically diagnosed DON.****Stretching of the optic nerve is yet another postulated mechanism of optic neuropathy in TED. As opposed to the peripheral nerves, the optic nerve has a regular and uniform organization of nerve fibers. This anatomical difference presumably makes it more vulnerable to damage through circumferential straining.
