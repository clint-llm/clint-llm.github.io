According to published monitoring parameters on Rh(D) immune globulin, if indicated for the alloimmunization prophylaxis, after administration, patients should be monitored for at least 20 minutes to watch for any signs of systemic reactions.

If using RhIG to treat immune thrombocytopenic purpura, the black-box warning recommends closely monitoring patients for at least 8 hours to rule out any evidence of intravascular hemolysis. While most patients will be asymptomatic, signs and symptoms to be mindful of in a minority of patients include fever, back pain, shaking chills, and discolored urine or hematuria, which may indicate hemolysis.

Recommended labs for monitoring before treatment initiation include complete blood count (baseline anemia assessment and degree of hemolysis), differential and PBS review (evidence of hemolysis, infection), direct antiglobulin test and antibody screen, reticulocyte count, urinalysis, serum creatinine, and BUN.

Recommended labs to monitor following treatment include complete blood count (1 to 3 days after infusion if first administration), urinalysis 1 to 2 hours after treatment (dipstick only, unless positive for blood), serum creatinine (only if posttreatment hemoglobin decreased greater than 1 g/dL), and BUN (only if posttreatment hemoglobin decreased greater than 1 g/dL).

If intravascular hemolysis is suspected, monitor plasma hemoglobin, LDH, haptoglobin, and plasma bilirubin (direct and indirect).
