A nasal septal hematoma should be drained urgently to avoid undue complications. The procedure is done under local anesthesia. However general anesthesia might be required in apprehensive adults and children.

Following equipment/instruments should be available before draining a septal hematoma:

- Topical anesthesia

- Light source (head-lamp or otoscope)

- Nasal speculum

- Suction apparatus (Frazier suction tip)

- Gloves

- Needle, 18-20 gauge (Ga)

- Syringe, five mL

- Scalpel, No. 11 blade or 15 blade

- Commercially produced nasal tampon

- Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin)

- Surgicel (oxidized cellulose)

- Small Penrose drain

The patient should lie in the reclining position with the head end of the table slightly raised. Small hematomas can be aspirated with an 18-Ga to 20 -Ga needle. Larger hematomas are drained by incising the mucosa over the most fluctuant area. The incision is given in the anteroposterior direction parallel to the nasal floor. In the case of a bilateral hematoma, a staggered incision is made to avoid through and through the septal perforation. The clot is suctioned, and saline irrigation is carried out on an 18-Ga to 20-Ga catheter. A small piece of the mucosa is excised from the incision edge for better drainage and the prevention of premature closure. A small Penrose drain is placed into the opened hematoma cavity and secured with a suture. The nose is packed on both sides to prevent the re-accumulation of blood. Systemic antibiotics are prescribed to prevent serious, infective complications. Pack and drain are usually kept in situ for 2 to 3 days and is removed only when there is no further drainage for at least 24 hours. Patients should be kept on regular follow up to prevent delayed complications.
