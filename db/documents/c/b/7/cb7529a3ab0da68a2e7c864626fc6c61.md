Multiple dosage forms of levothyroxine are available, including oral tablets, capsules, solutions, and parenteral dosage forms. Specific instructions for the dosage forms are as below.

- Oral: Administer levothyroxine on an empty stomach (acidity increases absorption) at least 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast or 3 to 4 hours after dinner. Do not administer levothyroxine within 4 hours of administration of products that may contain iron or calcium. Do not administer levothyroxine in conjunction with antacids or proton pump inhibitors.

- Capsule: Swallow whole; Do not crush or cut.

- Tablet: May crush into 5 to 10 mL of water and drink immediately. If swallowing the tablet whole, administer with a full glass of water to prevent dysphagia.

- Solution: Give either undiluted (directly squeeze contents into the mouth) or diluted in water only (squeeze contents into water, stir, and drink immediately).

- Intravenous levothyroxine is exclusively used in the hospital setting, where vital signs can undergo close monitoring.

- If the patient can not tolerate anything by mouth, the levothyroxine capsules are used as a suppository and are well absorbed.

**Adult Dosing**

- For the treatment of hypothyroidism (oral): Adults who are healthy and diagnosed with hypothyroidism for a few months should receive an initial dose of 1.6 mcg/kg/day with a 12.5 to 25 mcg/day dose adjustment every 6 to 8 weeks as needed.

- Adults with cardiac disease or elderly over 65 years old and hypothyroidism should receive an initial dose of 25 mcg/day with a dose adjustment of 12.5 to 25 mcg every 4 to 6 weeks as needed.

**Infant and Pediatric Dosing**

- Levothyroxine replacement of 10 to 15 mcg/kg/d should be initiated once newborn screening is positive. Higher doses may be required for infants with severe congenital hypothyroidism. According to product labeling by the FDA following dose of levothyroxine is recommended. The levothyroxine dose is adjusted based on clinical response and laboratory parameters.

- 0 to 3 months:10 to 15 mcg/kg/day

- 3 to 6 months: 8 to10 mcg/kg/day

- 6 to 12 months: 6 to  8 mcg/kg/day

- 1 to 5 years: 5 to 6 mcg/kg/day

- 6 to 12 years: 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day

- Greater than 12 years but growth and puberty incomplete: 2 to 3 mcg/kg/day

- Growth and puberty complete: 1.6 mcg/kg/day

- 1-year-old children 4 to 6 mcg/kg/d, adolescents 2 to 4 mcg/kg/d, transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 mcg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete.

- Newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure: Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Based on clinical and laboratory responses, increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed.

**Myxedema Coma (IV) or Severe Hypothyroidism**

- 200 to 400 mcg initial IV loading dose is followed by a daily dose of 1.2 mcg/kg/day, considering lower doses in patients with a history of cardiac disease, arrhythmia, or older patients. Switch to oral therapy (8 mcg/kg/day) when symptoms resolve. The equivalence between intravenous and oral levothyroxine is 0.75 to 1 (for example, 200 mcg IV of levothyroxine equals 266 mcg of oral levothyroxine).

**Organ Recovery from a Cadaver**

- 20 mcg IV bolus to the donor, followed by 10 mcg/hour continuous infusion. Given with methylprednisolone, dextrose, and insulin.

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**There is no information regarding dosage adjustment of levothyroxine in patients with hepatic impairment in the manufacturer's product labeling.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**There is no information regarding dosage adjustment of levothyroxine in patients with renal impairment in the manufacturer's product labeling.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements. Therefore, clinicians should monitor serum TSH levels and adjust levothyroxine dosage during pregnancy. Pregnant patients with newly diagnosed hypothyroidism should receive initial treatment at 1.8 mcg/kg/day. Adjust the dose every four weeks as needed. If a patient is diagnosed with hypothyroidism before pregnancy, adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed. After pregnancy, levothyroxine should decrease to 1.6 mcg/kg/day.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Levothyroxine (T4) is a component of human milk. Adequate levothyroxine during lactation may normalize milk production in hypothyroid lactating mothers. The health benefits of breastfeeding should be evaluated, along with the mother's clinical requirement for levothyroxine and possible adverse effects on the breastfed infant from levothyroxine. Exogenous replacement of levothyroxine during breastfeeding has no adverse effects in infants. The American Thyroid Association(ATA) suggests hypothyroidism should be treated with levothyroxine in lactating women. After delivery, levothyroxine should be reduced to the patient's preconception dose. Further thyroid function testing should be performed at approximately six weeks postpartum.
