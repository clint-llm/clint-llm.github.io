**Paranasal Sinuses**

The nerves that supply the ethmoidal sinuses are the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the nasociliary nerve. The nasociliary nerve is supplied by the V1 branch (ophthalmic nerve) of the trigeminal nerve. Orbital branches of the V2 branch (maxillary nerve) of the trigeminal nerve via the pterygopalatine ganglion also innervate the ethmoidal air cells. The maxillary sinuses receive innervation from the maxillary nerve via the infra-orbital and alveolar branches. The frontal sinuses receive innervation by the supraorbital nerve, a branch of V1 (ophthalmic) nerve. The sphenoidal sinuses get their innervation from the posterior ethmoidal branch of V1 (ophthalmic) nerve as well as orbital branches of the V2 (maxillary) nerve.

**Dural Venous Sinuses**

One of the most prominent dural sinuses of the head is the cavernous sinus. This sinus is responsible for allowing the passage of many cranial nerves (CN), particularly important for ocular and facial function. These nerves are CN III (oculomotor nerve for ocular muscle innervation, lens accommodation, and pupillary constriction), CN IV (trochlear nerve for superior oblique muscle innervation), CN V (V1 and V2 segments for ocular and facial sensation) and CN VI (lateral rectus innervation).
