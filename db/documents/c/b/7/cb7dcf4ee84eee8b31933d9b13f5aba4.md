The primary aim of treatment for chronic bronchitis is to relieve symptoms, prevent complications and slow the progression of the disease. The primary goals of therapy are aimed at reducing the overproduction of mucus, controlling inflammation, and lowering cough. These are achieved by pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological interventions.

The mainstay of pharmacological interventions are the following:

- Bronchodilators: Short and long-acting β-adrenergic receptor agonists, as well as anticholinergics, help by increasing the airway lumen, increasing ciliary function, and by increasing mucous hydration.

- Glucocorticoids: Reduce inflammation and mucus production. Inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbation and improve quality of life. However, it is administered under medical supervision and for short periods of time, as long-term usage can induce osteoporosis, diabetes, and hypertension.

- Antibiotic therapy: is not indicated in the treatment of chronic bronchitis; however, macrolide therapy has been shown to have an anti-inflammatory property and hence may have a role in the treatment of chronic bronchitis.

- Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors: decrease inflammation and promote airway smooth muscle relaxation by preventing the hydrolysis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a substance when degraded, leads to the release of inflammatory mediators.

Non Pharmacological Measures

The most critical nonpharmacological intervention is smoking cessation. Smoking cessation improves mucociliary function and decreases goblet cell hyperplasia. Smoking cessation has also been shown to reduce airway injury resulting in lower levels of exfoliated mucus in tracheobronchial cells.

Pulmonary rehabilitation is an important part of treatment for chronic bronchitis is pulmonary rehabilitation which consists of education, lifestyle modification, regular physical activity, and avoidance of exposure to known pollutants either at work or living environment.
