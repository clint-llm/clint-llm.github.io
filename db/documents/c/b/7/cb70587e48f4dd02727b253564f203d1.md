The histopathological examination of congenital smooth muscle hamartoma shows disseminated proliferation of mature smooth muscle cells of a central cigar-shaped nucleus and fibrillary and eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells form large and well-defined bundles randomly oriented, with characteristic clear space separating each bundle from surrounding collagen fibers. The proliferation is typically in the reticular dermis, but it may reach the hair follicles and the subcutaneous tissue. Masson's trichrome staining revealsÂ red irregularly-oriented bundles. Immunohistochemistry using smooth muscle actin stain provides conclusive clues of the smooth muscle nature of this cell proliferation. Epidermal histological features include basal layer pigmentation, mild acanthosis, and hyperkeratosis.
