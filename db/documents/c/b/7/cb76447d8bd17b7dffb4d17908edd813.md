Prone CPR in the hospital setting is usually performed by an interdisciplinary healthcare team that includes physicians, pharmacists, nurses, respiratory therapists, laboratory staff, and other ancillary staff. Prone CPR in the operating room during surgery should not be delayed while waiting for the cardiac arrest team to arrive. Instead, CPR should be initiated immediately by the healthcare staff present during surgery which usually includes the surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses, and surgical assistants.
