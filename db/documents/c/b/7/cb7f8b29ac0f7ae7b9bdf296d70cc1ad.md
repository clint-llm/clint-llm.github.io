The pathophysiology of stridor is based upon the anatomic location involved as well as the underlying disease process. Narrowing of the supraglottic areas can occur rapidly because there is no cartilage in these areas. The subglottic area is of most concern in infants in which minimal airway narrowing here can result in dramatic increases in airway resistance.

**Inspiratory Stridor**

An obstruction in the extrathoracic region causes inspiratory stridor. During inspiration, the intratracheal pressure falls below the atmospheric pressure, causing a collapse of the airway.

**Expiratory Stridor**

An obstruction in the intrathoracic region causes expiratory stridor. During expiration, the increased pleural pressure compresses the airway causing a decrease in the airway size at the site of the intrathoracic obstruction.

Both inspiratory and expiratory stridor occurs because of bacterial tracheitis and foreign bodies.

Laryngeal webs and vocal cord paralysis occur due to a fixed airway obstruction, which does not change with respiration.
