Physicians should explain the genetic basis of FCH and how it is inherited in families. By understanding the genetic basis of the condition, patients can better understand their risk of developing cardiovascular disease and the importance of early intervention. In addition to genetic counseling, patients should be educated on lifestyle modifications that can help manage FCH. This includes proper diet, regular exercise, and weight management. In addition, other modifiable risk factors should be addressed, such as smoking cessation, alcohol consumption, and stress management.

Furthermore, medications may be prescribed to help reduce cholesterol levels and decrease heart disease risk in patients with FCH. It is essential to discuss medication use's potential benefits and risks with their patients and monitor for any adverse effects. Regular follow-up appointments should be scheduled to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan. Ongoing support and education help patients manage FCH effectively and maintain their overall health.
