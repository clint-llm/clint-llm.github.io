Hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola may be observed in both genders. However, about 80% of the reported cases occur in females, mainly in the second or third decade of life. About 150 cases of hyperkeratosis of the nipple and/or areola have been reported to date. Nevertheless, the prevalence of this condition is likely underestimated because the skin lesions are usually asymptomatic and, subsequently there may not be sufficient motivation for affected persons to seek medical care.
