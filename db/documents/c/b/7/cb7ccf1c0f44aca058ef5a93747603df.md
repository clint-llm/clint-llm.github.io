Epiretinal membrane is a commonly occurring condition affecting the posterior pole of the retina over the macula. It appears as a greyish semi-translucent avascular membrane over the internal limiting membrane (ILM) on the surface of the retina. Etiology is unknown and can be seen as an idiopathic (IERM) condition or secondary to trauma, post intraocular surgery, chronic ocular diseases, etc. It progressively affects the central vision and causes metamorphopsia. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of the epiretinal membrane and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of the epiretinal membrane.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of the epiretinal membrane.
- List the management options available for the epiretinal membrane.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and improve outcomes in the management of the epiretinal membrane.
