Often the diagnosis is a clinical one. There is no specific lab test that will aid in the diagnosis of arterial air embolism. Laboratory testing should focus on the affected organ system or systems. Imaging studies can assist in the diagnosis, with CT being the most helpful. It can be challenging to obtain CT in these patients as they can require extensive resuscitation and stabilization before a definitive diagnosis.
