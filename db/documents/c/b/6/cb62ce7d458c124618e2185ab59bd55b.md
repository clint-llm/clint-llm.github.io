The current standard of care for autoimmune PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL)

**GM-CSF Replacement Therapy**

Clinical trials for GM-CSF replacement therapy were performed in the late 1990s

**Immunomodulation Therapy**

Systemic corticosteroids were trialed in autoimmune PAP but were ineffective, and they were found to increase the risk of pulmonary infections

The only proven therapy for secondary PAP is the treatment of the underlying disease

WLL may benefit patients with congenital PAP, but is not curative
