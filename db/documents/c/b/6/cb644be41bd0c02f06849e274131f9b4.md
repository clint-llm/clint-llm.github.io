Along with basic ophthalmologic operating room equipment, a microkeratome may be required depending on the technique. Donor tissue used for DSEK and DMEK may be prepared by the surgeon, usually on the day of surgery or obtained from an eye bank. Glide or mechanical injection devices for the insertion of grafts will be needed for DSEK. An intraocular lens injector may be used for DMEK graft insertion. A viscoelastic substance or air injection may be used for better visualization, and anterior chamber irrigation may be used to maintain anterior chamber depth.
