Even for the trained dental clinician, the discovery of a white lesion on the oral mucosa can be intimidating and a diagnostic challenge. If a white lesion is discovered during routine care by a provider, gathering a complete medical history is a critical first step. All lesions noted should be appropriately documented by the discovering physician. If the lesion can be attributed to an obvious source, subsequent follow-up is appropriate; however, if there is any doubt regarding the lesion's etiology or presentation, appropriate referral to a dental provider is warranted. It is important to include the patient's medical history and any pertinent clinical information to provide the dental provider as much information as possible to draw appropriate conclusions, and therefore an appropriate diagnosis and treatment regimen.
