Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIG) is a medication used to manage and treat Rh-negative pregnancies and immune thrombocytopenic purpura. It is in the immune globulin biological class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for RhIG as a valuable agent in managing RhIG in preventing hemolytic disease of the newborn and immune thrombocytopenic purpura and other disorders when applicable. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for healthcare team members in managing patients with Rh-negative pregnancies, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action and administration of Rho(D) immune globulin.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of Rho(D) immune globulin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring and toxicity of Rho(D) immune globulin.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring warfarin to improve patient outcomes for those receiving Rho(D) immune globulin.
