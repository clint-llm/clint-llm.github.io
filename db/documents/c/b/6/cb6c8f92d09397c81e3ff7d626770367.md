The primary management of patients with atlantoaxial instability is usually by the neurosurgeon. However, these patients are typically followed in the clinic by the primary care clinician (MD, DO, NP, or PA) or chiropractor. The treatment is tailored to each patient based on etiology and symptoms. The majority of asymptomatic patients need regular monitoring with imaging studies. Symptomatic patients usually undergo decompression and fusion for halting as well as reversing the neurological deficits governed by the AAI.

Given the involvement of various disciplines in discovering, diagnosing, and managing AAI, an interprofessional approach involving clinicians, nurses, surgeons, and therapists is crucial to patient success. All interprofessional team members need to follow the patient's status and progress regardless of the type of management. If they note any change in patient status, including worsening of symptoms or increased neurological symptoms, they must document their findings and immediately notify other team members so appropriate interventions can be implemented. Interprofessional coordination and communication will optimize patient outcomes in AAI cases. [Level 5]
