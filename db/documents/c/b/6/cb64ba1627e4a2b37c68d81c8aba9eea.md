The primary motor cortex is supplied primarily by the middle cerebral artery (MCA), along with the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The MCA supplies the area of the primary motor cortex that is responsible for the upper limbs and face, while the ACA supplies blood to the area that controls the lower limbs. As previously discussed, the upper motor neurons continue down as the pyramidal tract, which receives vascular supply from the lenticulostriate arteries. Once this tract reaches the brainstem, the paramedian branches of the basilar artery become the primary source of blood. At the caudal medulla level, the anterior spinal artery supplies most of the blood. This artery continues to provide blood to the lateral and anterior corticospinal tracts and anterior horn cells in the spinal cord.
