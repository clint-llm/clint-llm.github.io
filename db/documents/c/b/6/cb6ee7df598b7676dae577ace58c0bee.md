Diagnosis of MIS-C is based on the characteristic clinical presentation, history of exposure to COVID-19, and characteristic laboratory abnormalities. Exclusion of other diagnoses with similar presentation and evidence of COVID-19 exposure (prior maternal SARS-CoV-2 exposure, positive neonatal RT-PCR, or positive serology) is also essential while diagnosing MIS-C. The CDC and WHO have published criteria for diagnosing MIS-C in children. However, these criteria may not always be ideal for the neonatal population. Currently, there is no widely agreed definition for diagnosing MIS-C exclusively in neonates.

Laboratory findings may include the following:

- Leukocytosis or leukopenia, neutrophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia

- Elevation of inflammatory markers including C- reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin, interleukin-6 (IL-6)

- Elevation of cardiac markers such as troponin or Pro-BNP

- Coagulopathy as evidenced by prolonged prothrombin time, D-dimer elevation

- Hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia

- Elevated liver and renal function tests

- Metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate

Laboratory findings are variable, especially in the neonatal population. Therefore, high suspicion is required for the diagnosis of MIS-C in neonates. Laboratory work-up must be done in cases of suspected MIS-C to evaluate the degree of inflammation and end-organ dysfunction. Positive neonatal real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 can be considered evidence of prior COVID-19 exposure. A history of maternal SARS-CoV-2 exposure should be obtained in infants with negative testing.

To rule out cardiac dysfunction, an electrocardiogram and echocardiographic evaluation must be obtained in all neonates with suspected MIS-C.

A Chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) of the chest may show findings of pulmonary involvement, including interstitial pneumonia, pleural effusion, etc. The abdominal ultrasound should be done in infants with gastrointestinal symptoms to look for organomegaly and gall bladder hydrops and rule out other possible differential diagnoses—cases of neurological impairment warrants a brain ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.
