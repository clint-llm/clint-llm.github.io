Overall, cardiac amyloidosis is a rare disorder. The prevalence varies with the etiological type. About 10% of multiple myeloma cases may have AL amyloidosis, and 50 to 70% of these may have cardiac involvement. The annual incidence of AL amyloidosis is 1 per 100,000.

With more than 100 TTR genes responsible for the disease, the exact prevalence of familial (hereditary) amyloidosis is unknown. According to one study, the prevalence of one of the TTR genes V122I was 0.0173 in an African American cohort of 14 333.

Senile amyloidosis is the most prevalent type of cardiac amyloidosis, with an estimated prevalence of >10% in patients aged over 60 years being frequently diagnosed as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). At least 10% of patients with aortic stenosis may have ATTRw amyloidosis, and at least 10 to 15% of patients aged >65 years with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may have cardiac amyloidosis.

With improved survival and diagnostic rates, the prevalence of cardiac amyloidosis is higher than previously estimated. Over 12 years, the prevalence rate has increased from 8 to 17 per 100,000 person-years.
