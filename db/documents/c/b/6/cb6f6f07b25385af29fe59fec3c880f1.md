There are several factors that are integral to the initiation and maintenance of pacemaker mediated tachycardia:

- The pacemaker has to be in a pacing configuration where it senses the atrium and paces the ventricle (DDD or VAT mode). This is why this form of tachyarrhythmia does not happen in single-chamber pacemakers or with other pacing modes like VVI or AAI.

- There needs to be an event that dissociates the P wave from the QRS complex and triggers the tachycardia. In most instances, this is a premature ventricular contraction or premature atrial contractions, but it can also occur when there is an intermittent loss of atrial sensing or loss of atrial capture.

- There has to be retrograde conduction through either the AV node or an accessory pathway.

- The ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction needs to be long enough that it is able to be sensed by the atrial lead, meaning that it lasts beyond the atrial refractory period.
