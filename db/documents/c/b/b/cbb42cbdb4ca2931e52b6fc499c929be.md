While knee arthroplasty is done by the orthopedic surgeon, to ensure good outcomes an interprofessional team is required that includes a physical therapist, nurses, an internist, and the primary care provider. After surgery, the patients require physical therapy to regain muscle mass and joint function. In addition, for good outcomes, the patients need to exercise and maintain a healthy weight. Nurses should educate the patient on a healthy diet, avoidance of tobacco and taking part in regular exercise.
