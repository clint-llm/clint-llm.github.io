The process of development of teeth is a very complex process resulting from interactions between the ectoderm of the oral cavity, which gives rise to cells that produce enamel, and the neural crest ectomesenchyme which gives rise to the tooth structures other than enamel. At first, i.e., during the six weeks of intrauterine life, the tooth germ starts growing, and the cells forming the mineralized portion start differentiating. Thereafter, dentin and enamel matrices are laid down by these cells, which later start mineralizing. As the completed tooth erupts into the oral cavity, components of the periodontium, which includes periodontal ligament, cementum, and alveolar bone, start surrounding the root.
