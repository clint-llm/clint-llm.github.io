Dystrophin is a large cytoskeletal protein that facilitates interactions between the cytoskeleton, cell membrane, and extracellular matrix. It is located at the plasma membrane in both muscle and non-muscle tissues. Dystrophin is a critical part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which plays an important role as being a structural unit of muscle. In DMD, both dystrophin and DGC proteins are missing, leading to excessive membrane fragility and permeability, dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, oxidative damage. These factors play a crucial role in muscle cell necrosis. As patients with DMD age, the regenerative capacity of the muscles appears to be exhausted, and connective and adipose tissue gradually replaces muscle fibers.
