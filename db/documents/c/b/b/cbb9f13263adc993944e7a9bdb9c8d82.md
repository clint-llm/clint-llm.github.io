In DAA, the ascending aorta further divides into right and left transverse arches. The right transverse arch courses over the right mainstem bronchus, whereas the left aortic arch courses over the left mainstem bronchus. Because the aorta usually descends down towards the left side of the body, the right aortic arch goes posteriorly and insertsÂ into it. Further branches originate from the transverse arches: left common carotid and subclavian from the left aortic arch and the right common carotid and right subclavian from the right arch. The arterial duct is usually left-sided and generally inserts in the left transverse arch or descending aorta.

The vascular ring is formed when there is a failure of the regression or persistence of some part of the aortic arch.
