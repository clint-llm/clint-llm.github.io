Mycoplasma pneumoniae has multiple different manifestations dependent on site of infections, but it most commonly correlates with respiratory tract infection. Clinical presentation can vary from mild to severe illness often noted in children ages 5 to 14 years old. Symptoms are often gradual in onset and nonspecific.  Patients may present with fever, headache, sore throat, and cough.  On examination, patients present with a sore throat that rarely has exudates or lymphadenopathy. Upon auscultation, the patient may have variable findings dependent on the extent of infection. Rales and rhonchi (if the involvement is merely tracheobronchitis) or dullness with crackles (if pneumonia has developed) may be present on auscultation.  Often, patients have a long convalescence with a prolonged cough for up to 4 to 6 weeks.  Mycoplasma pneumoniae may with mucocutaneous eruptions related to erythema multiforme and Steven Johnson syndrome. Urticaria and anaphylactoid purpura are rare findings.

Urogenital infections caused by Ureaplasma species, Mycoplasma genitalium, and M. hominis may present with nongonococcal urethritis, dysuria, urgency, and urethral discharge in men. Many infected women are asymptomatic but may experience pelvic pain if pelvic inflammatory disease develops.
