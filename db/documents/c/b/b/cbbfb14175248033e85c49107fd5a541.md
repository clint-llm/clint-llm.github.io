Disasters, both natural and human-made, can occur at any timeÂ and have been increasing in frequency and number of victims. Planning and practicing for these events is a key factor for a favorable response. Since the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, there has been an improvement in disaster preparedness and recognition of the importance of including public health and health care professionals in the planning process. There has also been an increase in government involvement at the Federal, State, and local levels. Disasters can take many forms and require healthcare leadership to take an all-hazards approach. Good planning produces effective emergency operations and improves overall preparedness.
