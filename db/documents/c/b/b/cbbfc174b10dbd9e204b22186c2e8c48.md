**Infection**

Severe burn injuries result in impaired immune response related to a surge of cytokine inflammatory markers increasing the risk of infection. Wounds quickly become colonized with gram-positive organisms like Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis. Over the course of several days, intestinal microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli colonize the wounds. Systemic antibiotic therapy is not necessarily warranted for these microbe colonizations peri-operatively, although thorough wound cleansing with soap, water, normal saline, and/or chlorhexidine is advisable. Topical antibiotic therapy should be suitable for the perioperative period in the early phases of a burn. A conversation between the surgeon and anesthesiologist can minimize the overuse of antibiotics in this subset of patients.
