Alcohol-induced pancreatitis occurs in the setting of prolonged, chronic alcohol use, and its clinical features are similar to those of acute and chronic pancreatitis.

**Symptoms**

- Acute abdominal pain. Typically epigastric that radiates to the back.

- Of note, pain may be less abrupt and poorly localized in alcoholic pancreatitis versus gallstone-induced AP.

- Nausea or vomiting

- Anorexia

- Chronic pancreatitis may display the additional features of pancreatic insufficiency, including steatorrhea secondary to fat malabsorption and pancreatic diabetes secondary to endocrine cell destruction.

**Examination**

- May be normal

- Guarding

- Tenderness with peritonism

- Jaundice

- In severe cases, alcohol-induced pancreatitis may be classically associated with periumbilical or flank ecchymosis, also known as Cullen’s or Grey Turner’s signs respectively, and represent significant peritoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.

Severe presentations of AP may include peritonitis, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and/or shock.
