**Urine Testing**

- Urine should not be collected after the patient has been drinking a large amount of fluid, as a dilute specimen may result in a falsely negative test.

- Blood in the urine may cause a false positive test result.

**Serum Testing**

- Peripheral blood can be obtained for a serum hCG test.
