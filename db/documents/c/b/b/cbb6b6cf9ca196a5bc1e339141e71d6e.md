Psoriasis is recognized as the most prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory disease, involving skin and jointsÂ and associated with abnormalities of other systems. Plaque psoriasis is the commonest clinical type of psoriasis. Even though the condition is not life-threatening, it is difficult to treat and response rates vary widely.

Plaque psoriasis typically presents with large oval-circular plaques over the scalp, trunk and extensor body surface. The plaques have an extensive amount of scaling due to the hyperproliferation of the epidermal cells. Most patients have acute flares and relapses of plaque psoriasis, which may sometimes become severe and progress into the pustular subtype. At least 15% of patients with plaque psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis.
