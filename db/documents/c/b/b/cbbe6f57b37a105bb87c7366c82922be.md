Lovastatin is generally well tolerated with mild and transient adverse reactions. There are few report cases of severe adverse effects associated with lovastatin. Below are the reported side effects of the drug:

- Persistent elevation in serum AST and ALT (more than three times the upper limit of normal)

- Increased creatinine phosphokinase (CK) greater than two times normal

- Headaches, dizziness

- Skin rash

- Gastrointestinal symptoms such as flatulence, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia

- Myalgia, weakness, muscle cramps

- Blurry vision

Other serious adverse effects include diabetes mellitus, endocrine dysfunction, hepatotoxicity, and myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. Compared to other statins, lovastatin showed a non-significant upward trend in fasting blood glucose.

Lovastatin use requires caution in older patients since they are predisposed to myopathy. Surgical patients should discontinue Lovastatin for elective major surgery or any patients with conditions that may predispose them to renal failure (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, trauma, uncontrolled seizures). Lovastatin use in patients that have renal impairment and/or liver disease merits prescriber caution.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Drugs with strong CYP3A4 inhibition that can increase risks of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis: Itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone, and erythromycin.

- Other drugs that can increase the risk of myopathy if taken with lovastatin: cyclosporine, danazol, diltiazem, verapamil, amiodarone, colchicine, and ranolazine. In patients taking lovastatin concomitantly with danazol, diltiazem, dronedarone, or verapamil, lovastatin treatment should begin at 10 mg of and dose should not exceed 20 mg per day.

- Drugs to avoid when taking lovastatin: cyclosporine and gemfibrozil.

- Amiodarone:****In patients taking lovastatin and amiodarone concomitantly,  do not use more than 40 mg lovastatin per day as higher doses increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
