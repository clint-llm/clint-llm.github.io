Percussion of the chest is normally resonant. If there is a fluid build-up, it can become dull.

On auscultation, if there is wheezing, then this is due to bronchoconstriction (asthma). If there are crackles (rales), it is possibly due to pulmonary edema (congestive heart failure, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia). If there are rhonchi, then it is due to secretions in the larger airways, causing an obstruction (chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis).

When reading x-rays, the lungs are black because air is translucent. Pictures come out best when the patient is inhaling.

Thoracocentesis is a procedure that uses a needle to draw out fluid from the lung. It helps to determine the cause of a pleural effusion or abscess. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic (to relieve symptoms such as pain or shortness of breath).

Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lung and can cause pleural effusion. Patients may present with fever, cough, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
