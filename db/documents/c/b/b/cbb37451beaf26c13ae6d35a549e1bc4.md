The management of malignant hypertension requires an interprofessional team that includes an internist, nephrologist, cardiologist, and neurologist. Untreated, elevated blood pressure has high morbidity and mortality, including enormous healthcare costs. Therefore, the primary care providers, including the nurse practitioner, should regularly monitor blood pressure and emphasize medication compliance.

For asymptomatic patients, admission is not recommended. However, those with symptoms need to be monitored, and the specialists consulted to determine the presence of end-organ injury.

It is not recommended to decrease the BP too fast or too low, as ischemic damage can occur in vascular territories that have become habituated with the elevated level of BP. However, for the majority of hypertensive emergencies, mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be reduced by approximately 10% to 20% within the first hour and by another 5% to 15% over the next 24 hours.

All patients with hypertension should be encouraged to follow up in the outpatient clinic with a cardiology nurse. In addition, adherence to a low salt diet is beneficial. Finally, the interprofessional team members should continually encourage patients to remain compliant with their blood pressure medications and monitor their blood pressure at home.

**Outcomes**

The outcome for most patients with malignant hypertension in the short term is good, but in the long term, exacerbations are common. Strokes, vision loss, kidney damage, and adverse cardiac events are known to occur in a number of patients who are not compliant with therapy.
