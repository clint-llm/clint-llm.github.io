Critically ill patients receiving insulin aspart should have their glucose monitored every 1 to 2 hours. Non-critically ill patients using insulin aspart should monitor their blood glucose concentration routinely at home or in the hospital to assess the efficacy of the insulin dose. Preferably, this should be done either before a meal or 2 hours after a meal. Insulin doses should be adjusted based on the monitored blood glucose concentrations, generally a 105 to 20% adjustment in either direction. All patients on insulin therapy should receive biannual hemoglobin A1c monitoring and annual electrolyte monitoring. Hemoglobin A1c should be monitored quarterly in patients not meeting treatment goals or after changes in therapy.

According to the American Diabetes Association, monitoring goals include fasting blood glucose 80 to 130 mg/dL, peak postprandial (1 to 2 hours after a meal), blood glucose less than 180 mg/dL, and hemoglobin A1c less than less 7.0% for non-pregnant adult patients. Glycemic goals may change for individual patients based on the patient’s age, duration of diabetes mellitus, comorbid conditions, hypoglycemia unawareness, risks of hypoglycemic events, and other individual patient considerations, with less stringent goals for patients with more comorbid conditions or higher risk of harm in a hypoglycemic event.
