**N-Terminal Pro-BNP**

This is a peptide released by the left ventricular myocardium in response to elevated filling pressures and blood volumes. It is a very sensitive and specific marker of cardiogenic edema. High levels of Pro-BNP strongly suggest a cardiogenic cause while low levels can effectively rule out a cardiogenic cause; however intermediate values have little significance and require further investigation.

**Swanz-Ganz Catheter**

This is an invasive tool used to evaluate the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PWP). It entails the insertion a catheter from a peripheral access site to the pulmonary artery. A value greater than 18 mmHg is highly suggestive of a cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema as it corresponds to an elevated left atrial pressure.
