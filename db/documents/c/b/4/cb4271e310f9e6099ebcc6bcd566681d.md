The patient should provide their prior allergy history. Once the patient has such reactions, it is important to avoid such allergens to avoid further complications. Also, patients must be aware of the signs and symptoms of surgical suture hypersensitivity, such as erythema, swelling, nodular mass, extrusion of the suture through an incision, pruritus, edema, pain, seroma accumulation, and post-operative adhesions. The patient should be educated to contact the primary care team for proper complication management. Patient compliance with team recommendations for diets, follow-up, and wound care is essential for proper wound healing.
