Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Although penetrating trauma is less common than closed head trauma, it carries a worse prognosis. Most deaths from traumatic brain injury are due to firearm injuries. In the United States, approximately 20,000 gunshot injuries to the head occur annually.
