Plant alkaloids represent a widely diverse group of secondary plant metabolites found ubiquitously in nature and increasingly in households through indoor plants. The science of pharmacognosy has uncovered the equally diverse therapeutic potential of these phytochemicals. Conversely, they represent the toxic components of many of the well-known poisonous plants. Both humans and animals may be exposed to these phytotoxins and experience noxious consequences. The clinical effects that may ensue may range from ambiguous to illustrations of classic toxidromes. A thorough history and physical examination are foremost in identifying the diagnosis and thus in dictating management. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of plant alkaloid toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common etiologies of plant alkaloid toxicity and the major toxidromes they may produce.
- Summarize the approach to evaluating patients affected by plant alkaloid poisoning to guide management.
- Understand some of the complications that may result from these poisonings.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for individuals and communities affected by plant alkaloid toxicity.
