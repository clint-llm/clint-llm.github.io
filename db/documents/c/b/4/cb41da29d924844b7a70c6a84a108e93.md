Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and as a second-line treatment for narcolepsy in adults.

Children diagnosed with ADHD should be at least six years of age or older before being started on this medication. The treatment of both ADHD and narcolepsy have significantly better outcomes when used concurrently with nonpharmacologic therapies (i.e., social skills training in ADHD or sleep hygiene measures in narcolepsy).

Off-label uses of methylphenidate include treatment for fatigue in patients with cancer, refractory depression in the geriatric population, apathy in Alzheimer disease, and enhancing cognitive performance (e.g., memory).
