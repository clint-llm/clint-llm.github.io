Paradoxical Embolism can be difficult to diagnose and have an insidious onset.  Physicians should strongly suspect paradoxical embolism in patients with an embolic event with a non-identifiable source, such as atrial fibrillation, and when a concomitant intracardiac shunt or PAVM is known or suspected.

**Important Questions:**

- Evaluation of factors that lead to the event (ie: coughing or straining)

- Screening for HTN, DVT, CVD, DM, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and syncope.

- History of migraines (migraines occurs in up to 50% of patients with an intracardiac shunt).

- History of congenital heart disease, structural heart disease, or patent foramen ovale.

- Family history

- Social history, tobacco use.

**Physical Examination Findings:**

- Physicians should look for signs of congenital heart defects such as right ventricular hypertrophy, digital clubbing, or fixed S2 splitting.

- Full neurological evaluation (ie: speech or visual abnormality, unilateral weakness, seizures, and swallowing difficulties).

- Peripheral pulse evaluation and assessment for limb ischemia (ie: extremity involved may present with a sudden onset, be cold,  pulseless, and painful)
