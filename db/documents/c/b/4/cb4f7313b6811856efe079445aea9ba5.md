New more sensitive tests for HIV detection have been developed, and the diagnostic algorithm has been recently revised and updated. Initial diagnostic testing and screening should be done with antigen/antibody (4th gen) immunoassay that detects both HIV-1 and 2, as well as p24 antigen. This allows for earlier detection of infection by adding direct antigen testing to the initial screen (3rd generation immunoassays tested only for antibodies). A negative specimen does not require further testing. Patients with a positive test should be confirmed with an antibody immunoassay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 (as opposed to western blot). Positive tests define the diagnosis of HIV and subspecies. Patients that have a negative result or indeterminate in a confirmatory test should be tested with an HIV-1 NAT (nucleic acid testing). A positive test indicates acute HIV-1 infection. A negative test indicates a false positive result in initial testing and patient should be considered not infected. After confirmation of diagnosis and before initiation of treatment all patients should have a CD4 cell count, HIV RNA viral load, complete metabolic and blood count done, as well as genotypic resistance testing for the virus.
