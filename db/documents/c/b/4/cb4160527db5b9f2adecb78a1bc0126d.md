Diagnosis of PH is commonly delayed as the presenting symptoms overlap with other disease processes. Other conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis include, but are not limited to, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease,Â congenital heart disease, and pulmonary embolism.
