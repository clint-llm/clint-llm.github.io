Primary ossification of the ischium, ilium, pubis, and femoral shaft occurs in utero. Secondary ossification of the femur occurs at two ossification centers:

Proximal femoral epiphysis appears at age 4 to 8 months.

Trochanter appears at age 4.

The proximal femoral epiphyses fuse by 18 years of age, and the trochanteric apophyses fuse between 16 and 18 years of age. The proximal femoral epiphyses contribute significantly to metaphyseal growth of the femoral neck, whereas the trochanteric apophyses contribute largely to appositional growth of the greater trochanter.
