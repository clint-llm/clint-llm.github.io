As previously mentioned, peptides play an essential role in many physiological processes present throughout the body. The clinical significance peptides will be summarized below including some dermatologic disease states as well as therapeutic uses of peptides as imaging probes related to oncology for imaging and tumor targeting. Note that the information provided is concise and is not intended to represent all physiological processes that involve peptides.

**Wound repair**

Endogenous peptides also play a role in wound healing, and induction of mesenchymal cells to differentiate and promote bacteriolysis within the wound and facilitate healing. Antimicrobial peptides from within wound fluid induced by known as syndecan, a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan.

**Chronic Inflammatory Skin Conditions**

As mentioned previously, healthy skin can secrete AMPs to defend against surface attack, especially by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Where atopic dermatitis patients have suppression of AMPs leading to a further inflammatory, infectious state, patients with rosacea overexpress an anti-microbial peptide known as cathelicidin anti-microbial peptide (CAMP).

**Molecular Imaging and Tumor Targeting**

The mechanism of endogenousÂ peptide and specific receptor binding is principally the design for peptides acting as imaging probes and receptor-binding peptides for overexpressed receptors such as in cancer proliferation.

As biochemical sciences and therapeutic design continue to progress, peptide synthesis and design are heavily studied with implications for oncologic therapy as the pharmaceutical industry continues to shift more toward biologicals for new drug candidates.
