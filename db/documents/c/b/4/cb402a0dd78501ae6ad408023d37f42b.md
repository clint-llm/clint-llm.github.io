As with many disease states, a thorough history, and physical exam, with particular attention to the skin, is necessary for proper diagnosis. In addition, patients with suggestive skin lesions should have multiple biopsies performed at the edges of active lesions in order to increase diagnostic yield, as the histopathologic changes representative of necrolytic migratory erythema may only be focally present.

Among laboratory tests, a serum glucagon level is of paramount importance and will be highly elevated, often to levels greater than 1000 pg/nL (reference range is 50 to 200 pg/nL).

Other laboratory tests may be used to detect the presence of a neoplasm as the root cause of elevated glucagon. Serum chromogranin A levels may be measured, as this is a sensitive marker for glucagonoma.

Since glucagonoma syndrome may rarely be a part of MEN1, it is also important to screen for this disease if clinically suspected (specifically in younger patients), with serum levels of fasting insulin, calcium, parathyroid hormone, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and prolactin.

Imaging the abdomen is also indicated to help determine the presence of a tumor or metastases, as this helps guide treatment. A majority of glucagonomas, roughly 87%, are located in the pancreatic tail, as this is where the concentration of pancreatic islets is the highest.

One may also use selective angiography of the celiac axis to determine both the center of the neoplasm and the presence of hepatic metastases simultaneously. In fact, due to their relative hypervascularity, selective angiography of the celiac axis is the most reliable means of diagnosis and localization of glucagonoma in the face of unrevealing CT scans.

Lastly, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, classically with indium-111 octreotide (In-D-Phe1-octreotide), can be used for the detection of metastases, as nearly all glucagonomas reported in the literature have been somatostatin receptor positive.
