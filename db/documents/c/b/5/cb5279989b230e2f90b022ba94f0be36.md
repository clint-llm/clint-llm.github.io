Elevated levels of homocysteine can increase the risk of atherosclerosis by causing endothelial layer injury, promoting inflammation, and increasing oxidative stress.

There are multiple pathways to which elevated homocysteine levels can lead to schizophrenia. Elevated total homocysteine levels in the third trimester of pregnancy may cause subtle damage to the vasculature of the placenta, which can limit oxygen to the fetus and may have a direct effect on the brain structure of the fetus and thus increase the risk of developing schizophrenia.

The pathogenesis of hip fracture and elevated homocysteine levels is speculated to be due to homocysteine interference in collagen cross-linking, which alters the bone matrix and increases the fragility of the bones.
