The brachialis often has dual innervation, being innervated medially by the musculocutaneous nerve and laterally by the radial nerve.

The musculocutaneous nerve passes between the biceps and brachialis muscles, wherein the terminal branch of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve emerges. The radial nerve passes between the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles in the lateral arm after spiraling and emerging from the spiral groove of the humerus.
