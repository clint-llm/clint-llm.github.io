Knowledge of both the systemic and renal-specific causes of nephrocalcinosis is required as it will help to identify the primary lesion, whether it is genetic or acquired. It is vital to determine the underlying etiology for the nephrocalcinosis as only some causes will lead to chronic kidney disease and subsequently end-stage renal failure. Co-ordination between pediatrics, internal medicine and nephrology is needed to diagnose the primary etiology for early management.
