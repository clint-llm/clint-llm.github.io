The most common species responsible for infections are A. fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus terreus.

A. fumigatus is a fungus from the family of Trichocomaceae. First described by Fresenius in 1863, it is known to have a stable haploid genome of 29.4 million base pairs.

The life cycle outside of the human host is characterized by asexual reproduction which proceeds conidiophores, structures where the infectious form known as conidia, are produced and released into the air. Conidia are responsible for fungal dispersion and preserving the fungi genome under adverse conditions.
