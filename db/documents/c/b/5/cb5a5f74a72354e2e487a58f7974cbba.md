Rheumatoid arthritis has no cure and is a progressive disease associated with morbidity and increased mortality. All individualsÂ will experience multiple exacerbations and, without treatment, tend to have poor outcomes with disability and increased mortality.

Patients with RA also develop other chronic medical conditions/complications which drastically affect their outcomes. The most notable of this correlation is the relationship between RA and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease leading to accelerated coronary artery disease.
