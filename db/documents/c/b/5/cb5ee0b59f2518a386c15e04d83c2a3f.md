Patients with IAN and/or LN injury typically present with chief complaints of altered sensation in the lower lip, chin, mandibular teeth, gingiva, and tongue. Specifically, with LN injury, patients are likely to also report altered taste on the ipsilateral anterior tongue due to concomitant chorda tympani damage. The ability to move the tongue and lower face should remain intact though, as the hypoglossal and facial nerves are responsible for motor innervation of these areas. That said, a change in the ability to feel in the region can interfere with numerous daily activities such as speech, eating, drinking, kissing, applying makeup, and shaving.

The quality and the extent of altered sensations vary substantially among patients, who may experience paresthesias, hypo/anesthesia, and dysesthesia.
