Like with any trauma or critical patient, two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters should be placed immediately, preferably through unburned skin; intravenous catheters can be placed through burned skin if needed. Peripheral intravenous access is the most efficient and least invasive way to administer high fluid volumes when patients arrive at emergency department rooms.

If peripheral access is unattainable, central venous catheterization or an interosseous line must be considered. A critical yet sometimes forgotten concept is that all burn patients are trauma patients; they may have additional injuries contributing to their presentation. Hypotension is often a late finding in burn shock. If a patient arrives hypotensive, consider other traumatic causes of low blood pressure, such as hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, neurogenic shock, and internal abdominal and pelvic bleeding.
