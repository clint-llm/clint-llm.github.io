Before the advent ofÂ closed-chest compressions, surgeons routinely performed open cardiac massage. Some studies have suggested that open cardiac massage may be a more efficient method of maintaining circulation during cardiac arrest compared to closed cardiac compressions. Recent data on open chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation are lacking. A study published in 1953 demonstrated a recovery rate of 28%.

Another recent study was identified, which described an alternative approach to performing open cardiac massage via a transdiaphragmatic approach.
