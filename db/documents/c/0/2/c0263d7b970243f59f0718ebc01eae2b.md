SchizencephalyÂ is a rare congenital neuronal migration disorder.

- Type I (closed-lip) can be asymptomatic or diagnosed in adult patients.

- Type II (open lip) is a severe malformation that can manifest by refractory epilepsy, intellectual disability, and varying degrees of paralysis from hemiparesis to quadriparesis.

- Possible etiological factors include teratogenic exposures, viral exposures, genetic mutations, and intrauterine fetal stroke.

Risk factors of schizencephaly include young maternal age and the illicit use of alcohol and narcotic substances.

The diagnostic method of choice for imaging schizencephaly is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The therapeutic management of both types of schizencephaly is conservative.

Surgical treatment is undertaken in some cases with concomitant hydrocephalus or intracranial hypertension.
