The incidence of Menkes disease is close to 1 in 35,000 live male births.

There is no racial or ethnic predilection found for Menkes kinky hair disease. The genetic theory proposes that one-third of cases with Menkes kinky hair disease exhibit new mutations. These de novo mutations can occur anywhere independent of race or ethnicity.

Menkes kinky hair disease occurs in males almost exclusively due to the X-linked recessive trait. Females are carriers and usually do not manifest symptoms unless there are unusual genetic circumstances.

Patients with Menkes kinky hair disease present between six to eight weeks after birth when parents notice delayed development or the look of an unusual eye or unusual limb movements indicative of seizure activity.
