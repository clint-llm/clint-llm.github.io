Tuberculosis (TB) is a human disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It mainly affects the lungs, making pulmonary disease the most common presentation. Other commonly affected organ systems include the respiratory system, the gastrointestinal (GI) system, the lymphoreticular system, the skin, the central nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, the reproductive system, and the liver. In the past few decades, there has been a concerted global effort to eradicate tuberculosis. Despite the gains in tuberculosis control and the decline in both new cases and mortality, it still accounts for a huge burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tuberculosis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of tuberculosis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with tuberculosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for tuberculosis.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with tuberculosis.
