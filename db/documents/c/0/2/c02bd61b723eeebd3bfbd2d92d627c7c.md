The human brain has a confluence of cholinergic neurons that project to various cortical areas. These neurons control attention, thinking, and processing of stimuli. Not only do cholinergic neurons span the forebrain, but they also encompass the brainstem and thalamus (such as the reticular nucleus), which are responsible for consciousness and attention. In the context of Alzheimer dementia as a neurodegenerative disease, these cholinergic neurons have defective projections that correlate with the classic symptoms of cognitive slowing and decline.
