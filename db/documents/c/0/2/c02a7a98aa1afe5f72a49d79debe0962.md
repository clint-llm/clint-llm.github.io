There is no currently available disease-modifying therapy for Canavan disease. Management aims to maintain nutrition and hydration, protect the airways, prevent seizures, minimize the risk of contractures, and cure infections. An assessment of the patient's nutritional and developmental status is recommended for guiding the management.

A feeding gastrostomy tube is typically used to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration in the presence of dysphagia. A gastrostomy tube can also decrease the risk of aspiration due to the patient's lack of sound reflexes.

Seizures are managed with standard antiepileptic drugs. Physical therapy and position changes are helpful to reduce the risk of contractures and ulcers. They also help improve the patient's sitting posture. Botulinum toxin injections can be employed to treat spasticity. Special education programs and interventions can be considered.
