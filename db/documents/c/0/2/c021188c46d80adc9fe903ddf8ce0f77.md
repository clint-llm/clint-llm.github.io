Lamotrigine dosing requires alteration if given concurrently with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin, lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir, ritonavir, and valproic acid.

If it is necessary to discontinue lamotrigine, it should be done in a step-wise fashion over two weeks, if possible. There is a possibility of withdrawal seizures when discontinuing lamotrigine, which lessens if the drug is tapered rather than stopped quickly.

**Renal and Hepatic Dosing:**

In cases of renal impairment, the immediate-release formulation dose should be reduced by 25% if CrCl is between 10 and 50. If Creatinine clearance is below 10, the maximum dosing is 100 mg every other day. For hemodialysis patients, dosing is 100 mg for a single dose after each dialysis with no supplement. For patients on peritoneal dialysis, dosing is 100 mg every other day. For the extended-release formulation, clinicians are advised to reduce the usual dose in instances of significant renal impairment.

For hepatic impairment, dosing should reduce the dose by 25% in severe impairment; if theÂ patient has severe impairment with ascites, the dose reduction is 50%.
