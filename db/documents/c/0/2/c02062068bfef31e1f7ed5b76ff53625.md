The prognosis of CAP depends on the severity. Ellis types I and II are conservatively managed, and most of the patients end up in spontaneous resolution or develop pseudoaneurysms. However, smaller portions develop delayed pericardial effusions and hence the necessity of serial echocardiography for the first 48 hours after diagnosing CAP. Ellis type III has a high mortality rate if ensuing cardiac tamponade is not taken care of by the above measures.
