The clinical management and prognosis of infants with birth injuries vary widely depending on the injury's type and severity. The common sites for birth trauma can include the head, neck, and shoulders. Other less common locations include the face, abdomen, and lower limbs. A summary of the common traumatic clinical conditions occurring related to birth is listed below.

**Head Trauma**

Head trauma can include superficial lesions, extracranial and intracranial hemorrhages, and fractures of the skull bones.

**Caput Succedaneum:**Caput succedaneum is a common scalp swelling in newborns. It is a subcutaneous swelling and edema of the scalp between the skin and the periosteum due to local venous congestion from the birth canal's pressure on the presenting part. The edema is above the plane of the periosteum, and hence the scalp swelling crosses suture lines. No intervention is required, and it typically resolves over the first few postnatal days. Rare complications include bruising of the skin over the swelling with necrosis resulting in scarring and alopecia, and rarely systemic infection.

**Skull Fractures:**Skull fractures from birth trauma are most often a result of instrumented vaginal delivery. These fractures could be linear or depressed and are usually asymptomatic unless associated with an intracranial injury. Plain film radiographs of the skull usually clarify the diagnosis. Still, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is recommended if there is suspicion of intracranial injury or neurologic symptoms.

**Extracranial Hemorrhages:**

**Cephalohematoma:**Cephalohematoma is a localized sub-periosteal collection of blood resulting from the rupture of blood vessels traversing from the skull to the periosteum. Limited by the periosteal attachment to the underlying skull bones, the swelling does not cross suture lines and is often unilateral. It is more common in deliveries involving vacuum or forceps and occurs in up to 2.5% of all deliveries.

**Subgaleal hemorrhage:**subgaleal hemorrhage is a collection of blood in the loose areolar tissue space between the galea aponeurotica and the skull's periosteum. The injury occurs when traction pulls the scalp away from the stationary bony calvarium, resulting in the shearing or severing of the bridging vessels. A difficult vaginal delivery resulting in the use of forceps or vacuum is the most common predisposing event in the formation of subgaleal hemorrhage. It has been estimated to occur in 4 of 10000 spontaneous vaginal deliveries and 59 of 10000 vacuum-assisted deliveries.

**Intracranial Hemorrhages:**

Traumatic intracranial hemorrhages include epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and less frequently intracerebral and intracerebellar hemorrhages.

**Epidural hemorrhage**is rare in neonates and usually accompanies linear skull fractures in the parietal-temporal region following an operative delivery. Signs include bulging fontanelle, bradycardia, hypertension, irritability, altered consciousness, hypotonia, seizures. Diagnosis is via CT or MRI of the head, which shows a convex appearance of blood collection in the epidural space. Prompt neurosurgical intervention is necessary due to the potential to deteriorate rapidly.

**Subdural Hemorrhage**is the most common type of intracranial hemorrhage in neonates. Operative vaginal delivery is a major risk factor, and hemorrhage over the cerebral convexities is the most common site. Presenting signs/symptoms include bulging fontanelle, altered consciousness, irritability, respiratory depression, apnea, bradycardia, altered tone, and seizures. Subdural hemorrhages can occasionally be found incidentally in asymptomatic neonates. Management depends on the location and extent of the bleeding. Surgical evacuation is reserved for extensive hemorrhages causing raised intracranial pressure and associated clinical signs.

**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**is the second most common type of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage and is usually the result of the rupture of bridging veins in the subarachnoid space. Operative vaginal delivery is a risk factor, and the infants are typically asymptomatic unless the hemorrhage is extensive. Ruptured vascular malformations are a rare cause of subarachnoid hemorrhages, even in the neonatal population. Treatment is usually conservative.

**Intraventricular hemorrhage**even though most commonly seen in premature infants, can also occur in term infants depending on the nature and extent of the birth injury.

**Intracerebral and intracerebellar hemorrhages**are less common and occur as a result of occipital diastasis.

**Cranial Nerve injuries:**

**Facial nerve:**Facial nerve is the most common cranial nerve-injured with a traumatic birth. It occurs in up to 10 per 1000 live births and is usually a result of pressure on the facial nerve by forceps or from a prominent maternal sacral promontory during descent. Clinical manifestations include diminished movement or loss of motion on the affected side of the face. Facial nerve palsy requires differentiation from asymmetric crying facies, which results from congenital hypoplasia of the depressor anguli oris muscle and causes a localized movement abnormality of the corner of the mouth. Although forceps delivery has a strong association, facial palsy can occur in the newborn without apparent trauma.

**Peripheral Nerve and Spinal Cord Injuries**

**Brachial plexus injuries:**These occur in up to 2.5 per 1000 live births and result from stretching of the cervical nerve roots during the process of delivery. These injuries are usually unilateral, and risk factors include macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, difficult delivery, breech position, multiparity, and assisted deliveries.

- Injury involving the fifth and sixth cervical nerve roots results in Erbs-Duchenne palsy manifested by the upper arm's weakness. Adduction and internal rotation of the arm with flexion of the fingers are presenting symptoms; this is by far the most common form of brachial plexus injury.

- Injury to the eighth cervical and first thoracic nerves results in Klumpke's palsy manifested by paralysis of the hand's muscles, absent grasp reflex, and sensory impairment along the ulnar side of the forearm and arm.

- Injury to all the nerve roots can result in total arm paralysis.

- Injury to the phrenic nerve can be an associated feature of brachial palsy. Clinical manifestations include tachypnea with asymmetric chest motion and diminished breath sounds on the affected side.

The majority of brachial plexus injuries are stretch injuries, and treatment is conservative, with physical therapy playing a major role in the return of gradual function.

**Spinal cord:**Spinal cord injuries are infrequent in the neonatal period and are usually a result of excessive traction or rotation of the spinal cord during extraction.

**Skeletal injuries:**

Most of the fractures resulting from birth trauma are associated with difficult extractions or abnormal presentations. Clavicular fractures are the most common bone fracture during delivery and can occur in up to 15 per 1000 live births. The clinical presentation is significant for crepitus at the site of fracture, tenderness, and decreased movement of the affected arm with an asymmetric Moro reflex. Clavicular fractures have a good prognosis with spontaneous healing occurring in the majority of infants. The humerus is the most common long bone to fracture during birth, which can be associated with a brachial plexus injury. The clinical presentation could be similar to a clavicular fracture with an asymmetric Moro reflex, inability to move the affected arm. Also, a significant deformity might be noted on the affected arm with swelling and tenderness at the fracture site. Rare conditions may involve a distal humeral epiphyseal separation due to birth trauma requiring expert orthopedic intervention.

**Facial injuries:**

**Ocular injuries:**Subconjunctival hemorrhages (SCH) are superficial hematomas seen under the bulbar conjunctiva, commonly seen in infants born after going through labor. It is suggested to be due to ruptured subconjunctival capillaries from venous congestion, occurring from increased back pressure in the head and neck veins. This injury can result from either a nuchal cord or increased abdominal or thoracic compression during uterine contractions.

**Soft tissue injuries:**

Soft tissue injuries resulting from birth trauma include petechiae, bruising, ecchymoses, lacerations, and subcutaneous fat necrosis. Subcutaneous fat necrosis is thought to result from ischemic injury to the adipose tissue and characterized by palpation of soft, indurated nodules in the subcutaneous plane. These lesions resolve gradually over a few weeks. Hypercalcemia is one of the complications; therefore, it is recommended to monitor serum calcium.

**Visceral injuries:**

Birth trauma resulting in abdominal visceral injuries is uncommon and primarily consists of hemorrhage into the liver, spleen, or adrenal gland. The clinical presentation depends on the volume of blood loss and can include pallor, bluish discoloration of the abdomen, distension of the abdomen, and shock. Treatment is supportive with volume resuscitation and surgical intervention if needed.
