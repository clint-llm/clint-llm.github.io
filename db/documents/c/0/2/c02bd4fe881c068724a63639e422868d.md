Chlorhexidine Gluconate: According to product labeling, chlorhexidine gluconate (4%) may cause serious injury if placed or kept in the eye during surgical procedures or cause deafness when instilled in the middle ear through perforated eardrums. In case of accidental exposure, wash the contact area thoroughly with water.

Povidone-iodine: Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported with exposure to povidone-iodine.

Hexachlorophene: The Key Potentially Inappropriate Drugs in Pediatrics (KIDs) List includes hexachlorophene because of strong evidence of neurotoxicity.

Isopropyl Alcohol: The significant features of severe poisoning with isopropyl alcohol are CNS, respiratory depression, and circulatory collapse. The most common metabolic effects are an increased osmol gap, ketonemia, and ketonuria. Diagnosis is confirmed based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and laboratory investigations. Supportive care is the mainstay of management, emphasizing respiratory and cardiovascular support. Hemodialysis enhances the elimination of isopropyl alcohol and should be considered in severe poisoning.
