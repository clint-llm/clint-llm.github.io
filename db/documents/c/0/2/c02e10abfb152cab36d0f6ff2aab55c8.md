ARMD is one of the leading causes of blindness in the elderly population. Interprofessional communication and coordination are important in screening for this disease. People above the age of 50 years should undergo an eye evaluation by an ophthalmologist to rule out the presence of ARMD. Physicians should recommend an eye examination for their elderly patients. This is important, especially in recognizing patients with early ARMD, as these patients are often asymptomatic.

The aim is to educate the patient regarding the need for regular follow up and the benefits of timely intervention. Similarly, physicians may refer patients with poor vision to an ophthalmologist as these patients can benefit from low vision aids. Patients with ARMD and poor vision can be given wrist bands which mention the condition of the patient so that people around them can be careful and prevent them from falling and from other such accidents. ARMD can be managed appropriately if recognized timely and treated sincerely. Intravitreal injections are the standard of care for these patients. The cause-effect relationship of systemic side effects and these drugs is not well established.
