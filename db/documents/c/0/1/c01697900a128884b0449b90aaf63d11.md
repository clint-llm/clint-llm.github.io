Macular edema is a non-specific sign or sequelae for a myriad of intraocular and systemic diseases, which leads to significant visual loss. It is important to recognize the cause of visual loss as it may be the presenting sign of a number of systemic diseases. Also, timely intervention is necessary to prevent permanent visual loss. This CME activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of macular edema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various systemic and ocular diseases associated with macular edema.
- Summarise the basic mechanisms responsible for causing macular edema.
- Review the various modalities used for investigating macular edema.
- Outline the various treatment modalities used for managing macular edema by an interprofessional team.
