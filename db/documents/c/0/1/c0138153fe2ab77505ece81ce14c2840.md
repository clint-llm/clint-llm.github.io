Osteoporotic compression fractures are the most common fragility fractures seen today. Osteoporotic individuals may suffer a vertebral compression fracture as a result of seemingly insignificant trauma, for example, sitting down abruptly. In younger individuals, a higher-energy, axial loading force would be needed to compress the cancellous bone of the vertebral body. Non-osteoporotic lumbar compression fractures are typically seen in car accidents and fall or jump from a height. Infectious and malignant processes that weaken vertebrae can also lead to an eventual compression fracture.

These can cause significant physical limitations, including back pain, and functional disability.
