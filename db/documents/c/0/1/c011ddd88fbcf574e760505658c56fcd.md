Erysipelas is commonly encountered by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. The diagnosis in most cases is clinical but if there is any doubt, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist. The infection does respond to antibiotics and patients are usually managed as outpatients. Hospitalization is recommended for concern of necrotizing infection, the immunocompromised, patients with poor adherence to medications and follow up, and for those whose outpatient treatment is failing. An infectious disease or wound care nurse should follow these patients to ensure cure. Those who undergo surgery for an abscess or gangrene may require long term wound care. The pharmacist should encourage medication compliance. The team should communicate with each other to ensure that the patient is responding to therapy.

The outcomes for patients with erysipelas are good as long as they remain compliant with antibiotic treatment.
