AL amyloidosis: This disease is treated most likely in the framework of clinical trials and depending on the risk stratification according to the Standard Mayo Clinic staging system.

- Low-risk patients (NT-proBNP less than 5000 ng/L, troponins of less than 0.06 ng/ml, eGFR more than 50 ml/min per 1.73m, age less than 65 years, performance status of 0-2, NYHA class less than III, ejection fraction above 45%, systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg standing and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) above 90%). Low-risk patients receive autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) with Melphalan 200mg/m2. Induction with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone should be considered if the bone marrow, plasma cell infiltration is more than 10% or if a patient refuses transplant. Post-transplant treatment with bortezomib increases the complete response (CR) rates, and if CR is not achieved, bortezomib and dexamethasone combination should be given.

- Intermediate risk patients (ineligible for ASCT and stage I-IIIa): Melphalan and Dexamethasone are the preferred regimens especially in the case of neuropathy or t(11;14) translocation. Cyclophosphamide with Bortezomib and dexamethasone combination is a stem cell sparing regimen preferred in patients with renal failure and with 1q21 gain. If noninvolved Free Light Chains (FLC) is above 180 mg/l, the preferred regimen is bortezomib, melphalan, and dexamethasone combination.

- High-risk patients (stage IIIb, NYHA class III or above): bortezomib can be preferred due to a rapid onset of action or low-dose combination regimens are preferred as well.

ATTR amyloidosis: Transthyretin is a protein predominantly synthesized in the liver. Upon liver transplant, mutant transthyretin disappeared from blood and neuropathy improvement was observed.

Supportive therapy: The treatment of systemic amyloidosis involves supportive therapy aiming to maintain the quality of life and prevent organ dysfunction. If patients are on a heart transplant waiting list, they should receive low-dose chemotherapy due to increased survival.

Splenectomy: An option with proper prior vaccination when there is severe factor-X deficiency leading to bleeding diathesis. Factor X deficiency is seen in 2.5% of patients with AL amyloidosis. Splenectomy is effective in patients who have splenomegaly, but not usually in patients with a normal size spleen.
