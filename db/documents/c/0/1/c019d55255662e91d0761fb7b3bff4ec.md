An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. If magnesium toxicity occurs, the role of prompt treatment cannot be undermined. The patient is to be stabilized as early as possible and subsequently monitored closely. Major complications associated with magnesium toxicity can be avoided if the interprofessional team can promptly diagnose and treat this disease.

Collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication are key elements for a positive outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities.
