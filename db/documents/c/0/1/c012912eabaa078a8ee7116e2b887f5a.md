**Tuning Fork Tests**

The Rinne and Weber tests are designed to stimulate bone conduction and are used as a part of the initial evaluation of hearing loss. They are screening tests and are not considered to replace formal audiometry.

The Weber test is performed by placing the vibrating tuning fork equidistant from both ears on either the vertex, forehead, bridge of the nose, or chin and asking the patient if the sound is heard loudest in one ear or equally in both ears.

The Rinne test differentiates between sound transmission by AC and sound transmission by bone conduction. The Rinne test is performed by placing the vibrating tuning fork onto the mastoid process and then asking the patient to report when they can no longer hear the sound. Once the patient can no longer hear the sound, the vibrating tuning fork is immediately moved adjacent to the ear canal about 3 cm from the ear, and the patient is again asked to report when they can no longer hear the sound. A normal finding – termed a “positive Rinne test” – indicates AC is perceived more than bone conduction. In this case, the patient can hear the tuning fork adjacent to the ear canal for a longer duration than when they heard the sound over their mastoid process. An abnormal finding of the Rinne test – termed a “negative Rinne test” – suggests BC is perceived more than AC. In this case, the patient cannot hear or can only faintly hear the tuning fork after it is moved from the mastoid process to the air adjacent to the ear canal.

**Pure Tone Audiometry**

Pure tone audiometry (PTA) is performed by producing a tone with a controlled frequency and recording the lowest sound intensity in decibels (dB) at which the tone can be perceived half of the time. This value is referred to as the threshold and is used to compare a patient’s hearing acuity with that of an average population. Thresholds are measured for a set of frequencies, typically ranging from 250 to 8000 hertz (Hz). The results are recorded on a graph known as an audiogram, which ordinarily displays hearing threshold level on the y-axis and frequency on the x-axis (see figure).

Although audiometry is sometimes performed solely using earphones, which rely largely on AC, bone conduction can also be evaluated during audiometry and is an essential component of a true comprehensive audiogram. This is accomplished by positioning an oscillator on the patient’s mastoid process and measuring threshold values for the same frequencies used in AC testing. In this manner, bone conduction can be compared with AC graphically, illustrating what is referred to as an air-bone gap to document differences in AC vs. BC. Frequently, results from the right ear are plotted as an “O” for AC thresholds and an “<” for BC thresholds, while results from the left ear are plotted as an “X” for AC thresholds and an “>” for BC thresholds.

Often, the non-test ear is intentionally exposed to a masking frequency that is out of phase from the tone generated by the oscillator in the test ear, thus creating a noise-canceling effect. This masking technique is intended to prevent the sound of the oscillator from being perceived by the non-test ear, which would skew test results, especially if the non-test ear has better acuity – and thus a lower threshold – at certain frequencies than the test ear.

**Auditory Brainstem Response**

PTA is referred to as a behavioral hearing test because it is based on the subjective perception of tones reported by the patient. Auditory brainstem response (ABR), also referred to as brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), on the other hand, is a method that relies solely on objective measures to evaluate the function of auditory pathways to the level of the mesencephalon of the brainstem.

Electrical signals produced by hair cell vibration ascend to the auditory cortex via several nuclei, including first the cochlear nuclei, then the medial geniculate nuclei, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculi, and superior olivary complex. Potentials generated by these signals are recorded by electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp, ears, and forehead.

As an objective testing method, ABR testing has the advantage of being useful in evaluating hearing in infants, young children, and other patients with limited ability to communicate. As with PTA, ABR testing is usually performed with earphones, thus involving AC through the transformation of mechanical vibration in the ear canal into bioelectrical signals via cochlear hair cells. However, because both AC and bone conduction result in stimulation of the cochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), BC can also be evaluated in the stimulation of ABR. Evaluating bone conduction in this manner is accomplished by using an oscillator in contact with the mastoid process or other bony structures of the skull.
