The presentation of ACS varies between pediatric and adult patients. Pediatric patients are more likely to have an infectious cause and will therefore present with symptoms such as wheezing, cough, increased work of breathing, and fever. Adult patients are more likely to present with chest pain, pain in the arms and legs, shortness of breath, or a vaso-occlusive crisis elsewhere in the body (e.g., priapism).
