Intermittent claudication (IC) typically refers to lower extremity skeletal muscle pain that occurs during exercise. IC presents when there is insufficient oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic requirements of the skeletal muscles. IC is a common manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which includes atherosclerotic stenosis of arteries in the extremities. IC is commonly localized to the thigh, hip, buttock, and calf muscles. Pain within these muscle groups is reproducibly induced by walking and relieved with rest. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of intermittent claudication and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for intermittent claudication.
- Recall the evaluation of a patient with intermittent claudication.
- Summarize the treatment options for intermittent claudication.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by intermittent claudication.
