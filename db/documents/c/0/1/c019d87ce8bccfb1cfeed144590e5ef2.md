A posterior surgical approach to the knee is utilized in several situations. Knowledge of anatomy and the possible variations of the popliteal artery and its branches is vital in preserving blood flow to the knee and lower leg.

A recent meta-analysis study (14 research studies) demonstrated how endovascular popliteal artery aneurysm repair is a procedure without significant complications and with a relatively short length of hospital stay.

Another recent 5-year study showed that popliteal artery surgery in case of entrapment is satisfactory from a clinical and functional point of view.
