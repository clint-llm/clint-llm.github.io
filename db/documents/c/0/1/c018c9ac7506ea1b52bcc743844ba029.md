Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) are serum markers that can become elevated in some forms of auto-immune disease. They are typically associatedÂ with auto-immune hepatitis but may also increase in primary sclerosing cholangitis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The antibodies direct themselves against actin, troponin, and tropomyosin.
