Although prevalence data is scarce, carotenemia is not an uncommon presentation to pediatricians and family physicians. A Sri Lankan study found a prevalence of carotenemia of 2% among 615 children on a high carotenoid-containing diet.

Another study reported a much higher prevalence (approximately 22%) of carotenemia among children with mental disabilities. The authors commented it might be due to the different modes and types of feeding they received compared to healthy children.
