Allergic reactions such as anaphylactoid reactions and urticaria have occurred in patients receiving both oral and parenteral leucovorin.

Leucovorin enhances the effects of 5-fluorouracil and may cause toxicity.

Folic acid in large quantities has been shown to counteract the pharmacological actions of antiepileptics such as primidone, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.

When leucovorin has been used concomitantly during the treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), higher rates of treatment failure and morbidity have been reported.

The effects of leucovorin in pregnancy have not been the object of study. Leucovorin was a category C drug under the prior FDA system for categorizing medications in pregnancy. It is not known whether leucovorin gets excreted in breast milk. Caution is necessary when treating patients that are nursing with leucovorin as it may get excreted in breast milk.
