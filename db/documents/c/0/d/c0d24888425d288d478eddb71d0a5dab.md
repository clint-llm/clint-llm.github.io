The mainstay management of ileus is prevention, followed by appropriate diagnosis, and conservative/expectant management.Â At times this can be difficult and often requires all aspects of the healthcare system to participate in its prevention. Encouraging ambulation, multimodal pain regimens, ERAS protocols, and monitoring oral intake all are difficult for any person/team to monitor.

- Level 1- post-op analgesia with epidural catheter

- Level 1 - post-op gum-chewing is beneficial

- Level 1 - prokinetic drugs (neostigmine, metoclopramide, erythromycin) or laxatives are not effective once ileus is diagnosed

- Level 2 - adding peripheral opioid antagonist (naloxone)

- Level 5 - treatment consists of ambulation/mobilization, stopping opioids, TPN if oral intake is insufficient for seven days
