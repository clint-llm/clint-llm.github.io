When considering management for T2DM, primary interventions should be lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction. First-line monotherapy should be metformin or sulfonylureas due to their favorable side effect profiles. However, TZDs may be used as monotherapy or as combination therapy when first-line medications are contraindicated. TZDs may be necessary for high-risk hypoglycemic patients; however, the contraindications require evaluation before starting treatment.

There are several contraindications for using thiazolidinediones, including:

- Heart failure (New York Heart Association class III, IV): The American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association has stated that patients with New York Heart Association class III, IV symptomatic heart failure should use TZD at the lowest possible dose or not at all due to risk of fluid retention and diastolic heart dysfunction.

- Moderate to severe hepatic impairment: Troglitazone was removed from the market due to hepatoxicity. While rosiglitazone or pioglitazone have not shown the same hepatotoxic effects, the recommendation is still that patients undergo baseline and periodic monitoring of liver function. Patients with AST or ALT greater than or equal to 3 times the upper reference limit should discontinue TZD therapy.

- Bladder cancer: Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer. In patients with a history of bladder cancer, the risk of recurrence versus the benefits of glycemic control shouldÂ merit consideration before starting pioglitazone treatment. Rosiglitazone has not shown similar risks of bladder cancer.

- Pregnancy: The FDA labels TZDs as pregnancy class C with teratogenic potential, as PPAR-gamma is necessary for terminal differentiation of the trophoblast and placental vascularization. Pregnant patients should switch to another insulin sensitizer, such as metformin.

- High risk of fractures: Due to increased fracture risk, patients who are at a high risk of fractures, such as those with a history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal women, or patients taking other medications that increase fracture risk (such as glucocorticoids and PPIs), should not start on TZD therapy.

- Cytochromes CYP 2C8 and CYP 3A4 are necessary for the metabolism of TZDs; therefore, cytochrome inducers and inhibitors should be used with caution as these medications may affect the drug plasma levels of TZDs.
