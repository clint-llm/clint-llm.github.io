The threeÂ toxicokinetic phases of thallium are as follows:

- **Intravascular Distribution Phase:**During the first 4 hours post-exposure, thallium is distributed to organs via the blood.

- **CNS Distribution Phase:**During the next 4 to 48 hours, thallium reaches the central nervous system.

- **Elimination Phase:**This phase begins around 24 hours post-exposure and is mainly achieved through renal excretion and feces. This is a slow phase and may take up to 30 days.
