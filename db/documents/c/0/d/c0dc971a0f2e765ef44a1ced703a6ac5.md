Aside from skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and represents 14% of all new cancers in the United States. Breast cancer risk increases with age and is most commonly diagnosed in women aged 55 to 64 years. This increasing risk over time offers an opportunity to catch breast cancer at earlier stages, increasing the chances that a patient may achieve a cure and also reducing the morbidity of the treatments. Breast cancer therapies continue to improve and have contributed to mortality reduction, but early diagnosis through mammographic screening has had a greater overall impact on mortality reductions. This activity describes mammography and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo mammography.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomy of the breast and its expected visualization in mammography.
- Describe the appropriate indications for screening mammography.
- Review the clinical significance of mammography in the early diagnosis of breast cancer and subsequent patient outcomes.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mammography and improve clinical outcomes.
