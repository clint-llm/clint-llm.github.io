Spinal stenosis is a condition characterized by the compression of the nerve roots by a number of pathologic factors, leading to symptoms such as pain, weakness, and numbness. Depending on the position of the spine affected, each level of compression can produce different symptoms that warrant a particular treatment modality. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of spinal stenosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of spinal stenosis.
- Recall the presentation of a patient with spinal stenosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for spinal stenosis.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team in encouraging affected patients to participate in an exercise program, maintain a healthy weight, and discontinue smoking in order to improve outcomes for those with spinal stenosis.
