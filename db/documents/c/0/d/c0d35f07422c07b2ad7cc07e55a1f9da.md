The dermoscopic features of acquired digital fibrokeratoma have been rarely investigated and may differ among ADFK cases. Rubegni et al. reported a central homogeneous pale-yellow core fringed by a hyperkeratotic white scaly collarette. These features may reflect the epidermal acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and the presence ofÂ dense collagen fibers. More peripherally, a whitish-yellow area with dotted vessels was evident, while globular vessels externally encircled the whole tumor.
