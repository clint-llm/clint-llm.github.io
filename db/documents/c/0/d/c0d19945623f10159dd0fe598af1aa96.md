Psoriasis is the model of the psoriasiform reaction pattern, defined as epidermal hyperplasia with elongation of the rete ridges. In addition to hyperplasia of the epidermis, there is an elongation of the dermal papillae, dilated superficial blood vessels, hypergranulosis, and parakeratosis.

Remnants of neutrophils in the stratum corneum are referred to as microabscesses of Munro. A discrete collection of neutrophils  (spongiform pustule of Kogoj) can also be found in the upper stratum spinosum.
