Atherosclerotic rupture leads to an inflammatory cascade of monocytes and macrophages, thrombus formation, and platelet aggregation. This leads to decreased oxygen delivery through the coronary artery resulting in decreased oxygenation of the myocardium. The inability to produce ATP in the mitochondria leads to the ischemic cascade, and therefore apoptosis (cell death) of the endocardium or myocardial infarction.

With some exceptions due to genetic variation, coronary arteries have unique and diagnostic territorial distributions. For example, the left anterior descending coronary artery supplies blood flow to the interventricular septum, anterolateral wall, and ventricular apex. The left circumflex artery supplies blood to the inferolateral wall. The right coronary artery supplies the right ventricle. The inferior wall is suppliedÂ either by the left circumflex or right coronary artery.
