**The Lower Thoracic Splanchnic Nerve:**

- **The greater splanchnic nerve:**
- This nerve originates from the sympathetic trunk from level T5-T9. Also, it provides both afferent and efferent fibers.

- **The lesser splanchnic nerve:**
- This nerve arises from the T10-T11 level.

- **The least splanchnic nerve:**
- This nerve arises from the T12 level.

**Lumbar Splanchnic Nerve:**

The lumbar splanchnic nerve originates from the abdominal portion of the sympathetic trunk. Medially, this nerve gives off 3 or 4 lumbar splanchnic nerves, for which it travels to the superior hypogastric plexuses (SHP), intermesenteric, and inferior mesenteric plexuses.

**Pelvic Splanchnic Nerve:**

The splanchnic nerves branches give sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to the pelvis. The sympathetic innervation arises from the level of  T12 to L2. The parasympathetic innervation originates from the S2 to S4 level, which is also called the pelvic splanchnic nerve.
