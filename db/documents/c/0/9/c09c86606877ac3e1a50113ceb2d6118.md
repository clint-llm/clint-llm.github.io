The development of the primitive eye begins at approximately week 3 of gestation with the burgeoning of the optic sulcus from the periocular mesenchyme. The optic sulci are bilateral invaginations on both sides of the anterior neural tube at the diencephalon. As the sulci deepen, they become optic pits and eventually transform into the optic vesicles as they extend toward surface ectoderm. Both surface ectoderm and the optic vesicles secrete/excrete extracellular matrix and adhere to each other. As the optic vesicles extend outward, the proximal attachment to the forebrain becomes the optic stalk. The optic vesicles aid in the migration of neural crest cells, which contribute to future development. At approximately 5 weeks, a portion of the optic vesicle will undergo auto-invagination to produce a “cup” with two cell layers. This invagination is asymmetric, and a groove forms in the inferior border. This structure is called the optic fissure, and early vasculature and periocular mesenchyme are introduced to the eye via this structure. The optic fissure closes by the end of week 6.

The two layers forming the optic cup is a continuous tissue that gives bends at a hinge point known as the optic cup lip, and that marks the border of the outer pigmented layer and inner neural layer.
