In rare instances, e.g., patients with a weak immune system (as can be the case with HIV or cancer), ehrlichiosis can lead to serious complications. These include:

- Brain conditions, including confusion, seizures, or coma

- Hemorrhage

- Heart failure

- Respiratory failure

- Kidney failure

- Septic shock

These complications may require additional treatment, including respiratory support, IV fluids, or kidney dialysis. Complications are more prevalent in the elderly or people with pre-existing health conditions.
