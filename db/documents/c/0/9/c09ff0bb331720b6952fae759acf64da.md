Pregnancy, a state of profound physiological and hormonal changes, is associated with a spectrum of changes in the skin and appendages. More than 90% of pregnant women experience one orÂ more forms of skin changes.

Specific dermatoses of pregnancy are the afflictions of the skin that appear during pregnancy and resolve with parturition. Pruritus gravidarum is a condition of the skin in gravid women represented by itching and only secondary lesions in the form of excoriations with or without evidence of cholestasis.
