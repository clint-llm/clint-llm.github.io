Bimatoprost is a synthetic structural analog of prostaglandin F2α and has been hypothesized to exert its effects as an agonist through prostaglandin FP receptors.

**Reduction of Intraocular Pressure**

It has been well demonstrated and validated that bimatoprost and several topical prostaglandin analogs sustainably and effectively reduce IOP and are used as a standard first-line treatment of POAG.

It is shown that lowering IOP in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma may reduce the risk of disease progression.

**Enhancement of Eyelash Growth**

The ability of bimatoprost to promote the growth and thickening of eyelashes was first noted during glaucoma clinical trials to investigate the potential to reduce IOP. Although the previously mentioned prostaglandin receptors have been shown to be involved in the regeneration of the dermal papilla outer root sheath and throughout hair follicles, it remains unknown whether bimatoprost exerts its effects through this pathway.

A series of studies demonstrated that with a 2-week course of bimatoprost, a more significant proportion of follicles were in the hair cycle's anagen phase and decreased portion in the telogen phase, suggesting an increased transition from telogen to anagen. Therefore, the study hypothesized that this increased proportion of follicles in the anagen phase allows for the observable enhanced growth of eyelashes with bimatoprost.
