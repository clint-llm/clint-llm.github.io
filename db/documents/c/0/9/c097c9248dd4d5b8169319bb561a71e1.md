Amphetamine has high misuse/abuse potential. All interprofessional team members (clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, behavioral therapists) involved in the care of a patient taking amphetamines should monitor closely for signs of medication misuse. As a schedule II controlled substance, there are no refills for amphetamine, which may necessitate monthly appointments with the prescribing physician. A cardiologist consult may be necessary for evaluating patients with potential cardiac concerns before the initiation of amphetamines. A pediatrician should monitor growth charts for children taking these medications. Pharmacists should monitor prescribing patterns and warn clinicians of potential doctor shopping". Nursing staff can counsel the patient on proper dosing and administration, warn about side effects, and answer patient questions, which the pharmacist can also reinforce. Interprofessional coordination and open information sharing will optimize amphetamine therapy for those patients who need it, prevent drug abuse and misuse, and prevent adverse outcomes. [Level 5]
