The results of the IVP should systematically be assessed to minimize the chances of error.

**Assessment of both kidneys**

- Size

- Position

- Vertical axis

- Renal contour and symmetry

- Renal parenchyma and parenchymal thickening

- Scarring of the parenchyma

- Calyceal distortion

- Cyst

- Double contouring of renal parenchyma

- Rounding of forniceal margins

- Loss of papillary impression

- Clubbing of calyces

- Abortive calyces

- Aberrant papillae

**Assessment of the ureters**

- Symmetry of both the ureter(s)

- Diverticulum/diverticula of ureter(s)

- Ureteral obstruction

- Medial and lateral deviation of the ureter(s)

- Obstructive and non-obstructive dilatation of ureter(s)

- Asymmetry of the ureteral caliber

**Assessment of the urinary bladder**

- Physiologic distention

- Position of the bladder

- Bladder wall thickening

- Irregularity of the lumen

- Contour abnormalities

- Diverticula

- Neoplasms
