Pseudobulbar palsy is due to an upper motor lesion in the corticobulbar pathways in the pyramidal fibers. Pseudobulbar palsy presents as:

- Dysarthria, or anarthria

- Dysphagia, sialorrhoea, drooling

- Dysphonia, hypernasal voice (Donald duck tone), and slurred speech. Speech has abnormality both in the rhythm and in the timbre, may have associated palilalia and finally, anarthria develops.

- Glossplegia with paresis of the tongue. Bilateral supranuclear lesions of the hypoglossal nerve in pseudobulbar palsy can produce an inability of the tongue to function.

- Impaired mastication, and paresis of facial muscles

- Emotional lability (pseudobulbar affect) is the abnormal expressions of emotion sometimes described in patients with pseudobulbar palsy, such as pathological laughter and emotional outburst, which is characterized by involuntary, uncontrollable laughter, or crying with paradoxical poverty of facial expression. Pathological laughter has also been reported in association with many tumors of the posterior fossa, particularly those involving pons and midbrain.

- Trismus: Acute pseudobulbar palsy can present with trismus due to the bilateral infarction of the internal capsule.

- On physical examination, there is a brisk jaw jerk. Other facial reflexes also become exaggerated. There are retained or increased palatal reflexes. There is the deviation of the angle of the mouth, uvula to the normal side and the tongue falls on the paretic side. Unlike lower motor neuron bulbar palsy, in pseudobulbar palsy, there is no atrophy or fasciculations of the affected muscles. Moreover, in bulbar palsy, emotions are not affected.

- Frontal release signs

- Cognitive impairment and seizures are observed in almost 85% of pediatric cohorts.
