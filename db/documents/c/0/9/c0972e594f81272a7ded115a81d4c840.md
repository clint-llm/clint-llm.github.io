Analgesics are medications used in the management and treatment of pain. They include several classes of medications (acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, antiepileptics, local anesthetics, and opioids). This activity reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications for all the drug classes listed before as valuable agents in the treatment of pain and other specific disorders. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, monitoring) pertinent for members of the interprofessional healthcare team in the management of patients with acute and chronic pain and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indication for naloxone administration.
- Describe the common physical exam findings associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) toxicity.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with acetaminophen therapy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to pain control medication choices for patients with acute and chronic pain.
