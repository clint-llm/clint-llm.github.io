The primary route of administration is intravenous (IV).

For germ-cell testicular cancer, the dosing regimen is 1.2 g/m²/day IV for the initial five days of a 21-day cycle. IV infusion is typically for a period of 30 minutes along with IV hydration and mesna to prevent bladder toxicity. Ifosfamide is emetogenic; hence, antiemetics are routinely prescribed to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Precipitation of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy (IIE) by aprepitant has been reported in the literature.

Researchers discovered ifosfamide over two decades ago, but it was subject to dose limitations due to the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. Only after the availability of the thiol neuroprotective compound mesna was the drug used more commonly to treat a wide range of malignancies. For this reason, the administration is almost always along with mesna. Mesna converts to dimesna in the plasma, which is filtered at the level of kidneys, where it is converted back to mesna.

At the urothelium, mesna combines with active metabolites like acrolein (urotoxic) and forms a non-toxic compound, which is eliminated in the urine. Mesna administration can be either oral or IV. The half-life of mesna is around 0.4 hours. It is completely excreted in four hours if given IV and in eight hours if given orally.
