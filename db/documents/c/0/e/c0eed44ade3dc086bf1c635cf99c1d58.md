There is no specific laboratory test needed for evaluation.

**Imaging Studies**

- If a sinus tract present, a sinogram can be obtained by injecting radiopaque dye to delineate the course and determine the size of the cyst.

- Ultrasonography can be obtained to determine the cystic characteristics of the cyst.

- Contrast-enhanced CT will depict a cystic and enhanced mass in the neck.

- MRI can be used for a finer resolution.

Fine-needle aspiration is helpful to distinguish a branchial cleft cyst from a malignant neoplasm.
