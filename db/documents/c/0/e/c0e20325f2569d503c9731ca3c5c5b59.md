Patients with Rotor syndrome are typically asymptomatic; however, generalized non-pruritic jaundice can present at birth or early childhood. These symptoms may come and go. Some patients only have scleral icterus. Patients also complain about passing dark-colored urine, long-term jaundice, and fatigue. Additionally, around 5% to 30% of patients may also experience abdominal pain, gastric mucosal abnormalities, and fever.

Physical examination is typically normal, except for mild jaundice. Excess bilirubin results in a yellow-orange tinge of the tissues that most easily appears as icteric (yellowish) discoloration of the sclera. Unlike other disorders with cholestasis, pruritus is absent. Another feature to remember in Rotor syndrome is that there will be no hepatosplenomegaly in the presence of jaundice which can help narrow down the list of differentials.

Based on some distinguishing features, Rotor syndrome can be differentiated from other similar disorders, such as Dubin–Johnson syndrome. For instance, the liver has black pigmentation in Dubin–Johnson syndrome, while in Rotor syndrome liver has normal histology and appearance.
