Embryological derivatives of the foot nerves arise from the development of the central and peripheral nervous systems. This development starts with neurulation beginning around week 3 of the developing fetus. The notochord, which comes from midline mesoderm, induces the overlying ectoderm to form the neural plate (neuroectoderm). By the end of the third week, the lateral edges of the neural plate rise to become the neural folds while the center of the plate forms the neural groove. The neural plate then folds onto itself to create the neural tube and neural crest cells (formed as detachments of the neural cells at the crest of the neural folds upon closure of the neural plate) by the end of week 4, thus completing the process of neurulation.

The neural tube will eventually become the brain and the spinal cord as part of the central nervous system whereas the neural crest cells will migrate throughout the embryo to form many structures, including the spinal nerves of the upper and lower limbs, as part of the peripheral nervous system.
