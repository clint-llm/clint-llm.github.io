TEF occurs due to abnormal septation of the caudal foregut during the fourth and fifth weeks of embryonic development. Under normal conditions, the trachea forms as a diverticulum of the foregut and develop a complete septum that separates it from the esophagus. Fistula formation in conjunction with EA occurs during an abnormal posterior positioning of the tracheoesophageal septum, resulting in a retained connection between trachea and esophagus. Isolated EA without TEF commonly occurs when the esophagus fails to recanalize during week 8 of embryonic development.
