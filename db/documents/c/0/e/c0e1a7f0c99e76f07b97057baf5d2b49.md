Poorly treated diabetics have higher morbidity and complication rates associated with PN than well-controlled diabetics. PN often leads to skin breakdown, infection, ulceration, and eventually to amputation. Further, the treatment of PN is not satisfactory, and adverse cardiac events are common. Less than a third of patients achieve good pain control. For most patients with PN, the quality of life is poor.
