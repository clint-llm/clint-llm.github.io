In utero, the retina is in a state of physiological hypoxia. Elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) facilitate retinal angiogenesis.

Because the nasal and temporal portions of the retina form late in pregnancy, 32 and 40 weeks respectively, preterm infants are born with incomplete vascularization of these portions. The physiologic hypoxia that was previously driving vessel development is replaced with a state of hyperoxia, as many premature infants are exposed to supplemental in addition to atmospheric oxygen.
