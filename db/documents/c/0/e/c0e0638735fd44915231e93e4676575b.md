Flap transfer is indicated when a tissue defect cannot be closed primarily, and it would be inappropriate to allow the defect to heal by secondary intention or with the use of a skin graft. When substantial tissue loss occurs during trauma or as a result of oncologic resection, flaps are often employed for wound closure. Classic examples include traumatic scalp avulsions requiring closure with latissimus dorsi free flaps or hemiglossectomies requiring reconstruction with radial forearm free flaps.
