The true prevalence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in the general population is not known and is considered to be rare. Due to varied definitions and modalities of detection used, the incidence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure varies from 25% to 50%. This means that out of nearly 5.7 million patients with heart failure, two to three million patients are expected to have Cheyne-Stokes respiration. The incidence is reported to be more in patients with systolic heart failure compared to diastolic heart failure, and Cheyne-Stokes respiration is also more common in elderly patients.
