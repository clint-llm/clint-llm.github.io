Given the noninvasive nature of ductal carcinoma in situ, metastases and/or death in women with DCIS who are treated are rare.

There is an excellent prognosis with a normal life expectancy for the vast majority of patients with DCIS who undergo treatment. However, there is still an increased breast cancer mortality with the diagnosis of DCIS.  In a recent 2020 study published in JAMA Oncology of over 100,000 patients diagnosed with DCIS, the overall death rate from breast cancer at 20 years after diagnosis was 3.3%, a rate treble that of the general population. That rate was the same with either breast conservation therapy or mastectomy.

A recent meta-analysis from 2019 identified six factors that were linked to a higher risk of recurrence of invasive breast cancer. These factors are DCIS found by a doctor during a physical exam, being premenopausal, positive margins, high-grade DCIS, high levels of p16 protein, and having African American ethnicity.
