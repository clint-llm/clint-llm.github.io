Like other bursae, the ulnar bursa is a sac of synovial fluid that typically remains collapsed with the walls being held apart by the thin layer of fluid. It provides a means for smooth movement by reducing friction for the tendons of both the flexor digitorum profundus as well as the flexor digitorum superficialis as they pass deep to both the flexor retinaculum and the median nerve in the carpal tunnel and into the metacarpals of the hand. There are three communicating invaginations of the ulnar bursa at the level of the carpal tunnel. The most superficial invagination is between the transverse carpal ligament and the flexor digitorum superficialis tendons. The middle and deep invaginations are situated superficial and deep to the flexor digitorum profundus tendons respectively. The ulnar bursa encases these tendons until they reach the midpalmar region overlying the second, third, and fourth metacarpals but continues distally over the flexor tendons of the fifth digit and often communicates with the flexor tendon sheath of the fifth digit.
