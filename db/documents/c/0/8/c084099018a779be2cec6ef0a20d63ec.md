The etiology ofÂ popliteal artery aneurysms, and aneurysms in general, is unknown. Molecular studies suggest that a combination of genetic defects and inflammatory processes may be responsible. Atherosclerosis tends to increase flow turbulence distal to a stenosis, leading to a pathological dilation of the artery. Decreased wall strength associated with inflammatory cell infiltration is believed to result in aneurysm formation.
