One of the most critical differential diagnoses in DHR is to rule out sarcoidosis from tuberculosis. Both cause a granulomatous reaction and have many things in common, but the cause of tuberculosis is a microbe that can isolate in the laboratory, which is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Sarcoidosis is a non-infectious form of the granulomatous disease, and therefore, the culture of lesions will render non-pathogenic bacteria or another type of microbe. Primary T-cell immunodeficiency and hematologic malignancies are also considered in the differential diagnosis. Some of the diseases to consider are as follows:

- DiGeorge Syndrome

- Hodgkin Lymphoma

- Severe Combined Immunodeficiency

- Tuberculosis

- Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome

- HIV infection

- Measles infection
