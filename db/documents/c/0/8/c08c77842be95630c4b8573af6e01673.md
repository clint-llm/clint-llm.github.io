Trends in MDMA use have been well documented throughout the years, with user age ranging from the 8th grade all the way to the college level and adulthood. A review of epidemiological data revealed a significant increase in usage between the 1990s to early 2000s.  For example, lifetime ecstasy use on one college campus was found to increase from 16% to 24% between the years 1986 to 1990, while a national sample of college students saw a 69% increase between the years 1997 to 1999.

While the number of users increased significantly from the early 1990s and 2000s, the number of new users was variable from the period of 2002 to 2007.  Surveys found a decrease in users from 1.2 million in 2002 down to 642000 in 2003 then up to 860000 from 2006 to 2007.
