Nickel, being widely present in society, exposes individuals to various sources on a daily basis. Contact dermatitis represents the most prevalent manifestation of nickel poisoning. Management of this condition involves removing the source of exposure, along with the use of topical corticosteroids, moisturizers, and emollients to alleviate symptoms and promote skin healing.

Occupational exposure to nickel requires particular consideration, as nickel carbonyl can be a highly dangerous compound. Its solubility in the lungs allows for systemic symptoms and severe health implications. It is crucial for individuals to have a comprehensive understanding of their work environment and identify potential risk factors for nickel exposure. By recognizing and addressing these factors, occupational safety can be enhanced, and the risk of nickel-related toxicity minimized.

In cases of suspected nickel ingestion or inhalation exposure, it is important to promptly call 911 for immediate transfer to the nearest hospital. Timely medical intervention is crucial to assess and manage potential toxicity.

If there is a concern for occupational exposure to nickel, contacting the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is recommended. OSHA can provide expertise in evaluating and investigating occupational hazards, ensuring workplace safety, and implementing appropriate preventive measures.

The Poison Control Center is an invaluable resource available 24/7 for any concerns related to nickel exposure. Trained professionals at the Poison Control Center can provide guidance, coordinate efforts, and offer information to help address and navigate concerns related to nickel exposure.
