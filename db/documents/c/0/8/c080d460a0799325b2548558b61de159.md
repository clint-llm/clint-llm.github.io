Acne is unavoidable but can be controlled by regular washing of the face by a pH balancing wash which is available as benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid face wash. Avoidance of high glycemic index and/or dairy-based food plays a role. Management of stress and early detection and treatment of underlying causes like PCOD helps to control acne and preventing disfigurement.

Even though retinoids are excellent agents for acne, their use in women of childbearing age is limited because the agents are teratogenic. There is a registry for all individuals who are prescribed or dispensed retinoids like isotretinoin.
