When a patient presents with a cottonmouth envenomation, it requires the prompt evaluation and management of an interprofessional healthcare team. This team includes nursing, emergency provider, a toxicologist, or the regional poison center. The collaborative effort from these teams can properly triage patients and appropriately manage patients with snake bites envenomation. Patients in the emergency department should have the following:

- Vital signs recorded and monitored by the nurse with reporting of changes to the clinician

- Assess the wound and provide local wound care

- Record the patient's last tetanus shot and update if needed

- Elevate the affected limb to help with pain and swelling

- Avoid tourniquets, ice packs or manipulating the wound

- Observe all patients with suspected envenomation for at least 8 hours

- Administer antivenom if indicated

While most patients improve with local wound care, the patient requires monitoring for the development of compartment syndrome; this is where nursing can fill a vital role, informing the physician or contacting toxicology if they have any concerns. If there is any concern about blood flow compromise, the surgeon should be asked to perform a fasciotomy. If antivenom is necessary, it will be obtained from the pharmacy, and the pharmacists should be sure to familiarize themselves with the interaction and adverse event profile since it is an infrequently encountered agent; this will enable them to be a better asset to the care team. Today with prompt treatment, the outcomes following cottonmouth envenomation are good, but only if the interprofessional healthcare team, including physicians, toxicologists, pharmacists, and nursing work collaboratively to ensure patients receive the care they need in a timely fashion.[Level V]
