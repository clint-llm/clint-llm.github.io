Physical examination shows a visible midline forehead bony ridge leading to a deformity resembling a ship's keel. Hypotelorism is frequently noted. Patients have a narrow bitemporal skull dimension with a compensatory expanded biparietal dimension. Eyebrows are usually raised. TheÂ earlier the suture closure, the more severe will be the skull deformity.

Cases can be classified as severe, moderate, and mild, depending on the angulation of the frontal bones.
