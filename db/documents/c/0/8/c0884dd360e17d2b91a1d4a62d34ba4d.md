Treatment is generally supportive for mononucleosis. Antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications help to treat fever, sore throat, and the general fatigue seen in this illness. Hydration, rest, and good nutritional intake should also be encouraged. Corticosteroids are not generally recommended in the routine treatment of mononucleosis because of concerns with immunosuppression; however, in cases of airway obstruction, corticosteroids (and possible otolaryngology consultation) are indicated along with appropriate airway management. In instances where antibiotics have been inappropriately administered in patients with mononucleosis, a generalized maculopapular rash may develop. Classically, this is after administration of amoxicillin but can be seen with other antibiotics as well. All athletes should avoid sports during the early course of the illness (approximately three weeks) because of the splenic enlargement was seen in approximately 50% of patients with mononucleosis and the associated risk of splenic rupture.
