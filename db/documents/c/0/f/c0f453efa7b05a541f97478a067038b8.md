Rotational vertebral artery syndrome, or "bow hunter syndrome," is a very rare diagnosis that is easily missed. Furthermore, symptoms are very nonspecific and caused by underlying anatomic abnormalities or derangements. This activity serves to examine the underlying pathology of this rare cause of vertebrobasilar insufficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the relevant anatomy associated with rotational vertebral artery syndrome.
- Outline the pathogenesis of rotational vertebral artery syndrome.
- Explain the difficulty in the diagnosis of rotational vertebral artery syndrome as the underlying cause of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
- Summarize the importance of an interprofessional team approach in diagnosing and treating rotational vertebral artery syndrome.
