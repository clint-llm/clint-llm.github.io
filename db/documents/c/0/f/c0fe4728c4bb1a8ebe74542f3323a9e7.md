Adolescents and pregnant women may be more likely to form hypertrophic scars. People with darker skin complexions are about 15% more likely to develop keloid scars, and the lowest incidence of hypertrophic scars is in persons with albinism. It is estimated that 70% of deep (full thickness), burn injuries result in hypertrophic scars.
