Cicatricial pemphigoid is a rare, chronic autoimmune blistering disorder which can produce scarring. It can affect the skin only, mucous membranes only, or both the skin and mucous membranes. When only mucous membranes are involved, the disease is often referred to as mucous membrane pemphigoid. When only the ocular membranes are involved, it may be referred to as ocular pemphigoid. Risk of scarring depends on the location of disease activity. Initial diagnosis can be a challenge. Due to the risks of serious complications, such as blindness and airway compromise, early and aggressive treatment initiation may be warranted.
