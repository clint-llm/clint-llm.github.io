The earliest known documentation of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (NA) dates to Hippocrates in the fifth century B.C.

As previously mentioned, JNA is a highly vascular lesion, with one or more arterial vascular pedicles.Â  The most common primary arterial supply is the internal maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid artery.
