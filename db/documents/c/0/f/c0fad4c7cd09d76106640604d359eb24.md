In the management of osteoporosis, treatment effectiveness is considerably limited by some real and perceived intolerance to the therapies, and also due to poor adherence to recommendations. Data have shown that most patients discontinue the prescribed treatment before the end of the first year. Patient education remains the central theme of considering primary prevention of this condition. Avoidance of modifiable risk factors plus the importance of a healthy diet, exercise, and bone health will remain the cornerstone in care and prevention of this alarmingly raising co-morbidity.
