Intraarticular or periarticular destruction can be a sequel of synovial chondromatosis. Hence, prompt diagnosis and treatment will assist in avoiding secondary pathology.

**Recurrence:**There is rarely a reoccurrence of primary synovial chondromatosis after surgical management with the removal of the loose bodies and partial synovectomy. Reoccurrence has been reported in a case involving the temporal mandibular joint.

**Regression:**Despite uncommon, spontaneous regression has been reported in the literature. But, it often takes several years from the onset to the resolution of symptoms.
