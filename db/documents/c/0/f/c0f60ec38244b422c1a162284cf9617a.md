The myocardium of the heart is supplied by 2 major coronary arteries: the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery (RCA). The left main coronary artery is usually a short segment that branches into the left anterior descending (LAD) artery and the circumflex artery. The LAD branches further into diagonal branches and the circumflex artery branches into obtuse marginal branches.Â The RCA branches into the posterior descending artery (PDA) and the marginal branches.

The coronary circulation can be divided into left-dominant, right-dominant, and co-dominant systems depending on which artery supplies the interventricular septum and PDA. In a left-dominant system, the PDA is supplied by the circumflex artery; whereas, in a right-dominant system, the PDA is supplied by the RCA. Co-dominant arterial supply has the PDA supplied by both the RCA and circumflex arteries simultaneously.

Blockages in any of the coronary arteries cause a corresponding defect in myocardial perfusion, ischemia and if unrepaired can lead to permanent infarct or damage to the myocardium.
