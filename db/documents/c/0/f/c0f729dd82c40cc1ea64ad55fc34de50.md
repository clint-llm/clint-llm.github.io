Treatment for baclofen toxicity is mostly supportive. Stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation should be the priority in management. Due to the likely onset of respiratory depression and profound CNS depression, endotracheal intubation and ventilation may be necessary. Activated charcoal can be given early after the ingestion if the patient can safely tolerate it. Intravenous fluids would be the initial treatment for hypotension, with vasopressors reserved for refractory hypotension. Atropine can be used for bradycardia associated with hypotension or mental status change. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines.

Symptomatic baclofen ingestions should be admitted. In the case of an overdose, baclofen should be discontinued. However, to prevent withdrawal, baclofen should be resumed at therapeutic doses once the signs and symptoms of toxicity have improved. Patients with hemodynamic instability or significant CNS depression should be admitted to the intensive care unit.

If the patient has an intrathecal pump, they should ideally be managed at a medical facility with physicians experienced in managing intrathecal pumps. If there are concerns for pump malfunction resulting in overdose, the pump should be stopped, the reservoir replaced with saline, and in severe cases, CSF removal via lumbar puncture could be considered.

Hemodialysis can be beneficial by shortening the elimination time, especially in patients with underlying kidney disease.
