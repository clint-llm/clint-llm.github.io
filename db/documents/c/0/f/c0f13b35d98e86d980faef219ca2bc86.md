Providing proper education about an overlap syndrome to each patient is crucial to strengthening the patient-physician relationship. This could be as simple as providing resources to help patients safely and realistically lose weight through a dietary plan or structured exercise regimen and pulmonary rehabilitation. Additionally, providing resources on properly caring for any CPAP or BiPAP device can ensure they are functioning correctly and avoid unnecessary complications.

When possible, having patients undergo polysomnography at a sleep lab versus a home sleep study has been shown to improve compliance, in part because the patient can receive education by a trained sleep lab technologist and sleep medicine physician so that the patient can better understand their equipment, how to use it, and what to do when it is not functioning properly.
