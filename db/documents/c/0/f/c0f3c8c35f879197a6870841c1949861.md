Microspherophakia can be associated with complications secondary to the biconvex lens shape resulting in high myopia. Further, a relatively weak zonules lens is prone to subluxation or even complete anterior or posterior dislocation. The anterior subluxation can lead to corneo-lenticular touch, thus predisposing to endothelial cell loss or endothelial decompensation.

The posterior dislocation of the lens can lead to vitreous tractions and subsequent retinal detachment. Earlier studies have reported an incidence of up to 44% for subluxation of the lens in patients with microspherophakia. Further, the anterior subluxation of the lens can lead to a shallow anterior chamber, and pupillary block or patient might present with intermittent irido-lenticular touch.

The incidence of angle-closure glaucoma has been reported as high as 44.4 to 51%. Chronic pupillary block glaucoma can result from the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae, trabecular crowding by the spherophakic lens, reverse angle-closure glaucoma, or malignant glaucoma. Rarely, non-resolving malignant glaucoma might lead to permanent loss of vision or phthisis, or even there might be a painful blind eye needing enucleation.
