The incidence and presentation of phocomelia were examined in 22,740,933 live births by Bermejo-Sanchez et al. in an effort to assess the prevalence of true phocomelia. Reports indicate that true phocomelia occurs in 0.62 live births per every 100,000 patients. Approximately half (53.2%) of the cases displayed isolated phocomelia, while 36.9% had additional major congenital abnormalities, and 9.9% of cases correlated with a clinical syndrome.

The data shows that 55.9% of cases only involve one limb, while 40.2% of cases only involved two limbs. Only four cases of 141 had involvement of all four limbs. When comparing single upper extremities deficiencies, the left side was more commonly affected (64.9%) than the right.

When two limbs were involved, the upper limbs were involved 58.5% of the time compared to the lower limbs. The incidence of these findings was lower than what prior studies had reported, which is likely due to the care taken by this study, only to consider true phocomelia and not amelia or other limb truncation.
