The differential diagnosis of T-PLL includes other lymphoid neoplasms with a leukemic presentation; some relevant entities include

- B cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL); B-PLL, compared to T-PLL, has minimal lymphadenopathy and rarely skin involvement. It shows a strong B-cell marker study (CD19, CD20, CD22) with additional positive markers of CD79a and CD5. CD23 is negative. The cytogenetics shows no t(11;14), but there is positivity for 13q del, 11q del, 17p del, or 6q del. The median survival in B-PLL is three years; it is measured in months for T-PLL. Cytologically they bear a single prominent nucleolus.

- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL); the cells are variably positive for CD5 and CD23; weakly positive for CD22 and CD79b. They are CD10 negative. The cytogenetic analysis shows 13q del, 11q del, 17p del, or trisomy 12.

- Mycosis fungoides (MF) / Sezary syndrome (SS); Cells in Sezary syndrome are positive for CD2 and CD3. They are predominantly positive for CD4. They are positive for CD25 and negative for TCL1. They are usually negative for CD7 and CD26. Skin lesions may be found in as many as 20% or so of patients. A skin biopsy may be needed to exclude Sezary syndrome. The rash in SS is felt to be the harbinger of its lymphocytosis.

- Adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL); Chronic HTLV-1 infection is thought to be the etiology of this neoplasm. Here, HTLV-1 PCR/serology is positive; T-PLL cells are negative for this indication. ATLL cells are TCL1 negative. They are positive for CD3, CD4, and CD25. They are CD7 negative; T-PLL cells are CD7 positive. By far, in ATLL, CD4 is more prevalent than CD8. Hypercalcemia is common in ATLL but NOT found in T-PLL. ATLL cells have a unique cytomorphology with "flower cells." These are cells having convoluted nuclei with condensed, homogenous chromatin.

- T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (LGL);  These cells are TCL1 negative though they are positive for CD2, CD3, CD8, CD16, and CD57. They variably express CD7 and rarely CD4. The patients may have mild-to-moderate splenomegaly but rarely lymphadenopathy. Cytopenias are a frequent finding. The cytology reveals large lymphocytes containing azurophilic granules. The median survival is over ten years.

- Hairy cell leukemia (HCL);  HCL is rare and is noted to be a low-grade mature B-cell cancer. 'Classic' HCL bears B-cell markers of CD19, CD20, and CD22. Markers more specific for this entity include CD11c, CD25, CD103, CD125, and CD200.   An HCL variant exists missing both CD25 and CD123. CD22 and CD79b are variably expressed. However, the variant contains a characteristic BRAF-V600E mutation, a marker not evident in other B-cell maladies. The physical exam is noteworthy for massive splenomegaly, essentially its most prominent feature. Cellular morphology shows "hair"-like cytoplasmic projections. The variant form may manifest nucleoli.
