The development of the PAG and the midbrain happens quite early in gestation, beginning with the ectoderm, one of the three main germinal layers. The neural ectoderm begins to develop by the third week, giving rise to the neural ectoderm and notochord by the mid-fourth week of development. The notochord, responsible for the longitudinal axis of the brain, gives rise to the three main layers of the primitive brain, including the mesencephalon, which is the embryologic source of the midbrain.
