The insula is a paralimbic structure that lies between the neocortex and the paleocortex (sometimes referred to as the mesocortex). Cortical structures begin to form around the sixth week of fetal development, and the sulci fully appear in the second trimester. From an embryological standpoint, the insular cortex is the most primordial structure of the telencephalon, arising from the anterior prosencephalon (i.e., forebrain) during development, with the limen insulae forming as a result of the inferior cortical region folding on itself.

After a series of complex rotations and folds, the insula is housed deep to the lateral sulcus with many connections to surrounding structures. Although isolated reports of insular malformations are rare, the insula's location and development process represent many opportunities for congenital cerebral disruption. Maldevelopment may be associated with lissencephaly, disorders of the adjacent basal ganglia, and others.
