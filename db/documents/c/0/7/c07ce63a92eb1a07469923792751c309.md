Since the 1940s, the mainstay treatment for Nocardia infections has been sulfonamides, the most common of which in the U.S. is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).N. farcinica, N. nova, and N. otitidiscaviarum showing increased multi-drug resistance.Nocardia species.

Other agents to consider include:

- Carbapenems: imipenem, meropenem, or ertapenem, with imipenem having the best efficacy

- Quinolones: especially moxifloxacin

- Tetracyclines: minocycline

The duration of treatment is dependent on the location of infection and the immune status of the affected individual. For patients with pulmonary or multifocal disease that does not involve the CNS, a treatment regimen for 6-12 months is indicated. If the patient is immunosuppressed or has CNS involvement, they should be treated for a minimum of 12 months.

Prophylaxis:** **Patients shown to be at greatest risk forNocardia infection have been documented to be patients that are HIV positive.Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) or Toxoplasma gondii.  Fortunately, this prophylaxis also has been shown to help reduce Nocardia infections.
