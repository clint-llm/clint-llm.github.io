M cells differ structurally from normal intestinal mucosal cells. M cells have apical microfolds, hence their alternate name, "microfold cells." These apical microfolds are poorly organized villi that have unique adhesion molecules to grab and sample luminal macromolecules. They have a thin glycocalyx, as opposed to the normally thick glycocalyx of other mucosal epithelial cells, that allows for adhesion but also does not impend the transport of molecules.
