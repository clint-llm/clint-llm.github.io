BECTS is a common epilepsy syndrome in children. It is the only other benign focal epilepsy syndrome in children. Similar to benign occipital seizures, children with BECTS have a very good prognosis and have normal development and MRI. The seizures originate from the centrotemporal area, located around the Rolandic fissure.

IPOLE is a type of reflex epilepsy. Seizures are induced by light stimulation, such a flickering. Seizures may start between the ages of 5 to 17 years. At the seizure onset, the child often has elementary visual symptoms. Headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting may follow. Impairment of consciousness may or may not occur.
