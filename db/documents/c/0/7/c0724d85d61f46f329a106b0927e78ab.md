The management of renal stones is by an interprofessional team that consists of a nephrologist, emergency department physician, radiologist, urologist, and a primary care provider. The majority of renal stones pass within four weeks, but stones larger than 8 mm may require some intervention before they can pass. Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners who see patients with kidney stones, should contact the urologist when large stones fail to pass. Urologic nurses are involved in treatment, monitor patients, and update the team on changes in patient status. Pharmacists review prescribed medications for appropriate dosages, interactions, and provide patient education. In some cases of infected stones, surgery may be required. Because the recurrence of kidney stones is common, the patient should be educated on fluid intake and avoidance of certain foods. The prognosis for most patients with kidney stones is good. [Level 5]
