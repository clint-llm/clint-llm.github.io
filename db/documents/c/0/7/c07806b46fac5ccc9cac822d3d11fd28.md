Metoclopramide is generally administered orally in a tablet or solution form. The dosage of the tablets and solutions is generally 5 to 10 mg. It is usually taken before meals and before sleep. However, it can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously in severely nauseous patients; the intravenous route takes effect much more quickly.

Metoclopramide dosing for various indications is as follows:

**Diabetic Gastroparesis:**10 mg orally/IV/IM four times daily for a maximum duration of 12 weeks; max dose is 40 mg daily. Start at 5 mg four times daily for geriatric patients. For patients who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, give 5 mg four times daily (30 minutes before meals and at bedtime) with a max dose of 20 mg daily.

**GERD (chronic):**10 to 15 mg orally/IM/IV four times daily for a maximum duration of 12 weeks; maximum dose of 60 mg daily. Start at 5 mg four times daily for geriatric patients; max dose 30 mg daily. For patients who are poor CYP2D6 metabolizers, give 5 mg four times daily (30 minutes before meals and at bedtime) or 10 mg three times daily (30 minutes before meals).

**GERD (intermittent):**Up to 20 mg orally/IV/IM for one dose before symptoms begin.

**Prophylaxis of Chemotherapy-related Nausea and Vomiting:**1 to 2 mg/kg/dose IV every 2 to 3 hours; the first dose is given 30 minutes before starting chemotherapy, then repeated for two doses every 2 hours, then three doses every 3 hours. Pretreat with diphenhydramine to reduce extrapyramidal symptoms. Metoclopramide is not a first-line agent for this purpose.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**Reduce the dose of metoclopramide in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C). The recommended dose for diabetic gastroparesis is 5 mg four times daily.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**In patients with kidney failure, it is generally recommended that metoclopramide maintenance doses be reduced to avoid drug accumulation.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Metoclopramide can cross the placental barrier. Maternal administration of metoclopramide during delivery can lead to extrapyramidal signs and methemoglobinemia in neonates. According to ACOG(The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) guidelines, metoclopramide should be used only in refractory cases of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy, 5 to 10 mg every 6 to 8 hours, orally or intramuscularly, in adequately hydrated patients. The preferred pharmacological management is pyridoxine(vitamin B6) or pyridoxine in combination with doxylamine.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Metoclopramide is used as a galactagogue, but the clinical value of metoclopramide in increasing milk supply is uncertain. A meta-analysis of eight clinical trials indicated that metoclopramide increased serum prolactin but did not increase milk supply. Metoclopramide use increases the risk of postpartum depression and tardive dyskinesia. Use with caution.
