Exposure to ozone is most likely unintended and due to environmental sources, both indoor and outdoor. Indoor exposure is decreased in homes with central air due to the decreased exchange of indoor and outdoor air and filtering performed by the air conditioning unit.

One's outside environment is a major determinant of ozone exposure, potential toxicity, and overall cardiovascular and respiratory mortality.  One large study of 95 communities in the United States found a statistically significant association between increases in ozone measured in parts per billion (ppb) and short-term mortality. This study illustrates the widespread national public health concerns about ozone exposure. Countries outside of the United States, such as South Korea and Iceland, have also recognized the health impacts of ozone and the impact on public health.

The exact level and duration of ozone exposure that creates toxicity are not yet known.  Additionally, humans may have variable sensitivity to ozone exposure. One study found that pediatric asthmatics might be more sensitive to certain air pollutants such as ozone.
