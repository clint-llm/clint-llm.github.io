Rickettsia preferentially infects the vascular endothelial cells lining small and medium vessels throughout the body, causing the systemic symptoms and high mortalityÂ occurs with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The infection of endothelial cells leads to disseminated inflammation, loss of barrier function, and altered vascular permeability throughout the body. This condition leads to fever, myalgias, central nervous system symptoms such as headache and confusion, rash, and cardiovascular instability that can be present in patients with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The mechanisms involved in the rapid entry of the organisms into the cell and the downregulation of immune pathways allowing for persistence of infection are targets of studies to identify new therapeutic targets in these illnesses.
