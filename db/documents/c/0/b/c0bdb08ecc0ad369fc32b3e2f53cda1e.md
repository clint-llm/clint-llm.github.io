Morton neuroma is a compressive neuropathy of the interdigital nerve in the forefoot due to compression and constant irritation at the plantar aspect of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament. It is not a true neuroma as the condition is degenerative rather than neoplastic. It is also referred to as Morton metatarsalgia, interdigital neuritis, Morton entrapment, interdigital neuralgia, interdigital neuroma, interdigital nerve compression syndrome, and intermetatarsal neuroma. The exact etiological cause of Morton neuroma is not known, but four major hypotheses exist. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of Morton neuroma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Morton neuroma.
- Recall the evaluation of a patient with Morton neuroma.
- Summarize the treatment options for Morton neuroma.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Morton neuroma.
