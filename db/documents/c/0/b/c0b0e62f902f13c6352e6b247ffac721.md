Surgical release is only considered in refractory conditions after nonoperative modalities are exhausted.

The open surgical approach entails the complete release of the piriformis tendon from its insertion on the posterior femur. Additionally, neurolysis of the sciatic nerve is often performed in tandem.  The latter is recommended in the setting of advanced/severe fibrotic conditions adversely affecting the course of the nerve itself.

In general, the outcome after surgery depends on the chronicity of the condition, but the results are often variable.  Patients should be counseled before the surgery regarding the risk of continued pain/symptoms even after the surgical procedure is performed.

All patients with piriformis syndrome should enroll in a physical therapy program. The patient should undergo stretching and motion exercises to help relieve the adhesions on the nerve. The goal should be to eliminate symptoms and improve function.
