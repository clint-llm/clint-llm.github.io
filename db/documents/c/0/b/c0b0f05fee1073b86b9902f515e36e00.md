The optic nerve may be damaged by ischemia anywhere along its path, starting from its origin. It is mainly divided into anterior and posterior. A portion of the optic nerve between the retina and sclera is supplied by a network of 6 to 12 short posterior ciliary arteries at the back of the globe. Optic ischemia is a serious vision-threatening disease. It leads to vision loss in both eyes sequentially if not treated in time. Therefore a prompt diagnosis and treatment are mandatory. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment aspects of optic ischemia and the role of the interprofessional team in the same.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of optic ischemia.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of optic ischemia.
- Review the management options available for optic ischemia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care, coordination, and communication to improve outcomes.
