Myositis ossificans is a reactive process within the muscle secondary to traumatic muscular hematomas characterized by a proliferation of fibroblasts, cartilage, and bone.Â Most commonly, myositis ossificans occurs within the quadriceps muscles, the brachialis muscle, and the gluteal muscles. This outcome is a self-limiting condition that will typically decrease in size after a year.
