The incidence of Acute Mountain Sickness increases with increasing altitude. While Acute Mountain Sickness is very uncommon under 2500 m, the percentage of non-acclimated travelers affected at 3000 m approaches 75%. Any travelers with prior episodes of Acute Mountain Sickness are at greater risk than those who have tolerated similar trips in the past.

Pre-existing diseases can increase Acute Mountain Sickness risk by magnifying the effects of the hypoxia. The most common conditions in this category include anemia, with a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due to the reduced degree of oxygenation occurring in the lungs.

Given the suspected severity of the underlying process, careful pre-trip measures should include: screening to characterize the severity of the disease, additional treatment of the underlying condition, a lower threshold altitude to begin prophylaxis to reduce the risk of hypoxia, enhanced preparation for treatment during the trip, and recommendations to modify the itinerary.
