Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) often results in intractable, bothersome epiphora. In longstanding NLDO, mucus can accumulate, resulting in a mucocele in the nasolacrimal sac or even acute or chronic dacryocystitis. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgery can be performed to restore tear drainage and is usually the definitive treatment. This activity highlights the importance of a collaborative interprofessional team approach to achieve safe and effective operation.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the historical developments leading to modern dacryocystorhinostomy.
- Describe the detailed clinical assessment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
- Explain the technical details of how to perform an external and endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.
- Review the importance of collaboration between the anesthetist and the surgeon when performing an external or endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy.
