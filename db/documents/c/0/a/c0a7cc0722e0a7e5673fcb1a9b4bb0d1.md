The caudate nucleus lies near many vital deep brain structures, and caution is necessary during any surgical manipulation of the area. One surgery in the region of the caudate nucleus is the implantation of electrodes used for deep brain stimulation in the area. Deep brain stimulation in the ventral caudate nucleus is successful in the treatment of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depression, resulting in remission of depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms around one year after implantation.

Lesions of the caudate nucleus, such as hemorrhages or strokes, can have widespread effects depending upon their extent and the potential involvement of other nearby tissues. The caudate nucleus is not a common site of hemorrhage, but patients with caudate nucleus hemorrhage present with symptoms suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhages such as headache, emesis, and nuchal rigidity.

Caudate nucleus stroke presents with nonprogressive symptoms, which stabilize in severity less than one hour after onset.
