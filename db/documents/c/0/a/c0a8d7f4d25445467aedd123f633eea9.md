One of the most distinctive features of an excellent staging method is defining the anatomical extent of the tumor, differentiating survival outcomes, and guiding its optimal management. As per FIGO, cervical cancer can be staged as follows:

**STAGE I**: Carcinoma confined only, to the cervix (extension to the corpus is disregarded)

IA: Invasive carcinoma, which can only be detected microscopically, maximum depth less than 5 mm

- IA1: measured stromal invasion less than 3mm in depth

- IA2: measured stromal invasion equal or more to 3mm but less than 5mm in depth

IB: Invasive carcinoma with measured deepest invasion equal to or greater than 5mm, i.e. (it will be clinically visible), cancer confined to the cervix.

- IB1: Equal to or greater than 5mm of stromal invasion and less than 2cm in greatest dimension

- IB2: Equal to or greater than 2cm but less than 4cm in the greatest dimension

- IB3: Equal to or greater than 4cm in greatest dimension

**STAGE II:**Carcinoma extends beyond the uterus, but the lower third of the vagina and the pelvic walls are not involved.

IIA: Cancer confined to the upper two-thirds of the vagina without the involvement of the parametrium.

- IIA1: Less than 4cm

- IIA2: Equal to or greater than 4cm

IIB: There is parametrial involvement but not up to the pelvic wall.

**STAGE 3**: Cancer involves one or some or all of the following: the lower third of the vagina,  the pelvic sidewalls, hydronephrosis or nonfunctioning kidney, paraaortic, or pelvic lymph nodes.

IIIA: Involvement of lower-third of the vagina with no extension to the pelvic sidewall.

IIIB: Extension to the pelvic sidewalls, hydronephrosis, or nonfunctioning kidney

IIIC: Involvement of pelvic, para-aortic lymph nodes, irrespective of tumor size and extent

- IIIC1: Metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes only

- IIIC2: Metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes

**STAGE IV**: Extend beyond the true pelvis or involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa (biopsy-proven)

IVA: Spread to the adjacent pelvic organs

IVB: Spread to distant organs
