Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of a gene mutation. On chromosome 11, nucleotide mutation leads to substitution of glutamic acid to valine at position six on the beta-globin subunit.Â This leads to changes in the physical properties of the globin chain. Many inciting factors lead to this physical property change of red blood cells. Hypoxia, dehydration, exposure to cold or weather changes, stress, and infections are a few of these risk factors.
