Ongoing monitoring by nurses employed in medical offices that care for pregnant women should include education of women about fetal movements and prompt response to reports of decreased fetal movements. All office personnel that are in contact with a pregnant woman either during phone triage or prenatal assessments need to understand the importance of fetal movement monitoring and the need to listen to patient reports. Communication of concerns to the primary care clinician is critical in obtaining further evaluation, which has the potential of improving patient outcomes, especially with prompt assessment and intervention.
