Patients experiencing anginal chest pain require care coordination from the interprofessional healthcare team and should be comprehensively investigated for early diagnosis and management of the disease. The health care team should consist of a primary care clinician, cardiologist, nurse, pharmacist, and mid-level providers. Effective communication between the health care team and their patient can further lead to early diagnosis and pharmacotherapy initiation.

TheÂ primary care clinician should continually contact the cardiologist for any changes to their patient's medication regime and monitor the progress of the patient's disease course. The healthcare team should also monitor for recurring anginal symptoms as it can deteriorate the quality of a patient's life and prompt repeated hospital admissions. The healthcare team should be up to date with any recent updates in the literature on disease management as no exact guidelines for managing CSX have been established.

The primary care clinician should also investigate any underlying comorbidities and cardiovascular risk factors that may worsen CSX disease course and prognosis. Patient education by the healthcare team should be provided and encouraged routinely.
