Eczema herpeticum patients should be treated promptly with systemic acyclovir or valacyclovir to minimize the risk of complications and prevent progression to severe disease.

- **Mild cases**can be treated with oral acyclovir or valacyclovir for 7-21 days or until all lesions are crusted over.

- **Severe cases**or**immunocompromised patients**should be hospitalized for intravenous acyclovir 5-10 mg/kg every 8 hours. Patients can be transitioned to oral acyclovir once there is clinical improvement, and the lesions start to crust over.

- **Critically ill**patients may need intravenous fluids, electrolyte repletion, wound care, pain control, and nutritional support. Patients should be counseled about the risk of autoinoculation, and frequent handwashing should be encouraged. EH lesions are considered infectious until crusted over.

- **Contact precautions**should be initiated for hospitalized patients, including patient isolation and the use of face masks and gowns for healthcare providers.
