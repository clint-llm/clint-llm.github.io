Despite the advances in pharmacotherapy for treating some psychiatric disorders like anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and schizophrenia, many patients become refractory and will not respond to pharmacologic treatments.

The use of surgery for the treatment of psychiatric diseases is not a new concept. Historically, the concept of psychosurgery always raised general skepticism and stigma because of the way that it was used in the past with a high rate of complications and mortalities, but usually with little improvement in patients’ functionality.

In the late 1950s, pharmacotherapy was introduced and changed the approach in treating psychiatric conditions.
