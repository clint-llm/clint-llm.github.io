Prior to the induction of anesthesia, the surgeon and anesthesia provider will discuss the need for facial nerve monitoring and avoidance of a long-acting paralytic during induction. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is administered. Intravenous steroids can be given per surgeon preference. Once general anesthesia has been induced, and the patient has been intubated, the bed is turned 180 degrees. The surgical technician will move to the side opposite the ear to be operated, and the microscope will be at the head of the table.

With the goal of creating a sterile field that is free of hair, postauricular hair can either be shaved or separated from the field with adhesive drapes. Facial nerve monitoring electrodes are placed, and the proper equipment function is verified. Local anesthesia is typically injected into the EAC and postauricular incision (if used) to promote vasoconstriction and reduce pain.
