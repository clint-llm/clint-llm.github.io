Esophageal perforation can often be an obvious diagnosis if the patient presents after a traumatic event or if symptoms coincide with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

However, if a perforation is missed then the patient can present with chest pain, fever, or signs of systemic infection which can have a broad differential including, but not limited to:

- Myocardial infarction

- Mediastinitis

- Viral myocarditis

- Esophagitis

- Pulmonary embolism

- Aortic dissection

- GERD

- Gastritis
