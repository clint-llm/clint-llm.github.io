Traditionally, beta-blockers have been contraindicated in asthmatic patients. However, recommendations have aligned for allowing cardio-selective beta-blockers, also known as beta-1 selective, in asthmatics but not non-selective beta-blockers. Non-selective beta-blockers should not be used in patients with asthma.

Patients who have either acute or chronic bradycardia and/or hypotension have relatively contraindication to beta-blocker usage.

Specific beta-blockers are contraindicated depending on the patient's past medical history. Patients diagnosed with long QT syndrome or who have had torsades de pointes in the past should not use the drug sotalol. Patients with the Raynaud phenomenon should avoid beta-blockers due to the risk of exacerbation.
