**Multiple Classification Systems of Distal Radius Fractures**

**Frykman Classification**

Based on the pattern of intraarticular involvement

- Extraarticular distal radius fracture

- 1 + distal ulna fracture

- Intraarticular distal radius fracture involving radiocarpal joint

- 3 + distal ulna fracture

- Intraarticular distal radius fracture involving distal radioulnar joint

- 5 + distal ulnar fracture

- Intraarticular distal radius fracture involving radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joint

- 7 + distal ulna fracture

**Fernandez Classification**

Based on the mechanism of injury

- Metaphyseal bending fracture with the inherent problems of loss of volar tilt and radial shortening relative to the ulna

- Shearing fracture requiring reduction and often buttressing of the articular segment

- Compression of the articular surface without the characteristic fragmentation; also the potential for significant interosseous ligament injury

- Avulsion fracture or radiocarpal fracture-dislocation

- Combined injury with significant soft tissue involvement owing to high-energy injury

**Common Eponyms for Distal Radius Fractures**

Colles fracture

- Low energy, intraarticular and extraarticular distal radius fracture demonstrating dorsal angulation, dorsal displacement, and radial shortening

- Clinically, described as a “dinner fork” deformity

Smith fracture

- Low energy, extraarticular distal radius fracture demonstrating volar angulation

Barton fracture

- Fracture-dislocation or subluxation of the wrist. The dorsal or volar rim of the distal radius gets displaced with the hand and carpus

- Volar involvement is more common

Chauffeur’s fracture

- Avulsion fracture of the radial styloid

Die-punch fracture

- A depressed fracture of the lunate fossa of the articular surface of the distal radius
