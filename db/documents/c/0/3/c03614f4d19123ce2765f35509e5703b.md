The cold knife cone procedure is performed with a knife in the operating room and usually under general anesthetic. Candy cane stirrups or Allen stirrups are used for leg positioning. A colposcope, 5% acetic acid, or Lugolâ€™s solution can be used before the start of the procedure to assist the surgeon in identifying the lesion. A straight catheter to drain the bladder and weighted speculum with right angle retractor are used for visualization. The surgeon will also need a single tooth tenaculum, vasoconstrictive solution, a scalpel mounted on a 45-degree angle handle or a long-handled 11 blade. A pair of long-handled forceps or a long Allis clamp will be used for traction and long-handled Mayo scissors to excise the specimen. Some surgeons utilize stay sutures at the cervicovaginal junction and typically use a 2.0 delayed absorbable suture with the Heaney needle driver. A Bovie cautery tool is needed for hemostasis. A Kevorkian curette is used to perform the endocervical curettage after the cone is removed.
