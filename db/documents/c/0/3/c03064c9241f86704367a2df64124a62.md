Rubella, also known as German Measles, is a viral illness characterized by maculopapular rash, lymphadenopathy, and fever. It is a highly contagious but generally mild disease, and most cases do not lead to significant consequences. However, maternal infection during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause a fetal malformation syndrome known as congenital rubella syndrome. This activity reviews the presentation and management of congenital rubella syndrome and highlights the critical role of the interprofessional care team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the features commonly noted in patients with congenital rubella. 
- Explain how to diagnose congenital rubella. 
- Explain how to treat congenital rubella. 
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with congenital rubella.
