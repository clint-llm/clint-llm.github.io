These complications are mainly secondary to the extensive proteinuria that is seen with this disease.

Children and adults with MCD are at risk for developing complications such as:

- 
**Hypovolemia**

- **Infections (pneumonia, peritonitis, sepsis):**Secondary to the loss of immunoglobulins (IgG) and complement factors via the urine. Also, there is decreased opsonization of capsulated organisms.

- **Venous thromboembolism:**due to a decrease in antithrombin III, protein S, plasminogen, and increase in prothrombotic factors.

- 
**Hyperlipidemia**

- **Acute kidney injury:**From the intravascular volume depletion.
