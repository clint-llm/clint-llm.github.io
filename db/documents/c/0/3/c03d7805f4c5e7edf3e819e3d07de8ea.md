Patients with metastatic disease to the chest wall are best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes oncology nurses. Before deciding on hyperthermia, the patient functional status must be established. This treatment is not curative and is only palliative. Patients too ill should not undergo this treatment as it offers no benefit. In addition, patients with widespread metastases are not ideal candidates. The outcomes for most patients with metastatic disease to the chest wall are poor, irrespective of therapy. Hence, palliative care nurses should be involved early in their care.
