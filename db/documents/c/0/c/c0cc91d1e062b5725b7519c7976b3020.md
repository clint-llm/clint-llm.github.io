In general, decompression sickness (DCS) is thought to be caused by the generation of gas bubbles within the vasculature and organ tissues.

IsolatedÂ IEDCS is recognized in deep diving with the use of helium-oxygen mixtures, particularly when breathing gas is switched from a decompression mixture containing nitrogen back to a helium-containing mixture (e.g., the diver's bottom mix). This is most frequently seen in technical/professional divers but can be seen in deep-diving recreational divers as well. Though the actual mechanism is poorly understood, it is suspected that since helium has a much higher diffusion rate than nitrogen, diffusion of helium into tissues like endolymph that are already close to critical supersaturation could result in bubbling even while at a decompression stop where ambient pressure remains constant. This phenomenon is known as isobaric counter diffusion. Breathing gas switches should be carefully planned to avoid such effects and avoid changing diluents when tissues are close to critical supersaturation. All dives should incorporate appropriate decompression stops to minimize such risks.
