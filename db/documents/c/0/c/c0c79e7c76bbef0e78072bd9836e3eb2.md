Absolute contraindications for posterior epistaxis nasal packing include:

- Skull base fractures

- Significant nasal bone or maxillofacial trauma

- Airway compromise or hemodynamic instability (airway must be protected before nasal packing)

Relative contraindications include:

- Significant septal deviation (nasal packing and inflation of the balloon device will be more difficult)

- Cardiopulmonary instability or significant cardiopulmonary history (which may increase morbidity and mortality with posterior nasal packing)
