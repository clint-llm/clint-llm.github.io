The molecular mechanisms underlying primary testicular failure and the phenotypic heterogeneity of physical and neurocognitive features in KS are not well characterized. Studies are ongoing to determine the influence of genetic polymorphism, skewed X-inactivation, the parental origin of the extra X chromosome, and gene dosage.

Extra X-chromosome material is responsible for testicular hyalinization and fibrosis, leading to primary gonadal failure that often evolves through adolescence and young adulthood. Suppose there is early dysfunction. The affected newborn manifests microphallus, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and tiny testes. Later, evolving hypogonadism leads to incomplete puberty and gynecomastia. Finally, long-term hypogonadism and infertility are typical.

The additional gene dosage of the SHOX gene in the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome leads to tall stature, long limbs, and a reduced upper/lower segment ratio.

The pathophysiology of neuropsychological differences observed in KS is not well-understood.
