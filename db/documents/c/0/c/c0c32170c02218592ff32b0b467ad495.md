Many patients with a parathyroid adenoma are asymptomatic, with hypercalcemia incidentally discovered on routine lab work. Symptomatic parathyroid disease will most commonly manifest as symptoms of hypercalcemia such as bone pain, fatigue, polyuria, nephrolithiasis, constipation, and neuropsychiatric disturbance. More extreme elevations in calcium can cause complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, coma, and death. A patient is unlikely to have outward physical signs of a parathyroid adenoma. The pathologic gland itself is rarely palpable, and an obvious neck mass is more suggestive of thyroid pathology or parathyroid carcinoma.
