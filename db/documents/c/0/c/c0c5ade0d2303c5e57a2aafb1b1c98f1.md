The indications for osteochondral autograft transplantation varies. Hangody made suggestions for patient selection to maximize the chance for success. This included limiting surgery to patients younger than 45 years with good physical condition and focal lesions. A patient with global arthrosis is less of a candidate than a patient with a symptomatic small focal traumatic lesion. As long as a bony healing response can be expected, a wide range of age is acceptable for surgical indication. Knee joint due to its size and varied pathology is most easily approached with this technique.

A femoral condyle can be approached by an open or an orthoscopic method, but the retropatellar area and trochlear groove need an open approach. The tibia presents a unique difficulty because direct perpendicular access is not possible with either an open or an orthoscopic approach; an indirect retrograde method can be used. Care should be taken to obtain oblique grafts from the donor that match the angle of the recipient tunnel surface angle. Most report full-thickness cartilage lesions between 1 cm and 2.5 cm in diameter are appropriate. Studies have reported favorable outcomes in osteochondral autografts that have been larger, but these numbers are not widely accepted.
