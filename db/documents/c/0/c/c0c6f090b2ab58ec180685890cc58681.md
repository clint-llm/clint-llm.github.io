Rosuvastatin is a widely used medication for serum lipid-lowering. The drug is known to be effective for elevated lipid levels and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Prescribing and monitoring the patient will require interprofessional collaboration and communication between the clinicians (including NPs and PAs), pharmacists, nursing staff, and other subspecialties such as cardiologists who may have a role in adjusting the dosage of the medication. Monitoring for the effect of the drug and dose adjustment is best accomplished via an interprofessional approach, although it is manageable by a single provider. The drug does have multiple drug-drug interactions; therefore, it is helpful for pharmacists to check and flag any interactions. If any drug-drug interactions are present, the pharmacist must notify the provider immediately. Nursing also bears responsibility for monitoring for adverse reactions, helping assess therapeutic effectiveness, offering counsel to the patient, and serving as a liaison between the pharmacist and other providers and the prescriber. The prescribing provider should determine the risks versus benefits of the medication in conjunction with the patient after an informed consent discussion with shared decision making. Only with a collaborative interprofessional team approach can rosuvastatin therapy be optimized to deliver the appropriate therapeutic results for the patient. [Level 5]
