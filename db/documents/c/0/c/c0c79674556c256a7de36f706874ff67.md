There have been a variety of adverse effects reported with isoniazid use, with most being transient and low-grade. Patients experience gastrointestinal effects most commonly, and some patients also report a rash and/or pruritus. Peripheral neuropathy is also a commonly-associated adverse event of isoniazid therapy, although its incidence is less than 0.2%. The risk may increase in patients with diabetes, HIV, nutritional deficiency, renal failure, alcoholism, and in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. The mechanism of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy appears to involve interference of INH metabolites with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism, resulting in decreased amounts of biologically active B6. Thus, the treatment and prevention of peripheral neuropathy caused by isoniazid is pyridoxine supplementation during treatment.

Isoniazid is also a CYP450 inhibitor, potentially resulting in elevated serum concentrations of concurrent drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, diazepam, primidone, and others. Slow acetylators may be at a higher risk for these drug-drug interactions.

Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) has been reported in up to 1% of patients taking INH. Half of the patients in these cases present with fever and pleuritis, and 30% present with pericarditis. Some experts think that slow acetylation poses an increased risk for the development of INH-induced lupus.

Hepatotoxicity also occurs in a small percentage of patients, discussed below in “toxicity.”
