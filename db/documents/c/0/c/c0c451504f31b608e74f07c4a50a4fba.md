Similar to the management of any acute ischemic stroke, remember "TIME IS BRAIN." Rapid evaluation is essential to an orderly approach (algorithm) developed within each hospital or stroke center.

The management steps include:

- Intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with IV tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) within 3 to 4 1/2 hours of the onset of the ischemic stroke with slightly different exclusion criteria: overall, IV thrombolysis, within this period, improves functional stroke outcomes by 30%. Studies have shown that the window for posterior circulation strokes may be longer than 4 1/2 hours.

- Endovascular revascularization: the newer devices have been shown to improve outcomes, with the number needed to treat as low as 3. These are indicated mainly for large vessel intracranial occlusion, which carries a poor prognosis without revascularization.

- General medical therapy: patients are best monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 24 hours after IV thrombolysis. Otherwise, managing the patients in dedicated stroke units should be an alternative.

- IV fluid: avoid hypotonic solution to reduce risks of cerebral edema. Normal saline is generally preferred.

- Blood pressure (BP)management: cerebral autoregulation is impaired in the infarcted areas of the brain. Blood pressure oftenÂ drops gradually without any drug treatment. BP generally does not need to be lowered unless the patient receives IV thrombolysis or when it is over 220/120 mmHg.

- Speech therapy assessment is essential to assess swallow function and prevent any aspiration.

- Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis: This is performed with sequential pressure devices and low-dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LWMH).

- Blood sugar: best to keep the patient normoglycemic.

- Antithrombotics: antithrombotic therapy with aspirin does improve the outcome.

- Early physical therapy and occupational therapy with a good rehabilitation plan.

Secondary stroke prevention is decided after each patient's primary prevention outcome; this involves a multimodality approach:

- Carotid endarterectomy for significant large vessel extracranial stenosis

- Oral anticoagulation for cardioembolic strokes

- Antiplatelets such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or ASA/dipyridamole for other forms of stroke

- Statins

- Smoking cessation

- Good control of diabetes

- Good blood pressure control

- Healthy diet and lifestyle with regular exercises

This multimodal approach can reduce the risk of subsequent stroke by 80%.
