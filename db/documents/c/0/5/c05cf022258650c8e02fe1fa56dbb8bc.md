- Management and follow-up assessments of IOP in patients with OHT and glaucoma.

- Diagnosis, management, and differential diagnosis of numerous ophthalmologic conditions thatÂ cause elevated IOP (i.e., Posner-Schlossman syndrome, uveitis, a long-term steroid medication, pigment dispersion syndrome, etc.).

- IOP assessment before and after surgery.

- Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with infection, trauma without globe rupture, inflammation, etc.
