A scanning laser ophthalmoscope is an instrument that uses a collimated beam of laser light to image the ocular structures, especially the retina and optic nerve head. The SLO achieved a drastic reduction in the amount of light required to image the posterior segment of the eye in contrast to indirect ophthalmoscope and conventional fundus camera, thereby improving patient comfort during the procedure.

Though SLO for clinical practice was introduced as early as 1990, it was not routinely utilized due to disadvantages like inferior resolution, bulky equipment, and cost. These disadvantages were overcome by a "confocal" arrangement where the scattered light rays from the ocular structures are detected at a focal point conjugate to the focus of the point illuminated.
