Ilioinguinal neuralgia is a frequent cause of pain in the lower abdomen and the upper thigh and is commonly caused by entrapment or injury of the nerve after lower abdominal surgeries. The ilioinguinal nerve is responsible for motor innervation of the transverse abdominis and internal oblique muscles. It provides sensory innervation to a region of the upper anteromedial thigh. In males, it also supplies sensory innervation to the anterior surface of the scrotum and root of the penis and in females, supplies sensory innervation to the labia majora and mons pubis. Male or female patients with ilioinguinal neuralgia may complain of pain, paresthesia and abnormal sensation in the area supplied by the nerve. This activity explains when ilioinguinal neuralgia should be considered on differential diagnosis and reviews the proper evaluation and management of this condition. This activity stresses the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when ilioinguinal neuralgia should be included on differential diagnosis.
- Describe the evaluation of ilioinguinal neuralgia.
- Summarize the management options for ilioinguinal neuralgia.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of ilioinguinal neuralgia and improve outcomes.
