Radical orchiectomy provides both diagnostic and therapeutic implications in seminoma. It is indicated for all stages of the disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy depends upon the clinical staging that follows radical inguinal orchiectomy. Generally, treatment plans are as follows:

- **Stage I:**For patients with stage I seminoma, orchiectomy is usually curative.

- **Stage II:**Following radical inguinal orchiectomy, the treatment of stage II diseases depends on the extent of the lymph node involvement. Radiotherapy with or without cisplatin-based chemotherapy is recommended.

- **Stage III:**For stage III diseases,Â chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) or etoposide and cisplatin (EP) is preferred. Radiotherapy may be indicated in select cases.

After treatment patient requires life long follow up. Surveillance includes the following, with the frequency determined by the disease stage and duration of follow up.

- History and physical examination

- Serum tumor markers ( beta-hCG, LDH, AFP)

- Chest radiography

- CT scan of the abdomen, with or without CT scan of the pelvis
