Focal atrial tachycardias can arise from any or a combination of the three mechanisms causing tachyarrhythmias: enhanced automaticity, triggered, or reentry.

Focal atrial tachycardia often occurs as a result of abnormal automaticity and are challenging to initiate during an electrophysiology study and require drug infusion to induce.

During phase 4, the cardiac myocyte membrane is polarized and at baseline. The inwardly rectifying potassium channel is responsible for maintaining baseline resting potential near potassium equilibrium.

Abnormal automaticity occurs as a result of accelerated phase 4 upslope, leading to spontaneously depolarizing cells. When the cell experiences further hyperpolarization, and more negative than -70 mV, automaticity may occur via the "funny" current, carried by sodium and potassium ions in sinoatrial, AV nodal, and His-Purkinje cells.

The triggered activity has features seen with enhanced automaticity, though are felt to primarily involve calcium channels.  Similar to reentry, triggered activity is inducible during an electrophysiology study.
