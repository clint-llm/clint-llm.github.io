The TFL acts primarily toÂ abduct the femur as well as medially rotate the femur. The tensor fasciae latae does so by working in conjunction with the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, which also allow for femoral abduction. Injury to these abductor mechanisms can result in what is called a Trendelenberg gait, where the ipsilateral hip drops during footstrike due to the failure of the abductors properly functioning.
