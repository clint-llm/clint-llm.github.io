The muscles acting directly on or around the foot are responsible for many actions that allow for normal gait and posture. Injuries to these muscles can result in many conditions that may interfere with the ability to complete activities of daily living. Achilles tendon rupture, hammer toe, and pes planus (flat foot) are common conditions associated with the foot muscles. Each of these affects patients differently and may come with other comorbidities. Treatment of these conditions varies based on severity and the age of the patient. Conservative non-operative management of Achilles tendon rupture,Â for example, has shown to be non-inferior to operative management in older patients.
