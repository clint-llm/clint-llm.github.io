Bradykinin is a product of kallikrein induced breakdown of high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) in the kinin cascade. HMWK also serves as an inducer of the conversion of factor seven to factor seven A in the intrinsic pathway, or contact activation, of the coagulation cascade. Bradykinin is inactivated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs and kidneys.
