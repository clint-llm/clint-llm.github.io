Cord blood gas analysis is an objective measure of the fetal metabolic condition at the time of delivery. By determining fetal acid-base status, it helps identify infants at risk for neonatal encephalopathy.

Pathological acidosis reflects significant fetal distress due to hypoxic stress. As an isolated finding, it poorly predicts the risk of hypoxic-ischemic injury.
