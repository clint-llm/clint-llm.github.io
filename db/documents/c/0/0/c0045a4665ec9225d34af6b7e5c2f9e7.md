It has been proposed that mucous cysts could be an outpouching of the synovial lining of a joint. Studies have been performed where dye is injected into the joint and has shown communication between the joint and the cyst. However, when the dye is injected into the cyst, there does not appear to be a communication of the cyst to the joint. This could indicate that there is a one-way valve, where the fluid is originating from the joint but it is unable to go back into the joint. Others have proposed that there could be a rent in the tendon sheath or the capsule surrounding the joint, causing irritation and a local reaction and thus the formation of the cyst. Another theory is that the connective tissue surrounding the joint is undergoing mucoid degeneration, with byproducts of collagen breakdown collecting in the cyst.
