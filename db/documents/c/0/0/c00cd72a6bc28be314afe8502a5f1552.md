Clinicians can detect marijuana use up to 2–5 days after exposure for infrequent users and up to 1-15 days for chronic or heavy users.  Those with high body fat may have positive tests from 1 to 30 days. The actual detection times vary based on many factors, including the method of use, metabolism, and volume of distribution.  It also depends on the type of THC metabolite being tested for. False positives have been triggered by several medications and materials, although more detailed and expensive tests can differentiate further if necessary.

Assess ALT, AST, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment, with dose changes or the addition of or changes in hepatotoxic medications.

Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance by the FDA, and therefore is not accepted for medical use and has a high abuse potential from a federal point of view. As a result, doctors cannot prescribe marijuana, but doctors may certify its use in states that allow its use to treat medical conditions.  Both dronabinol (synthetic THC) and nabilone (a synthetic cannabinoid receptor antagonist) are individual oral agents registered for use in the US available commercially but have been difficult to titrate to receive therapeutic effects. As of now, it is not known to what extent a physician who certifies a patient for medical marijuana is liable for negative outcomes or whether medical insurance will cover liability.
