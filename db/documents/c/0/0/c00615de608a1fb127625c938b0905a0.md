While the etiologies of isolated mediastinal injuries are unknown, the most common cause of blunt thoracic trauma in the United States is motor vehicle accidents. Factors associated with mediastinal trauma in motor vehicle accidents include high speeds, not wearing a seatbelt, extensive motor vehicle damage, and the presence of steering wheel deformities. Penetrating thoracic trauma most often occurs from gunshots and stab wounds. Other less common causes of penetrating thoracic injury include impalement by objects as a result of industrial accidents, falls, collisions, blast injuries, and military devices.
