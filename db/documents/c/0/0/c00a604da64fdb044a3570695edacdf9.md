The primary assessment involves ABC's: airway, breathing, and circulation. Particular attention in the full assessment must be paid to the adequacy of ventilation, mental status function, and cardiac functioning. Unstable patients should be monitored continuously on telemetry and assessment of vitals occurring every fifteen minutes until stable.

Lab studies obtained may include a complete blood count, a metabolic profile that includes electrolytes, and an arterial or venous blood gas. Plain radiographs of the chest and abdomen may identify free air or pneumomediastinum.

In caustic ingestion, the grade of the injury should be determined, which will guide the next steps of management after initial resuscitation has been performed. Endoscopy has traditionally been used as a method of evaluating gastrointestinal injury. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) has been proposed as an alternative to endoscopy for the evaluation of lesions.
