The carotid sinus is a common site for the formation of atheromatous plaque predisposing to significant disabilities and fatal strokes. This plaque is detected and removed by procedures like carotid endarterectomy.

This location is also a site for unique tumors called the carotid bifurcation paragangliomas arising from the carotid bodies.

The sternocleidomastoid plays an important role, and its chronic denervation is essential in old patients with carotid sinus hypersensitivity.
