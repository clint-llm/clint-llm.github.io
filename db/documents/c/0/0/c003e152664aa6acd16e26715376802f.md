Didanosine, also known as ddI, is a purine nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that was used in combination with antiretroviral regimens of anti-HIV therapy. It was removed from the market due to adverse effects and drug interactions. The article is for historical purposes only. After its uptake into a cell, it works by inhibiting the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. It is also effective as a monotherapy.

Didanosine's primary use is in patients intolerant to zidovudine, abacavir, or tenofovir. Patients with the M184V mutation that are failing lamivudine therapy can switch to didanosine.

Didanosine therapy in children has shown potent in-vivo antiviral activity and delays in disease progression.
