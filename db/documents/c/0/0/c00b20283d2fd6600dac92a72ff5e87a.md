Nasopalatine duct cysts are developmental in origin, arising from epithelial remnants of the nasopalatine duct.

Nasolabial cysts are developmental in origin. There are currently two hypotheses that exist for the pathogenesis of these cysts. The first states that the cyst is formed from retained epithelial cells within the mesenchyme after the fusion of the nasal processes. The second proposes that the cyst arises from epithelial remnants of the nasolacrimal duct in the area of the nasal process and maxillary prominence. Both theories remain to be determined.

Palatal cysts of the neonate, also known as Epstein pearls or Bohnâ€™s nodules, result from keratin entrapment within the palate, resulting in cystic lesion formation.

Oral lymphoepithelial cysts have several theories regarding pathogenesis; however, the most accepted theory involves the association with oral lymphoid tissue (Waldyer ring) and the entrapment and/or accumulation of desquamated epithelial cells within a dilated crypt.

Epidermoid cysts are developmental in origin and are considered inclusion cysts that are derived from the ectoderm. These cysts can also be acquired by trauma resulting from the forced displacement of epithelial tissue into deeper tissue layers forming a cystic cavity.
