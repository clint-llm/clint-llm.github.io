If patients have minimal pain and no impairment of function, conservative treatment may be sufficient, even for angulated fractures. However, if there is any evidence of severe angulation, comminuted fractures, neurovascular injury, functional impairment, or unmanageable pain, patients should be referred to a hand surgeon.Â  Thorough education with patients regarding management options should be discussed.
