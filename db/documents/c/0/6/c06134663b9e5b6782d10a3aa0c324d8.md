Soft tissue radionecrosis refers to the delayed effects of radiation therapy which result in tissue breakdown from the impaired blood supply radiation damaged tissue. Radiation can damage capillary beds and arterioles which lead to relative tissue hypoxia resulting in the characteristic fibrosis, and these tissue changes can develop over time, remote from the time of the original radiation exposure. The soft tissue radionecrosis can develop 6 months to several years after the exposure. Capillaries can regrow by the process of angiogenesis, but in the hypoxic radiation-damaged tissue, the new capillaries tend to grow disorganized resulting in telangiectasias. This abnormal neovascularization results in inadequate tissue perfusion which can cause further breakdown from tissue necrosis and skin ulceration. Just minor trauma or surgical procedures can result in tissue breakdown and ulceration. The radiation can damage superficial and deep tissue. Spinal and brain soft tissue radionecrosis can be especially problematic to treat. The dose of the radiation exposure is usually over 5000 cGy (Centi-gray), but it can be seen with as little as 3000 cGy.
