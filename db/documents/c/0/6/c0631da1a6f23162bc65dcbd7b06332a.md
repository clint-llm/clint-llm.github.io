Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as the presence of kidney damage or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 square meters, persisting for 3 months or more. It is a state of progressive loss of kidney function ultimately resulting in the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation). This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and management of chronic kidney disease and emphasizes the roles of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with chronic kidney disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for developing chronic kidney disease.
- Review the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for chronic kidney disease.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the management of chronic kidney disease and improve patient outcomes.
