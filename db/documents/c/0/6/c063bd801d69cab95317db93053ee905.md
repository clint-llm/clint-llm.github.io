**Acetylcholine Receptors**

The nervous system utilizes many neurotransmitters for communication and function. The primary neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system is acetylcholine (ACh). ACh is synthesized in the cytoplasm of presynaptic neurons by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). It is subsequently relocated to synaptic vesicles by vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), where it is stored. When the presynaptic neuron becomes stimulated via depolarization, ACh gets released through exocytosis into the synaptic cleft, where it acts on presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors by binding to them. These receptors include muscarinic (M) and nicotinic (N) types, each with their respective subtypes. There are five subtypes of muscarinic receptors, M1 thru M5, all of which are G protein-coupled receptors.

**Scopolamine**

Scopolamine (also known as hyoscine) is an alkaloid compound. It competitively antagonizes the action of ACh at muscarinic receptors both centrally and peripherally. It is selective to muscarinic receptors but is non-selective between the muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1 thru M5). Because ACh is the principal neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, scopolamine acts as a parasympatholytic agent.

**Nausea and Vomiting**

Multiple proposed mechanisms of nausea and vomiting involve various systems (e.g., vestibular, gastrointestinal, etc.). Furthermore, the specific pathways that these systems utilize to stimulate nausea and vomiting are not clearly understood. The precise locations and functions of nervous system structures involved in nausea and vomiting require further research.

For these reasons, the exact mechanisms by which scopolamine prevents nausea and vomiting are unclear. The proposed pathways generally involve scopolamine inhibiting cholinergic communications between higher CNS centers, the reticular formation in the brainstem, the vestibular nuclei, the cerebellum, the glossopharyngeal nerve, and the vagus nerve. Additional structures may be involved, and scopolamine’s exact role is unclear. Furthermore, all five muscarinic receptor subtypes M1 thru M5 show expression in the brain, and the roles of each subtype relative to nausea and vomiting remain unclear.

A discussion of the mechanisms involved in scopolamine’s adverse effects is in the Adverse Effects section of this article.
