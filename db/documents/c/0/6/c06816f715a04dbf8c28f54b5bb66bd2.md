Functional endoscopic sinus surgery is the most commonly performed procedure for CRS. With the availability of fine instruments and high-resolution imaging, rhinologists are now able to dissect and open sinuses more aggressively. However, rhinologists should not only rely on imaging studies, navigation, and instruments; they should understand the anatomy and be mindful of all the possible complications, the minor and the major. Safe operation requires following the steps of FESS and identifying the constant landmarks at every stage.
