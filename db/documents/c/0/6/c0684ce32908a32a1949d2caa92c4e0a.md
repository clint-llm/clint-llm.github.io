- Debriefing needs to occur following simulation exercises to be effective.

- The scheduled debriefing time should be for at least the anticipated duration of the simulation exercise. For example, a 10-minuteÂ simulation will need at least a 10-minute debriefing.

- Learner self-assessment, facilitator directed feedback, and conversational feedback is three options that facilitators can use to address their feedback. These methods can be blended to best suit the needs of the simulation.

- Reflective observation is an opportunity for simulation participants to reflect upon and evaluate their performance.

- The Advocacy Inquiry Method (AIM) seeks to understand the underlying reason a simulation participant performed a particular action.

- Directive feedback is a useful technique when addressing a gap in procedural knowledge, but maybe less preferred by learners than other models.

- Novice facilitators will need support to be proficient at debriefing simulation exercises. Written tools or formal training can provide a framework for a debriefing for novice facilitators.
