A volvulus is a medical condition where the intestines twist upon themselves. This condition can occur at any age. However, it is more frequent in children and infants. A volvulus can cause a blockage that may cut off blood flow usually due to a congenital anomaly called intestinal malrotation; this can occur in any part of the intestine without this condition present. Intestinal malrotation can make an infant more likely to develop a midgut volvulus and usually occurs in the first few weeks of life. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of midgut volvulus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of midgut volvulus.
- Discuss the evaluation of midgut volvulus.
- List the treatment and management options available for midgut volvulus.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance knowledge regarding midgut volvulus and improve outcomes in pediatric patients.
