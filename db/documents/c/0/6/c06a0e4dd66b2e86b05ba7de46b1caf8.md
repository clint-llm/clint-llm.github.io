Facial paralysis can cause significant decreases in quality of life due to social and functional impacts. Facial nerve repair and transfer provide the potential for restoration of mimetic facial function with a good risk-to-benefit ratio, as only minor complications are typically reported. The best results are usually seen in young, healthy patients with distal facial nerve injuries that are repaired quickly, as in facial lacerations or iatrogenic injuries. Worse outcomes are expected when the injury is proximal, the patient is older or in poor health, and the paralysis is chronic, as in advanced parotid malignancies and recurrent cholesteatomas. Patients with slow-growing benign tumors or trauma fare best, while those with malignant and inflammatory pathologies fare worse. The first clinical signs of facial reinnervation can be expected to appear anywhere from 2 to 12 months postoperatively.
