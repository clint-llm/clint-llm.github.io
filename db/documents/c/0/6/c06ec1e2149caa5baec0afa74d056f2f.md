Several different medical subspecialists commonly perform upper blepharoplasty: ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, dermatologists, and even dentists, gynecologists, and general practitioners. Without careful screening of patients, complications may occur. At the very least, undesirable outcomes may be experienced by the patient. Outcomes may be improved if all surgeons carefully consider the important aspects of blepharoplasty as discussed and the nursing staff carefully monitors the patient for postoperative complications.
