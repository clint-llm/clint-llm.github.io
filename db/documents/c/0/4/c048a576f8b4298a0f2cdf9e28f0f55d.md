Rifampin produces bactericidal antimicrobial activity by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) either by sterically blocking the path of the elongating RNA at the 5′ end or by decreasing the affinity of the RNAP for short RNA transcripts. It specifically inhibits the microbial RNAP, halting further RNA synthesis.
