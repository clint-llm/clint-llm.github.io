Genetic mutations underlie much of human disease and evolution. Although rare in themselves, approximately 1 in 15 people are affected by a genetic disorder. Furthermore, various diseases have a multifactorial etiology, of which genetic mutations are a contributory factor, including conditions such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and infertility. Additionally, the role of acquired genetic mutations cannot be understated in their role in carcinogenesis, particularly if the affected genes are critical in cell cycle progression and growth regulation, such as TP53.

Furthermore, the acquisition of genetic mutations throughout an individualâ€™s lifetime leads to aging, as cells either undergo apoptosis or enter senescence. All healthcare practitioners encounter genetic mutations in their work, even if they may be unaware, that is the case. Cancer, chronic conditions, and the diseases of aging all share the common foundation of genetic mutations.

As NGS techniques continue to evolve and become more cost-effective, healthcare practitioners will more readily have access to genetic testing for their patients and families. Though there may be pitfalls, such as VUS, more genetic variants will be accounted for and described in the literature over time. The combination of lower barriers to genetic testing and robust literature will provide practitioners the opportunity for improved decision-making in many of their patients.
