Myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow is blocked in the coronary vessels that supply the heart muscle with oxygen.

A basal amount of troponin is found in the circulation of healthy individuals from the regular turnover of cardiac myocytes.

Troponin levels typically start to elevate in the circulation within two to three hours of the onset of chest pain. The levels will continue to rise until a peak is reached, generally between 12 and 48 hours. The troponin level will then fall to normal over the next four to ten days.

Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) have amino acid sequences that differ from the skeletal isoforms and are encoded by unique genes.

In humans, cTnT isoform expression has been demonstrated in skeletal muscle specimens obtained from patients with muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and end-stage renal disease.
