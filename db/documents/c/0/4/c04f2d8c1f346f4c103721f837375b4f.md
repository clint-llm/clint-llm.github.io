Congenital syphilis may present similarly to other disease processes which should also be considered by the clinician. These include neonatal sepsis especially given the pneumonia-like chest x-ray findings in CS. Other considerations include TORCH infections including Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus. Neonatal hepatitis should also be considered given hepatomegaly and elevated LFTs. Co-infections with HIV should also be considered.
