To discern each carcinoma subtype, Radiotracers are often used to distinguish specific biological features and as a follow-up diagnostic method for surveillance and evaluation of metastatic disease.

In the thyroid, follicular epithelial cells demonstrate avid iodide uptake mediated by the sodium-iodide symporter. The partially preserved activity of this transporter in the aberrant cells of differentiated carcinomas is the foundation for the successful therapeutic and diagnostic utility of radioiodide interventions.
