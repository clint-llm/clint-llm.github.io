Gaucher disease (pronounced as GO-SHEY) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene GBA1 is an enzyme that cleaves beta-glucosidic linkage of glucocerebroside lipids. Inborn errors of metabolism are particularly relevant in pediatrics since their presentation is very often (but not always) in the neonatal period of infancy. There are five known types of Gaucher disease: type 1, type 2, type 3, perinatal lethal and cardiovascular. The perinatal lethal form is the most severe and its complications can begin before birth or in early infancy.

Knowing the major manifestations of any inborn error of metabolism is the key to making a diagnosis. Inborn errors of metabolism primarily result from the lack (or insufficient levels) of specific enzymes needed: (1) convert fat or carbohydrates to energy or to; (2) breakdown amino acids or other metabolites, allowing them to accumulate and become toxic if not treated. Gaucher disease is a “toxic accumulation” inborn error of metabolism due to the accumulation of glucocerebroside lipids. It is the most common cause of lysosomal storage diseases. Lysosomes are subcellular organelles responsible for the physiological turnover of cell constituents. Toxic accumulation inborn errors of metabolism fall into three major categories, localized toxicity, circulating toxicity or a combination of both. Gaucher disease is an example of localized toxicity.
