Although the gold standard for gallbladder surgery is a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it is imperative that surgeons are also comfortable doing open cholecystectomies. Certain conditions mandate a planned open technique as the initial surgery. However, in laparoscopic cases, the surgeon must be prepared to convert to the open technique during an operation.

There is no substitute for experience and using appropriate clinical judgment in tough cases. Preparation is key, and asking for help when the situation arises should not be forgotten or looked down upon. There is no substitute for safety. Residents should never pass up the chance to scrub an open chole. They are not very common anymore. The reason the case is open typically is preceded by some difficult issue that forces this technique.
