Treatment of a cervical dissection depends on many factors such as the cause (traumatic vs. spontaneous), and whether the patient has had a stroke. Â Also, whether this dissection is intracranial or extracranial will alter the treatment plan. Active bleeding with hematoma expansion will also be a factor in deciding treatment.

If there are no contraindications, antiplatelets may be used, or more commonly, systemic anticoagulation may be used to minimize the risk of a stroke. Also, endovascular stenting may be performed on some of these patients, especially if there are contraindications to anticoagulation or if medical management fails. The one-year recurrence rate is 0-10%.
