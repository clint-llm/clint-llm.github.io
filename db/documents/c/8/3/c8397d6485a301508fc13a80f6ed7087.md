Histologically, the malignancy is composed of spindle-shaped and polyhedral cells, demonstrating various patterns of vascular channels. Solid areas that resemble fibrosarcoma and polynuclear giant cells may also be seen. It is common to see tumor invasion of a portal and hepatic vein branches. Areas of infarct, atrophy, and fibrosis are also commonly seen as parenchymal loss causes scarring and occlusion of pre-existing vessels. CD31, CD34, Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, and factor VIII-related antigen are immunohistochemical markers that can be used to aid diagnosis. Due to the highly vascular nature of the tumor, liver biopsy has a high risk of morbidity and mortality.
