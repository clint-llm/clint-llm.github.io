Patients on oxaliplatin therapy must periodically have blood and urine work up to assess complete blood count with differential, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG) for QT prolongation.

Oxaliplatin has a narrow therapeutic index, which most commonly affects the hematopoietic and nervous systems and has gastrointestinal side effects.
