Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and ertugliflozin are FDA-approved for managing adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) to improve blood sugar control adjunct to diet and exercise. All four agents are sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors acting on the SGLT-2 proteins expressed in the renal proximal convoluted tubules to reduce the reabsorption of filtered glucose, decrease the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), and promote urinary glucose excretion. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other vital factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in managing adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) to improve glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular and renal complications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the proposed mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors in Type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease.
- Implement the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors.
- Assess the potential adverse effects of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.
- Collaborate with the interprofessional team to improve care coordination and communication to advance the use of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in treating adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to achieve glycemic control, improve certain types of heart failure, and improve outcomes.
