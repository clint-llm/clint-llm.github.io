**Foot Drop**

Because the primary function of the tibialis anterior is dorsiflexion, paralysis of this muscle results in “foot drop,” or an inability to dorsiflex, this paralysis can be caused by nerve injury, like direct damage to the deep peroneal nerve, or a muscle disorder, like ALS. “Foot drop” is often most obvious during gait when the patient cannot clear their foot during the swing phase.

**Tendinitis**

The tibialis anterior tendon (TAT), like any tendon, can become irritated and inflamed—a condition known as tibialis anterior tendinitis. Excessive tension on the tendon causes tendinitis, often due to repetitive, high-force activities, for example, hill running or direct contact with equipment, like a shoe that is too tight around the ankle and the tendon. Because the tendon traverses the anterior ankle and inserts on the medial foot, most patients will complain of pain at the front of the ankle or the medial midfoot. Pain will be aggravated by the stressful activity and alleviated by rest. Symptoms usually present gradually and get progressively worse.

On exam, the patient will have tenderness over the tendon and maybe even swelling. Loading the tendon, as in dorsiflexion, will exacerbate the pain. Treatment is conservative. Because the injury is due to exertion, the primary treatment is limiting activity. NSAIDs can be used for analgesia. It is also important to stretch the calf, decreasing the resistance to dorsiflexion. A stabilizing or restricting ankle brace may also decrease the load through the tendon.

**Tibial Stress Syndrome (Shin Splints)**

The tibialis anterior muscle is often overused, resulting in a tibial stress syndrome commonly known as shin splints. Anterior tibial stress syndrome (ATSS) is acute and experienced by new runners or walkers; medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) is more chronic and occurs in athletes. The tibialis anterior muscle is more commonly involved in the former, while the tibialis posterior muscle is more commonly involved in the latter. However, the tibialis anterior can also cause MTSS. Both syndromes are caused by repetitive stress and strain on the tibia, often due to training errors or various biomechanical abnormalities. Training errors include the recent onset of increased activity, intensity, or duration (doing “too much, too fast”) or running/walking on hard or uneven surfaces. Biomechanical abnormalities include hyperpronation of the subtalar joint (eversion) and tibial torsion. Tibial stress syndrome, particularly MTSS, can progress to a stress fracture of the tibia. This is more common in females than males due to a higher incidence of diminished bone density and osteoporosis.

In ATSS, the patient will present with tightness or tenderness in the anterior muscles of the leg that is aggravated by running or walking and alleviated with rest. The pain may begin as a dull ache but often progresses to sharper pain. As the injury progresses, pain may be present even at rest.

Since tibial stress syndrome results from overuse and repetitive stress, rest is the most important treatment in the acute phase. Ice and NSAIDs can provide analgesia. It is critical to modify the training routine and add stretching and strengthening exercises in the long term. Stretching helps prevent muscle fatigue and subsequent strain on the tibia where muscles attach; strengthening muscles, like the tibialis anterior, helps control movement to reduce stress on the tibia. It is also important to correct underlying biomechanical abnormalities.

**Anterior Compartment Syndrome**

Compartment syndrome occurs when tissue pressure within a closed, non-extensible muscle compartment exceeds the perfusion pressure. Pressure greater than 30 mm Hg (in relaxed muscles, normal tissue pressure is 10 to 12 mm Hg) compromises circulation and can lead to necrosis and/or ischemia. In acute compartment syndrome, the increased pressure is caused by bleeding or edema, usually due to fracture or trauma. In chronic compartment syndrome (CCS), the increased pressure in skeletal muscle is due to overexertion. Unlike other exertional injuries, like ATSS or MTSS, chronic compartment syndrome won’t respond to NSAIDs or physical therapy. In the leg, the anterior compartment is most frequently affected by compartment syndrome.

Patients with compartment syndrome often present with ischemic pain, described as greater pain than one might expect given the clinical situation. The pain can be reproduced by passively stretching the muscles in the affected compartment. For example, in anterior compartment syndrome, plantarflexion will increase pain. In CCS, like other exertional injuries, the pain is aggravated by activity and alleviated by rest. Patients may also develop paresthesia due to nerve ischemia or paralysis of the affected muscles; however, neurological symptoms may also be due to a concurrent nerve injury. Ischemia may also lead to pallor and pulselessness, though the latter may be a sign of arterial injury instead. Finally, swelling is common and can make the leg feel firm and “wooden” upon palpation.

Early diagnosis of compartment syndrome is critical to avoiding poor outcomes, such as infection, contracture, and amputation. Diagnosis requires awareness of the syndrome and appropriate examination. Intra-compartmental pressure can also be measured to diagnose compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy is the standard treatment; the recommendation is to decompress all four compartments. Chronic compartment syndrome can be treated nonoperatively with complete cessation of all causative activities and massage therapy. In general, nonoperative treatment is unsuccessful.
