Administration of alpha-1 receptor agonists is done intravenously through a central line for shock. In the setting of anaphylaxis, epinephrine administration should be either intramuscular or subcutaneous, not intravenous. Phenylephrine can be administered orally for congestion. Alpha-1 receptor antagonists can be administered orally for refractory hypertension, behavioral modification, and urinary hesitancy.  In the emergent setting, the administration of alpha-1 blockade agents can be via the intravenous route. Alpha-1 antagonists are predominantly administered orally and in the outpatient setting. Alpha-2 agonists can be given orally or intravenously, depending on the setting and requirement.
