The implications and role of a change in ADLs in any particular patient differ among the various stakeholders in the patient’s care team.

- Case manager, nurse, and social worker

- Primary care clinician

- Home health or skilled nursing agencies

- Physical and occupational therapy

- Long-term care insurance providers

- Government agencies

The nurse and care manager typically assess and collect information on a person’s ability to perform ADLs. This data enables them to plan for each person’s continuum of care. The physicians use the assessments to formulate and plan of care which is then provided to the home health agency or skilled nursing agency. The agency will then select the appropriate staff needed for each client. The physical and occupational therapists work with the plan of care and document the progress in ADL to ensure the rehabilitation goals are achieved to the extent possible. Insurance providers and government agents use the assessments of ADL to determine the patient's qualifications and pay for the services rendered.
