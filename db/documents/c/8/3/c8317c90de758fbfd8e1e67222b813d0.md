The differential diagnosis of gyrate atrophy includes the following conditions:

- Choroideremia

- Retinitis pigmentosa

- Congenital stationary night blindness

- X-linked retinoschisis

- Bietti crystalline dystrophy

- Pigmented paravenous retinochoroidal atrophy

- Bifocal chorioretinal atrophy

- Pathological myopia

- Choroidal sclerosis

- Gyrate atrophy-like phenotypes with normal plasma ornithine

- Extensive paving stone (cobblestone) degeneration, which however is peripheral

These conditions can be differentiated from GA on the basis of the patient's history, inheritance pattern, clinical picture, laboratory findings, genetic analysis, electrophysiology, and multimodal imaging analysis.
