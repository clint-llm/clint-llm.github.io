The gluteus maximus receives vascular supplyÂ from both the inferior and superior gluteal arteries. These vessels enter the gluteus maximus at the center of the muscle. The inferior gluteal artery proceeds to descend along the greater trochanter of the femur. It accompanies the descent of the sciatic nerve, which proves to be critical as rupture of the inferior gluteal artery can cause gluteal compartment syndrome and sciatic nerve palsy.
