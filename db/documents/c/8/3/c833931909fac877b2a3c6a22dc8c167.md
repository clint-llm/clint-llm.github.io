Although the exact cause of acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction is unknown, current theories suggest that the inhibition of parasympathetic activity, dysregulation of stretch receptors, and decreased ganglion cells in the colonic smooth muscle play an important role.Â Specifically, decreased parasympathetic activity, which plays an excitatory role for colonic motility, from the sacral plexus is thought to play a role in colonic atony.

The pathophysiology of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is better understood with multiple causes identified. Neuropathies, myopathies, or abnormalities of the interstitial cells of Cajal have all been attributed to CIPO.
