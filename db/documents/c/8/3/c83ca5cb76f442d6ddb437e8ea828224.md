The flexor digitorum profundus is a flexor of the midcarpal (wrist), metacarpophalangeal, and interphalangeal joints of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Since the lumbricals arise from the flexor digitorum profundus tendons and insert into the dorsal extensor expansions of the proximal phalanges, the flexor digitorum profundus muscle aids the lumbricals in fully extending the fingers at the interphalangeal joints and flexing the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints. Flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints depends on wrist positioning and the tension generated at the distal joints is reduced when the wrist is fully flexed.
