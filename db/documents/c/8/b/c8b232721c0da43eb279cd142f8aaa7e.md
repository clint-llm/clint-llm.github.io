**Characteristic Features Noted in Individuals with Clinical Anxiety**

- False alarms: The presence of intense fear in the absence of threat cues or very minimal threat provocation.

- Persistence: There is a future-oriented perspective that involves the anticipation of threat or danger which causes the patient to experience a heightened level of apprehension and thoughts about impending potential threat, regardless of whether it materializes.

- Impaired Functioning: Anxiety interferes with effective and adaptive coping in the face of a perceived threat and the person’s daily social or occupational life.

- Stimulus hypersensitivity: In clinical states, fear is elicited by a wider range of stimuli or situations of relatively mild intensity that would be innocuous to a person who does not have clinical anxiety.

- Dysfunctional cognition and cognitive symptoms: Thinking characterized by overestimation of threat or danger appraisal of a situation that is not confirmed in any way.
