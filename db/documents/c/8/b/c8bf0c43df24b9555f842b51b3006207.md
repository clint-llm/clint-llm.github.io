The nucleus pulposus is poorly vascular as its cells express Fas ligand which causes apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells, which in turn creates poor blood vessel growth. Also, a few factors are released by notochordal cells during development that can suppress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the blood vessels that supply nutrients to the nucleus pulposus are located mainly in the longitudinal ligaments that travel next to the disc as well as in cartilaginous endplates(CEP). Most of the nutrients used by the intervertebral discs are from diffusion via the CEP or the blood supply in the outer annulus fibrosis.
