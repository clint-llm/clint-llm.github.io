**Hippus**

Random fluctuations of the pupil that are often observed under continual retinal illumination.

**Alternating Contraction Anisocoria**

Direct pupillary constriction of the eye exceeds the consensual constriction of the contralateral pupil. This phenomenon may be unilateral or bilateral. In one subset of unilateral contraction anisocoria, the pupillary response of one side always exceeds that of the other eye. This subset is often confused with a relative pupillary afferent defect. The cause is hypothesized to be a lesion at the posterior commissure and one or both brachia of the superior colliculus due to damage of combination of both first and second-order neurons.

**Few diagnostic pearls:**

- RAPD with normal visual acuity, color vision, field defects suspect higher-order lesion at the level of the pretectum

- RAPD in one eye and contralateral field defects or specifically temporal field defects - optic tract lesion

- RAPD and NVI (new vessels of the iris) - look for ischemic CRVO

- RAPD and anisocoria - Repeat test after 30 minutes of light adaptation

- Cataract and same eye RAPD - suspect posterior segment pathology

- Cataract and contralateral eye RAPD - can be a transient phenomenon or posterior segment lesion of the other eye such as recovered optic neuritis
