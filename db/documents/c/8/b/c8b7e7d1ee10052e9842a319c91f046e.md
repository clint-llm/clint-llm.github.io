The oral mucosa has a large number of functions of clinical significance. It acts as a protective physical and immune barrier from external stimulus and harbors minor salivary glands that secret saliva maintaining the wetness of the tissue, and perceives and responds to the stimulus of temperature, touch, and pain. Multiple diseases may affect the oral mucosa and impair its capacity to develop these tasks. To mention some examples, the oral epithelium disruption can cause various oral mucosal lesions such as oral lichen planus and oral leukoplakia. Oral carcinomas, such as squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), have been developed when the oral epithelial barrier of the mucosa is disrupted and keratinocytes undergo defective differentiation

Common superficial oral mucosa lesions include recurrent herpes labialis, candidiasis, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, erythema migrans, hairy tongue, and lichen planus
