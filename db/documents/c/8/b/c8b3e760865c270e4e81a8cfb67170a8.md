Understanding how hormones interact to maintain the body tightly within the strict limits of homeostasis is imperative. With a firm grasp of endocrine physiology, pathology often becomes straightforward. When a hormone is either elevated or decreased, it will present a certain way â€“ due to its lack or excess of action; this allows providers to hone in their differential diagnosis, order the appropriate laboratory tests and imaging, to pinpoint the diagnosis, and provide treatment. This diagnosis is not always as easy as it sounds since hormones are often intricately related and may influence other hormones, which are the primary presenting symptoms. For example, when prolactin is elevated, GnRH is inhibited, resulting in amenorrhea and infertility because of low FSH and LH levels.

It may be tempting to focus only on the reproductive organs or their hormones for not functioning correctly when in actuality, hyperprolactinemia is the culprit. Rarely, one has to consider hormone resistance syndromes when there is a discrepancy between elevated hormone levels and target organ function, i.e., receptor defects such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus pseudohypoparathyroidism, etc.
