The inferior alveolar and lingual nerves provide sensation to the structures of the lower face, including the teeth, skin, and oral mucosa. Injuries to these nerves can be caused by surgical procedures, trauma, or tumors involving the mouth and mandible. Such injuries can cause significant discomfort during daily activities, including chewing, eating, and speaking. Healthcare providers need to understand the anatomical course of the nerves to minimize the risk of injuries. However, if an injury occurs, clinicians should be able to recognize it and accurately assess the extent of the damage. Moreover, patients with nerve damage should be managed promptly to minimize the likelihood of long-term dysfunction. This activity will cover the etiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management of inferior alveolar and lingual nerve injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the possible causes of inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injuries.
- Outline clinical presentations of inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injuries.
- Review how to diagnose and classify inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injuries.
- Summarize management of inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve injuries.
