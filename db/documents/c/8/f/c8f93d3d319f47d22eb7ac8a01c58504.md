**Sjogren Syndrome**

Sjogren’s syndrome is commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. The syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that demonstrates decreased lacrimal and salivary gland function that can also have associated systemic symptoms

**Cystic Fibrosis**

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease that causes impaired chloride transport due to a mutation of the CFTR protein.  Because CFTR is involved in the production of sweat, mucus, and digestive fluids, the mutation causes a direct effect on exocrine gland secretions.  Indeed, approximately 90% of infants born with cystic fibrosis will develop pancreatic insufficiency by one year of age

**Acne vulgaris**

The prevalence of acne is an estimated 35 to 90% in adolescents Propionibacterium acnes with associated inflammation. As sebum accumulates, an open comedo forms, also known as a white head. Hyperkeratinization and increased sebum production lead to clogging of the pores of the pilosebaceous unit. As the lipids within sebum oxidize, the follicular orifice opens, forming an open comedo, or blackhead.

Treatment for acne largely depends on the severity of inflammatory symptoms, but topical retinoids are usually the first-line treatment, although antimicrobial agents are an additional option for refractory cases
