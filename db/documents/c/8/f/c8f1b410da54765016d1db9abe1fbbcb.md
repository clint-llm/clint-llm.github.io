Palatal and gingival cysts of the newborn should be differentiated from natal and neonatal teethÂ and congenital epulis.

Natal and neonatal teeth are rare and usually located in the lower incisors region.

Congenital epulis is a benign pedunculated soft swelling of 1 mm to several centimeters in diameter, typically located in the anterior maxillary ridge and present at birth. It is occasionally diagnosed in utero.
