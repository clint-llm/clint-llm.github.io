Delay in development occurs when the child fails to attain developmental milestones as compared to peers from the same population. It is caused by impairment in any of the following distinct domains, such as gross and fine motor, speech and language, cognitive and performance, social, psychological, sexual, and activities of daily living (ADL). It can be isolated (involving a single domain), multiple (involving two or more domains, or global (affecting most developmental areas). In order to avoid long term disability, early detection, and intervention is warranted. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the comprehensive evaluation of developmental delay using standardized developmental surveillance and screening instruments in addition to lab workup and imaging.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of developmental delay and related medical conditions.
- Summarize the evaluation of developmental delay.
- Describe appropriate management options available for developmental delay.
- Summarize the expected prognosis of a patient with a developmental delay.
