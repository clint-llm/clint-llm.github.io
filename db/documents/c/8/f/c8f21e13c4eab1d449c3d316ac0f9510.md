The diagnosis of crocodile tears syndrome should be considered after excluding common differential diagnoses such as simple epiphora following Bell palsy.

Other differentials include nasolacrimal duct obstruction, conjunctivitis, and allergies. These conditions are not associated with hyperlacrimation, and typically the patient will give no history of increased tearing while eating food. Furthermore, in crocodile tears syndrome, the clinical examination of the eye and its appendages will be within normal limits. Also, a latency of 6 months is usually present between the onset of facial nerve palsy and crocodile tears syndrome for the nerves to regenerate.
