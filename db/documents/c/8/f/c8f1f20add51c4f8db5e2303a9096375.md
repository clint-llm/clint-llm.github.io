The etiology of ALHE is not fully understood, and it is not clear whether it consists of a vascular neoplasm or a lymphoproliferative process.

The first hypothesis has support by the association with arteriovenous shunts in 43% of the cases as well as the frequency of preceding trauma (friction, surgery, frostbite, laceration, etc.), similarly to pyogenic granuloma.

The second hypothesis of ALHE as a lymphoproliferative disorder has support from the condition's progressive course and frequent recurrences. Interestingly, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement and monoclonality have been previously observed in ALHE cases, raising the possibility to consider this condition as a low-grade T-cell lymphoma.

Finally, whether ALHE is a true vascularÂ neoplasia with a rich inflammatory component or a lymphoproliferative process with a reactive angiogenic response is yet to be clarified.
