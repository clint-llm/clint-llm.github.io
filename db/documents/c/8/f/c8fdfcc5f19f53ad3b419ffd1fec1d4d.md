Many patients infected with T. gondii are asymptomatic. However, some immunocompetent patients with acute infection may complain of vague symptoms, including fevers, chills, headaches, pharyngitis, myalgias, rash, or hepatosplenomegaly. More commonly, patients may complain of non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy that can persist for weeks.

Immunosuppressed individuals with severe complications may present with signs and symptoms related to the affected organ. HIV-infected patients typically present with neurological symptoms, although the extracerebral disease can also occur.

- Cerebral toxoplasmosis usually presents with neurological symptoms based on the region of the brain involved and the number of lesions. Symptoms may include fevers, seizures, headaches, change in vision, altered mental status, focal neurological deficits, cognitive dysfunction, ataxia, and involuntary movements.

- Extracerebral toxoplasmosis typically presents as pneumonitis and chorioretinitis; however, heart, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and disseminated disease can also occur.

- Pneumonitis - patients present with fever, cough, and shortness of breath
- Chorioretinitis - patients may present with a change in vision, floaters, or ocular pain.
