Of the three primordial tissue layers in the human embryo, bone tissue derives primarily from the mesoderm. Some craniofacial bones and the bones of the middle ear arise instead from neural crest cells. In developmental disorders of neural crest cell migration, craniofacial malformations are sometimes evident. During development, long and short bones develop via the process of endochondral ossification. In this process, bone replaces a cartilaginous precursor template during maturation.

Flat bones form via a process known as intramembranous ossification. In this process, osteoblasts derived from mesenchymal stem cells produce bone spicules, which fuse one to another, forming trabeculae. The trabeculae grow to connect with the other trabeculae and produce woven bone. Mesenchymal cells surrounding the trabeculae serve toÂ establish the periosteum. Osteogenic cells that arise from the periosteum grow along the surface of the woven bone and become lamellar bone after mineralization.
