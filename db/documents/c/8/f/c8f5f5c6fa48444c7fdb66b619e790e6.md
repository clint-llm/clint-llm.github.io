Surgical considerations involving the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle are important for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis or enthesopathy of the extensor carpi radialis brevis.

Fractures of the distal humerus can affect the extensor carpi radialis brevis (and other forearm extensor muscles) due to its attachment to the lateral epicondyle. Therefore, in patients presenting with distal humerus fractures involving the lateral epicondyle, these muscles must be assessed to ensure there was noÂ ischemia due to interruption of its vascular supply and/or nerve damage.

A study also revealed that in patients with carpal bossing, there could be physiologic variants in the insertion site of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle.
