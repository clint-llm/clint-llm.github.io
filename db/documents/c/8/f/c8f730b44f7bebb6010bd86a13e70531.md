Microdermabrasion may be performed by several types of practitioners in the outpatient setting, including aestheticians, medical assistants, and nurses. Although MDA is a relatively benign procedure with minimal complications, all providers should receive training on the proper technique, benefits, as well as risks of the procedure. A medical history, including allergies, should be documented prior to starting the procedure. Appropriate expectations should be set, and patients should be informed that several treatments might be required to achieve the desired results. As some patients may experience petechiae and redness immediately after the procedure, treatments should be avoided for at least two weeks prior to significant life events (e.g., wedding photography, etc.) Proper sterilization of MDA equipment is essential to prevent infectious disease transmission from one patient to another. Patients should be advised to use sunscreen when outdoors for at least one week following the procedure. For individuals with skin conditions not amenable to MDA, a referral to a dermatologist is warranted.
