Management strategies for PAD attempt to achieve two distinct goals: lower cardiovascular risk and improve walking ability. All patients with PAD, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, have an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and thrombosis compared to patients without arterial disease. These cardiovascular events probably account for the shorter life expectancy of patients with PAD. Therefore, all patients diagnosed with PAD should undertake lifestyle changes aimed at lowering their cardiovascular risk profile. Key targets for lifestyle changes include quitting smoking, lowering cholesterol, and controlling hypertension and diabetes.

Treatment options to improve walking ability vary depending on the patientâ€™s symptoms and disease severity. Exercise therapy involves walking until reaching pain tolerance, stopping for a brief rest, and walking again as soon as the pain resolves. These walking sessions should last 30 to 45 minutes, 3 to 4 times per week for at least 12 weeks. Despite being more effective, supervised exercise programs for PAD are not usually covered by insurance companies. Pharmacotherapy for claudication involves the use of cilostazol, a medication that promotes vasodilation and suppresses the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Patients who respond to cilostazol usually notice a positive effect within 12 weeks. Since cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase type-3 inhibitor, a history of congestive heart failure precludes patients from receiving this type of therapy. Pentoxifylline, a medication that improves oxygen delivery by its rheolytic effect has been approved for the treatment of claudication. However, it has inconsistent results compared to placebo in walking distance studies. Balloon angioplasty or stent placement provides a minimally invasive, percutaneous treatment option for patients with PAD symptoms that do not respond to exercise or medical therapy. These endovascular treatments achieve the best results when applied to focal occlusive lesions in the iliac and superficial femoral arteries. The technical success and durability of endovascular therapy decrease in patients with long-segment total occlusions and infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease. Since PAD does not usually represent life or limb-threatening condition, surgery should be reserved for highly selected patients who have significant symptoms despite treatment with non-invasive and endovascular therapy. Surgical options for PAD include bypass grafts to divert flow around the blockage or endarterectomy to segmentally remove the obstructive plaque.

There is ample evidence supporting the use of statins to improve the atherosclerotic disease. However, the patient must change lifestyle and reduce the risk factors for atherosclerotic disease.
