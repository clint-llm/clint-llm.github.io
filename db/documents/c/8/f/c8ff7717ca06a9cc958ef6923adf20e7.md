In the past, for patients with inadequate fluid intake or when the rapid establishment of IV access was not possible, the subcutaneous tissue and extrinsic muscles of the back were sites for "clysis" hydration, which is the placement of a line directly into the large muscles of the back and rapidly administering isotonic fluid.

Normally, the trapezius muscle works in conjunction with the serratus anterior to rotate the scapula superiorly. This allows for the arm to elevate above the head. Any injury to the long thoracic nerve or serratus anterior muscle can compromise this action. The long thoracic nerve originates from nerve roots C5 to C7. The nerve rest on the outer surface of the serratus anterior. The physical exam of a damaged long thoracic nerve or serratus anterior will show lateral protrusion of the scapula and medial winging on abduction.
