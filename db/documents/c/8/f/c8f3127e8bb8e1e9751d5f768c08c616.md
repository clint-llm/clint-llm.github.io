Patients with hemorrhagic stroke should be managed in a dedicated stroke unit with emergency and critical care, neurology and neurosurgery, and neuroradiology for the best outcome. The intensivists, physicians, and critical care nurses should be well versed in emergency neurological life support (ENLS). This is especially necessary in low- and middle-income countries. The surgical methods should be done and assessed in a standardized manner. More trials are needed to confirm the role and usefulness of surgical interventions. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) also should be given to the survivors.
