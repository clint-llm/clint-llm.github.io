The most commonly reported sources for Campylobacter infections are under-cooked poultry in the developed world and contaminated water in the developing world. Ensuring poultry and meat is thoroughly cooked at 70 C before ingestion decreases the risk of infection. The CDC recommends, washing items that come into contact with raw poultry. They also recommend separate cutting boards for raw meat and cleaning utensils after they contact raw meat.
