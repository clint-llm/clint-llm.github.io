Phenobarbital increases the amount of time chloride channels are open, consequently depressing the central nervous system. This action occurs by acting on GABA-A receptor subunits. When phenobarbital binds to these receptors, the chloride ion gates open and stay open, allowing a steady flow of these ions into neuronal cells.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: Rapid and complete absorption occurs after oral or IV administration.

Time of Peak Plasma Concentration: 30 minutes to 1 hour for oral formulations; 5 minutes for IV injection

Distribution: Rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids

Metabolism: Metabolized primarily via acetylation in the liver (hepatic microsomal enzyme system)

Excretion: About 25 to 50% of unchanged drug is excreted in the urine. It is important to remember clearance rates vary with patients and their specific presentations. For instance, terminally ill cancer patients on phenobarbital may need dose adjustments due to reduced clearance of this drug.
