The robotic TKR is expensive and needs software applications to be installed. The preoperative CT adds a cost to the total cost of the procedure and increased radiation exposure. Also, there is an increase in the time of operation, especially during the learning phase. In addition, the surgical team's continuous training and software updates are needed. Additional time is required for preoperative planning, and a technical engineer is usually needed in the operating room to facilitate the robotic procedure. If any unresolved difficulties happen, it will require intraoperative conversion to conventional TKA.
