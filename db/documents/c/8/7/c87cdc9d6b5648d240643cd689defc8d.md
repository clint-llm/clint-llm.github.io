Most neonates are diagnosed prenatally by maternal screening by ultrasound and/or serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein. The screening test of choice is a high-quality second-trimester ultrasound as it is more accurate in detecting neural tube defects than the serum level of alpha-fetoprotein. A positive screening will require further evaluation, including a complete anatomy scan, genetic testing like fetal karyotype, and fetal magnetic resonance imaging if ultrasound imaging is indeterminate. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, extensive prenatal counseling must be undertaken to discuss the natural history of spina bifida, offer additional prenatal testing, and provide management choices, including termination of pregnancy, postnatal surgery, or fetal surgery if available. Serial ultrasounds are also done to monitor head growth, ventricular size, and help with delivery planning.
