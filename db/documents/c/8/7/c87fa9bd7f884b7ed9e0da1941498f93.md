Melanoma is a malignant tumor produced from malignant transformation of melanocytes. This can be sporadic or arise from a preexisting premalignant lesion. Due to the fact that melanocytes are of neural crest origin, melanomas can arise in other locations where neural crest cells are present, including the brain and gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 10% to 25% of melanomas are found in the head and neck region. The most common sites are the occipital scalp and skin of the cheek. Common locations are face (40 to 60%), scalp (14 to 49%), neck (20 to 29%), and ear (8 to 11%). Location of the lesion is of particular importance when addressing melanoma in the head and neck as some locations had a worse prognosis. Additionally, the location requires different management compared to other parts of the body.
