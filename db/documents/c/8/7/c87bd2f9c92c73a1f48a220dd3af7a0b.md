SANRT is a rare arrhythmia but can be confused with other atrial arrhythmias. Healthcare workers, including the nurse practitioner, should carefully examine these patients and rule out other reversible causes. Patients should be referred to a cardiologist if there is any echocardiographic evidence of structural heart disease. Most patients with SANRT do not need medical intervention as a heart of 100 to 150 bpm rarely induces any symptoms. Emergency department and cardiac nurses are responsible for monitoring patients and notify the interprofessional team if there are issues. In rare cases, patients with frequent SANRT might develop symptoms and require medical management. These patients might also benefit from treatment to avoid long-term adverse effects such as tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

Currently, there is a lack of large pharmacological studies in patients who present with SANRT due to the rarity of the rhythm and its less frequent complications. For chronic suppression of recurrent SANRT radiofrequency catheter ablation is recommended rather than suppressive medical therapy due to higher success rates of ablations together with short and long-term side effects of the medications. However, in patients who require prolonged suppressive medical therapy, verapamil, digoxin, or amiodarone can be used. Pharmacists review prescribed medications for doses and interactions, as well as, providing patient education. [Level 5]
