- A previous history of a hypersensitivity reaction to nimodipine is an absolute contraindication. In addition, liver failure and hypotension are relative contraindications for administering nimodipine.

- Concomitant administration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is also a relative contraindication.

- The drug is not entirely safe in pregnancy (Category C under the former FDA system), and pregnant patients should only use it if there is a strong benefit-risk ratio. Breastfeeding is contraindicated while taking the drug due to the chance of harmful effects on the baby. Research has not yet fully established safety in the pediatric population.

**Boxed Warning:**Do not administer nimodipine by parenteral routes. Serious, life-threatening adverse events, including death, cardiac arrest, hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, and bradycardia, have been reported when the drug has been injected parenterally.
