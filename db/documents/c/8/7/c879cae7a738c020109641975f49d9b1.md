**Laboratory evaluation**

The lactic acid levels are typically increased in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in symptomatic as well as the asymptomatic patients with MERRF. The lactic acid is further increased after physical activity and exercise. CSF protein is also raised but often does not exceed 100mg/dl. A raised creatine kinase (CK) often demonstrates myopathy.

**Imaging**

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain may reveal early gray matter changes, while the white matter changes occur late in the disease. Other imaging features seen in MERRF are cerebral atrophy, cerebellar atrophy with dentate nucleus calcification, and changes in the red nucleus as a result of progressive neuronal loss. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) may be helpful in the diagnosis of MERRF. It reveals a high lactic acid peak.

**Electrophysiological testing**

Electroencephalogram (EEG) may reveal a slow background activity with generalized epileptiform discharges, which may precipitate with photic stimulation. These EEG features may also be seen in MELAS and other progressive myoclonic epilepsies.Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) may reveal small polyphasic motor units with early recruitment consistent with a myopathic process. However, a concomitant neuropathy may be present in some patients.

**Muscle biopsy**

A muscle biopsy is important in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disorders, including MERRF. The typical red-ragged fibers are pathognomonic and are present in more than 90% of patients with MERRF. These stain more strongly with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) as compared to modified trichrome Gomori (TGM), unlike other mitochondrial diseases. This histological difference may be explained by a deficient cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in muscle fibers of patients with MERRF.

**Genetic testing**

Genetic testing is available for the diagnosis of MERRF. The most common mutation observed is an A-to-G mutation at nucleotide 8344 (m.8344A>G) of the mtDNA lysine tRNA gene (MT-TK). It is present in about 80% of MERRF patients. Some of the other mtDNA mutations identified in MERRF are m.8356T>C, m.8363G>A, m.3243A>G, m.3255G>A, and m.3291T>C. If a mutation is present in a family, molecular genetic testing can be used to evaluate the at-risk relatives.
