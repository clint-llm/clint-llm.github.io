Human trafficking care must involve a trauma-informed approach where the healthcare provider recognizes the scope of the impact of the trauma on an individual victimâ€™s lifespan and lessens any chance of inflicting more injury on this victim. Provider understanding of the signs of trauma, verbal and nonverbal cues, and their response by following predetermined protocols for identification, treatment, and appropriate referrals are essential elements of trauma-informed care.

Victims may suffer a diminished quality of life and fear of autonomy and independence. The long-term mental and physical health consequences of being a victim of trafficking are immeasurable. Health professionals must work as a team to identify victims and assist in their transition to a normal and productive everyday life.

Trauma-informed care involves the entire healthcare team incorporating shared decision-making practices using an interprofessional, collaborative approach. Safety, transparency, and collaboration with peers and agencies are vital.
