Given the high mortality of Reye syndrome despite treatment, the focus today is on prevention. Besides physicians, the nurse and the pharmacist are in a prime position to educate the parents about risk factors for the disorder. The family should be told to avoid the use of salicylates in children. Further, the parents should be educated about the symptoms and signs of Reyes syndrome and when to seek immediate help. Finally, the CDC recommends that all children over the age of 6 months should receive the influenza vaccine. The pharmacist should always speak to the family about the safe use of medications in children and alternative options for the management of fever and pain.

**Outcomes**

Over the past 4 decades, the mortality rate of Reye syndrome has dropped from 60% to about 20%, chiefly due to early recognition and aggressive management. By preventing increased intracranial pressure and edema, death can be avoided in many children. For those who survive, full recovery has been noted in about two-thirds of patients. However, those children with elevated levels of ammonia usually have residual neurological deficits.
