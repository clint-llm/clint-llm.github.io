The larynx is a well-vascularized tubular structure that receives its blood supply from several major vessels. On either side, the larynx receives vascular supply from the right and left common carotid arteries which bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries. The first branch from the external carotid artery is the superior thyroid artery. This artery further divides into the superior laryngeal artery, which pierces the thyrohyoid membrane to supply the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, and the cricothyroid branch that supplies the cricothyroid muscle. Venous drainage is accomplished ultimately by the internal jugular vein which divides into the corresponding vessels of the superior thyroid vein as well as both the superior and inferior laryngeal veins. Lymphatic drainage occurs through a combination of deep cervical lymph nodes such as the anterior cervical and lateral jugular lymph nodes which terminate at the right lymphatic duct and thoracic duct.
