It is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that manifests as noncaseating granulomas in multiple systems. Various associations have been described, including occupational and environmental exposures to beryllium, dust, and other agents causing asthma. Various microorganisms like mycobacteria and propionibacteria have been associated. Possible infective etiology has been described in a few studies where sarcoidosis developed in a previously negative individual after cardiac or bone marrow transplantation.

Genetic components and disease in more than one family member are usually related to antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), especially DR alleles. Few studies have described other less common genomes and angiotensin-converting enzyme genotypes in a few patients.

Cytokines including Th1, IL-2, IL6, IL 8, IL12, IL 18, IL 27, and interferon (IFN) gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha are closely associated with sarcoidosis. Few of these are implicated in granuloma formation with macrophage and epithelioid accumulation, activation, and aggregation. Some of these interleukins are believed to act as disease modifiers.
