A wheat allergy can be life-threatening, and it is vital that patients carry epinephrine. Patients should follow up with an allergist for treatment goals. Patients will also benefit from a gastroenterology follow-up as patients frequently have GI symptoms, especially if they have celiac disease. Wheat allergies are just one of the many allergic reactions that a patient can face. An interprofessional allergy clinic can improve families' ability to manage allergies and reduce allergic reactions.
