Atenolol is a second-generation beta-1-selective adrenergic antagonist that reduces heart rate and blood pressure and decreases myocardial contractility. It is FDA-approved and indicated in treating hypertension, angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction. Non-FDA-approved indications include treatment of arrhythmias, migraine prophylaxis, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, alcohol withdrawal, thyrotoxicosis, and prophylaxis against secondary myocardial infarction. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of atenolol. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients using atenolol.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the accepted indications for atenolol use.
- Identify the mechanism of action of atenolol and other selective beta-blocking agents.
- Summarize the adverse event profile of atenolol.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance patient outcomes and minimize adverse events with atenolol.
