Patients should be taught that nevus sebaceus is typically a benign lesion that may present as a warty plaque on the scalp when fully developed. The patient should be advised that an associated malignancy is very rare and would be more likely to present in adulthood. All patients should be asked to see a clinician when there are changes in the color, texture, size, or accompanying symptoms of the lesion.
