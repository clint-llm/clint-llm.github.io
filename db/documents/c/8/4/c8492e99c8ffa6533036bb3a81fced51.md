The perimortem cesarean section, as described in its name, is the surgical delivery of the fetus, performed at or near death of the maternal patient. Given the high stakes and emergency situation that leads to the consideration of this surgery, the perimortem cesarean section is one of the most anxiety-provoking surgical procedures in the medical field.  It is also one of the oldest described surgical procedures.

At this time, there are no clear, standardized guidelines as to when to perform the procedure. The lack of data consensus makes performing this procedure even more stressful. It is imperative for emergency care providers to know the indications, as well as be able to perform the procedure efficiently, thus giving both patients an increased chance of survival.
