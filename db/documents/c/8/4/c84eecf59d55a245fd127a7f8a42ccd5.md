Multiple imaging studies may assist in the diagnosis of a pars lesion.

Scintigraphy is an excellent screening tool for low back pain in children or adolescents. It has shown high sensitivity for detecting acute injuries and bone stress reactions in the pars. However, some lesions may not display an increased contrast uptake.

A computed tomography scan (CT) may be helpful in some cases due to its higher specificity. The tomographic finding of an acute injury include the margin reabsorption in the pars; pars sclerosis may indicate chronic stress, and marginal sclerosis with widening may indicate a chronic condition. Identifying patients with a normal CT scan and abnormalities on bone scintigraphy or Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is important as these patients are presumed to be in a very early stage of the disease and have a higher chance of healing with timely conservative treatment.

SPECT is considered the best diagnostic adjunct when plain radiographs are negative. Several of the abnormalities identified on SPECT proved to represent spinal pathology other than spondylolysis, including infection and osteoid osteoma. Although these modalities may present with increased sensitivity in detecting pars lesions compared with plain film, they are not necessarily highly specific for this disorder. Repetitive stress causes local bone remodeling and abnormal uptake of scintigraphic tracer. SPECT has 10 to 20 times more contrast than planar bone scintigraphy; it is more sensitive than radiography and planar bone scans and improves anatomic localization of skeletal lesions without exposing the patient to additional radiation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers advantages in terms of visualizing other types of pathology present in the lumbar spine and may potentially detect pars edema secondary to stress in their clinical course.

The optimal diagnostic algorithm remains undefined in the current literature. When an acute pars injury is suspected, the recommendation is for an X-ray to be the first diagnostic study, followed by scintigraphy or SPE T. If SPECT is positive, a CT scan should be run after SPECT to confirm the pars lesion suspicion and diagnose the stage of the lesion. If SPECT is negative, pars injury has almost certainly been ruled out as the cause of the low back pain, and MRI can be the next study to search for other possible entities.
