Once considered central to the pathogenesis and the diagnosis of RA, Rheumatoid factors are probably one of the most studied autoantibodies in the medical literature. Apart from RA, RFs can be elevated in a number of rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases. Although useful in the diagnosis of RA along with ACPA, testing for RF in the general population, as a screening test for rheumatological disorders should be strongly discouraged. It should be remembered that the diagnostic accuracy of RF depends on the patient population chosen. For example, the higher the pre-test probability of RA, the higher the positive predictive value will be. As with any other diagnosis, a thorough history and physical examination should dictate the battery of tests chosen. Therefore, any patient with arthritis/arthralgia should be not subjected to testing for RFs unless the clinical suspicion for RA is high. On the other hand, if the patient has been diagnosed with RA, it is prudent to provide a referral to a rheumatologist. Early involvement of rheumatologists in the management of patients with RA has shown better outcomes in terms of joint function and disability.
