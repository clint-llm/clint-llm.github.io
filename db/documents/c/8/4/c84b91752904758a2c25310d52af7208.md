Most patients present with symptoms suggestive of fluid loss and clinical signs of dehydration. Symptoms and signs of hypernatremia are secondary from central nervous system dysfunction and are seen when serum sodium rises rapidly or is greater than 160 meq/L. Infants and Children present with irritability and agitation, which can progress to lethargy, somnolence, and coma. Other symptoms include increased thirst response in alert patients and high-pitched cry in infants. Patients with diabetes insipidus present with polyuria and polydipsia. The skin can feel doughy or velvety due to intracellular water loss. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are usually present in hypovolemic hypernatremia. The patient may have increased tone with brisk reflexes and myoclonus. It is important to remember that the degree of dehydration can be underestimated in children with hypernatremia due to a shift of water from the intracellular space to the extravascular space. Polyuria is one of the common symptoms of diabetes insipidus.
