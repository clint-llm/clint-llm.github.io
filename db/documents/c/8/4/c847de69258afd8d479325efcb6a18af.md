Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is a commonly used medication to treat interstitial cystitis, also known as bladder pain syndrome. In 2018 it was first associated with a progressive retinal pigmentary maculopathy, a finding which was later corroborated by several other large studies. PPS maculopathy (PPSM) can cause severe visual impairment by decreasing visual acuity and causing nyctalopia. PPSM is generally not reversible and can be progressive even once discontinued. This activity reviews the evaluation and etiology of PPSM and highlights techniques to help diagnose the condition earlier with specific imaging modalities.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pattern of imaging findings consistent with pentosan polysulfate maculopathy.
- Identify the currently accepted guidelines for screening patients taking pentosan polysulfate.
- Explain the pathophysiology of pentosan polysulfate maculopathy.
- Review the available treatments for pentosan polysulfate maculopathy.
