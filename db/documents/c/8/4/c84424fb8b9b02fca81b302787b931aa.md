OMT-led injuries are rare in the literature; a retrospective study of cases administered between 1925 and 1993 reports only 185 injuries caused by OMT. Acute soreness is sometimes apparent in patients after OMT; in fact, any form of manual medicine leads to this soreness. The degree of soreness will vary, as it solely depends on the approach, angle, and force applied by the physician or non-physician therapist. Passive interventions like BLT procedures are generally risk-free; however, active interventions such as muscle energy may cause minor musculoskeletal complications.

Muscle energy procedure is the most risk-bearing in this band of procedures, requiring the physician to apply direct exertion. Medical literature reports one deleterious result per 50,000 active interventions; however, there is no strong evidence suggesting that active manual interventions performed by well-trained physicians (DO or MD) and providers should go through revision due to high risk. Proper warm-up before and adequate hydration after OMT procedures will minimize soreness; experience will enhance the physician's or provider's skills and lead to better performance, as well.
