- **Fibroadenoma:**The principal differential diagnosis for benign phyllodes tumor is fibroadenoma having a pronounced intracanalicular pattern.

- **Sarcomas**: malignant phyllodes tumor may be confused with pure sarcomas of the breast.

- **Periductal stromal tumor**: the periductal stromal tumor is an entity that histologically overlaps with malignant phyllodes tumor, the main difference being the absence of leaf-like processes. It is non-circumscribed, consisting of spindle-cell proliferation localized around open tubules.

- **Metaplastic carcinoma**: carcinoma is also in the differential diagnosis of malignant phyllodes tumor, but the immunohistochemical demonstration of epithelial differentiation helps resolve the problem.
