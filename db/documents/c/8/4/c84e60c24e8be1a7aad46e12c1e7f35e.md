Pseudohypoparathyroidism typically gets discovered during early childhood. There may or may not be an obvious family history of the disease depending on which parent the child inherited the disease from, as genetic imprinting can hide its expression. The presence of the AHO phenotype should prompt physicians to complete biochemical workup.

Patients experiencing symptoms of hypocalcemia may complain of paresthesias, peri-oral numbness, and muscle cramping or spasms.

A physical exam for PHP type 1b would likely only find symptomatic hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can present with a positive Chvostek sign and a positive Trousseau sign.

The Chovostek sign is positive when tapping on the facial nerve leads to the contraction of facial muscles on the same side due to the nerve's hyperexcitable state. A positive Trousseau sign is when inflation of a sphygmomanometer to higher than systolic blood pressure and maintaining that pressure for 3 minutes leads to transient ischemia and carpal pedal spasm due to hypocalcemia.

In rare cases, the patient might present with seizures, and special imaging of the brain will be needed to rule out any cerebral pathology.

In a recent case report, there was a finding of hypokalemia as the presenting sign of pseudohypoparathyroidism.

PHP type 1a and 1c may have signs of hypocalcemia but will also exhibit the AHO phenotype.
