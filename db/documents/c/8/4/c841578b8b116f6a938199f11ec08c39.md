Biopsy of the duodenum is performed during an upper endoscopy to yield tissue for processing for pathological examination. Duodenal biopsies are performed either in a random fashion for detection or surveillance of disease, or in a directed manner to correlate with microscopic pathology of either likely or apparent abnormal areas in the duodenum. Of note, select pediatric gastroenterology units can perform lactase assays on the biopsies to assess for this enzyme deficiency. One of the most common reasons for conducting a duodenal biopsy is to diagnose or monitor the celiac disease.
