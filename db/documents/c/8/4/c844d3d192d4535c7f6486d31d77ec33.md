MBP is toxic to helminths, bacteria, and mammalian cells. MBP can exert cytotoxic effects through several pathways. It is capable of increasing membrane permeability, disrupting a cell’s lipid bilayer**.**

MBPs participate in host defense and inflammation via another distinct method: extracellular DNA traps.

MBP can influence nerve activity, as well. MBP is an allosteric antagonist of inhibitory M2 receptors.
