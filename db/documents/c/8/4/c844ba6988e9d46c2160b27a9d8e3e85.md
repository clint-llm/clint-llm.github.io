Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) has been proven to be a successful treatment for both total and partial LSCD.

There is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria for LSCD. Most cases are diagnosed clinically. The “gold standard” diagnostic test is impression cytology, which evaluates cells collected from the cornea surface for the presence of goblet cells or features of the conjunctival epithelium. Non-invasive in vivo confocal microscopy has also been used to diagnose and monitor LSCD.

Fluorescein staining is very useful for diagnosing and evaluating LSCD. Unlike most epithelial defects, the more permeable conjunctivalized epithelium has delayed staining, which remains for ten or more minutes even after rinsing with eyewash solutions. The conjunctivalized epithelium is also thinner than normal corneal epithelium leading to pooling of the fluorescein dye that may demarcate normal and pathologic epithelium.

The distribution of limbal palisades of Vogt may diminish with age. However, observing flattening or disappearance of the palisades, particularly in the superior limbus or an area known to have them may be a sign of stem cell loss.
