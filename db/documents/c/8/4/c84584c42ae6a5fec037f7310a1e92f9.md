Approximately a third of patients with Enterobius vermicularis are asymptomatic. The most common symptom associated with pinworm infestation is perianal itching. Perianal erythema may be seen due to the itching and scratching. Sometimes a superficial bacterial infection can occur at the scratching sites resulting in erythema and warmth. Persistent itching can cause disturbances in sleep and may lead to insomnia. Female genitourinary infections have also been reported in the literature. Watery diarrhea has been reported in some patients. Sometimes abdominal pain and other serious complications like appendicitis can occur due to worms blocking the lumen in the appendix or lead to inflammation around the appendix.
