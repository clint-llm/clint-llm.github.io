Some of the most significant indications for leaving an abdomen open after trauma are elevated intra-abdominal pressure, damage control, inability to close, and planned re-exploration. More specifically, these include patients with abdominal compartment syndrome, intra-abdominal hypertension, severe intra-abdominal infection, post-traumatic hemorrhage, peritonitis, bowel edema or ischemia, hypothermia, acidosis, the need for re-exploration after trauma or abdominal sepsis, and high-risk patients in need of a definitive operation that may last longer than 2 hours.
