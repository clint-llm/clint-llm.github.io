When the diagnosis of pancreatic serous cystadenoma is made based on clinical and radiographic evidence, non-surgical management should be recommended in asymptomatic cases. Based on the slow growth rate of these cysts, surveillance imaging can be safely recommended. This is due to the small risk of malignancy (<3%).

Surgical resection should be the next step in the management of symptomatic patients due to rapidly growing lesions (cystadenoma itself vs. hemorrhage), giant tumors more than 10 cm (causing mass effect, obstructive jaundice, pancreatic duct obstruction causing pancreatic exocrine insufficiency or gastric outlet obstruction) or when malignancy (for example serous cystadenocarcinoma) cannot be excluded.

The surgical approach depends on the location and may include distal pancreatectomy with or without splenectomy, mid pancreatectomy, or Whipple procedure. Enucleation was previously reported as a safe option for well-selected patients with serous cystadenoma, with preservation of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas function.
