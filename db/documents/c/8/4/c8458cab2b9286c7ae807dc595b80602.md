Possible complications are divisible into early and late. Early complications, occurring within days to weeks post-operatively, include wound leakage, raised intra-ocular pressure, bleeding and infection. Late complications, occurring months to years postoperatively, include graft rejection, corneal swelling, cataracts, astigmatism and recurrence of the original disease. Reported 5-year and 15-year graft survival rates are approximately 70% and 50%, respectively.
