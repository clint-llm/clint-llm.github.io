The interprofessional team must maintain strong communication during the transition of care so that all involved in managing the patient's health problems are aware that the patient is on insulin pump therapy. The patient or a certified pump specialist should make adjustments to the pump settings, including but not limited to insulin boluses, temporary basal settings, and other changes to basal rates. Persistent hyperglycemia, problems with infusion sites, or removal of the device should be rapidly communicated with the physician.

In most hospitals, there is a system where the patients can continue to use their insulin pumps as inpatients.
