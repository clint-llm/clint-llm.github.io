Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FED) is a bilateral, slowly progressive, often asymmetric corneal disease characterized by deterioration of endothelial cells and development of guttata, which are excrescences of Descemetâ€™s membrane.

FED was first documented in 1910 when Viennese ophthalmologist Ernst Fuchs reported 13 elderly patients with bilateral central clouding.
