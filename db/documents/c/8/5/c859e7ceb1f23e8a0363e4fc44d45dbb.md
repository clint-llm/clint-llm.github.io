Schwannoma typically has a benign course; however, it can undergo a malignant transformation in rare cases. Patients should be encouraged to follow up with the neurosurgeon, peripheral nerve surgeon, or radiation oncology to discuss the management plans regularly. Frequent CT/MRI monitoring is necessary to assess the tumor size in those tumors under observation.
