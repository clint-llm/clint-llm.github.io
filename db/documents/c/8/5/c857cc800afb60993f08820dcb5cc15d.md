In cases of recurrent and chronic barosinusitis, referral to an otolaryngologist is useful to assess for anatomically correctable causes. Surgical treatments such as osteotomy, nasal polypectomy, septoplasty, turbinate reduction, uncinectomy, concha bullosa reduction, or sinus surgery may be indicated.

Isolated, acute barosinusitis requires surgery only for complications such as pneumocephalus and orbital fractures. If there is a blockage of a sinus ostium during descent, a relative negative pressure environment is created in the sinus. If the subsequent ascent occurs too quickly, that negative pressure environment increases due to intrasinus volume expansion. If the difference between these pressures is great enough, a sinus can rupture, leading to orbital fracture and/or pneumocephalus.
