Chronic diarrhea has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes microscopic colitis. It is imperative for nursing staff to be aware of a patient complaining of chronic diarrhea what the consistency, color, and associated symptoms are to advocate for further evaluation. A gastroenterologist will also be involved in these cases for evaluation. If the patient workup as an outpatient, depending upon the workup already performed the GI specialist will be instrumental in completing the workup with colonoscopy and biopsies. Primary care physicians and nurse practitioners will be the point of care leaders to diagnose and begin the workup. Pharmacists will be helping with the recommendation for antidiarrheal agents when it is known that the cause is not infectious, and for further recommendations for glucocorticoids.
