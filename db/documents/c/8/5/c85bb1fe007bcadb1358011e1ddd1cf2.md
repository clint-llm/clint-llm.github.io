Sinus node dysfunction previously referred to as sick sinus syndrome is a progressive disease that requires both symptoms and ECG findings to diagnose. The mainstay of this disease management is a permanent pacemaker placement. When sinus node dysfunction is associated with atrial arrhythmia, the syndrome then will be called tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome.
