There are no specific contraindications for this procedure. Patient refusal to have the procedure as well as an allergic reaction to the implant material can be considered contraindications. In certain circumstances, some patients might benefit from alternative procedures such as full joint replacement rather than wrist fusion. The decision regarding surgical procedure needs to be discussed between the patient and the surgical consultant depending on their age, functional requirements, and the condition affecting the wrist.
