Most heel pain causes can be diagnosed clinically.

**Laboratory**

The laboratory tests include acute phase reactants, Rheumatoid factor, Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide Antibodies, HLA-B27 For systemic causes of the plantar heel pain.

**Plain Radiographs and Computed Tomography**

Clinicians can order them to diagnose stress fractures and plantar calcaneal spurs.

**Musculoskeletal Ultrasound**

In patients with plantar fasciitis, the investigators may find thickening of the plantar fascia (greater than 4 mm) on the medial tuberosity of the calcaneus. An increase in vascularity under power Doppler ultrasound is not a common finding in plantar fasciitis.

Physicians can diagnose heel fat pad atrophy when they find the heel fat pad is thinner than 12 to 14 mm in non-weight bearing conditions.

The cross-sectional area of tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel greater than 9.26 mm² or side-to-side difference greater than 0.8 to 1.76 mm² is diagnostic for the tarsal tunnel syndrome.

The Medial calcaneal and Baxter's nerves are small nerves. Their size was around 3 mm and 2 mm, respectively. To confirm the diagnosis of the entrapment of the medial calcaneal and Baxter's nerves, clinicians should compare the symptomatic side with the asymptomatic one and or perform ultrasound-guided diagnostic blocks.

In cases of Baxter nerve entrapment, ultrasound can show changes in the muscles (quadratus plantae, flexor digitorum brevis, and abductor digiti minimi) supplied by the nerve distal to the site of entrapment.

Regarding SpA, ultrasound can detect sub-entheseal erosions, enthesitis, and enthesophytes at the attachment of the plantar fascia to the calcaneus.

**Electrophysiologic Studies**

It is helpful in the diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndrome, entrapment of the medial calcaneal nerve, diabetic polyneuropathy, and S1 radiculopathy.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

A useful imaging modality to diagnose plantar fasciitis, entrapment of the tibial nerve at the posterior tarsal tunnel, bone cysts, stress fractures, tumors, among others.
