Thoracic empyema is an infectious process defined by frank pus in the pleural space. Due to the high mortality associated with this condition, health professionals should be cognizant of the multifactorial pathogenesis, different stages of the disease, and treatment modalities available. Rapid diagnosis is essential to successful treatment and patient survival. Treatment aims at combining medical and surgical interventions that target eradication of the infection and ensure adequate lung re-expansion. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of thoracic empyemas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of empyema, including risk factors associated with common medical conditions and bacteriology.
- Outline the pathophysiology of empyema, including the different stages of the disease. 
- Review the medical and surgical treatment options available for empyema.
- Explain a well-coordinated, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by thoracic empyema.
