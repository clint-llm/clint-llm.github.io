Cystic teratoma is a type of germ cell tumor that contains well-differentiated tissues developed from three germ cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). The earliest evidence of teratoma dates back to as old as 2000 years B.C. The first case of MCT was reported by Johannes Scultetus in 1659 while recording the autopsy findings of a young woman who died of an ovarian tumor described as a “dermoid cyst of the ovary.”

Ovarian teratomas are broadly classified histologically into monodermal teratomas (carcinoid tumors, neural tumors, struma ovarii), immature teratomas, and mature cystic teratomas. The most common type among these tumors is mature cystic teratoma, also known as "Dermoid cyst." Cystic teratomas constitute about 20% of ovarian germ cell tumors. The most common site of occurrence is in the ovaries and testes. However, they can rarely be seen in the anterior mediastinum, sacrococcygeal region, or neck. Mature cystic teratoma is always benign with a slow growth rate of 1.8 mm/year; however, in rare circumstances, it can undergo malignant transformation.
