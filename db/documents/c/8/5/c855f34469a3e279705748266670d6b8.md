An inpatient obstetric care team includes but is not limited to nurses, midwives, residents, obstetricians, anesthesiologists, neonatologists, pediatricians, and lactation services. All team members should work in harmony to create a safe environment for the pregnant woman and her fetus during labor and postpartum. A trained obstetrician capable of performing a cesarean section (CS) should be readily available anytime IOL is used if the need arises to proceed to CS.
