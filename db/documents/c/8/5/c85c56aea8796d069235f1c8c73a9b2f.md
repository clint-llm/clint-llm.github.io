Due to its importance in higher education, refresher FERPA training is an important component of all faculty and staff of educational institutions. In addition to traditional data sources, computer simulators, VR systems, and other online and virtual learners provide a novel set of data resources that must be appropriately managed. Although these systems and underlying technology are new, the appropriate storage, use, and destruction are already outlined in federal guidelines.Â Although COVID-19 has reminded the simulation community of public health concerns, it is important to remember that healthcare status is protected on campus under FERPA and in clinical environments under HIPPA. Contact tracing does not negate this fact.
