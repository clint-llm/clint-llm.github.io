A high index of clinical suspicion is required to consider coronary sinus thrombosis in the diagnosis as the symptoms are not well characterized due to the shortage of published cases and relatively high mortality rate.

Early studies have shown that occlusion of the coronary sinus resulted in chest pain, shortness of breath, hypotension, ischemic electrocardiogram changes such as ST-segment elevations, pericardial effusion, cardiogenic shock, or even sudden cardiac death. Mortality is high due to the nonspecific clinical presentation, rapidity of clinical deterioration, and rarity of the condition

Occasionally a few cases have an insidious onset and form a partial or incomplete thrombus. Such partial or incomplete occlusion of the coronary sinus by chronic thromboses may not cause immediate death due to the formation of adequate collateral circulation among coronary sinus, anterior cardiac vein, and Thebesain veins. Therefore chronic occlusion of the coronary sinus with thrombus remains silent without any signs of myocardial decompensation until further complications such as progression to complete occlusion or rupture and embolization of the thrombus develop causing potential pulmonary embolism or myocardial dysfunction or infarction.
