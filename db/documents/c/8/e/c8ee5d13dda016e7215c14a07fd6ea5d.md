Immunizations come in various preparations, depending on the manufacturer. Many vaccinations are combinations, such as measles, mumps, rubella or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines. Vaccines may be prepared in single-dose or multi-dose preparations. Some vaccines come in prefilled syringes, while others are in vials and must be drawn into a syringe before administration. **The use of specific antiviral drugs (acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir) should be stopped 24 hours before varicella vaccination. It is also recommended to avoid the use of antivirals 14 days after varicella vaccination.**
