Various authors have classified OAVS in literature. Vento et al. described OMENS classification (consisting of an Orbit, Mandible, Ear, Nerve, and Soft tissue grading system). Cousley et al. and Vento et al. classified OAVS, including only the facial features, whereas Rollnick et al. did not take laterality into consideration.

**Objective Scoring System**

**Main features/ minimal diagnostic criteria:**2 points each

**Additional clinical findings:**1 point each (deafness, orofacial clefts, anomalies of the eyes, dermoid, urogenital anomalies, brain anomalies, congenital heart defects, motor and speech delay, short stature, limb anomalies, microcephaly)

Total score: 18

This scoring system can be used for an objective description of the phenotype and defines the severity of the disease, and predicts the likelihood of associated malformations in OAVS. Tasse et al. noted that the average score in bilaterally affected patients is higher than in unilateral ones. Thus, bilateral involvement is associated with more additional clinical findings. They also reported associations between specific clinical findings such as epibulbar dermoid and brain anomalies correlated with other ocular anomalies. Short stature was associated with ocular anomalies, microcephaly, limb, and vertebral anomalies. Motor developmental delay was commonly associated with speech delay, eye and brain anomalies, and short stature.
