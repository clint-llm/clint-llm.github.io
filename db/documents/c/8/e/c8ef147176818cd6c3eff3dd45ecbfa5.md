As with any superficial vein catheterization procedure, considerations must be given that weigh the risks and benefits. In the common peripheral scalp vein sites of the frontal veins, superficial temporal veins, and posterior auricular veins, venous blood flow is robust, and those veins have sufficient alternative routes of venous drainage. Relative contraindications include overlying skin infection and thrombophlebitis at the site of catheterization. Patient discomfort (either with catheterization or continuous presence of hardware to keep the catheter in place) should be considered as well as sensory or motor deficits around the site being chosen.

Peripheral IV catheterization can provide emergent and life-sustaining or saving access to administer medications, fluids, and blood products. In emergency settings, the severity of the clinical situation takes precedence over most relative contraindications.
