Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are recombinant receptors for antigens which redirect the specificity and function of T lymphocytes and/or other immune cells in a single molecule. The concept of using CARs in cancer immunotherapy is that CARs, which are programmed targeting tumor-associated antigens, can be replicated rapidly and homogeneously. Direct infusion of these armed tumor targeting T-cells bypass the barriers and kinetics of active immunization. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of CART treatment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of cancer patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for CART therapy.
- Describe the complications of CART therapy.
- Review the contraindications of CART therapy.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination in patients who receive CART therapy.
