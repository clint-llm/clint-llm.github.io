The most common cognitive and behavioral disorders in X-linked ichthyosis patients include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, inattentive subtype), and autistic-spectrum disorder (language/communication difficulty), but there is not good evidence that these are more common in X-linked ichthyosis than in control male population. Contiguous gene syndrome from contiguous gene deletions may variably present with retardation, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and/or anosmia; the latter two features are seen in Kallmann syndrome.
