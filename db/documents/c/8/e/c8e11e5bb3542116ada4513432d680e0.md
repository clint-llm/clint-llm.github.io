Most of the serum calcium filtered by the glomerulus (>60%) is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. This is accomplished by a paracellular pathway involved tight junction proteins claudins-2 and -12. This process is driven by water and particularly sodium reabsorption. About 20% to 25% of the remaining calcium is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of Henle using a similar mechanism. The distal convoluted tubule and the collecting ducts regulate the remaining calcium excretion and reabsorption utilizing several chemical pathways. Typical idiopathic hypercalciuria is most often due to a genetic mutation or modification in one of these calcium reabsorption pathways.

The traditional way of looking at hypercalciuria includes absorptive which has increased intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium leak which is an inherent kidney problem, resorptive as in hyperparathyroidism, and renal phosphate leak hypercalciuria. Not every patient will fall nicely into one of these categories, and a simpler classification requiring much less testing is now available based on clinical response.[26]

Other causes of hypercalciuria include milk-alkali syndrome (excessive oral calcium ingestion), sarcoidosis, glucocorticoid excess, Paget disease, paraneoplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, metastatic tumors involving bone, Addison disease, and Hypervitaminosis D. Hypercalciuria without any obvious cause, which is the majority of cases, is called idiopathic.

Animal studies have suggested that in some subjects, there appears to be an increased sensitivity to Vitamin D. This may be due to an increased number of 1,25 Vitamin D receptors in those individuals.  These changes have not been reliably identified in humans; just in animal studies.

High salt (sodium) intake has also been suggested as a possible cause of hypercalciuria.  An increased sodium load leads to higher urinary excretion of sodium which decreases tubular calcium reabsorption resulting in hypercalciuria.  While high salt intake may be a contributing factor, it is rarely the sole cause of significant hypercalciuria.

A high animal protein diet will produce an acid load that causes a release of calcium from the bone and inhibition of renal tubular calcium reabsorption resulting in hypercalciuria. Again, this does not appear to be the sole causes of significant hypercalciuria.

In children 2 to 12 years of age, the calcium/citrate ratio has been found to be clinically useful. A cutoff of 0.25 has been suggested meanting that those with a calcium/citrate ratio >0.25 are more likely to develop stones.
