Radioactive iodine therapy(RAI) is a nuclear agent that is FDA-approved and indicated for hyperfunctioning thyroid disease and thyroid carcinoma. This agent's use should be under the management under the supervision of an interprofessional team, including an endocrinologist, a primary care clinician, nurses, and pharmacists. Thorough follow-up and communication between the primary care clinician and specialists are vital to monitor free T4 and TSH levels to gauge the success or complications of treatment. Providers involved in the patients' direct care, such as nurses, should be familiar with the clinical signs and symptoms of treatment complications such as thyroid storm, ophthalmopathy, and transient hypothyroidism. Consultation with an ophthalmologist may be necessary for patients suffering from thyroid-associated orbitopathy.

Counseling and discontinuation of treatment are strongly advised during pregnancy. A negative pregnancy test should be considered before therapy, as radioactive iodine can readily cross the placenta and be taken up by the fetus, further causing irreversible damage. Select patients should be educated on pre-treatment if needed, and all patients should receive counsel about iodine restriction before therapy. Patients should receive clear instructions regarding radiation toxicity and avoidance of household contacts, pregnant women, and children. The interprofessional team should also counsel patients on the adverse effects of therapy, and the early and late complications that may arise, and the severity of the complications.
