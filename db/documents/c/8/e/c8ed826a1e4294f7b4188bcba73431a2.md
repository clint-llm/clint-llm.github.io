The critical process in penile erection activity is the relaxation of the intracavernosal smooth muscle. This permits increased blood flow into the corpora cavernosa which fills with blood and compresses the emissary veins, reducing venous outflow.  The process is under the control of the paraventricular and medial preoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The signals travel through the parasympathetic nervous system to the parasympathetic nerves of the S2-S4 sacral plexus and then to the penis via the cavernosal nerves. Nitric oxide released by the cavernous nerve terminals initiates the erectile process while nitric oxide from endothelial cells acts to maintain it.

Nitric oxide stimulates the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) when it enters the smooth muscle. Protein kinase G is activated by cyclic GMP which opens potassium channels while closing calcium channels. Low intracellular calcium causes the intracavernosal smooth muscle tissue to relax resulting in increased arterial flow with simultaneous veno-occlusive activity.  The result of all this is a rigid erection with minimal blood flow into or out of the corpora once the erection is established. The corporal smooth muscle contracts again when the cyclic GMP is degraded by penile phosphodiesterase and the process reverses. Pathology arising from any of the above processes can result in erectile dysfunction.
