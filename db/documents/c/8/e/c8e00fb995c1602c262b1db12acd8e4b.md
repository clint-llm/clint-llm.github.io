Erythropoietin stimulating agents are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to non-human mammal-derived products because of ESA production methods.

Because ofÂ increased blood viscosity when using ESA, physicians should exercise caution in patients with a history of DVT, pulmonary embolism, or hypercoagulability disorder. Likewise, caution is necessary for patients with a history of ischemic stroke or cardiovascular disease.

ESAs containing benzyl alcohol are contraindicated in neonates, peripartum mothers, and breastfeeding mothers due to the risk for gasping syndrome. This syndrome causes gasping respirations, renal failure, and neurological deterioration in neonates, resulting from severe metabolic acidosis.
