Sickle cell retinopathy, especially proliferative sickle retinopathy, is considered the commonest cause of loss of vision in sickle cell disease. The best method to prevent the development of devastating complications of proliferative sickle retinopathyÂ is regular dilated peripheral retinal examinations. Patients should be educated regarding the importance of regular ophthalmological examinations. Patients should also be instructed to consult an ophthalmologist if they notice any changes in vision.

Close follow-up and annual retinal examinations are also required in patients with thalassemia to prevent and detect any complications before permanent damage occurs. Educating the patient will go a long way in this direction.
