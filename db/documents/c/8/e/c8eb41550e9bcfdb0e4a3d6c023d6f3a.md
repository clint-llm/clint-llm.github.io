Severe hypoglycemia can be associated with signs and symptoms such as anxiety, irritability, slurred speech, shakiness, disorientation, agitation, seizures, loss of consciousness, and even death.

Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can result in a condition called “hypoglycemia unawareness,” wherein despite low blood sugar levels, the counter-regulatory responses are blunted, and the symptoms of hypoglycemia diminish over time. A study in patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia demonstrated impaired driving performance associated with low glucose levels even in the absence of symptoms of hypoglycemia.

In patients with diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemia can also have insidious harmful effects on various organ systems, significantly affecting the quality of life. However, the long-term effects of post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia are unknown.
