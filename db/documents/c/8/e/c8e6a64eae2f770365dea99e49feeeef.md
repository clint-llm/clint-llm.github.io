The nasal turbinates play important roles in respiration, immune surveillance, and olfaction; when they function properly, most patients are unaware they exist. However, dysfunction of the turbinates, particularly the inferior turbinates, can significantly impair quality of life. When the turbinates become hypertrophied, they produce anatomical nasal obstruction, and if they are resected or their mucosa severely injured, the sensation of nasal obstruction in the absence of a physical blockage can occur as well. Lastly, dysfunction of the olfactory epithelium that leads to a loss of smell and a reduction in the sense of taste can also significantly impact patient well-being.

Numerous medical and surgical therapies are available to help manage turbinate dysfunction, often administered by primary care providers, allergists, and otolaryngologists; the use of an interprofessional healthcare team strategy will ensure patients receive appropriate evaluation and individualized treatment.
