Discussion about the chosen modality of surgery should involve a core multidisciplinary team consisting of specialists from medical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, radiology, interventional radiology, and nursing. Specialists from nuclear medicine, geriatric oncology, oncology pharmacy, psycho-oncology, and palliative medicine usually form a part of the extended MDT. The presence of a nephrologist in the MDT may be necessary, given the risk of development of chronic kidney disease post-surgery, and given the common adverse effects of targeted therapy, like hypertension (and itâ€™s potential to impact residual renal function).
