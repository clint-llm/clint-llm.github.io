Allergens (or antigens) are presented to T-cells by Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) during the sensitization phase of Type I hypersensitivity. T-cells then signal for stimulation of B-cells to produce IgE antibodies, which bind to the Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils. Subsequently, the free antigen induces the crosslinking of these mast cell and basophil bound IgE antibodies. This results in the degranulation of the cells and the release of histamine, proteolytic enzymes, and other mediators (i.e., prostaglandin, cytokines, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factors, macrophage inflammatory proteins, tryptase, etc.).

As a result, there is increased vascular permeability, peripheral vasodilation, and smooth muscle contraction, which can manifest to increased mucous secretions, bronchospasm, abdominal cramping, rhinitis, and potentially hypovolemia or hypoxia. Pulmonary edema or general edema can also occur due to fluid shifting into interstitial space. Individuals can experience pruritis and local response of asthma or a systemic response of anaphylaxis.
