Variations of the pituitary gland sizes are seen in regard to hormonal demands. In younger adults, especially those going through puberty, have larger glands. These glands entirely occupy the space of the pituitary fossa and have a large convex upper border. Those individuals that are older will tend toÂ have an empty-looking pituitary fossa. The most dramatic change can be seen in pregnancy when it is dramatically enlarged and in some cases can be mistaken for an adenoma.

It has also been documented that sexual dimorphism exists. Through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) it was seen that females ages 14 to 17 years were documented to have a larger pituitary gland. Those females that were 19 years, compared to those that were older (20 years and older) demonstrated this correlation between pituitary volume and age. Males did not show these phenomena.
