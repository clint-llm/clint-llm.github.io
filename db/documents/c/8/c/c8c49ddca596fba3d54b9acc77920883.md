Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, given its wide phenotypic variations, is challenging to diagnose and needs a high level of suspicion to achieve prompt and early diagnosis. In sporadic cases, diagnosing NBCCS in proband should trigger genetic testing of other family members. Once identified, management implications include appropriate cancer screening and precautions, for example, screening for basal cell carcinoma (with encouragement to apply sunscreen, limit sun exposure and avoid ionizing radiation) and early childhood medulloblastoma (children less than eight years of age are recommended to have annual brain MRI with contrast). Diagnosis of cardiac fibroma, which rarely is a presenting manifestation, should prompt an evaluation for NBCCS along with a careful assessment of the patient’s past medical and family history.

As mentioned earlier, patients diagnosed with NBCCS are at an increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasms at an early stage. Experts have recommended coordinated multispecialty care for surveillance of NBCCS patients.
