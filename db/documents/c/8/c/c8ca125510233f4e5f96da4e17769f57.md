# Continuing Education Activity

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common symbiont bacterium that can become infectious once inside the human host. They are among the most common causes of nosocomial infection in the United States and can lead to serious complications. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis infection and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.
- Explain the common presentation of a patient with Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis infection.

# Introduction

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci bacteria that form clusters. It is also a catalase-positive and facultative anaerobe. They are the most common coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species that live on the human skin. In its natural environments such as the human skin or mucosa, they are usually harmless.

The belief is that Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infection, with infection rates as high as those of Staphylococcus aureus.

# Etiology

Staphylococcus epidermidis is usually a symbiont that is harmless in its natural environment.Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococcus species arise most commonly by indwelling medical device contamination.****

# Epidemiology

Staphylococcus epidermidis is among the most common causes of nosocomial blood infections.

# Pathophysiology

One of the crucial factors allowing coagulase-negative species to survive in a harsh environment is the production of the biofilm. Biofilm formation occurs with initial adhesion to a foreign surface or endothelium, which leads to accumulation into multicellular structures.

# History and Physical

Staphylococcus epidermidis can manifest in many ways once inside the human host, including localized and systemic infections. Below are some of the most common diseases.

**Intravascular Catheter Infections**

Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphs are one of the leading causes of catheter-related bloodstream infection. The infection largely occurs as the bacteria migrate from the patient’s skin to the surface of the catheter, but they also can migrate via luminal surfaces.

**Infectious Endocarditis**

Staphylococcus epidermidis ranks as one of the most common species to cause infective endocarditis in both the prosthetic valve and the native valve. Up to 40% of cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) are due to coagulase-negative staph.

**Cardiac Devices, Prosthetic Joints, and CNS Shunt Infection**

Staphylococcus epidermidis can cause infections from implantation of medical devices such as cardiac devices, orthopedic devices, and CNS shunt. Up to 20% of patients with cardiac devices can become infected and can show signs of erythema, pain, purulence around the site of the infection, and sepsis.

Shunt infection may present without symptoms, but can also cause headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status.

# Evaluation

For patients suspected of having catheter-related bloodstream infections, blood cultures are necessary before starting antibiotics. The recommendation is to draw cultures from both the peripheral vein and the catheter site for the most reliable results.

Patients suspected of having endocarditis based on a clinical picture will also require blood cultures and echocardiogram. At least three blood culture sets are recommended from separate venipuncture sites.

An echocardiogram is imperative in the diagnosis of endocarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the initial step, which has a high sensitivity to 75% and specificity of about 100%.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment for Staphylococcus epidermidis infection largely depends on the type and severity of the infection. Patients with systemic infection warrant parenteral therapy. Resistance to methicillin is present in more than 80% of the coagulase-negative staph isolates.

# Differential Diagnosis

Bacteremia secondary to:

- 
Staphylococcus aureus

- Other coagulase-negative staph

- Gram-negative bacteria

- Streptococcal species

- Septic thrombophlebitis

- Viral infection

- Osteomyelitis

- Culture negative endocarditis

# Prognosis

The prognosis depends on the type of infection and the patient’s comorbidities at the time of infection. In neonates with low birth weight, mortality due to S. epidermidis sepsis was as high as 4.8% and 9.4%.

# Complications

Sepsis and septic shock are complications with high mortality that can arise with catheter-related infections. The mortality rate for septic shock can up to 20 to 30%.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients who are undergoing procedures or surgery that requires implantation of prosthetic or medical devices should receive education about the possibility of the infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis.  If patients are knowledgeable about common signs and symptoms of the infection, then it will lead to faster evaluation and treatment, which will overall lead to reduced mortality and complications.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common bacterium found on the human flora, are innocuous species that can become virulent once inside the host. This species of bacteria can have different consequences in an infected individual, and it requires a great deal of coordination between various medical staff to treat the infection.

Early consult with the infectious disease team will aid in starting the patient on the initial treatment. If the clinical picture is concerning for endocarditis, a cardiologist can provide a further evaluation with imaging such as TTE or TEE.  Also, it is useful to have a pharmacist specializing in infectious disease to overlook the type and dosage of the medication based on the patient’s comorbidities.

Because one of the main methods of invasion for Staphylococcus epidermidis is through prosthetic and medical devices, following strict aseptic techniques during a procedure is necessary.  A systemic review showed that an effective infection control team requires a multi-disciplinary team consisting of nurses, physicians trained in infection control, microbiologist, and data manager.  For an institution to implement an efficacious protocol and system, it requires constant training in frontline staff with education, surveillance, and feedback.
