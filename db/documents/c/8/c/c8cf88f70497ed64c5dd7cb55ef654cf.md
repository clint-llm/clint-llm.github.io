Parasternal cardiac ultrasound should not be done during CPR, but other views are appropriate if feasible. Parasternal views can take place during the pulse check and towels should be nearby to clean off the gel immediately before CPR resumes. Care should be taken not to scan over a wound or incision to avoid contamination and infection.
