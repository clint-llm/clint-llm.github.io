Intubation is usually performed in controlled settings like the operating room and ICU. However,Â in the field, it may be performed by EMS, nurse anesthetist, and surgeon without access to paralytic drugs. The key is to perform the procedure without harm to the patient. Clinical judgment is required, as in some cases, the patient should be bagged and transported quickly to the nearest ED. Failed intubations are associated with high morbidity and mortality.
