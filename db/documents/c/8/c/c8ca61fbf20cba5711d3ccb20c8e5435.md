**History**

Following an inhalational injury, the patients generally present with rhinorrhea, scratchy throat, chest tightness, cough, dyspnea, and eye irritation. Since ammonia is a gas with a strong, pungent odor, the onset of symptoms is generally preceded by the patient identifying the smell, and people capable of escaping this environment are not subject to prolonged exposures. Prolonged or severe exposure to the gas results in full-thickness skin burns.

Following ingestion injury, the patients present with oropharyngeal, epigastric, and retrosternal pain. Abdominal pain and similar gastrointestinal symptoms follow if there is perforation of a viscus; this can occur as late as 24 to 72 hours after ingestion. More often than not, there is a preceding history of accidental or suicidal ingestion of ammonia-containing products, commonly, household ammonia-based cleaners.

**Physical Examination**

After securing the airway, breathing, and circulation, a brief physical examination should be performed to establish the extent of the exposure. Start by assessing the level of consciousness. Examine the head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat for signs of facial and oral burns, ulcerations, or edema. Examine the respiratory system and evaluate for respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, stridor, drooling, cough, wheezing, rhonchi, and decreased air entry. Completely expose the patient and examine the skin for signs of burns. Special attention is to be given to the examination of the eye since ammonia can cause severe damage to the cornea, lens and may even lead to globe perforation. Abdominal examination may be able to delineate epigastric tenderness and peritoneal signs in patients with perforation. Since this can be a late sign, the clinician should repeat the abdominal examination periodically.
