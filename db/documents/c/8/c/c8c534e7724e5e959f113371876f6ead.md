The primary complications of sialolithiasis are the development of sialadenitis, acute or chronic, and atrophy of the affected salivary gland. Obstruction of the salivary glands by a sialolith blocks the flow of saliva resulting in swelling and pain. Additionally, this blockage of flow prevents the removal of bacteria and debris from the salivary duct, resulting in bacterial infection. If the obstruction is chronic, the blocked flow of saliva will damage the salivary glands' acinar cells, resulting in local inflammation. Without proper treatment, it can result in permanent fibrosis of the gland and atrophy.
