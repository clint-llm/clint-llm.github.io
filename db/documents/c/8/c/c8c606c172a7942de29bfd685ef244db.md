Citalopram hydrobromide is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The primary FDA-approved clinical use for citalopram hydrobromide is for the treatment of depression in adults. Non-FDA-approved uses include alcohol use disorder, coronary arteriosclerosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, postmenopausal flushing, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. This activity reviews indications, mechanism of action, administration, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity associated with citalopram and the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with conditions that indicate therapy with citalopram.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of citalopram. 
- Identify the approved and off-label indications of citalopram.
- Summarize the potential adverse effects of citalopram, and indicate measures to take should they appear during the course of therapy.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients on citalopram therapy.
