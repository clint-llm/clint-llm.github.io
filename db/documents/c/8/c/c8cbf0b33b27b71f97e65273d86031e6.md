No optimal treatment strategy for these tumors has been established. Radiation and chemotherapy offer a modicum of improvement in the overall prognosis. The mainstay of therapy remains surgical reaction with an R0 result. R0 is defined as a microscopically negative margin of resection where no gross or microscopic tumor is found at the surgical site.

Given the metastatic nature of the disease, all surgery can accomplish sometimes is palliation, an improvement in the quality of life. For the patient, this may be a worthy goal. Data from other sources support the assertion that metastasectomy of one or both ovaries increases overall survival.

Metastatectomky is favored over no surgeryÂ for its increasing overall survival, especially when an R0 is felt to be an obtainable result.
