Chiari type I malformation can have a genetic basis or can be secondary to different conditions involving alterations in the basal skull such as craniosynostosis, craniocerebral disproportion, platybasia, secondary neurulation abnormalities, bone metabolic disorders. This type of malformation can be the result of a build-up of pressure in the brain produced, for instance, by hydrocephalus or a tumor. Furthermore, iatrogenic Chiari I, due to lumboperitoneal shunt for treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension has also been reported.

In some cases, it is also possible that a traction mechanism from below is the cause of the disease. According to a mechanisms of caudal traction (tethered cord), indeed, the lowering of the tonsils in Arnold Chiari type I could be provoked by a traction by the filum terminal (between the coccyx and the sacral part of the vertebral column), that pulls from the bone marrow and brainstem structures, causing, in turn, the descent of the cerebellar tonsils.

When a genetic basis can be suggested, links to chromosomes 2, 9, 14, and 15 have been proposed.
