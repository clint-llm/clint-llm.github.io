Cerebral edema can result from a variety of derangements.  The major types include vasogenic, cellular, osmotic, and interstitial.

Through these mechanisms, cerebral edema stems from tumor, trauma, hypoxia, infection, metabolic derangements, or acute hypertension.  Causes are widespread and divide into neurological and non-neurological categories.  Other non-neurologic causes include hepatitis, Reye syndrome, carbon monoxide poisoning, lead poisoning, and high altitude cerebral edema. A rare cause of cerebral edema is pseudotumor cerebri.
