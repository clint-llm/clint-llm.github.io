The classical form of A-T presents early during the first decade. Usually, ataxia is the first noticeable sign. In particular, it can be noticed as instability of the trunk when toddlers are sitting or as an unstable gait. Because of the ataxia, patients often need a wheelchair-accessible vehicle by the age of 10. As the disease progresses, dysarthria and oculomotor apraxia manifest, sometimes affecting vision and reading skills that can impact children during their first years of school. Nystagmus, saccadic intrusions, and hypometric saccades can be present as well.

Telangiectasias, which are the other distinctive feature of the disease, are present in almost all cases. They usually become evident after the age of 6. Telangiectasias occur most frequently in the eyes, in particular in the conjunctiva, and/or in sun-exposed areas (such as the face and ears).

Not infrequently, other neurological manifestations can be present. In particular, basal ganglia involvement is common, manifesting with tremor, parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia, and myoclonus. Axonal neuropathy is part of the clinical picture of A-T as well.

Immunological impairment is common, affecting about two-thirds of cases. Usually, patients present with low IgA and IgG levels, with variable IgM, which can be either low or high, together with low total CD4 cell count.

About 25% to 30% of patients with A-T will develop a tumor. Most frequently leukemia and lymphoma arise early in life. Later on, solid tumors such as breast and ovarian cancer, melanomas, gastric, or liver tumors can present.

Insulin resistance or diabetes, as well as hypercholesterolemia and steatosis, can be present, especially later in the course of the disease. The endocrine system can also be involved in growth hormone deficiency, resulting in short stature and failure to grow, and gonadal failure, causing infertility.

**Variant Forms**

Some authors reported an adult-onset form of A-T which is characterized by a much milder phenotype that manifests later in life and progresses slowly. An intermediate phenotype that still presents during the first or second decade but is milder in course has also been reported.

**Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Like Phenotypes**

Different genetic mutations have been found in patients with a phenotypic presentation similar to A-T.

In particular, mutations of the genes NBS1 (nibrin) or MRE11, which encode for 2 proteins whose functions are strictly related to ATM, have been associated with diseases that resemble A-T. Nijmegen breakage syndrome, which is caused by the mutation of the NBS1 gene, is characterized by an increased risk of cancer, microcephaly, and syndromic features, recurrent respiratory infections, and intellectual disability. Ataxia and telangiectasia are not present.

Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder 1 (ATLD1), instead, is caused by the genetic mutations of the MRE11 gene. This disorder can present with progressive ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and dysarthria, but without telangiectasias. Moreover, the age of onset can be delayed compared to A-T, and the level of immunoglobulin in the peripheral blood is usually normal.
