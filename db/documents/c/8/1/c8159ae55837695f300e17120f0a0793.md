Approximately 59% of the population older than six years old has been exposed to CMV, with an increase in the population’s seroprevalence with increasing age. Infection can occur as a primary infection, reinfection, or reactivation. Transmission of CMV can occur in numerous ways: via blood products (transfusions, organ transplantation), breastfeeding, viral shedding in close-contact settings, perinatally, and sexual transmission. Reactivation is seen in patients who become immunocompromised and is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality.

- Primary infection: infection in seronegative patients; may be asymptomatic

- Recurrent infection: Reinfection or reactivation of CMV in seropositive patients

- CMV infection: Presence of CMV in body fluids (urine, blood) or tissue

- CMV disease: CMV infection with associated non-specific signs and symptoms and/or end-organ involvement
