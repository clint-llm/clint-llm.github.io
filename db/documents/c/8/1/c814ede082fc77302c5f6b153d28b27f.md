Tonicity is tightly regulated by the equilibrium between water intake and water excretion.

One of the cardinal manifestations of a hyperglycemic crisis is hypertonicity.

High-glucose conditions in patients with diabetic microvascular complications, particularly with diabetic nephropathy, have shown TonEBP to upregulate the expression of AR.

During acute states of tonicity variability, the brain is also in danger. The primary defensive adaptation occurs through RVI, but astrocytes also play a major role by accepting the movement of water from the cerebrospinal fluid.
