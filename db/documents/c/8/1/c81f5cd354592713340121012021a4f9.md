Prosthetic training for amputees is a significant part of their recovery and healing process. This is a multidisciplinary approach involving surgeons, clinicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and prosthetists. Training programs are center-specific but help teach patients how to don and doff their prosthesis, inspect their amputation site for wounds and skin breakdown, and perform safe transfers.  Comprehensive programs, including mental training combined with gait training, have shown improved outcomes in transtibial amputees.

More advanced training sessions assist amputees with non-assistive weight-bearing and with more advanced weight-bearing on uneven surfaces and stairs.
