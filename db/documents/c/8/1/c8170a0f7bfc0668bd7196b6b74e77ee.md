The presentation of all different types of glomerulonephritis is the same. They can be differentiated only on the basis of specific renal biopsy findings. Therefore, a patient presenting with hematuria is classified under nephritic syndrome, which can include acute glomerulonephritis, diffuse proliferative, focal proliferative, or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. The precise diagnosis is based on if more than 50% glomeruli are involved; it is termed diffuse, while less than 50% glomeruli involvement makes it focal. Thickening of the basement membrane indicates membranous, while increased cellularity is indicative of proliferative etiology. In case cellular damage is extensive enough to result in greater than 3.5 g/day proteinuria, it is then classified as nephrotic syndrome.
