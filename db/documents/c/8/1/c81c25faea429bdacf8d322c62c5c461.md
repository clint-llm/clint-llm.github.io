While the performance of the US itself requires a credentialed sonographer or physician, the discovery of the need and indications for the US study depends on the collaboration of the entire interprofessional healthcare team across specialties. Nurses, medical students, and physicians all review history, conduct interviews with patients, and perform examinations on patients, making it important for healthcare teams to share findings to optimize patient care. The clinical staff required for management depends on the pathology. Still, it may include vascular or interventional radiology for surgical management for some venous pathologies and either primary care or specialty teams for anticoagulation therapy or observation. Hospital pharmacists provide valuable recommendations for initial and daily doses of a new anticoagulant in patients with multiple interacting medications. Dieticians provide patients with the necessary nutritional education on appropriate vitamin K intake when management requires warfarin therapy. [LevelÂ 5]
