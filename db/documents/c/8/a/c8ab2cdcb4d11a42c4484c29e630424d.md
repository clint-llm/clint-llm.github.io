Phosgene ALI should be included in the differential for pathologies characterized by hypoxia with evidence of central vascular congestion with or without pulmonary infiltrates. Consider pulmonary contusion, infectious pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, cardiogenic pulmonary edema (e.g., acute decompensated congestive heart failure), or pulmonary hemorrhage.

History, physical examination, and laboratory analysis will differentiate acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pulmonary contusion. Consider infectious pneumonia in those with pyrexia, leukocytosis, and productive cough. Aspiration pneumonitis may be differentiated by various historical features and physical examination but will likely include management additions such as antibiotics.
