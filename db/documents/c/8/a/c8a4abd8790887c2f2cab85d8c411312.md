The sural nerve provides sensory feedback from the lateral ankle and foot. It forms from two branches of periphery nerves: the tibial nerve and the peroneal nerve. Around the level of the gastrocnemius muscle origin, the medial sural cutaneous nerve branches from the tibial nerve. This branch merges with the lateral sural cutaneous nerve, which is a branch of the common peroneal nerve given off around the level of the fibular head. Although variations in anatomy can be present, one study showed that 85% of cadaveric specimens had these innervations.

During the harvesting of the sural nerve, the surgeon will also encounter the lesser saphenous vein. This vein originates at the level of the venous arch of the foot around the fifth digit, courses posteriorly and laterally with the sural nerve, and terminates between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle into the popliteal vein.

The sural nerve typically functions as a purely sensory nerve, although some studies have found small motor fibers in post-mortem biopsy.
