A meticulous clinical history and physical examination for urethral trauma are necessary when evaluating a patient for urinary catheterization. Traumatic injury to the urethra is a contraindication to urinary catheterization without direct visualization. Clinical signs correlating with injuries, such as blood at the urethral meatus and a high-riding prostate, suggest urethral injury, and an attempt at Foley catheterization should only be made under direct visualization with the aid of a cystoscope. The lack of blood or high-riding prostate is insufficient to rule out urethral injury. One must use clinical judgment when evaluating the patient's mechanism of injury to determine if a traumatic urethral injury is likely. If in doubt, a retrograde urethrogram should be performed.
