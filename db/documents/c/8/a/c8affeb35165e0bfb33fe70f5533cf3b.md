Understanding the anatomy of the thorax is vital, as it provides access to the heart, great vessels, lungs, diaphragm, and mediastinum.

- The intercostal nerve block is a procedure through which local anesthetic agent is injected around the intercostal nerve between the paravertebral line and the area of required anesthesia for different surgical procedures. However, the surgeon needs to anesthetize the adjacent nerve as well because of considerable overlapping of contiguous dermatomes occurs.

- Median sternotomies are the most commonly performed osteotomy in the world and a standard incision for thoracic and cardiac surgery. The median sternotomy is a critical procedure in which the surgeon splits the sternum in the median plane to gain access to the heart, great vessels, as well as the lungs.

- Flail chest is an extremely painful injury affecting the respiration, often caused by blunt chest trauma, resulting in multiple successive rib fractures. The fractured ribs of the anterior and/or lateral chest wall move inward on inspiration and outward on expiration (paradoxical) and may be associated with pneumothorax and/or contusion of the heart and lung. Today, flail chest management is through pain control, pulmonary toilet, and early ambulation. It is not common to surgically repair the ribs.
