Mediastinal carcinoid tumors are extremely rare malignancies with aggressive behavior and a grim prognosis. These malignancies often go undetected until they are finally diagnosed at advanced stages. Symptoms at the time of presentation can grossly vary and are generally equivocal. A high level of suspicion needs to be ascertained for a diligent workup. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of thymic neuroendocrine tumors and highlights the role of the healthcare team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of mediastinal carcinoid tumors. 
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of mediastinal carcinoid tumors.
- Identify the management options available for mediastinal carcinoid tumors.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication within the interprofessional team in the care of patients with mediastinal carcinoid tumors to improve outcomes.
