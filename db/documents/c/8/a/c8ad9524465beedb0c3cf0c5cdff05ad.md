Most galactoceles are seen in lactating mothers, and they usually resolve spontaneously or with conservative management. An interprofessional team including surgeons, clinicians, and nurses will provide a holistic and integrated approach to lactating mothers for early diagnosis and treatment of galactocele, which will lead to the best outcomes.

It is helpful to refer the patient to a clinical radiologist when the breast lump warrants further investigation; for example, galactocele in infants or non-lactating women, galactocele not resolving spontaneously. FNA done under ultrasound guidance can be reviewed with a cytopathologist to help the clinician clinch a diagnosis. Collaboration and communication with the radiologist and the pathologist are key elements for a good outcome.

When galactocele gets complicated by forming a breast abscess, the aspirated pus must be sent for culture, and the opinion of a microbiologist will be invaluable to initiate antibiotics as per the antibiotic sensitivity reports. Shared decision-making between the clinician and the general surgeon based on the evidence-based and a patient-specific tailored approach to determine the need and the timing of surgical interventions gives better outcomes. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and educate the patient and family. [Level 5]
