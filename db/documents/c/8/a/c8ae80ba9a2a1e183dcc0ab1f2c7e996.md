Estimates of the combined prevalence of acute porphyrias are 5 cases per 10000 persons. Out of all these clinical syndromes, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) that has prominent cutaneous features, is the most common porphyria, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10000. AIP, the most common acute porphyria, has an overall European prevalence of approximately 1 in 2000,Â with a higher incidence of 1 in 1000 in Sweden due to the founder effect. Recently, there are also reports of the founder effect correlating with a higher prevalence of AIP in certain ethnic groups in Argentina and Spain.

Acute intermittent porphyria is a low-penetrant genetic metabolic disease with penetrance considered to be around 10% to 20%.

Acute intermittent porphyria affects women to a greater degree than men, with a ratio of between 1.5 and 2 to 1. Attacks are rare before puberty. The typical age for the appearance of symptoms is between 18 to 40 years.
