Small unruptured cerebral aneurysms (less than 7 mm) have a low risk of rupture. Morbidity and mortality are very high once a cerebral aneurysm ruptures. SAH due to aneurysm rupture is a catastrophic event with a mortality rate ranging from 25% to 50%. Nearly 50% of the survivors will have a permanent disability.

The annual risk of rupture of an aortic aneurysm is low when the size is less than 45 mm. When an aneurysm ruptures, approximately 50% of patients die before they reach the emergency department. Those who survive have very high morbidity. When all locations are included, there is approximately perioperative mortality of 2% to 17%, with the arch of aorta location approaching a 25% mortality. The outcome depends on the timing of intervention, the location, the type of surgery, the experience of the surgeon, concomitant comorbidities, and if it has ruptured.
