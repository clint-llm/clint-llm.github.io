Facet-mediated pain is due to facet arthropathy or facet arthritis which arise during the degenerative process of the spinal column. A single facet joint is composed of the inferior articulating process of one vertebra and the superior articulating process of the vertebra directly inferior.

Medial branches from the dorsal rami of spinal nerve roots at the same level and one level above provide sensory innervation to the facet (for example, the L4-L5 facet joint is innervated by the medial branches of L3 and L4). The medial branches typically course over the lateral border of the superior articulating process.

An insulated electrode with a non-insulated tip is advanced toward the concavity that is formed between the superior articulating process and the adjacent transverse process, which is in proximity to the nerve that is suspected of causing the symptoms. It is in this region where the use of high-frequency or radiofrequency energy is generated to produce a lesion via coagulative necrosis, therebyÂ disrupting afferent pain signals. In Pain Medicine, the use of radiofrequency ablation most commonly involves targeting the specific medial branches of the dorsal rami that innervate pain-producing facet joints under fluoroscopic guidance. However, further investigations regarding the efficacy of ablation in other common pain syndromes continue to diversify its use.
