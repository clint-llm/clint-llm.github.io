**Multicolor Fundus Photography**

Multicolor imaging of the fundus uses lasers of three different wavelengths to capture an image of the retina in contrast to the bright flash of light used to capture routine color fundus images. The blue (488 nm), green (515 nm), and infrared (820 nm) wavelengths depict information from different retinal depths.

The advantages of multicolor imaging include high contrast images, better resolution, reduction in image noise due to eye tracking mechanism, better comfort to the patient as laser beams are used for image capture instead of a bright flash of light, and the ability to image in a miotic pupil. The disadvantages include that it requires a slightly more extended fixation period and is highly operator dependent on acquiring artifact-free images.

**Fundus Autofluorescence**

Fundus autofluorescence is a non-invasive technique that utilizes the fluorescent properties of inherently occurring substances in the retina. Lipofuscin is the predominant fluorophore of the retina and is composed of over ten bisretinoid compounds, which are byproducts of the vitamin A cycle. Among them, N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine (A2E) is the best-characterized component of lipofuscin.

**Contrast-enhanced Angiography - Fundus Fluorescein Angiography and Indocyanine Green Angiography**

Fundus fluorescein angiography is a technique of imaging the retinal vasculature by using sodium fluorescein dye. Indocyanine green angiography utilizes a higher wavelength that penetrates the retinal pigment epithelium and helps in imaging the choroidal vasculature. The transit of the dye through the retinal vasculature gives an idea of circulatory disturbances in the retina and choroid. When coupled with ultra-widefield imaging can give an idea of the dye transit through the entire retina and choroid.

**Adaptive Optics**

Adaptive optics technology eliminates the higher and lower-order aberrations that result in the ability to image individual photoreceptors. It has been successfully integrated with fundus photography, SLO, and optical coherence tomography. It helps assess the cone density and distribution in the macula in normal individuals and diseased states like inherited retinal diseases. Hence, it may be utilized to evaluate the extent of damage caused by the disease's progress, monitor progression, and assess response to therapeutic interventions like gene therapy. The utility of adaptive optics is still in the research stage and is yet to be introduced for day-to-day clinical use.

**Ultrawidefield Imaging**

Ultra-widefield imaging enables to capture of the entire retina up to 200 degrees, depending on the commercial models used. This is especially useful in children and anxious patients who might be unable to fix in different gazes to image the different parts of the retina. The ability to capture such an extensive field in a non-mydriatic state is an added advantage and may be useful in patients in whom dilatation is contraindicated or unwilling for dilatation. It has a few disadvantages, like pseudocolor imaging and low posterior pole resolution. Though binocular indirect ophthalmoscope is the gold standard of examination of the retina, wide-field imaging may document and monitor progress in patients with vitreoretinal and choroidal pathologies.
