Ebstein anomaly is thought to be associated with chromosome 15q duplications, thought to be involved in the embryological development of the heart in utero. There are case reports suggesting a possible association of Ebstein anomaly with chromosome 11q rearrangements. Others have shown an association between Ebstein malformation and mutations in the MYH7 gene, which is frequently associated with cardiomyopathies. Ebstein has also been associated with mutations in the NKX2-5 gene, which is a cardiac transcription factor responsible for the association between atrial septal defects with atrioventricular conduction defects. The NKX2-5 gene has also been associated with tetralogy of Fallot.

Another known association of Ebstein anomaly is the teratogenic effect of Lithium. Case-control and cohort studies in the 1970s and 1980s of pregnant women taking Lithium demonstrated a risk of Ebstein anomaly in <2% of their newborns.
