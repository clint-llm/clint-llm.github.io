Malaria is present throughout most of the tropical areas of the world. P. ovale malaria is endemic to tropical Western Africa. It is relatively unusual outside of Africa and comprises less than 1% of isolates where found. It is also seen in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea, but is relatively rare in these areas. P. ovale infection, the frequency of P. ovale relative to P. falciparum, and P. vivax was a ratio less than 1:1000. P. ovale malaria are rare, possibly due to the relative rarity of P. ovale infection.

In many parts of Africa and Asia, malaria and HIV infection coexist; the combination usually leads to poorer outcomes than either infection alone.

Malaria is equally likely in both genders. However, P. falciparum is known to have high morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. Fetal complications can include anemia, low birth weight, death, or premature birth.
