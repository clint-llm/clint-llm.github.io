There are no major risks or complications to the fetus or mother undergoing a transabdominal ultrasound. A potential complication in the transvaginal approach is the possibility of inadvertently inserting the probe through the cervical os, causing a hemorrhage in the setting of an unknown placenta previa or vasa previa. However, this risk is very low if the scan provider or sonographer is properly credentialed and trained in the technique. Taking precautions by starting each examination with the transabdominal approach to locate the placenta can avoid this possible risk.
