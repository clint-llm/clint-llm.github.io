**Early stage:**

- For patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides (IIA or below), the various treatment options are topical corticosteroids, topical nitrogen mustards (mechlorethamine, HN2), topical bexarotene, imiquimod, psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy or ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy.  Local radiation therapy may be used for localized lesions (such as in pagetoid reticulosis).

- For patients with highly symptomatic, generalized thickened plaques in whom a prompt response is needed, the recommendation is total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) or skin-directed therapies in combination with systemic therapies rather than HN2 or UVB alone.

- Systemic therapies, such as retinoids or interferons, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, or low-dose methotrexate are used if skin-directed therapies fail, if skin symptoms are extensive/severe, or if patients have a worse prognostic profile such as folliculotropic mycosis fungoides, large cell transformation, or early blood involvement.

**Advanced Stage**

- Advanced stage (IIB to IV) mycosis fungoides is a heterogeneous group that encompasses those patients that present with extracutaneous disease or advanced skin lesions (e.g., tumors). It is often a chronic or persistent disease with a relapsing course. The main goals of therapy are long-term disease control, prompt symptom relief, and management of life-threatening (aggressive) disease.

- For most patients with cutaneous tumors involving a limited percent body surface area (typically less than 10%), treatment with localized radiation to the tumors plus skin-directed therapy as needed for concurrent patch/plaque disease is recommended.

- For patients with generalized tumors, total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) or systemic therapies are acceptable treatment options. TSEBT can be followed by other skin-directed therapies or systemic therapies to prolong response duration.

- For more extensive disease, combinations of skin-directed therapies and systemic therapies are used. The various systemic options available include methotrexate, bexarotene, targeted immunotherapy (such as alemtuzumab), polychemotherapy, etc.

- Patients with disease that is difficult to control should be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with curative intent.
