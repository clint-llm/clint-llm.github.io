When the liver is injured during surgery or penetrating trauma, the bleeding can be torrential and quickly lead to hemorrhagic shock or death. A lifesaving maneuver sometimes performed to stop the bleeding is the Pringle maneuver, which was first described in 1908 by a surgeon named James Hogarth Pringle in Glasgow, Scotland. This surgical maneuver involves compressing the hepatoduodenal ligament withÂ a clamp. This clamping interrupts blood flow to the liver and helps control bleeding. If no clamp is available, one may use their fingers to compress the ligament. If the bleeding from the liver continues, this indicates that the inferior vena cava or the hepatic vein may have suffered an injury.

Complications of the Pringle maneuver include ischemia and portal hypertension. It may also lead to a reperfusion phenomenon if the clamping time is prolonged. There are no absolute contraindications to the Pringle maneuver. However, in patients with a compromised liver function such as cirrhosis, one should not clamp for more than 10 minutes at a time.
