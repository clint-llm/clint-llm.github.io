Chronicity of the pain after injury or entrapment of the ilioinguinal nerve is not uncommon. But, the majority of patients respond well to nerve block or surgical neurectomy. However, some patients may continue to have burning pain for months or years. This pain is often unaffected by the usual analgesics; patients may require management by a pain specialist in such cases.
