Environmental factors influence the appearance of plaques and papules in Darier disease. Most patients will experience an increase in these lesions during summer when exposed to heat and humidity. Exposure to UV light, friction (e.g., tight-fitting clothing), minor injury or friction such as occurs with rubbing or scratching, and ingesting certain medications can also increase the appearance of lesions. Therefore patient s need to receive counsel on these precipitating factors so they can practice appropriate preventative measures.
