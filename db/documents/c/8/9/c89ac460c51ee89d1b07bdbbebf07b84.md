Prophylaxis against reactivation of T. gondii in seropositive patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/microliterÂ is recommended. Mostly used is trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Other options include dapsone plus pyrimethamine and folinic acid**or**atovaquone with or without pyrimethamine/leucovorin.

In conclusion, toxoplasmosis should always be included in the differential diagnosis of CNS lesions in advanced HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is a combination of clinical symptoms and signs, serology and imaging. CSF may further support the diagnosis. Brain biopsy is often reserved for difficult cases. Treatment is often dramatic, and most patients have a favorable clinical outcome.
