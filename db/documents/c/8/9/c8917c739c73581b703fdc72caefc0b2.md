As discussed above, low levels of aldosterone render spironolactone ineffective in Liddle syndrome patients. The drug of choice is amiloride and it works well because it directly inhibits ENaC. Amiloride is prescribed daily at a dose that ranges from 5 to 20 mg. Triamterene, another potassium-sparing diuretic similar to amiloride, can also be used to manage this syndrome. A sodium-restricted diet showed a cumulative effect with these drugs.
