The muscarinic receptor consists of M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 receptor subtypes. All muscarinic receptors are part of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). A molecule activates GPCRs; in this case, muscarinic receptors become activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Activation of GPCRs leads to ligand binding, which leads to the generation of second messengers depending on which class of G protein is present in the receptor.Â Gq receptors are excitatory and generate phospholipase C and protein kinase C (PKC). Phospholipase C will then produce second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG and IP3 work to increase protein kinase and calcium intracellularly, which provide the mechanism for an excitatory reaction. Gi receptors are inhibitory and cause a decrease of adenylyl cyclase, leading to the reduction of protein kinase A. With decreased protein kinase A, cellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate decrease and cause an inhibitory reaction within the cell. M1, M3, M5 are stimulatory receptors and are composed of the Gq protein, whereas M2 and M4 receptors are inhibitory receptors and are composed of the Gi protein.
