Felty syndrome (FS) is a rare extra-articular manifestation of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) characterized by RA, neutropenia, and splenomegaly. Severe or recurrent infection is of particular concern due to neutropenia, especially in the skin and respiratory system. This activity focuses on increasing awareness about this rare condition among clinicians and discussing the importance of interprofessional care involved in treating patients with FS.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation and the laboratory markers needed to make the diagnosis of Felty syndrome. 
- Identify the ways to differentiate between Felty syndrome and pseudo-Felty syndrome. 
- Review the stepwise approach to the treatment and management of Felty syndrome.
- Outline inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes in Felty syndrome.
