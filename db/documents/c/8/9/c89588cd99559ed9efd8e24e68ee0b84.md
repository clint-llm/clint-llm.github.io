At the cellular level, TPP is the pressure differential exerted at the interface between the alveolar surface and the pleural space. Since TPP is the transmural pressure across the lungs, by convention, it is measured as the pressure on the inside of the structure minus the pressure on the outside of the structure. In this case, this would translate toÂ alveolar pressure minus intrapleural pressure. The change in TPP also affects the compliance of the lung. Lung compliance is the change in lung volume produced by a given change in TPP. In order words, a highly compliant lung will more easily expand when a more significant TPP is applied. In contrast, a stiff lung will require a more considerable TPP to produce an inevitable increase in lung volume.
