The procedure is routinely done in a sterile procedure suite, with the patient lying prone on a procedure table.

Key components of the procedure include:

- C-arm mobile fluoroscopic unit

- Local anesthetic

- continuous high-frequency generator with the built-in thermocouple, impedance, voltage, and amperage monitor

- Introducer needles (50 to 150 mmÂ in length, 18 to 22 gauge in diameter)

- Active and ground electrodes

The active electrode delivers the high-frequency current, which is dissipated through a ground electrode attached to the patient.
