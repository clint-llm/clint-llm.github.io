**Nutritional Assessment**

While performing nutritional assessment, it is important to understand that there is no single best test to evaluate nutritional status. Information should be collected systematically, and an evaluation of nutritional status should be done based on the overall data collected. As per the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) guidelines, a comprehensive nutritional assessment involves a thorough clinical examination (history and physical examination), anthropometric measurements, diagnostic tests, and dietary assessments.

Additional clinical examinations or diagnostic tests may be necessary for different groups of populations and individuals with specific underlying pathology. As per the International Consensus guidelines committee, the diagnosis of malnutrition in adults can be categorized as (i) starvation-related malnutrition (chronic, non-inflammatory), (ii) acute disease or injury-related malnutrition (mild to severe inflammation), or (iii) chronic disease-related malnutrition (chronic mild to moderate inflammation).

Given below are the components of a comprehensive nutritional assessment that need to be performed while evaluating the nutritional status of individuals.

**Clinical History:**Patients' clinical history is a crucial component of nutritional assessment. Clinical history aims to look for indications of malnutrition and identify underlying factors that may lead to malnutrition or increase the risk of malnutrition.

- Once patient identification markers (name, age, sex) are noted, take a detailed history of chief complaints.

- If not mentioned in chief complaints, ask for other constitutional symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, or sleep disturbances. The presence of these symptoms can be an indication of underlying pathologies. For example, fever suggests active infection or inflammation.

- Inquire about the patient’s usual weight and ask if there have been any weight changes. Weight loss of >10% of body weight can signify underlying pathology. Weight gain can be suggestive of various underlying endocrine pathologies. Weight gain can also lead to insulin resistance contributing to metabolic syndrome.

- Ask if there are any symptoms suggestive of malnutrition other than weight changes, such as rashes, sores in the mouth, dryness of skin and eyes, loss of night vision, hair loss, bleeding gums, poor healing of wounds, swelling of extremities, tingling, or numbness.

- Ask about eating habits and dietary preferences. For example, ask about the number of meals eaten in a day, approximate portion sizes, whether they are following any restrictive diets, whether they are vegan or vegetarian, or if they are allergic to any food items. This can help in diagnosing a possible nutritional deficiency. For example, a vegan diet may be associated with vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency.

- Ask about any factors affecting food intake, like poor dentition, ulceration in the oral cavity, difficulty in swallowing, loss of appetite, heartburn, nausea, and/or vomiting. Further, inquire about bowel habits, which help assess the general functioning of the gastrointestinal system. Also, ask if there is any abdominal pain, abdominal distention, diarrhea, flatulence, or constipation, which can indicate underlying gastrointestinal pathologies that affect nutritional status.

- Ask about any current major clinical or surgical illnesses, including mental illnesses. Also, ask if they are taking any medications, either prescribed or over the counter. Ask if there is any history of chronic illnesses, hospitalization, trauma, or malignancies. The impact of current or past illnesses on nutritional status is discussed below.

- In female patients, detailed menstrual history should be taken. Amenorrhea in child-bearing aged women can indicate pregnancy, chronic infection, chronic illness, eating disorder, etc., which can affect the nutritional status of patients. History suggestive of menorrhagia can reveal the presence of anemia. Also, a history of contraceptive use is essential. Women on oral contraceptive pills have different nutritional requirements. Oral contraceptive pills have been shown to deplete B vitamins, vitamin C, and some minerals, such as magnesium, selenium, and zinc.

- Next, ask questions related to lifestyle habits (active vs. sedentary), daily physical activities, and exercise routine.

- History about social habits such as drinking, smoking, tobacco consumption, or other non-prescription drugs should also be taken.

- Since socioeconomic conditions can affect nutritional status, request information related to this as well.

- Finally, family history can also be useful for the early diagnosis of conditions that can affect a patient's nutritional status or help identify underlying predisposing conditions.

**Dietary Assessment:**Dietary assessment is necessary to ensure adequate nutrition and hydration intake. It is advised to consult a qualified registered dietitian-nutritionist (RDN), if available, to obtain a thorough dietary assessment.

- The information can be collected from various sources such as the patients themselves, family members, caregivers, or medical records.

- History about dietary habits, frequency of meals, and serving sizes needs to be collected. As mentioned earlier, details about food preferences, restrictive diets, and allergies should be noted.

- Current nutrient and fluid intake should be recorded. Methods such as the 24-hour recall method, food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), diet charts, observation, etc., can be used. Wearable monitoring devices, phone apps, or nutrition analysis software can be used as aids.

- If patients are on any nutritional supplements, care must be taken to record the frequency and dosage to limit the risk of nutrient insufficiency and toxicity.

- If patients are on parenteral or enteral diets, information on feeding regimens (quantity and frequency) should be noted. Factors affecting these feedings, such as displacement of feeding tubes, site irritation, or infections, should be considered.

**Physical examination:**The next component of the nutritional assessment is physical examination. The physical examination aims to identify signs of malnutrition and factors affecting nutritional status.

- General condition: General condition and appearance of the patient should be observed. Look for any signs of emaciation. Note whether the patient is conscious, alert, and ambulatory. Make a note of whether a patient is being examined in a hospital or outpatient setting. An initial observation of the patient's cognitive, mental, and emotional status should be noted. Also, note any parenteral or enteral feeding devices being used. A patient's general condition can help determine whether a patient can meet their nutritional needs and/or whether their condition is causing their malnutrition or putting them at a higher risk of nutrition deficiencies.

- Vital signs: Vital signs (body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiratory rate) should be checked. Temperature > 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius can signify active inflammation/infection. Hypothermia (temperature < 95 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 degrees Celsius) can be associated with conditions causing impaired nutritional status, such as sepsis, trauma, burns, stroke, alcohol intoxication, and metabolic disorders like hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and Wernicke encephalopathy.

- Height and Weight: Measure the height and weight of the patient. Body mass index (BMI) calculated from these variables can help determine whether an individual is undernourished or overnourished. Details about BMI and other anthropometric measurements are discussed later.

- Eyes: Look for pallor, which may be indicative of various nutrient deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin B6, vitamin C, or protein deficiency), as well as various chronic illnesses. Look for icterus, suggesting metabolic disturbances associated with the hepatobiliary system. The presence of Bitot spots and xerosis is indicative of vitamin A deficiency. Xanthelasmas, yellow-colored plaques on eyelids, can suggest obesity, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes mellitus.

- Oral cavity and perioral region: Assess the general health of the oral cavity and look for pathologies that can affect the adequate intake of nutrients. Also, look for glossitis, angular stomatitis, and cheilosis, which can indicate vitamin B complex deficiency. Bleeding gums and gingivitis are suggestive of vitamin C deficiency. Again, look for pallor. If an eating disorder is suspected, look for vomiting-related oral damage, for example, discoloration of teeth, loss of enamel, cavities, and enlarged salivary glands.

- Skin: Assess the general health of the skin. Xeroderma (extremely dry skin) can signify vitamin A and/or essential fatty acid deficiencies. Petechia, purpura, and ecchymosis may be associated with vitamin C and vitamin K deficiencies. Vitamin C deficiency can also present with perifollicular hemorrhage. Poorly healed wounds indicate vitamin C, protein, and/or zinc deficiencies. Pigmentation and rashes in sun-exposed areas (around the neck and on extremities in glove and stocking patterns) can be due to niacin deficiency.

- Hair: Various nutrients are required to maintain the health of hair and hair follicles. Dry hair can be a sign of vitamin A or vitamin E deficiency. Biotin deficiency can make hair brittle. Severe undernutrition, especially protein deficiency, can lead to discolored and easily pluckable hair, eventually resulting in hair loss. Rapid hair loss can also be indicative of underlying systemic illnesses.

- Nails: Assess the general health of nails and nailbeds. Dry and brittle nails can be associated with various nutritional deficiencies, such as deficiencies in biotin, zinc, and proteins. Discoloration of nails is another sign of poor nutrition.

- Extremities: Examine all extremities carefully. Protein or thiamine deficiency can lead to edema. Vitamin B12, thiamine, vitamin E, and vitamin B6 deficiencies can present with paresthesia and muscle weakness. Loss of vibration and position sensation can also be observed in individuals with vitamin B12 and/or vitamin E deficiencies. Patients with diabetes mellitus may also show signs of peripheral neuropathy, foot ulceration, or gangrene. Severe undernutrition, as well as chronic illnesses, can lead to muscle atrophy and wasting. Bowing of lower limbs can be seen in children with vitamin D deficiency rickets.

- Odors: Certain odors can be suggestive of specific disorders or substance use. Detection of fruity acetone odor in patients with ketoacidosis, musty odor in patients with phenylketonuria, sweet burnt sugary odor in patients with Maple syrup disorder, or the smell of alcohol can also be helpful during the examination of patients.

- Functional assessment: It is essential to do a functional assessment of patients. Observe whether patients are ambulatory and whether they can eat and drink with or without assistance. Examine the strength of extremities to determine whether they can perform activities of daily living (ADLs) or other physical activities. Mental assessment is also crucial, along with physical assessment. For example, elderly patients with severe malnutrition may be physically (due to weakness) and mentally (due to dementia) incapable of maintaining healthy nutritional status. Similarly, patients with thiamine deficiency may develop Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff psychosis and may become incapable of meeting their own dietary needs.

- Systemic evaluation: An appropriate systemic examination should be performed based on the history and general examination findings.

**Anthropometric Measurements**

- Height, weight, and BMI: Measure the weight and height of the patient, as mentioned above. Patients should be advised to avoid wearing heavy garments or shoes while these measurements are taken. Bed or chair scales may be needed if patients are not ambulatory or cannot stand. In pediatric age groups, these parameters are plotted on growth charts to assess growth and nutritional status. BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is also calculated using these parameters, and the state of nutrition can be assessed. In adults, BMI < 18.5 kg/m^2: underweight; BMI = 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m^2: within normal range; BMI > 24.9 to 29.9 kg/m^2: overweight; and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2: obesity.

- Factors such as edema and hydration should be considered while making these determinations, as they can affect the weight and BMI values. BMI cannot differentiate between muscle mass and adipose tissue/fat mass. And finally, BMI does not take into account micronutrient deficiencies.

- Other anthropometric measurements: Circumference (arm, abdomen, and thigh) measurements and skinfold (biceps skinfold, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, and suprailiac skinfold) thickness measurements can also help with the evaluation of nutritional status. Skinfold thickness measurements are considered indicators of energy stores (mainly lipid stores). Circumference measurement, namely midarm circumference (MAC), can be used to derive midarm muscle circumference (MAMC=MAC-3.1414 X triceps skinfold thickness), which is an indicator of protein stores. While these tests can quickly be done at the bedside without additional cost, subjectivity in terms of measurements and the applicability of results across various populations can make these tests less reliable.

- A complete anthropometric assessment may also involve body composition measurements, which are discussed in diagnostic tests.

**Diagnostic tests:**The next component of the nutritional assessment is diagnostic tests, which are done to validate the results of the clinical presentation.

**Laboratory Tests**

- Routine clinical tests: Routine clinical tests can help evaluate the patient's overall status (as well as nutritional status).

- Low cholesterol levels can be seen in undernourished individuals. Low hemoglobin is suggestive of anemia. Lymphocyte functioning and proliferation are affected in chronic malnutrition and may manifest as decreased lymphocyte count.

- Visceral proteins:

- Micronutrient levels: If specific micronutrient deficiencies are suspected, individual micronutrient levels can be measured. For example, levels of B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid, B12), vitamins A, C, D, E, and K, iron, zinc, selenium, homocysteine, etc., can be measured. More specific tests such as the Schilling test for B12 deficiency or iron panel to differentiate between different types of anemia can also be performed based on clinical presentation.

- Other non-nutrition-specific markers can also be used; for example, C-reactive protein (CRP) can be used to indicate inflammation.

**Body Composition Studies**

Apart from laboratory tests, body composition studies can be performed to estimate the body's composition in terms of water, air, muscle, bones, and fat mass.

- Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA): This helps analyze the body composition based on the ability of different body tissues to conduct electricity. Conductance is higher in tissues with more water and electrolytes (for example, blood) and less in adipose and bone tissues. This is an easy, non-invasive test that can be done at the bedside using low-cost equipment. However, in patients with extremely high BMI or fluid overload, the results may be less accurate.

- Dual-Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA): This is a standard method used to determine body composition and is also used as a reference to compare other body composition tests. However, it is expensive, requires a specialized machine, and involves exposure to X-rays. It is more commonly used in clinical research than in routine clinical practice.

- Other tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can also be used to determine body composition but are expensive options for routine nutritional assessment. Body composition, however, can be determined when imaging is done for other diagnostic purposes.
