**Nonoperative Management**

The initial management of LHBT instability is nonsurgical. A period of rest and activity modification is beneficial in the acute setting, coupled with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most authors agree that, especially in the setting of significant LHBT instability, especially in younger active patients involved in sports or manual laborers, surgical treatment is usually necessary.

**Physical Therapy**

Successful physical therapy regimens target the underlying source(s) contributing to the LHBT pathology. For example, early instability in overhead athletes can be managed with an earlier aggressive intervention focused on improving pitching/overhead throwing mechanics.

The physical therapist should recognize the concomitant shoulder pathologies as part of the entire constellation at presentation. LHBT pathology can be seen in association with GIRD in overhead athletes/baseball pitchers, poor trunk control, scapular dyskinesia, and internal impingement.

Strengthening protocols should focus on restoring muscle balance across the shoulder girdle, including rotator cuff and periscapular muscle strengthening programs. Focused stretching on the anterior shoulder structures, including pectoralis minor, should also be considered. Other modalities such as dry needling have demonstrated promise in preliminary animal studies.

**Injections**

In the setting of most LHBT pathology, including potential subtle instability, injections represent a reasonable consideration in the nonoperative modality arsenal. There is some controversy concerning the type of technique used (ultrasound [US]-guided versus blind injection) and exact location utilized for the injection (subacromial, intra-articular, bicipital groove/sheath). Theoretically, in the setting of concomitant shoulder pathologies, an intra-articular injection would also reach the LHBT in the bicipital groove, as the sheath is contiguous with the glenohumeral joint synovial tissue.

Direct injection is targeted to the sheath and not the LHB tendon directly. Although not definitively documented, an intratendinous LHB tendon injection may predispose the patient to tendon rupture.  In a 2011 randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing injection accuracy (with post-injection CT imaging to confirm injection placement by location) of US-guided versus blind bicipital sheath injections at its location in the groove. Potential injection location results included (1) solely in the tendon sheath, (2) inside the tendon, in the tendon sheath, and surrounding (but outside) the tendon sheath, and (3) confined to only the area outside the tendon sheath. The US-guided injections resulted in 87% accuracy for injecting the tendon sheath alone (location "1"). By stark contrast, the blind injection was accurate only 27% of the time, and one-third of the time, the tendon itself and the entire bicipital sheath was missed altogether.

**Surgical Management**

In most cases of true LHBT instability, either in isolation or the setting of associated shoulder injuries, nonoperative management often fails.  Indications for surgical management include:

- Persistent symptoms despite a trial of attempted nonoperative management

- LHBT instability, including persistent subluxation and/or dislocation causing patient-reported pain and disability with desired activities

- Concomitant shoulder pathologies in the setting of LHBT instability, including:

- 
              
- Partial-thickness tears of the LHB tendon (greater than 25% to 50%)
              
              
- Biceps soft tissue pulley lesions (subscapularis, supraspinatus, SGHL/CHL complex)

- Lesser tuberosity injuries causing persistent LHBT instability and/or functional compromise

- 
              
- Includes a history of injury with malunion, nonunion, or acute avulsions

**Surgical Techniques**

Diagnostic Approach and Dynamic Exam

After performing a standard diagnostic arthroscopy sequence, A 30-degree scope is advanced into the shoulder's anterior compartment with attention on the soft tissue pulley components. The arm is internally and externally rotating to evaluate for the presence of any LHB instability or laxity of the soft tissue pulley. A probe is used to assist in the dynamic examination to assess LHBT instability, and additionally bringing the arm into forward elevation with rotation, the LHBT is evaluated for possible medial/inferior subluxation of the LHB tendon.  In the setting of LHB tendon instability, this maneuver will lead to tendon entrapment within the joint. The entrapment is relieved with external rotation of the arm. The SGHL/CHL complex and the subscapularis are individually probed and inspected for the presence of any lesions.

The LHBT is then probed and pulled into the joint under traction, allowing for inspection of the proximal portion of the extra-articular tendon. Tenosynovitis is often indicated by a “rush” of yellow synovial fluid emanating from the bicipital groove itself.  The tendon itself is inspected for any fraying or peritendinitis.

The rotator cuff is assessed during shoulder motion. The subscapularis is inspected during dynamic internal rotation movement, and the supraspinatus is inspected during external rotation and abduction of the shoulder.

Biceps Tenotomy

Arthroscopic inspection of the tendon allows for the estimation of the relative percentage of the LHB tendon that is compromised. A popular classification system utilized for the intra-operative grade corresponding to the degree of LHB tendon macroscopic pathology is the Lafosse grading scale

- Grade 0: Normal tendon

- Grade 1: Minor lesion (partial, localized areas of tendon erosion/fraying, focal areas affect less than 50% of the tendon width)

- Grade 2: Major lesion (extensive tendon loss, compromising greater than 50% of the tendon width)

Some surgeons solely debride the tendon in the setting of less than 25% to 50% tendinous compromise. Arthroscopic biceps tenotomy is performed by releasing the tendon as close as possible to the superior labrum. As long as the tendon is free from intimate soft tissue adhesions to surrounding structures, the tendon should retract distally toward the bicipital groove. If adhesions are present, all efforts should be made to mobilize the tendon to allow for retraction following the tenotomy. In cases where the LHB tendon is particularly hypertrophic and scarred to other soft tissue structures in the joint, this serves as a potential source of postoperative pain.

Biceps Tenodesis

- Recommended over tenotomy in the setting of LHBT instability

- The preferred technique in younger patients, athletes, laborers, and those patients specifically concerned with postoperative cosmetic (“Popeye”) deformity

- Optimizes the length-tension relationship of the biceps muscle; mitigates the postoperative risk of muscle atrophy, fatigue, and cramping.

Various locations for the tenodesis itself, in addition to the fixation technique used, provide equivalent results in terms of patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. In general, the purpose of a tenodesis procedure is to anchor the biceps tendon in a new location (i.e., out of the bicipital groove itself).

A spinal needle is used to “tag” the tendon near its entrance into the bicipital groove with fiberwire. Next, an arthroscopic cutter is used to release the intra-articular portion of the tendon close to its origin. The residual “stump” is shaved back to the superior labrum.

Next, the arthroscope is taken into the subacromial space, and the tagging sutures help localize the LHBT. A subdeltoid and subacromial decompression/bursectomy are performed as needed depending on the extent of bursal adhesions. This step also helps with visualization.

Next, the bicipital groove is opened up with a cautery device at the distal extent of the groove. After the sheath is opened, the LHBT is visualized and mobilized. Various tenodesis sites and fixation components can be used (suture anchors, interference screws, bone tunnels). As the all-arthroscopic techniques are improved, most surgeons began advocating to utilize the suprapectoral region, distal to the bicipital groove, after debriding the soft tissue in the desired location between the subscapularis and pectoralis major.  Care is taken to maintain the appropriate position to optimize the length-tension relationship. Once fixation is complete, any residual tendon that remains prominent from the fixation point is carefully resected.

An alternative to the all-arthroscopic tenodesis procedure is the open subpectoral approach. Several studies have compared outcomes between the two techniques, with most reporting equivalent results and patient-reported outcomes. An additional incision must be used, followed by removing the LHBT entirely from the bicipital groove and tenodesis fixation utilizing the options mentioned above. Again, attention is given to maintaining the appropriate length-tension relationship of the tendon fixation and tension on the biceps muscle belly.
