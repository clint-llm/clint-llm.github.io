The prognosis of neutrophilia depends on the prognosis of the underlying cause of neutrophilia. Neutrophilia seen in infection/inflammatory state resolves with treatment of these states. Neutrophilia associated with medications can also resolve once either treatment is over or the drug is discontinued. The prognosis in CML has been drastically improved with the introduction of TKIs, including Imatinib and HCT.
