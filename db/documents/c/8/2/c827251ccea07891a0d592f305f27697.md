**Respiratory functions of lungs:**

- **Respiration:**The lungs are the primary organs of respiration, where the exchange of gases takes place. In the alveoli, which are the functional units of lungs, the oxygen is taken up, and carbon dioxide is removed from the bloodstream through the alveolar-capillary bed

- **Air conditioning:**The function of conducting part is not only to lead the air but also acts as an efficient air conditioner. This conditioning is done by warming/cooling the inhaled air to bring it to the level of body temperature, humidifying the air, and also the removal of all the foreign particles present in it. The removal of foreign particles like dust, bacteria, virus, etc., is done by mucous secretion, which traps the suspended particles and beating of the cilia, which clears the mucus from the respiratory passage

**Non-respiratory functions of lungs:**

Even though the lungs are primarily for respiration,Â studies indicate that they have many non-respiratory functions. Some of the few important ones are mentioned below.

- Converting an inactive chemical precursor into its active form, like turning angiotensin-I into angiotensin-II, which help in raising of blood pressure

- It is also an essential site for degrading/inactivating important vasoactive chemical mediators like bradykinin, serotonin, and norepinephrine

- The bronchial mucosa also contains a small cluster of neuroendocrine cells

- Pulmonary epithelium acts as the first line of defense for the inspired air
