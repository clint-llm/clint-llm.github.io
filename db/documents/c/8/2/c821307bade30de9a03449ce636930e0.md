As withÂ any other medication, there are clinically significant side effects associated with the use of insulin. Insulin administration can lead to local hypersensitivity reactions such as erythema, pruritus, swelling, and pain at the injection site. Local dermal lipo-dystrophic reactions can occur. An inappropriately excessive dose of insulin or incoordination with meals/missing meals hypoglycemia can occur, which can be life-threatening. Untreated hypoglycemia can cause seizures, coma as well as death, which makes it especially important in elderly patients who are more susceptible. Long-term use of insulin can lead to the production of antibodies against it with the possible development of insulin resistance. As mentioned earlier, insulin can cause the potassium to shift to the intracellular compartment and lead to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can manifest as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramping, gastrointestinal upset, confusion, weakness, and lethargy.
