The mylohyoid nerve is a branch from the inferior alveolar nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve originates from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. The branching of the inferior alveolar nerve into the mylohyoid nerve occurs before the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandibular foramen. Once the mylohyoid nerve branches, it will descend on the medial side of the mandibular ramus. The mylohyoid nerve will perforate through the sphenomandibular ligament to enter the mylohyoid groove and continues to descend towards the mylohyoid muscle. The mylohyoid nerve travels closely with the medial division of the submandibular glands, ultimately settling between the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior muscle belly of the digastric muscle. The anatomical position of the mylohyoid nerve is inferolateral to the mylohyoid muscle but superior to the anterior muscle belly of the digastric muscle.

The mylohyoid nerve's function is to provide motor innervation to the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior muscle belly of the digastric muscle.
