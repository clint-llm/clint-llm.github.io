The primary assessment of a patient with trauma and possible underlying spinal shock includes evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation. Care should be taken to ensure movement of the spine does not occur to minimize secondary injury. The patient should beÂ immobilized at the scene and during transport. A rigid cervical collar and supportive blocks on a backboard with straps are recommended.

Radiologic imaging is the next most important step in managing a patient with suspected SCI. Computed tomography (CT), especially spiral CT of the cervical spine, has a higher sensitivity for detecting spinal fractures when compared with a plain radiograph and should be employed first if available.
