The diagnosis of intussusception in adults is rare and challenging. The management, on the other hand, is rather straight forward. To achieve good outcomes, early recognition of the disease process is pivotal to reduce pre-operative or even operative complications. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, etiology, history, and physical findings, as well as the importance of an interprofessional team to enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of intussusception in adults.
- Review the evaluation of intussusception in adults. 
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for intussusception in adults.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for adults suffering from intussusception.
