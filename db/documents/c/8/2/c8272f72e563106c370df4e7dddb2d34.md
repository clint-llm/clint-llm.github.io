Evaluation relies heavily on imaging findings and correlation with a thorough history and physical exam:

- Neurological function can be evaluated by the Modified Oxford Handicap Scale (MOHS), and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

- Cognitive function can be assessed by the Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

- Severity of impaired consciousness can be evaluated by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).

- Evaluation of alcohol consumption can be assessed by the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST-C).

Laboratory exam can be useful through the following:

- Serum electrolytes, to discard electrolytes disorders that can cause coma, consciousness impairment, and seizures.

- Serum transaminases and bilirubin to assess liver damage.

- Serum glucose, to discard hypo/hyperglycemia.

- Complete blood count (suspect alcohol abuse disorder if there are signs of macrocytosis or macrocytic anemia), to determine infectious/inflammatory causes and to assess the hemoglobin and platelet levels.

- Toxicology screening, to discard abuse of other substances.

- Serum and spinal fluid infectious serology panel, to determine systemic or central nervous system infections.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging study of choice although CT may reveal hypodense lesions in the corpus callosum, especially the central portion

- In the acute stage, the impaired area has cytotoxic edematous changes with or without demyelination: hyperintense T2-weighted/Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighed imaging (DWI) signals in the middle layer of the corpus callosum (sandwich sign)

- As the acute stage passes, the edema resolves, and hyperintensities on MRI may normalize. If diagnosed and treated early, MRI may demonstrate a complete resolution of the lesions in the corpus callosum

- In one study, Estruch et al. compared MRI findings of 28 males with chronic alcohol use disorder with 14 subjects who were non-alcoholic and found statistically significant differences between the group with alcohol use disorder and the control group in the mean of all planimetric brain indices calculated. They found the group with alcohol use disorder had a significant reduction in anterior thickness, middle thickness, posterior thickness, corpus callosum area, corpus callosum percentage, frontal lobe index, and cortical sulci size compared to the control group. Estruch et al. found the mean corpus callosum body area of two-thirds of the subjects in the group with alcohol use disorder were less than two standard deviations of the mean of the subjects in the control group. There was an 18% decrease in genu size, a 16% decrease in truncus size, and a 15% decrease in splenium in the group with alcohol use disorder compared to the control group
