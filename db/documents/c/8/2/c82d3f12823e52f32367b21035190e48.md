In January 2016, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) published its new clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of BE. They now recommend screening for BE in men with at least five years of chronic GERD symptoms who also have at least two (2) additional risk factors including greater than 50 years of age, history of smoking, white ethnicity, central obesity, or a confirmed family history of BE.  Due to the extremely low prevalence of EAC in women, this population has no indications for screening except for the presence of multiple risk factors.

Diagnosis of BE, as defined by the American College of Gastroenterology, requires gross endoscopic identification of columnar metaplasia, generally described as “salmon-pink” tongues of mucosal tissue, as well as pathological confirmation of intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells on biopsy evaluation. However, the British Society of Gastroenterology, as well as the GERD Society Study Committee in Japan, do not require the presence of goblet cells to diagnose BE and base the diagnosis solely on the presence of columnar metaplasia.  Due to the controversy over the significance of goblet cells, another alternative classification has been proposed, which allows the pathologist to state that there is columnar metaplasia and then further specify whether goblet cells are present or are not present. To maximize the possibility of finding BE, dysplasia, and/or carcinoma, a minimum of 8 biopsies is recommended by the ACG. The Prague C & M criteria are recommended for endoscopic grading of BE, with the most proximal extent of circumferential columnar mucosa from the GEJ being the C value, and the maximal extent of non-circumferential columnar mucosa above the GEJ being the M value.

In cases of BE, the pathologist must determine whether dysplasia or carcinoma is present. As studies suggest that the extent of dysplasia also correlates to the risk of cancer, it may be valuable for pathologists to not only comment on the presence but also the extent of dysplasia (such as focal or diffuse). Sometimes there may be a specific concern for dysplasia if an area of nodularity or ulceration is noted on endoscopy. However, BE-related dysplasia is often flat and not apparent on endoscopy. The major histologic pattern of dysplasia is intestinal, therefore resembling an adenoma of the colon. However, non-intestinal dysplasia also exists, including foveolar and serrated patterns. Validated criteria for classification as either low or high-grade only exists for intestinal-type dysplasia, however. Low-grade dysplasia may have up to mild architectural abnormalities with cytologic atypia consisting of nuclear elongation, dense and hyperchromatic nuclei, an increased nuclear:cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio, stratification limited to the basal half of the epithelium, increased mitoses and up to the mild loss of polarity.  Features distinguishing high-grade dysplasia from low-grade include crypt crowding, full-thickness stratification, a prominent loss of polarity, and mild to marked nuclear pleomorphism.  If there is extensive regenerative change so much that the atypia present slightly overlaps with low-grade dysplasia, the pathologist may give a diagnosis of “Indefinite for Dysplasia.” Distinction between high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal carcinoma suffers from a high degree of interobserver variability, however, recommended criteria for a diagnosis of intramucosal carcinoma include the lamina propria being invaded by individual neoplastic cells with no connection to the crypts, sheeting out of malignant cells, irregular and angulated glands located in the lamina propria or muscularis mucosae, a complex anastomosing pattern of glands within the lamina propria, and/or back-to-back glands or cells in an irregular architectural pattern.
