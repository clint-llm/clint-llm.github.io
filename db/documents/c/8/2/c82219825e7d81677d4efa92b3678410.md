The exact etiology of SIDS is not clear. Studies suggest that SIDS is associated with suboptimal physiologic responses to hypoxemia and hypercarbia and a combination of several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The most important preventable SIDS risk factor is a supine sleeping position. Acknowledging prone sleeping as a means of preventing SIDS has resulted in advocacy that significantly decreased SIDS deaths. The incidence of SIDS has dramatically reduced in countries that advocate for supine sleeping.

The incidence of SIDS declined by more than 50 percent in the United States after physicians began to promote “On the back to sleep.” After the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a recommendation for supine sleeping in 1992, the incidence of SIDS decreased. From 1992 to 2001, the incidence of SIDS deaths declined from 1.2 to 0.56 deaths per 1000 live births. During the reported period, the percentage of infants sleeping in the supine position increased from 13% to 72%.
