At the time of diagnosis, most FL-HCC masses are approximately slightly greater than 10cm. At the time of the histopathological examination, four-tenths of the patients have a positive margin and vascular invasion after resection. Metastasis to locoregional lymph nodes has been demonstrated in about half the patients. On examination, these tumors are usually large, single, yellow, with well-defined margins and demonstrate features of rapid growth, outgrowing the blood supply and have a central scar.
