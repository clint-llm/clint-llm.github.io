DPP-4 inhibitors, known as gliptins, are a class of oral diabetic medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults.

DPP-4 inhibitors that have FDA approval include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin. Vildagliptin has approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), but not by the FDA.

These drugs act through incretin hormones, which are gut hormones responsible for glucose homeostasis after oral food intake.

Apart from antihyperglycemic effects, this class of drugs possesses antihypertensive effects, anti-inflammatory effects, antiapoptotic effects, and immunomodulatory effects on the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels independent of the incretin pathway.

They can be used as monotherapy or add-on therapy with other medications.
