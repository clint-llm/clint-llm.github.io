A thorough history documenting a patient's visual complaints and underlying etiology of elevated ICP is necessary. Patients may experience visual field loss and transient dim-outs.  Elevated ICP may result in horizontal binocular diplopia from an abducens nerve palsy, and audible vascular bruits known as pulsatile tinnitus.  A headache is common and may worsen with positions that place the dependent flow of volume to the intracranial space.  Nausea and vomiting may also be present with acute rises in ICP.  Medications such as steroids, retinoids, tetracyclines, oral contraceptives should be asked about as causes of ICP elevation.   Weight gain and obesity should also undergo assessment as risk factors for idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

A standard ophthalmic and neurologic exam should be performed with attention to detail of the optic disc.  The lack of spontaneous venous pulsations at the disc is a sign of elevated ICP when it has exceeded the intraocular pressure.  An exam may reveal an elevated optic disc, dilated veins, hemorrhages overlying the disc, hyperemia of the disc, and peripapillary retinal folds known as Paton lines.  The disc margins become blurred, and a reproducible inter-observer grading scheme suggested by ophthalmologist Lars Friesen is widely utilized

- Grade 1: Disruption of the normal radial arrangement of nerve fiber bundles with a blurring of the nasal border of the optic disc and normal temporal margin

- Grade 2: Nasal and temporal (circumferential) blurring of the optic disc with more pronounced changes from grade 1

- Grade 3: The elevated and blurred disc margin borders obscure one or more major retinal vessel segments

- Grade 4: More pronounced changes than from grade 3 and with total obscuration of a segment of the central retinal artery or vein

- Grade 5: More pronounced changes than from grade 4 and with total obscuration of all disc vessels
