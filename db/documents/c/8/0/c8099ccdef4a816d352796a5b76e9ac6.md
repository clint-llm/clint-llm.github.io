Patients with SCVT will present with complaints of upper extremity or neck discomfort or pain. They may describe it as a "feeling of vague fullness" and possible swelling in the affected upper extremity. Patients with primary effort-induced SCVT can present as typically healthy, teenage to 40 years old, males more often than females. History may reveal recent strenuous or repetitive extremity movements, whereas idiopathic SCVT has no strenuous activity history. A patient's complaints and findings in secondary SCVT are similar, but a catheter or device lead or history of trauma will be present. The loss of function of the catheter is also frequently noted.

Physical findings will reveal supraclavicular fullness, a palpable mass, changes in extremity color, and Urschel's sign (dilation of the collateral veins in the anterior chest wall). The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of venous obstruction. Early in the disease process, patients will complain of mild discomfort. As the process evolves, more prominent signs and symptoms will appear.
