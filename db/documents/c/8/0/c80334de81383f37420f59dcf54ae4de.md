The 5-year relative survival rate for RCC is 75%. Two-thirds of cases are diagnosed at a local stage, for which the 5-year relative survival rate is 93%.

These prognostic factors can be grouped into three main categories that are tumor-related factors, patient-related factors, and laboratory biochemical tests. The use of these factors to create integrative algorithms improves the prognostic power over a simple anatomic tumor stage alone and improve management decisions.

Prognostic features for RCC

- Tumor related: Stage, tumor size, tumor grade, histologic type, histologic tumor necrosis, sarcomatoid transformation

- Patient-related: Asymptomatic vs. local symptoms vs. systemic symptoms, performance status, substantial weight loss, presence of well-defined paraneoplastic syndrome, metastasis-free interval, history of prior nephrectomy

- Laboratory biochemical tests: Elevated LDH levels, hypercalcemia, anemia, thrombocytosis,Â elevated ESR, or CRP.
