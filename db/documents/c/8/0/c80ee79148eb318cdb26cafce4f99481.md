Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening illness almost exclusively affecting neonates with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. The pathophysiology of NEC is inflammation of the intestine leading to bacterial invasion causing cellular damage and cellular death and necrosis of the colon and intestine. As NEC progresses, it can lead to intestinal perforation causing peritonitis, sepsis, and death. Signs and symptoms of NEC are non-specific and may include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, abdominal tenderness. This activity examines the presentation, evaluation, and management of necrotizing enterocolitis and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the factors associated with increased risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis.
- Describe the presenting features of necrotizing enterocolitis.
- Explain how the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis is made.
- Review an interprofessional didactic regarding the presenting features, evaluation and management of necrotizing enterocolitis to ensure a high degree of clinician awareness, allowing for improved detection and utilization of up-to-date management strategies to optimize patient outcomes.
