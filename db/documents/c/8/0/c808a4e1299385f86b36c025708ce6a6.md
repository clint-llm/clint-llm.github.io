The rib attachments and origin of the serratus anterior may vary between each person. For instance, the serratus anterior can be found attached to the tenth rib, or attachments may be absent to the first rib. The serratus anterior fibers may sometimes be found in union with fibers of the levator scapulae, external intercostals, or external oblique muscles. Furthermore, there have been reported vascular variants, specifically in the blood supply to the serratus anterior myo-osseous flap, such that the lateral thoracic artery is the dominant supplier to the lower muscular slips.
