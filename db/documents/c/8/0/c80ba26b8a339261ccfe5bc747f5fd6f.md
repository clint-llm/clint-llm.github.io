Familial occurrence of thyroid cancer is approximately 5% for PTC and FTC and 15 to 30% for MTC.

Some of the common mutations are as follows:

PTC - Point mutation in the BRAF gene leading to BRAF V600E mutant kinase is the most common mutation leading to PTC (29 to 69%) and PTC-associated anaplastic thyroid cancer (0 to 12%).

FTC - Mutations in RAS proto-oncogene are most common in FTC (40 to 50%). Translocation in PAX8–peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has been identified in around 30 to 35% of FTC.

Anaplastic - Inactivating mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been identified in addition to early inactivating mutations in about 50 to 80% of the cases with anaplastic thyroid cancer.

MTC - Germline mutations of RET proto-oncogene in inherited forms of MTC (approximately 25% of MTC) and RAS mutations in 25% of MTC.

Several other uncommon gene mutations have been associated with the development of thyroid cancer, such as TERT mutations, especially highly aggressive PTC.

Risk factors: Female sex, a family history of thyroid cancer, and radiation exposure of the thyroid gland during childhood are the major risk factors associated with DTC.
