Peripheral neuropathy is a prevalent problem, affecting an estimated 15 to 20 million people in the United States above the age of 40.

In many affected individuals, such neuropathies involve the small nerve fibers, including the peripheral thinly myelinated Aδ fibers as well as unmyelinated C nerve fibers.
