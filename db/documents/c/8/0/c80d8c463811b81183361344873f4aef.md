Another application of the conoid of Sturm is the Jackson cross cylinder used in refraction.

For example:

- +1 DS/-2DC

- +1 vertical meridian/-1 horizontal meridian

Therefore, the spherical equivalent of the Jackson cross cylinder will be zero. This implies that, when kept in front of an astigmatic eye, it does not move the circle of least diffusion. It is used to collapse or elongate the conoid of Sturm, which can refine the power and axis of the cylindrical lens that is prescribed to a patient.
