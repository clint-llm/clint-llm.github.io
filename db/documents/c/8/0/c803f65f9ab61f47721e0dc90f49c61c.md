Cystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive mutation in the CFTR gene, which codes the proteins that compose the chloride channel pore.

Kwashiorkor is another severe protein deficiency; however, it is due to a lack of protein intake rather than a genetic disorder. The digestive enzymes are present in kwashiorkor; however, because there is little protein ingested, symptoms of protein deficiency are present. In malnourished individuals with kwashiorkor, the vital reactions in the body are sustained through intracellular protein catabolism. The need for available essential amino acids leads to an extensive reduction in peripheral muscle mass from muscle breakdown.

A defect in facilitated and active transport mechanisms can lead to pathological malabsorptive states. Cystinuria and Hartnup disease are both genetic disorders involving the membrane amino acid transporters but differ in the groups of amino acids transported and so present different clinically.
