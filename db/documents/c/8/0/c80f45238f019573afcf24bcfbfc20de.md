**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of opsoclonus.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of patients with opsoclonus.
- Outline the management options available for patients with opsoclonus.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with opsoclonus and improve outcomes.
