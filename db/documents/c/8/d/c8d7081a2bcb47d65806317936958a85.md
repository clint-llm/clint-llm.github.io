The beginning steps in yarn preparation produce the most dust. Therefore, the closer to the beginning of the process the person is, the higher the level of dust exposure and the greater risk of experiencing a pulmonary reaction or response.

In the initial stages, symptoms manifest as frequent coughing, chest tightness, dyspnea, and at times, wheezing, particularly within a few hours of exposure (or reexposure) to the workplace. Hence, patients usually report symptoms towards the beginning of their work week and thus the term Monday fever. This is in contrast to patients with occupational asthma who experience symptoms towards the end of their work week. Once exposure and lung irritation becomes persistent, patients will no longer have cyclical symptoms and progress to the chronic byssinosis state.

In conjunction with the above symptoms, cough with sputum production may also manifest, which can lead to a misdiagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchitis.
