An important concept to understand in AC mode is that because the system is volume-cycled and a set volume will always be delivered, the pressure that will be generated in the system will be determined by lung compliance. A very compliant lung will generate low plateau pressures, while a stiff lung does not distend well with the set volume and will generate a much higher pressure (i.e., patients with pulmonary edema, ARDS, pneumonia, or pulmonary fibrosis). It is important to understand thisÂ to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury or barotrauma.
