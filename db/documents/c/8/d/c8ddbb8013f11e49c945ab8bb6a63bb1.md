Brexanolone has a rapid onset of action within 60 hours of infusion and has a sustained response for up to 30 days after infusion. Patients in clinical trials were not followed after a 30 day follow-up period, limiting data on toxicityÂ from long-term use. Long term efficacy of brexanolone, when compared with other antidepressants, is unknown and needs further research.

Limited clinical trial data is available concerning overdose. The manufacturer's labeling describes two cases of accidental overdose. These were due to infusion pump malfunction resulting in the sudden loss of consciousness. Patients recovered after 15 minutes of discontinuation without the need for supportive measures. The infusion was resumed, and patients completed treatment. It is recommended to stop the infusion immediately in case of overdose and initiate supportive measures as needed.

Clinical studies on exogenous allopregnanolone administration have reported sedation, intoxication, flushing, and headaches; however, there are no reports of severe adverse events.
