**Genetic Factors**

Although there are reports of sporadic cases, acrokeratoelastoidosis is considered to be a genodermatoses with autosomal dominant being the primary mode of inheritance (although anecdotal reports exist of an autosomal recessive mode). As per the classification of palmoplantar keratodermas (PPK), inherited acrokeratoelastoidosis is considered to be a type of inherited punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKP), specifically Type 3 PPKP.AAGAB gene, implicated in type I PPK, is not involved in AKE.AAGAB gene associated reduced expression of the cytosolic p34 protein has been implicated, which results in increased epidermal cell proliferation.

**Acquired Factors**

The exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Although a history of chronic trauma and excessive sun-exposure has been reported in few cases

It is important to note that although the clinical presentation is predominated by lesions generally localized to the acral parts; some workers have reported that elastorrhexis (fragmentation of dermal elastic fibers). The histopathological hallmark of the condition seen in acral papules also involves apparently normal-appearing skin in some patients suggesting that AKE may represent a disorder with a generalized defect of elastic tissue.

The anecdotal report of AKE-like lesions in patients with scleroderma has its basis in the abnormal connective tissue metabolism of scleroderma.
