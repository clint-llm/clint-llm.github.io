The occipital emissary vein may not be present in all individuals, and it may only pass through a singular condylar canal, or through multiple, smaller clustered canals.

The jugular tubercle on the upper surface of the lateral condylar part of occipital bone may sometimes have an oblique groove for cranial nerves IX, X, and XI.

The occipital artery may sometimes branch to give the mastoid artery; most of the time, this artery arises from the auricular branch of the occipital artery.

Cerebral dural sinus venous blood flow in the torcular Herophili, also known as the confluence of the sinuses, on occipital bone’s inner surface is variable.
