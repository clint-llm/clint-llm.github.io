Tricuspid valve repair is almost always performed due to tricuspid regurgitation and in conjunction with left-sided valve surgery or coronary artery bypass graft. Sole tricuspid valve repairs are rare, due to an increased incidence of complications. The main indication of the repair is secondary tricuspid regurgitation due to annular enlargement, right ventricular remodeling, and advanced left heart diseases. Structural abnormalities of the valve itself usually require replacement. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment options of tricuspid valve repair and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo tricuspid valve repair.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of tricuspid regurgitation.
- Identify the indications of tricuspid valve repair.
- Outline the common complications of tricuspid valve repair.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for tricuspid valve repair surgery and to enhance postoperative management.
