The prognosis of frontal lobe syndrome depends on the underlying cause. For reversible and treatable causes such as infections or resectable tumors, the prognosis is more favorable than progressive neurogenerative disorders such as frontotemporal dementia. In the latter cases, treatment is based on symptom control and patients will eventually succumb to the disease.
