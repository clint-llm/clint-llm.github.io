**External ear:**

The external ear's primary function is resonance and sound amplification.

**Middle ear:**

The middle ear is a fluid-filled cavity in the skull that has three ossicles. The sequential order of ossicles transmits sound and vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear.

**Inner ear:**

The inner ear includes the cochlea, the vestibule, and the three semicircular canals. The cochlea is responsible for hearing, while the vestibule and semicircular canals play a part in balance.
