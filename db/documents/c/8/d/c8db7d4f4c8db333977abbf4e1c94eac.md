History and physical examination have a crucial role in the evaluation of submandibular swelling. History should address many factors:

- Duration of symptoms (acute vs. chronic)

- The number of glands involved

- Discomfort associated with swelling

- Foul taste in the mouth

- Frequency of symptoms

- Aggravating factors (association with meals or salivary stimulants)

- Constitutional symptoms (fever, viral prodrome, weight loss)

- Systemic symptoms (e.g., joint pain, dry eyes, and mouth )

- Medical comorbidities (e.g., alcohol use, diabetes, bulimia, liver disease, autoimmune disease)

- History of radiation treatment

A physical exam includes a visual inspection of glands to observe the number of glands involved, erythema of overlying glands, palpation of the gland to note gland size, texture, tendernessâ€”massage of the gland to express salivary discharge from duct orifice and note the type of discharge. A focussed cranial nerve exam is necessary to evaluate facial nerve and trigeminal nerve, especially the mandibular branch. An examination of cervical lymph nodes is also required.

Fever may be present.

On examination, the gland is swollen, indurated, and tender. Cervical lymphadenitis may be present in cases of infections. Chronic or recurrent sialadenitis causes repeated episodes of pain and swelling, often with meals and recurrent infections. Massage of the gland may reveal purulent saliva at the ductal orifice. Acute unifocal salivary gland swelling due to obstructive sialadenitis is usually the result of salivary gland stones and/or strictures and is characterized by intermittent gland swelling occurring with the stimulation of meals. Mechanical obstruction of salivary flow within the duct causes swelling of the gland.

Viral sialadenitis (e.g., mumps) presents with acute multifocal salivary gland swelling accompanied by constitutional symptoms, including fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia. Submandibular sialdenosis presents with painless bilateral submandibular enlargement and may be associated with mild discomfort.Approximately 50 % of cases are associated with recognized risk factors, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, alcoholism, bulimia, malnutrition, and liver disease.
