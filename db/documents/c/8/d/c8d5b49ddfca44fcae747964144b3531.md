According to some authors, the Zero nerve or N nerve exists, which would have many connections with the olfactory nerve, although it is still not recognized in the anatomy books. The zero nerve arises above the olfactory nerve.

In the initial stages of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the patient may undergo an alteration of the volume of the olfactory bulb (it decreases), with alteration of the sense of smell.

The olfactory nerves are an essential way for the passage of cerebrospinal fluid, through the cribriform plate up to the mucous membranes of the nose, to reach the lymphatic system of the jaw and neck. The integrity of the nerve and its anatomical structures are fundamental for an adequate outflow of the CSF.
