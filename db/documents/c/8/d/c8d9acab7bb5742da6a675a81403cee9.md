Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis is best managed by an interprofessional team, including otolaryngology or dermatology nurses. CNH is a relatively common disorder, but it is often not diagnosed. It is believed to result from pressure on the auricle that ultimately causes inflammation secondary to vascular insufficiency. The basic feature is a painful ear, usually at the helix. Over the years, many treatments have been proposed for this condition, including prosthetic appliances and surgical excision. To improve outcomes, clinicians should first attempt pressure-reducing remedies. Surgery to remove the lesion should be the last resort. Because of a lack of large studies, there is no general consensus on which treatments are most effective. For this reason, patients should be counseled initially to avoid pressure on the ear, which appears to provide symptom relief in many cases.
