The management of patients with OSA is best accomplished with an interprofessional team that includes a sleep specialist, primary provider, cardiologist, otolaryngologist, dietitian, pulmonologist, and neurologist. There are many options to treat OSA, the primary one being CPAP. Unfortunately, compliance with CPAP remains low. Some patients may benefit from an oral or nasal device, but compliance remains an issue. Surgery is the last step and should only be considered after a thorough patient evaluation. Surgery does not cure the disorder, is expensive, and can be associated with severe complications. The prognosis for most patients with OSA is guarded. Until the patient starts to lose weight, most therapies have poor efficacy.
