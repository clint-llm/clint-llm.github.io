The prognosis depends on the type of amyloidosis and the patient's response to treatment. Systemic amyloidosis if left untreated can be fatal. If the underlying chronic inflammatory condition is not picked up as a cause of amyloidosis or is misdiagnosed, amyloid aggregation usually accelerates. The survival rate depends on the organs affected. If the heart is involved, cardiovascular complications significantly increase morbidity and mortality.
