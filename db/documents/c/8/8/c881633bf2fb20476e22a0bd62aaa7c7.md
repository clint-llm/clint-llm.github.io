The suboccipital release is a frequently performed OMM technique due to its simple setup and versatility. This technique requires minimal equipment and patient positioning, thus making it easy for providers to perform. Typically, this technique treats migraines, headaches, and neck pain. It can also be used as an adjunct for treating conditions with autonomic dysfunction. This activity outlines and explains the indications and procedures for performing suboccipital release and examines the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients who undergo suboccipital release.

**Objectives:**
- Outline and explain how to perform suboccipital release on a patient.
- Summarize the relevant anatomy involved in a suboccipital release.
- Review the pathophysiology behind the suboccipital release.
- Identify indications and contraindications for using suboccipital release in inpatient and outpatient settings.
