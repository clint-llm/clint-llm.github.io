Patients with Buerger disease must be advised again and again to quit all exposure to tobacco products and reassured that if they can quit tobacco use, the disease will go into remission and amputation could be avoided.

Providers should educate patients that the level of tobacco avoidance that is required to achieve resolution of the disease often requires that they vehemently curtail the exposure to secondhand smoke as well. It can be very difficult for patients who share their space with another smoker therefore it is reasonable to refer such patients and their associates to multidisciplinary smoking quitting programs.
