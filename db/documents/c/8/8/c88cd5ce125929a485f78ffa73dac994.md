Sodium and potassium gradients function in various organ systems' physiologic processes.

Sperm cells also use the Na, K-ATPase, but they use a different isoform necessary for preserving fertility in males. Sperm needs the Na, K ATPase to regulate membrane potential and ions, which is necessary for sperm motility and the sperm’s acrosome functioning during penetration into the egg.

The brain also requires NA, K ATPase activity. Neurons need the Na, K ATPase pump to reverse postsynaptic sodium flux to re-establish the potassium and sodium gradients which are necessary to fire action potentials. Astrocytes also need Na, K ATPase pump to maintain the sodium gradient as the sodium gradient maintains neurotransmitter reuptake. Na, K ATPases in the gray matter consumes a significant amount of energy, up to three-quarters of energy is absorbed by Na, K ATPases in the gray matter while merely a quarter of the total energy gets utilized for protein synthesis and molecular synthesis.
