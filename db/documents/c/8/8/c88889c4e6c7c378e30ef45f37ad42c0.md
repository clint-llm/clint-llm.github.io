Anaphylaxis is typically an IgE-mediated (type 1) hypersensitivity reaction that involves the release of numerous chemical mediators from the degranulation of basophils and mast cells after re-exposure to a specific antigen. IgE crosslinking and resultant aggregation of high-affinity receptors induce the rapid release of stored chemical mediators. These chemical mediators include histamine, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, and proteoglycans. Via activation of phospholipase A, cyclooxygenases, and lipoxygenases, they then form arachidonic acid metabolites, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and platelet-activating factors.

- Histamine increases vascular permeability and vasodilation, leading to hypoperfusion of tissues. The body responds to these changes by increasing heart rate and cardiac contraction.

- Prostaglandin D functions as a bronchoconstrictor with simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary vascular constriction. It also potentiates peripheral vasodilation, thus contributing to the hypo-perfusion of vital organs.

- Leukotrienes add to bronchoconstriction, vascular permeability, and induce airway remodeling.

- The platelet activation factor also acts as a bronchoconstrictor and increases vascular permeability.

- TNF-alpha activates neutrophils (as part of stress response leukocytosis) and increases chemokine synthesis.
