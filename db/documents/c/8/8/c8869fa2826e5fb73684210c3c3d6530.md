Muscles in the anterior cervical region divide relative to the hyoid bone, such that the suprahyoid muscles lie above, and infrahyoid muscles lie below. The suprahyoid muscles include the stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, and geniohyoid muscles. The infrahyoid muscles include the omohyoid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid, sternothyroid muscles.

**The Suprahyoid Muscles**

The suprahyoid muscles are aforementioned. Their general function is to elevate the hyoid bone. The stylohyoid divides the carotid from the submandibular triangle. It originates from the styloid process at the skull base and inserts on the hyoid body and digastric tendon. The facial nerve innervates this muscle and retracts the bone during swallowing. The digastric muscle primarily functions to depress the mandible and elevate the hyoid bone. This muscle is composed of an anterior and posterior belly joined by a tendon that attaches to the body of the hyoid bone. The anterior belly, innervated by the mandibular division of trigeminal nerve (CN V), arises from the internal surface of the mandible. The posterior belly, innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII), arises from the medial surface of the mastoid process.

The mylohyoid forms the floor of the oral cavity, as well as the deep surfaces of the submandibular and submental triangles. It originates from the internal surface of the mandibular body and inserts on the hyoid bone body and contralateral mylohyoid muscle in the midline. It receives innervation from the branches of the inferior alveolar branches of the trigeminal branch, mandibular division. This muscle elevates the floor of the oral cavity. The blood supply of this artery is the mylohyoid branch of the inferior alveolar artery.

The geniohyoid is a narrow muscle superior to the medial border of the mylohyoid muscle, so named for its passage from the chin to the hyoid bone. It functions to carry the hyoid bone upward, as well as the tongue. It originates in the inferior mental spine of the mandible and inserts on the hyoid bone.

**The Infrahyoid Muscles**

The strap, or infrahyoid, muscles are four grouped pairs of anterior cervical muscles, as previously listed. Their primary function is to depress the hyoid bone and larynx during speech and swallowing maneuvers. All except the thyrohyoid receive innervation from the cervical plexus (C1-C3), particularly the ansa cervicalis.

The sternohyoid muscles and sternothyroid muscles are both innervated by the ansa cervicalis. The former originates on the posterior surface of the manubrium sterni and inserts onto the medial lower border of the hyoid bone. The sternothyroid originates similarly and inserts on the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage.

The omohyoid superior belly originates in the intermediate tendon and inserts onto the hyoid bone, whereas the inferior belly originates on the superior scapular border and inserts onto the intermediate tendon. Of the four, only the thyrohyoid is innervated by cervical spinal nerve one via the hypoglossal nerve.
