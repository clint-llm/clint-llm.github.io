Two mechanisms of injury have been proposed and supported by animal and in vitro studies. The first postulates direct damage to small vessel endothelium, being a tissue that exhibits rapid turnover, through interaction with the radiation-induced reactive oxidative species. The resulting debris interrupts the vascular flow, a process known as endarteritis obliterans. The other model describes a delayed process initiated at the time of radiation with the release of bioactive, fibrogenic cytokines inhibiting parenchymal and stem cells and causing the extensive fibrosis seen in several damaged irradiated tissue. This is known as the fibro-atrophic effect.
