While reverse transcriptase inhibitors are generally safe to use, contraindications do exist to prevent severe adverse effects associated with their use. First and foremost, a prior history of hypersensitivity to RTIs is a contraindicationÂ for their use. If a patient has had an adverse reaction to one RTI, they should discontinue the drug and a different agent prescribed.

Abacavir is explicitly associated with a life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction in 5% of patients. Specifically, patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele have the highest chance of experiencing a severe reaction to the drug. Patients with HLA-DR7 and HLA-DQ3 should also avoid the use of abacavir.

Patients with elevated or abnormal baseline ALT or AST should avoid the use of nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy due to severe hepatotoxicity and rash-associated hepatotoxicity.

Didanosine has also demonstrated a clinically significant drug interaction when taken concomitantly with allopurinol.
