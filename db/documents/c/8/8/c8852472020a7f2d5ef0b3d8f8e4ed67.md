The nasal cavity functions to humidify, warm, filter, and act as a conduit for inspired air, as well as protect the respiratory tract through the use of the mucociliary system. The nasal cavity also houses the receptors responsible for olfaction. If any of the functions of the nasal cavity are compromised, the result is likely to manifest in signs and symptoms of clinically significant disease processes. Understanding the anatomy, physiology, and function of a properly functioning nasal cavity is essential in diagnosing and treating the underlying pathology.
