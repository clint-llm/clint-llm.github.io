Researchers have developed several classification and grading systems (WHO2010, ENETs, AJCC) for pNET. Most of them provide essential prognostic values.

Newer classification systems include WHO2017 and AJCC 8 edition. AJCC (8th edition, 2017) includes ENETs definitions for T stage and prognostic stage grouping. Further modification of this staging system is available, which might provide better prognostic information.

**TNM Staging**

- TX - Tumor cannot be assessed

- T1 - Tumor limited to the pancreas, less than 2 cm

- T2 - Tumor limited to the pancreas, 2 to 4 cm

- T3 - Tumor limited to the pancreas, greater than 4 cm; or tumor invading the duodenum or common bile duct

- T4 - Tumor invasion of adjacent organs (e.g., stomach, spleen, colon, adrenal gland) or the walls of large vessels (celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery)

- NX - Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

- N0 - No regional lymph node involvement

- N1 - Regional lymph node involvement

- M0 - No distant metastasis

- M1 - Distant metastasis

- M1a - Metastasis confined to the liver

- M1b - Metastasis in at least one extrahepatic site (e.g., lung, ovary, nonregional lymph node, peritoneum, bone)

- M1c - Both hepatic and extrahepatic metastases
