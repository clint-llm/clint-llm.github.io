Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder usually involving the lungs, and cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is the presentation of sarcoidosis involving the heart. It is thought to be a rare form of sarcoidosis reported in less than 10% of patients with sarcoidosis. The granulomatous inflammation affects the heart to cause infiltrative cardiomyopathy either in isolation or as part of systemic sarcoidosis.

The most common clinical manifestations are conduction system disorders and heart failure.

The most common manifestations of cardiac sarcoidosis are in the form of atrioventricular (AV) block and ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT).
