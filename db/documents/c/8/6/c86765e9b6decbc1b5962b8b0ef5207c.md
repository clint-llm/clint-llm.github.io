The relationship between HIV infection and observed neurocognitive deficits is not clearly understood but thought to be due to several factors. Proteins expressed from viral genes in infected cells can directly damage neurons. Cytokines produced by activation of the immune response in surrounding healthy glial cells may also contribute to neuronal damage. Additionally, autoimmune antibodies against brain tissue have been isolated in HIV-infected patients suffering from HAD which appear to be present less frequently in those who do not develop dementia. Autoantibodies continue to be present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients following treatment and may explain the progression of symptoms in patients with low viral counts.
