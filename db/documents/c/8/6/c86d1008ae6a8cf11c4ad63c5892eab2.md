The Na+-K+ ATPase plays a prominent role in thyroid pathophysiology. In hyperparathyroidism, there is an increase in heat intolerance, increased sweating, and increased weight loss due to the increased synthesis of Na+-K+ ATPase induced by the excessive thyroid hormone. This increased synthesis of Na+-K+ ATPase then increases basal metabolic rate, which then increases oxygen consumption, respiratory rate, body temperature, andÂ calorigenesis.
