# Continuing Education Activity

Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is a group of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases that involves the interstitium and tubules. Inflammation of the kidney consists of the collection of inflammatory cells, fluid, and extracellular matrix surrounding the interstitium, along with the infiltration of tubular cells by inflammatory cells that define both tubules and interstitium pathology. It is one of the most important and significant causes of acute kidney injury that subsequently leads to renal failure. There are multiple causative factors of tubulointerstitial nephritides, including drug-induced, idiopathic, genetic, immune-mediated, and infectious (viral, bacterial, parasitic, or fungal). In addition, there is an association of systemic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren disease, immunoglobulin G4 associated autoimmune disease (interstitial infiltration of IG4 positive plasma cell and C3 deposition), tubulointerstitial nephritis, and uveitis syndrome. This activity highlights the role of interprofessional team members in managing patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis for best patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tubulointerstitial nephritis.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of tubulointerstitial nephritis.
- Summarize the management options available for tubulointerstitial nephritis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tubulointerstitial nephritis and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is a group of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases that involves the interstitium and tubules. Inflammation of the kidney consists of the collection of inflammatory cells, fluid, and extracellular matrix surrounding the interstitium, along with the infiltration of tubular cells by inflammatory cells that define both tubules and interstitium pathology. It is one of the most significant causes of acute kidney injury that leads to renal failure. TIN can be classified into acute and chronic based on underlying etiology, duration, or histology.

Renal impairment with acute TIN is reversible, provided early and appropriate interventions are made, but chronic TIN may be irreversible in severe cases. Drug-induced nephritis is widely described and is the leading cause of TIN. Delay in diagnosis due to nonspecific signs and symptoms is frequently seen; thus, many attempts have been made for effective diagnosis and exclude the other differentials carefully through efficient clinical experts' opinions and assessment and diagnostic tests.

# Etiology

There are multiple causative factors of tubulointerstitial nephritis, such as drug-induced, idiopathic, genetic, immune-mediated, and infectious (viral, bacterial, parasitic, or fungal). Associated are systemic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren disease, immunoglobulin G4 associated autoimmune disease (interstitial infiltration of IG4 positive plasma cell and C3 deposition), tubulointerstitial nephritis, and uveitis syndrome.

TIN is the third leading cause of renal transplant dysfunction, whereas transplant rejection in already immunocompromised patients is mainly due to infections, including polyomavirus or cytomegalovirus. Bone marrow transplant recipients are mainly associated with necrotizing TIN due to adenovirus. TIN and uveitis syndrome are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus and bacteria like leptospira, mycoplasma, and yersinia.

# Epidemiology

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The global prevalence of acute TIN is 1 to 3% among all renal biopsies. The overall prevalence of acute TIN increased to 15-27% when the analysis was restricted to only AKI cases.

In this study, most patients accounted for adults and the elderly, and only 5% were children, male (53%) compared to females (47%). Data analysis from Czech registries of renal biopsies insisted the rate of TIN was 4%, but when analyzed only among the patients with renal insufficiency, it was around 12%.

# Pathophysiology

High metabolic demand and relatively less blood supply make the tubulointerstitium susceptible to injury. The kidney has a higher exposure to drugs and toxins, increasing renal injury chances.

Production and activation of cytokines, such as tissue necrosis factors alpha (TNF-alpha) by inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, macrophages) and renal cells (interstitial fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, proximal tubular cells), escalate the inflammatory process. Macrophages are initially responsible for repair but later contribute to inflammation by producing fibrogenic cytokines, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). TGF-beta is responsible for fibrosis in chronic TIN. Tubular atrophy leads to burnout and a decrease in the number of nephrons, which overwhelms the functioning capacity of remaining nephrons by hyperfiltration leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD). TGF-beta favors the accumulation of collagen in the extracellular matrix and basement membrane and inhibits the collagenase and metalloproteinase enzymes. In the setting of tubular necrosis, a complex series of necrosis-induced inflammation, i.e., neuroinflammation, has a role in the pathogenesis of TIN. Injured renal tubular cells lose their polarity and integrity and undergo apoptosis and necrosis. Necrosed cells express various danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and alarmins, which activates the immune response to induce inflammation. This process of intensifying inflammation through necrosed tubular cells is known as necroinflammation.

Drug-induced TIN is a result of allergic reactions and is immune-mediated. Only small proportions of the population taking the same medications have TIN, mainly due to variable responses of individuals to the same drug.

Another mechanism of TIN is due to cell injury and insults by bacterial, viral, and fungal infections often associated with preexisting obstruction or reflux. Without obstruction, damage and loss of functions of tubular cells by bacteria are unlikely as the kidney is resistant to structural damage by a bacterial infection. Pathogenesis of other systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, SLE, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Sjögren syndrome, etc., is complex, and it is supposed that multiple factors such as susceptibility to autoimmunity, systemic inflammation, genetic predisposition, nutritional insufficiency, and predisposed infectious agents are involved.

# Histopathology

Histopathologic light microscopy in the cases of tubulointerstitial nephritis reveals interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and edema, regardless of etiology. Inflammatory cells are most commonly lymphocytes, neutrophils, and plasma cells, but drug-induced TIN involves eosinophil infiltration. Esopisnophil's presence is not diagnostic of drug-indued TIN as NSAIDs do not involve eosinophils due to their anti-inflammatory nature. The presence of dominant neutrophils and plasma cells suggests a bacterial infection.

Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy have fewer features and so are not helpful in diagnosis because it is usually negative in patients with drug-induced TIN, and only rarely methicillin-induced TIN shows immunoglobulins at the tubular basement membrane. The granular or linear deposition pattern in immunofluorescence usually indicates autoimmune diseases and minimal change disease treated with NSAIDs.

# History and Physical

The challenging aspect of tubulointerstitial nephritis is the nonspecific and highly variable clinical presentation that delays the diagnosis and treatment, eventually worsening the outcome. History of onset and duration, age of the patients, and drug intake are of utmost importance while assessing for TIN. The classical presentation of drug-induced hypersensitivity in a study series showed fever (27%), rash (15%), and eosinophilia (23%). The classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is found in only 10% of cases. Even the symptoms may vary in different classes of medications. However, some studies suggest that allergic features dominate the clinical presentations in drug-induced TIN.

In a retrospective study, acute kidney injury due to medications initially presented without oliguria, but as the disease worsened and progressed, oliguria was seen in 51% and arthralgia in 45%.

On physical examination, skin rashes in the form of morbilliform, maculopapular, erythroderma, and epidermal necrolysis are seen. These rashes are highly variable extrarenal manifestations more common in agents that cause hypersensitive reactions, such as penicillins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, and allopurinol. The kidney is palpable occasionally in severe cases when markedly enlarged. Flank pain and tenderness due to capsular distension by inflammation and edema are likely in those taking rifampicin.

# Evaluation

Diagnosis of tubulointerstitial nephritis may be delayed due to nonspecific symptoms. It is challenging to differentiate acute and chronic TIN, and equally important to separate TIN from other causes of renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis and acute tubular necrosis because treatment and prognosis are different. Clinical assessment, laboratory findings, and imaging tests are the approaches by clinicians to make the diagnosis.

**Renal Biopsy**

Histopathological view after the renal biopsy is the only definitive diagnosis and gold standard for TIN, which shows characteristic diffuse or focal inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, histiocytes) infiltration, edema, and fibrosis along with tubulitis. One should always have a high suspicion of TIN in any patient with renal insufficiency. If there is no clinical improvement even after the withdrawal of offending agents, the patient should be advised for renal biopsy, provided there are no contraindications, and the patient agrees.

**Imaging Tests**

Renal ultrasonography (USG) and CT scans are often used as imaging studies to support the diagnosis of TIN. These tests reveal bilateral normal to the increased size of the kidney and diffusely increased cortical hyperechogenicity.

In another study, it was revealed by USG that the increase in the width of the kidney was more significant than in other dimensions.

**Blood Testing**

The most significant manifestation of renal failure in TIN is increased blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. The diagnosis could be considered initially when patients develop a rise in serum creatinine levels.

**Urine Analysis and Microscopy**

Urine analysis is one of the most commonly used tests and provides a helpful clue to diagnosing TIN. Positive proteinuria in dipstick test and microscopic or macroscopic hematuria is associated with drug-induced TIN in less than 50% of cases but about 90% in beta-lactam antibiotics-induced TIN. Urine leukocytes are present in almost all patients with methicillin-induced TIN but less common with other antibiotics. Esinophiluria (Wright or Hansel stain) is present in the drug-induced acute TIN but not sensitive and specific due to being present in other conditions.

Diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity are helped by urinary biomarkers, for instance, monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 (MCP-1), alpha1-microglobulin (A1M), and beta2- microglobulin (B2M).

# Treatment / Management

It is essential to have high clinical suspicion to eliminate causative agents of tubulointerstitial nephritis and treat associated systemic disorders. Treatment is supported by the clinician's experience, study series, case reports, and randomized control trials. Therefore, treatment should be according to the underlying etiology. Discontinuation of drugs is the first line of therapy in drug-induced TIN, with alternative drug administration to treat infections that often lead to the reversal of renal injury.

A multicenter retrospective study revealed improvement in renal function in cases of early prompt corticosteroid administration after diagnosis and removal of drugs. It showed complete recovery in about 54% of people who received steroid treatment compared to only 33% with no steroid treatment. Also, the need for chronic dialysis is more, i.e., up to 44% in the no corticosteroid treatment group compared to only 4% in the steroid-treated patient group.

The role of mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated in recent studies.

Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, i.e., azathioprine, is indicated mainly in cases associated with systemic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren syndrome, sarcoidosis, SLE, TIN with uveitis, and other granulomatous disorders. A retrospective study advocated improved prognosis of corticosteroid use in granulomatous interstitial nephritis regardless of the extent of fibrosis and inflammation on biopsy.

Management of infection-related TIN is the treatment of underlying infections with appropriate antibiotics. Besides, there are no other well-described treatment methods. Corticosteroids have little or no role in an infection-related TIN.

Supportive and conservative care should be provided to patients with adverse effects of medications and severe renal failure. These measures include fluid and electrolyte management, avoiding volume depletion or overload, adequate hydration, symptomatic relief of fever, rash and systemic symptoms, avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, supportive dialysis, etc.

# Differential Diagnosis

Clinical presentations and laboratory results of tubulointerstitial nephritis are not specific but rather overlap with most kidney diseases, causing AKI and renal insufficiency. So differentials of TIN include all those causes of AKI. Thus, clinicians use different diagnostic tests, i.e., biopsy, imaging, etc., to differentiate the TIN from AKI because therapeutic interventions differ according to the various causes of AKI. Therefore, while assessing the suspected tubulointerstitial nephritis in patients with renal insufficiency, the following problems should be considered:

**Acute Tubular Necrosis**

It is the most common cause of acute renal failure characterized by tubular cell necrosis for various reasons, such as ischemia, toxins such as aminoglycosides, heavy metals, urate, radiocontrast dye, ethylene glycol, etc. In addition, clinical manifestations like oliguria, metabolic acidosis, elevated BUN and creatinine, and electrolyte imbalance are similar to TIN.

**Atheroembolism**

Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal emboli) should be considered in patients with a predominance of urinary WBC and RBC casts. Atheroemboli may also present with skin rashes, eosinophiluria, and eosinophilia. Skin changes usually include livedo reticularis and digital infarcts rather than the diffuse maculopapular rash of TIN. History of endovascular diseases, old age, and obesity point towards atheroemboli.

**Glomerulonephritis**

These are a wide range of glomerulopathies, ultimately leading to renal impairment and mimicking TIN. Typical presentations of glomerulonephritis are similar to TIN, such as proteinuria, oliguria, and RBC casts, so visualization of glomeruli and immune complex deposition in light and electron microscopy helps to differentiate different types of glomerulonephritides from TIN.

**Vascular Injury**

Different cardiovascular insults, likely renal artery stenosis, cardiac failure, vasculitis, reduced blood flow due to afferent arteriolar constriction in NSAIDs users, reduced efferent arteriolar tone by ACE inhibitors, etc., are the common causes of AKI that clinically simulate TIN.

**Urinary Tract Obstruction (UTO)**

UTO is the postrenal cause of acute renal failure and is usually attributed to renal stones, tumors, and strictures. In patients, anuria or absence of sediment may be due to obstruction as a differential diagnosis. In such patients, imaging helps to distinguish the obstruction from other causes of AKI. Obstruction is the favorable nidus for infection, which drives the ascending infection and, thus, the pyelonephritis sooner or later. Sterile pyuria, WBC casts, leukocytosis, positive dipstick test for leukocyte esterase, and flank pain are the common manifestations.

# Prognosis

Prognosis depends upon the cause of tubulointerstitial nephritis, timing of therapy, renal function, previous offending agent, and time of removal of the reason. Chronicity portends worse outcomes. Early identification and removal of the cause improve renal outcomes. In general, drug-induced TIN has a good prognosis because of the potential for partial recovery of the kidney.

Long-term prognosis is usually encouraging with full kidney recovery.

# Complications

Older patients are more vulnerable to complications. A delay in diagnosis and treatment worsens the condition. Renal insufficiency is a common manifestation that ultimately progresses to end-stage renal disease. The inflammatory interstitium is entirely replaced by fibrosis, and severe degeneration of tubular epithelial cells induces irreversible renal impairment necessitating early renal replacement therapy. Initially, glomeruli are usually spared, but later on, glomeruli are also involved. Damage of glomeruli provokes the hyperfiltration of proteins, glucose, blood cells, and other essential components of blood. The insufficiency of reabsorption from damaged renal tubular cells causes an excessive renal loss of body electrolytes. Also, there is an acid-base imbalance causing hypokalemic metabolic acidosis.

The involvement of proximal tubules, especially in TIN with uveitis, heightens the chances of glycosuria, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricosuria, proximal renal tubular acidosis, aminoaciduria, proximal renal tubular acidosis, and kaliuresis, which is described as Fanconi syndrome.

Some cases of TIN result from antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and transform to necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis when corticosteroid therapy is delayed.

Tubulointerstitial inflammation increases angiotensin II activity, which leads to arterial hypertension due to sodium retention and increases oxidative stress.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Information provided to patients about the disease and course of treatment should be understandable. Well-educated patients who want in-depth knowledge are provided with more sophisticated and detailed notes about the procedure. Every patient has the right to know about their disease. This helps to decrease the communication gap between clinicians and patients. Patient education also assists the patients in clearing their doubts and motivates them to tackle their problems. In this way, patients become optimistic and compliant with routine therapy and cooperate with clinicians. So, health education has always been a high priority. Briefing about the disease, signs and symptoms, treatment options, side effects, and complications enables the patients to make appropriate decisions and present early in the clinic. Preventive measures, diagnostic tests, and consent before invasive interventions come under patient education.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

In most countries, an enhanced healthcare system is still unavailable. The interprofessional healthcare approach has always been highly appreciated and desired, which brings about a better outcome. Resource-rich countries are already working through multiple healthcare teams to make precise diagnoses and imply appropriate treatment. The need for different professionals depends upon the complexity of the disease process. Tubulointerstitial nephritis has a wide range of etiology, which needs clinicians from various specializations, such as nephrologists, urologists, infectious disease experts, ophthalmologists in cases of TIN with uveitis, and pulmonologists.

Diagnostic approaches can be made effective with the help of histopathologists, radiologists, lab technicians, and microbiologists. Skin rashes in drug-induced hypersensitivity can be managed with the help of dermatologists. Nursing care of patients is an inseparable entity in every hospitalized patient, and pharmacists provide drug education and review side effects. Surgeons have their role in biopsy and chronic kidney disease in renal transplantation with the aid of anesthetists. This way, the comprehensive interprofessional healthcare team drives better results with fewer adverse outcomes.
