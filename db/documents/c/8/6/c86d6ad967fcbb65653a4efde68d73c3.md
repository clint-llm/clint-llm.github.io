Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) also known as 'periodic peritonitis,' 'familial paroxysmal polyserositis,' 'periodic disease,' 'Siegal-Cattan-Mamou disease,' 'Wolff periodic disease' or 'Reimann syndrome' is an autoinflammatory genetic disorder that causes recurrent fevers and serosal inflammation of the abdomen, lungs, and joints leading to severe pain.

This hereditary disease represents the most common of the periodic fever syndromes and is named FMF because it mainly affects the people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern origin. Although FMF and other familial periodic fever syndromes were only described in the second half of the twentieth century, descriptions of periodic fevers can be found since antiquity.

Although the attacks tend to resolve spontaneously, FMF has an important clinical significance. Without treatment to help prevent attacks, the disease can result in serious secondary amyloidosis damage, especially in the kidneys, with the potential development of kidney failure.

This chapter is aimed at presenting etiology, epidemiology, clinical features, and management of FMF. Moreover, the importance of collaboration and coordination among the healthcare team to promptly diagnose and treat the disease to improve patient outcomes is highlighted.
