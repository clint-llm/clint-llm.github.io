The fibers of the buccinator muscle originate from three areas, due to which this muscle has three muscular bundles.

The fibers of all the three bundles run in the anterior direction and descent through the modiolus, thus, forming the musculature of the cheek.

On the lateral aspect, this muscle is related to the ramus of the mandible, muscle of mastication (masseter and medial pterygoid muscle), the buccal fat pad, and the buccopharyngeal fascia. On the medial aspect, its covering is the submucosa and mucosa of the cheek.

The buccinator muscle is pierced by the parotid duct (Stenson's duct) after it crosses the masseter muscle and turns medially at the anterior border of the muscle to open in the oral cavity into a small papilla opposite the maxillary second molar.
