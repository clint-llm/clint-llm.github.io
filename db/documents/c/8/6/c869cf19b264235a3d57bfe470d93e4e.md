Prognosis and outcomes for pineal tumors depend on the histology and treatment received. An interprofessional team of specialists that include a pediatrician, endocrinologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, neuro-ophthalmologist, and intensivist must work together to provide the best care for patients with pineal tumors.

Neuroradiologists can help with the radiological identification of a specific tumor, as several of them show peculiar characteristics. Cytologists can help with the identification of tumor markers that can define particular management strategies. Nurses and pharmacists will help the patient in the postoperative period.
