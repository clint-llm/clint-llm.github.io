The 2 MHz to 5 MHz curvilinear (or abdominal) probe is used for the eFAST exam to eliminate delays when switching between transducers. However, the phased array (or cardiac) probe is effective as well, particularly with parasternal windows. Likewise, the 5 MHz to 12 MHz linear (or vascular) probe is ideal for assessing for pleural sliding.
