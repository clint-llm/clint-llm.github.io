Glucocorticoids have been the mainstay of the treatment ever since the syndrome was first described.

A very small percentage of patients will require immunosuppression with other agents, either to avoid side effects of long-term steroid therapy or for long-term suppression of the disease process itself. Azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and infliximab have been used as second-line therapy. There have been reports of radiotherapy being used as second-line therapy for recurrent flare-ups leading to steroid dependence or as a first-line therapy in the presence of contraindications to steroids. Usually, these patients would have had a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Tolosa Hunt syndrome, before a second-line therapy is initiated.

**Prognosis:**Tolosa Hunt Syndrome is characterized by the dramatic symptomatic improvement seen with Glucocorticoids. Symptom improvement, especially pain relief, is usually seen 24 to 72 hours after starting steroids, with the majority of patients reporting improvement within one week. Cranial nerve palsies improve gradually and can take anywhere from two to eight weeks for recovery.

Relapses tend to occur in about 40% to 50% of patients and can be ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral.
