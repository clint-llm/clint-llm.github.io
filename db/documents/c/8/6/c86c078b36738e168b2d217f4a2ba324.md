Apert syndrome is having an autosomal dominant inheritance, and advanced paternal age is found to be associated with the de novo occurrence of Apert syndrome. There is a 50% chance of the genetic trait being passed to each child. If a pathologic variant person is present in the family, prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk should be ideally performed.
