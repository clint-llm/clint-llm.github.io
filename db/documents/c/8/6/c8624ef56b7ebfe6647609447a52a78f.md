The pathophysiology of opsonization is when the process is not occurring. Opsonization fights off foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses and also supports self-tolerance and inhibits autoimmunity. Self-tolerance is the ability of the immune system to recognize its self-antigens without mounting a response. However, when opsonins are not available, or opsonization does not occur, apoptotic cell fragments remain in the body.
