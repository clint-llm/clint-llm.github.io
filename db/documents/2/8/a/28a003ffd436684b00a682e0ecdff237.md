Lisinopril is classified as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and has been available for nearly three decades. Lisinopril has some key features that make it different from enalapril and captopril; 1) it has a long half-life, 2) it is hydrophilic, and 3) it is not broken down by the liver.

**FDA-approved Indications**

- Lisinopril is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage hypertension in adult and pediatric patients six years and older.

- It is used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of heart failure.

- It is recommended as a treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within 24 hours in hemodynamically stable patients to improve survival.

**Off-label Uses**

- Lisinopril is used in diabetic nephropathy.

- Proteinuria: As per the expert opinion, lisinopril has a role in proteinuric chronic kidney disease. In IgA nephropathy, in addition to appropriate blood pressure control, adequate control in proteinuria can be achieved with the use of lisinopril.
