A literature search does not reveal any comprehensive epidemiological dataÂ on glottic insufficiency; this is likely due to the variable causes and complexity of causes of glottic insufficiency, as well as potential under-diagnosis. It is difficult to perform a meaningful literature review on such a common and widely variable symptom, as opposed to a definitive diagnosis. The risk of vocal fold paresis after thyroid surgery has been described classically as 1%, though with more sensitive neuro-monitoring and measurements, up to 5.6% of post-thyroidectomy patients may have a demonstrable weakness. Presbylaryngeus has an increasing incidence with age and has been documented in 8-10% in some geriatric facilities. True idiopathic vocal fold paresis/paralysis has been estimated at 1 case per 100,000 people per year in one multi-institutional population study.
