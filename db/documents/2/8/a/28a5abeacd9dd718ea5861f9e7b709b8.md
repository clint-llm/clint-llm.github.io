Although debate over the duration of treatment exists, the fact of the matter is septic bursitis requires antibiotic treatment. Chronic septic bursitis can develop if initially not treated appropriately. Complications such as osteomyelitis and continual pain can occur. Overlying ligaments and tendons can become weak and may rupture due to chronic infection. Therefore, tendinitis must be a consideration when diagnosing septic bursitis.
