The development of the bowel is a complex process that relies on many signaling mechanisms. There are also many genes required to induce anterior-posterior patterning, which causes differentiation of the foregut, midgut, and hindgut structures. The NODAL gene induces expression of specific transcription factors at different points in the gastrointestinal tract including the anterior (rostral) expression of Hhex, FoxA2, and Sox2 and posterior (caudal) expression of Cdx2 and Wnt. These differences are responsible for the difference in the intestinal epithelium from proximal to distal. These genes must be active during gastrulation to have proper development of the gastrointestinal tract.

Intestinal villi are stimulated to develop by crosstalk between the endoderm and mesenchyme. Hedgehog signals from Shh and Ihh are essential in the development of the mesenchyme as well as promoting villus formation. Mesenchyme expresses BMPs and PDGFR-alpha to stimulate villus emergency and Sox9 in intervillous areas, restricting villi formation in these locations.
