Glaucoma is a chronic and serious disease that can result in permanent vision loss if not taken care of properly. To reduce the morbidity of the disorder, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that is dedicated to the management of patients with vision problems. The key to treatment is patient education. The pharmacist should emphasize the importance of medication compliance and the need to follow up with the eye surgeon. The ophthalmic nurse should assess the intraocular pressure and convey the result to the ophthalmologist.

Regular eye appointments and compliance with medication are vital to helping slow down disease progression. Since glaucoma has a hereditary component, it is important to educate family members thatÂ they may be at an increased risk to develop glaucoma and may need to have screening done regularly by an eye doctor for early detection.

No member of the team should change the dose or frequency without first consulting with the ophthalmologist. Only through open communication between the members can the morbidity of glaucoma be decreased.
