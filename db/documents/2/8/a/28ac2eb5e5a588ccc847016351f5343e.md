Embryologically, the parts of the brain can be allotted to three origins: prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. The prosencephalon becomes the forebrain, the mesencephalon becomes the midbrain, and the rhombencephalon becomes the hindbrain. These three divisions can be further split into subdivisions so that the prosencephalon consists of the telencephalon and diencephalon, the mesencephalon does not subdivide, and the rhombencephalon is made up of the metencephalon and myelencephalon.

In week 3 of embryologic development, ectoderm forms the neural tube. The cranial part of the neural tube then becomes the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon. By week 5, the thalamus arises from the diencephalon along the sides of the third ventricle. Other structures that arise from the diencephalon include the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, epithalamus, optic vesicle, the optic cup, which forms the retina, and optic stalk.

A developmental relationship exists between the thalamus and the cortex. Both parts of the brain influence one another by affecting proliferation, connections of axons, and interneuron maturation.
