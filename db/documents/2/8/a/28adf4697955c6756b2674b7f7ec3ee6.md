The presentation of a TOA can be confused with several other causes like appendicitis, a ureteral stone, cystitis, or an obturator hernia. Any delay in treatment can lead to high morbidity. Thus, an interprofessional team approach is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of TOA.

The majority of patients first present to the emergency department and hence the triage nurse should be fully aware of immediate admission and notifying the physician. The radiologist plays a vital role in the diagnosis. Any time a tubo-ovarian abscess is suspected, the gynecologist must be consulted.

The key to TOA is prevention and this requires patient education. The nurse should educate the patient on the risk factors for TOA and how to avoid them. Women should be told about safe sex and avoidance of multiple partners. Use of a condom should be encouraged. The pharmacist should encourage compliance with antibiotics to ensure that the abscess resolves without sequelae.

A retrospective review of tubo-ovarian abscesses by Ginsburg et al. found that prognosis was predictable based on the extent of disease at diagnosis and the initial response to medical therapy.

Rupture of a TOA is a surgical emergency. These patients present with diffuse peritonitis, which, unfortunately, can quickly lead to overwhelming sepsis and death.

The members of the team should communicate with each other so that the outcomes can be improved.
