Ultrasound is the preferred diagnostic imaging modality for the initial workup of adenomyosis with high sensitivity and specificity. MRI can be helpful in equivocal cases.

Diagnostic imaging utilizing either ultrasound or MRI has some limitations due to numerous mimics and variable physiologic appearance of the uterus.

Treatment options should target primary symptoms. NSAIDs for painful cramping, OCPs or levonorgestrel IUD for heavy bleeding, and hysterectomy for women no longer desiring fertility. Minimally invasive therapies should be a consideration in refractory cases in women who wish to preserve fertility.

Adenomyosis can co-exist withÂ leiomyoma (50%), endometriosis (11%), and endometrial polyps (7%). These associations merit attention in patients who have refractory symptoms.

Up to a third of women with a sonographic diagnosis of adenomyosis may be asymptomatic.

While adenomyosis is classically taught as a disease of premenopausal, multiparous women, there is data showing an increased prevalence in undiagnosed younger populations.

Utilization of the PALM-COEIN mnemonic can be used to broaden the differential diagnosis for abnormal uterine bleeding.
