Antipsychotic-induced akathisia may be managed by reducing the dose of the offending agent or switching to an alternative antipsychotic agent. Beta-blockers such as propranolol and benzodiazepines have historically been used for the treatment of akathisia although the amount of high-quality data supporting their use is limited. Anticholinergic agents such as benztropine may be utilized if concomitant pseudoparkinsonism is present. Mirtazapine may also be utilized for the management of akathisia. Low-dose mirtazapine has been found to be as effective as beta-blockers and may be considered first-line therapy. However, one should use caution with this agent, because there are reports that high doses of mirtazapine may worsen akathisia.

When using beta-blockers, clinicians should be aware of the risk of bradycardia and hypotension.

Many other agents, including vitamin B6, have been used to treat akathisia, but there are no randomized controlled trials to determine their efficacy.
