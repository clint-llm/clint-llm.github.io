The blood supply to the distal leg includes the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, both branches of the popliteal artery originating from the femoral artery and external iliac artery proximally. The blood supply to the syndesmotic region itself, however, has not been extensively studied. The studies published on the topic have described anatomical variations in the vasculature supplying blood to the anterior aspect of the tibiofibular syndesmosis. Different variants of blood supply to the anterior syndesmosis seen in the literature include

- Branches stemming primarily from the perforating branch of the peroneal artery

- Branches from the peroneal artery, supplemented by smaller vessels from the tibial artery

- Supply from the tibial artery predominantly with smaller branches from the peroneal artery

Blood supply to the posterior aspect of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis has less variation. In most cases, the blood supply to the posterior ligaments of the syndesmosis is supplied solely by the peroneal artery. In rarer instances, branches from the tibial artery also supplemented the vascular supply to the area.

Lymphatic vessels of the lower extremity divide into superficial and deep vessels, which further subdivide into medial and lateral groups. These vessels drain into the popliteal, deep or superficial inguinal, external iliac, or lumbar (aortic) nodes.
