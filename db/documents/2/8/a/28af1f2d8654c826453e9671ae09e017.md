The adverse effects of topical corticosteroids can be divided into local and systemic effects. Local adverse effects occur with prolonged treatment and are based on the topical steroid potency, vehicle, and application site. The most common local effects include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne, and purpura.

Skin atrophy is the most common adverse effect and occurs due to the anti-mitotic effect of topical corticosteroids.

Tachyphylaxis is the result of the skin developing tolerance to the topical corticosteroid, which ultimately is a loss of vasoconstriction at the level of the capillaries. It has been demonstrated that the capillaries regain the ability to vasoconstrict after 4 days. For this reason, pulse therapy is recommended and the topical corticosteroid should be discontinued for 4 days if it has lost its effectiveness.

Striae develop due to injury to the dermis and mechanical stress. Inflammation and edema of the dermis results in collagen deposition in the region of the mechanical stress. Striae appear histologically as scars and are permanent.

Topical corticosteroid usage can result in acne formation due to the degradation of the follicular epithelium and an increase in the concentration of free fatty acids on the skin surface. This fosters an environment for bacteria growth, ultimately leading to comedogenesis.

Steroid rosacea can occur when steroids are prescribed initially for erythema with or without pustules. If a low-dose potency topical corticosteroid is prescribed, it can lead to good results until the lesions reappear and higher potency steroid use is continuously needed.

Perioral dermatitis occurs due to prolonged use of potent corticosteroids on the face. It presents as follicular pustules and papules on an erythematous base surround the perioral region but sparing the vermillion border.

Less common local adverse effects include hypertrichosis, pigment alteration, and delayed wound healing. Systemic adverse effects are less likely to occur due to low percutaneous absorption; however, they can develop with the prolonged use of high-potency steroids on thin epidermal regions. The systemic adverse effects include glaucoma, hypothalamic-pituitary axis suppression, Cushing syndrome, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.
