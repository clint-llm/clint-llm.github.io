The expression of the mutated phenotype depends on several factors. The two most studied factors include the gender of the parent that transmits the repeat and the stage of the development at which the sequence is introduced into the genetic material.

The Concept of Anticipation: There exist different threshold repeat numbers for disease manifestations in both coding and non-coding regions. In an event where the expansion exceeds the threshold, disease manifestation occurs. Additionally, the larger the repeat sequence in the parent, the greater are the chances of a phenomenon called anticipation to occur. In this, the larger expansion in the progeny compared to the parent causes disease manifestation to occur earlier and in a more severe manner in the progeny. This vicious cycle continues.

The mechanism of this transmission is explained by the region affected. Trinucleotide repeat disorders were classified as type 1, which are polyglutamate (polyQ) disorders with abnormal CAG repeats in the coding region, and type 2 or non-polyglutamate (non-polyQ) disorders which are triplet expansions in the non-coding regions, by La Spada et al.

**Non-Coding Region Repeats**

- Fragile X syndrome (FXS): This occurs due to CGG repeats in the non-coding region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The fragile X CGG repeat has four forms: common (6–40 repeats), intermediate (41–60 repeats), premutation (61–200 repeats), and full mutation (>200–230 repeats), occurring almost exclusively through the maternal transmission.

- Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1): The pattern of transmission is very similar to Fragile X syndrome in that it is transmitted maternally and in an X-linked dominant manner. However, the length of the CTG expansion, ergo, the severity of the disease, correlates with the maternal age, suggesting that the expansion occurs in quiescent M1 phase of the primary oocyte. Paternal transmission in this condition is forgiving as well due to the phenomenon of ‘contraction’ as explained above.

- Spinocerebellar ataxias: This class comprises those SCAs that are caused by DNA repeat expansions falling outside the protein-coding region of the respective disease genes. In other words, the pathogenic expansion does not encode glutamine or any other amino acid in the disease protein. Ataxias included in this category are SCAs 8, 10, and 12, although there is some uncertainty about the pathogenic mechanism in SCA8.

**Coding Region Expansion**

- Huntington’s disease (HD): The pathological CAG expansion sequence in Huntington’s disease is most likely due to paternal transmission. The offspring of maternal transmission is largely normal due to a contraction in CAG repeat expansion size. In males with existing premutation alleles in the germ cells, once the mutation in the coding reaches the threshold, a 3- to 175- fold increase in the number of repeats is favored over contraction.

- Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCA): It is an autosomal dominant transmission that occurs by paternal transmission (up to 28 repeats). The offspring of an affected young mother is likely to show a contraction of the CAG repeats. However, older mothers, the multiplication of CAG repeats, occurs in the arrested primary oocyte. Somatic changes in TNR tract length occur in patients with SCA, but there is little increase in heterogeneity with increasing length.

- Friedrich ataxia (FA): FA is caused by an autosomal recessive disorder, involving GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FRDA gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97% of patients. The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210-amino acid protein, frataxin, which is located in the mitochondria and is severely reduced in FA patients. A normal individual has 8 to 30 copies of this trinucleotide, while FA patients have as many as 1000. Pathology, The main sites of pathology in FA are the dorsal root ganglia, posterior columns of the spinal cord, corticospinal tracts, and the heart. A gross examination reveals a small spinal cord with the posterior and lateral columns particularly are affected. In the posterior columns, demyelination is seen. In particular, the large fibers arising in the dorsal root ganglia, Clarke column, and dentate nucleus are affected. Iron deposits in the myocardium and, consequently, a hypokinetic heart failure have been reported.
