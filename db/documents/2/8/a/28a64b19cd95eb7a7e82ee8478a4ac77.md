Glycopyrrolate, also known as glycopyrronium, is an anticholinergic drug. Glycopyrrolate has been widely used as a preoperative medication to inhibit salivary gland and respiratory secretions. The most frequent reasons for administering anticholinergics include producing an antisialagogue effect, creating a sedative and amnesic effect, and preventing reflex bradycardia. Glycopyrrolate is among the more common anticholinergic medications. It is used perioperatively as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dosing, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, the toxicity of glycopyrrolate. It increases practitioners' knowledge regarding how to approach and use this medication and monitor it effectively to drive better patient outcomes.
