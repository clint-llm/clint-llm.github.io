Contraindications include patient inability to tolerate the examination due to discomfort, apprehension, significant active bleeding which could prevent adequate visualization by the examiner, or the presence of a known mass in the distal rectum which could be damaged or irritated by the introduction of the rigid anoscope.

Anoscopy should not be performed on an imperforate anus.
