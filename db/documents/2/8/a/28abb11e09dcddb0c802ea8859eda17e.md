Historically, James Hope was one of the first physicians to recommend methods to recognize benign and innocent murmurs. In his 1942 textbook, Hope says “murmurs from these causes may easily be distinguished from that of valvular disease…” As the 20th century approached, it became more common knowledge among the medical community that healthy children and adolescents may have murmurs and gallops on physical exam that have no pathologic significance, especially in the asymptomatic patient.
