Ever since the passage of the FDCA, clinical efficacy proven by authentic empirical methods has played a significant role in the development of federal protocols about medication production.

- An entrant must produce evidence (under 505(d)) that the medicine is safe and efficacious when requesting clearance for an NDA.

- 
              
- Animal and clinical (human) investigations are required as evidence.

- Section 505(a) prohibits the distribution of any novel medicine unless it has been FDA approved.

- 
              
- 505(i), which permits the FDA to exempt a medication from the NDA criteria for clinical research, avoids this seemingly conflicting position. 
              
              
- 
                  
- The maker must file a "Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Drug," also known as an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application, to get this exclusion. 
                  
                

              
              
- The producer could then perform clinical tests of its IND if it is authorized.
              
              
- 
                  
- The filing of an IND follows the applicant's lengthy preclinical inquiry. The petitioner has decided that the drug has prospective worth and would be reasonably safe to try in people through laboratory experiments and animal testing.

Biological products act as a paradigm example; these products have been under government regulation since 1902 and are now governed by the FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 codified them as drugs.

- To be considered interchangeable, the applicant must show that the biosimilar will deliver the same clinical outcomes as the reference product while posing no additional risk.

- Biologics are items made from living organisms used to treat, protect, or heal human diseases or conditions.

- As part of the ACA, the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (BPCIA) allows the FDA to approve biosimilar products.

- Biosimilarity refers to how closely a biological item resembles a reference product with no clinically significant deviations.
