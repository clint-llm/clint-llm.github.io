The most common adverse effect of alosetron is constipation. A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study was done to assess the efficacy and safety of 0.5 mg and 1 mg of alosetron in women with severe IBS-D. The study revealed that constipation occurred in 9%, 16%, and 19% of patients in the 0.5 mg, 1 mg once daily, and 1 mg twice daily groups, respectively.

Other common side effects include

- Abdominal discomfort and pain

- Nausea

- Intestinal discomfort and pain

- Abdominal distention

- Regurgitation and reflux

- Hemorrhoids

- Headache

- Tiredness

Although rare, there have been a few reported ischemic colitis cases in patients taking alosetron for IBS treatment. Clinical trials comparing patients receiving alosetron 1 mg twice daily to patients receiving placebo showed that the cumulative incidence of ischemic colitis was 0.2% within the first three months and 0.3% within the first six months.versus 0.00%, p = 0.03).

In postmarketing surveillance studies, gastrointestinal adverse reactions were common. Patients using alosetron tablets reported GI perforation, impaction, ulceration, small bowel mesenteric ischemia, headache, and skin rash.

**Drug Interactions**

**CYP1A2 Inhibitors:**Fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor, if coadministered with alosetron, can inhibit the metabolism of alosetron which can lead to alosetron toxicity. Moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including cimetidine and quinolone antibiotics, should be avoided unless clinically needed.

**CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**Ketoconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, voriconazole, itraconazole, and protease inhibitors are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and may increase alosetron toxicity.  Exercise caution when alosetron and CYP3A4 inhibitors are administered concomitantly because of potential drug interactions.
