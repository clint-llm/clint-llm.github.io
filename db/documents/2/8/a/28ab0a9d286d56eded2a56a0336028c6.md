Early symptoms of primary benign orbital tumors overlap with those seen in various inflammatory, infectious, and malignant orbital diseases. Thus, it is important to counsel the patient cautiously and empathetically during the diagnostic workup. In cases of small, asymptomatic masses, clinicians should discuss the role of observation and the importance of adherence to follow-up. When intervention is warranted, the risks, benefits, and alternatives should be explained thoroughly to allow informed decision-making.
