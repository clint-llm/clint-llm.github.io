Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is an arrhythmia present usually in infants and children. It originates in the atrioventricular (AV) node or AV junction, including the bundle of His (BH). It is further classified into congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia (CJET) and postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia (POJET).

CJET occurs without any previous history of heart surgery and can be even present at birth. CJET is associated with high morbidity and mortality as high as 35 percent if not diagnosed and appropriately treated as it is usually refractory to medical therapy.

POJET usually occurs in the first 72 hours of repair of congenital heart defects. It has been attributed to ischemia, stretching, and direct injury to the atrioventricular (AV) conduction tissue of the heart during the repair of congenital defects. It can be regular or irregular. It does not involve the reentry circuit, unlike AV nodal reentry and AV reentry supraventricular arrhythmias. It could have retrograde atrial conduction in 1:1 pattern or AV dissociation with variable conduction.
