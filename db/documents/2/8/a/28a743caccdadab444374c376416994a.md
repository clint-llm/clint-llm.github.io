Polymyxins are a class of medications used in the management and treatment of systemic infections caused by susceptible strains of multidrug-resistant organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is in the antibiotic class of drugs. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for polymyxin as a valuable agent in the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with polymyxins who are infected by susceptible strains of gram-negative pathogens resistant most of the other antibiotic classes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action and administration of polymyxin.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of polymyxin.
- Review the appropriate monitoring and toxicity of polymyxin.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team that can enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring polymyxins to improve patient outcomes for patients receiving systemic antibiotic therapy with polymyxins.
