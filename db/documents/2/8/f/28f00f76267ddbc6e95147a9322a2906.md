Chloroquine exerts its antimalarial effects by preventing the polymerization of heme into hemozoin (a food source for the malarial parasite). Chloroquine forms a drug-hemozoin complex, and this complex caps the polymerizing chain, thereby preventing additional polymerization. Along with the prevention of polymerization, the free heme accumulates in the food vacuole, exerting its toxic effects on the parasite.

Chloroquine also functions as an anti-autoimmune therapy. It exerts its effects by binding to transcriptional factors on T helper 17 cells and preventing differentiation. At the same time, chloroquine also activates the transcription factor Foxp3, driving the formation of regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells have been shown to treat and prevent autoimmune diseases.
