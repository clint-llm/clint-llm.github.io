After neurotmesis occurs, there are many cell signals and neurotrophic factors involved. Within 30 minutes after injury, intracellular processes that promote repair and regeneration have already been activated. Schwann cells play an indispensable role in promoting regeneration by producing neurotrophic factors and by increasing their synthesis of surface cell adhesion molecules, and by elaborating basement membrane containing extracellular matrix proteins, such as laminin and fibronectin.

Within hours of injury, the ends of the severed axons seal over, and the sealed ends swell with cellular organelles as anterograde axonal transport in the proximal stump, and retrograde axonal transport in the distal stump persist for several days.

Within days after injury, Schwann cells begin to divide and create a pool of de-differentiated daughter cells. These de-differentiated Schwann cells upregulate expression of nerve growth factor, other neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and other compounds that lead to Schwann cell differentiation and proliferation in anticipation of the arrival of a regenerating sprout.
