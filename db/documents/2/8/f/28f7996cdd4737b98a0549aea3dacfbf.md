Tibial fractures are common injuries; the subcutaneous nature of the tibia makes it more prone to open injury. Radiographs are essential in the initial evaluation of these fractures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tibia diaphyseal fractures and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tibial diaphyseal fractures. 
- Explain the radiographic findings of tibial diaphyseal fractures. 
- Describe the management of tibial diaphyseal fractures. 
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of tibial diaphyseal fractures.
