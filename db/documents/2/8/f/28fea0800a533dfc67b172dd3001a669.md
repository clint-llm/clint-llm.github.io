Spontaneous resolution of nevus comedonicus has not been described; however, aggressive treatment is not recommended as nevus comedonicus is essentially a benign condition. Treatment is mainly reserved for cosmetic reasons or when there are complications such as the formation of cysts or abscesses. Cosmetic treatment for the post-inflammatory scarring also might be required. Treatment options include topical and systemic retinoids. These sometimes are combined with topical steroids for their anti-inflammatory action, salicylic acid, or 12% ammonium lactate. Surgical excision and ablative lasers have been tried in NC. Newer treatment avenues being explored include FGFR inhibitors, interleukin-1-alpha inhibitors, and anti-gamma-secretase drugs. Successful treatment of the keratin plugs with a pore strip has been described. Lasers have been described to be effective in the treatment of nevus comedonicus. Ultrapulse carbondioxide lasers and erbium-YAG lasers have been reported to effectively treat lesions of nevus comedonicus. A recent report has mentioned the use of a 1450 nm diode laser in treating nevus comedonicus. It is postulated that sublesional collagen stimulation by the laser might lead to a reduction of the epidermal invaginations leading to an improvement in the skin texture.
