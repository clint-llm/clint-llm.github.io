**Standard First-Trimester Ultrasound Examination**

As outlined by the AIUM-ACR-ACOG-SMFM-SRU practice parameters, indications include confirmation of singleton/multiple gestation intrauterine pregnancy and chorionicity/amnionicity if applicable, confirmation of cardiac activity, estimation of gestational age, evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy, measurement of Nuchal Translucency (NT) for aneuploidy screening, vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, suspected gestational trophoblastic disease, or maternal pelvic organ assessment.

**Detailed First-Trimester Anatomy Ultrasound Examination (Early Comprehensive Fetal Anatomy Ultrasound)**

This specialized diagnostic examination is an indication-driven examination for women at increased risk of fetal and/or placental anomalies performed between 12 weeks and 0 days to 13 weeks and six days either transabdominally or combined with the transvaginal approach. Indications include a previous child with an anomaly, increased Nuchal Translucency >3 mm, a suspected fetal anomaly in the current pregnancy, advanced maternal age, pregestational diabetes mellitus, maternal obesity, IVF pregnancy, teratogen exposure, congenital infection exposures, multifetal gestation, positive maternal serum screening tests, abnormal placental implantation. The best time to perform an early anatomy scan is after 13 weeks. With great emphasis, this ultrasound does not replace a detailed second-trimester anatomic survey, which should always be performed.

**Standard Second-Trimester Anatomy Ultrasound Examination**

This routine anatomy ultrasound is performed between 18 to 22 weeks in every pregnancy to assess fetal anatomy, screen for anomalies, evaluate the placental location and maternal pelvic anatomy, and estimate gestational age (if not performed with an earlier scan). The standard anatomical ultrasound is performed in low-risk pregnancies who otherwise do not have indications for a detailed anatomy scan, as outlined below.

**Detailed Second Trimester Anatomy Ultrasound Examination**

According to the AIUM-ACR-ACOG-SMFM-SRU practice parameters, this scan is an indication-driven examination and is not intended to be performed in all pregnancies. The indications include a previous child with an anomaly, increased Nuchal Translucency >3 mm, a suspected fetal anomaly in current pregnancy, advanced maternal age, pregestational diabetes mellitus, early gestational diabetes before 24 weeks, maternal obesity, IVF pregnancy, teratogen exposure, congenital infection exposures, multifetal gestation, positive maternal serum screening tests, abnormal placental implantation, parental chromosomal/genetic carrier, aneuploidy marker on previous ultrasound, alloimmunization, oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, maternal drug use.

**Specialized Third Trimester Ultrasound Examination**

Third-trimester ultrasounds are indication-driven examinations. Examples of types of specialized ultrasounds include the biophysical profile, additional biometric measurements follow-ups (every 3 to 4 weeks), doppler ultrasounds in the setting of growth restrictions. Indications include fetal growth restriction or suspected macrosomia, multifetal gestation, twin-twin transfusion syndrome screening (every two weeks), a significant discrepancy between the uterine size and clinical dates, evaluation of fetal well-being, evaluation of prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labor, vaginal bleeding, suspected placental abruption, follow-up evaluation for placental appearance for suspected placenta previa, vasa previa, PAS, suspected fetal death, suspected amniotic fluid abnormalities.
