Most patients with pulmonic stenosis are asymptomatic, which may lead to a missed diagnosis until an insult occurs. Symptomatic patients typically experience dyspnea on exertion or associated fatigue, depending on the severity of obstruction and cardiac compensatory reserve. Rarely, patients can experience angina or sudden cardiac arrest. In patients with an associated septal defect, the patient may present with signs of cyanosis.

A physical exam may reveal multiple signs of pulmonic stenosis, depending on severity and practitioner skill. Cardiac examination may reveal a left parasternal heave, secondary to right ventricular hypertrophy. Auscultation at the left upper sternal border may reveal a systolic ejection murmur radiating to the back.
