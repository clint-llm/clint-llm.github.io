Factors that can interfere with appropriate ELISA testing can occur at any phase of the testing process, beginning with specimen collection. The quality and integrity of the assay plate, coating buffer, capture antibody, blocking buffer, target antigen, detection antibody, enzyme conjugate, washes, substrate, and signal detection can all interfere with proper ELISA testing.

- Plate Assay: the shape and quality of the wells, the material of the plate, potential pre-activation, and even or uneven coating.

- Buffer: pH, contamination.

- Capture and detection antibody: incubation time, temperature, specificity, titer, affinity.

- Blocking buffer: cross-reactivity, concentration, contamination.

- Target antigen: conformation, stability, epitopes.

- Enzyme conjugate: type, concentration, function, cross-reactivity.

- Washes: contamination, frequency, volume, duration, composition.

- Substrate: quality/manufacturer.

- Detection: instrument-dependent factors.

- Reader/human error.
