Cushing syndrome is caused by prolonged exposure to high circulating levels of cortisol. The most common cause of cushingoid features is iatrogenic corticosteroid use, while some herbal preparations can also increase circulating corticosteroid levels leading to Cushing syndrome. Cushing syndrome can be interchangeably called hypercortisolism. ACTH-dependent cortisol excess due to a pituitary adenoma is called Cushing disease, and it is responsible for 80% of endogenous Cushing syndrome. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Cushing syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Cushing syndrome.
- Describe the presentation and evaluation of Cushing syndrome, including indicated laboratory workup.
- Summarize the treatment and management of Cushing syndrome.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
