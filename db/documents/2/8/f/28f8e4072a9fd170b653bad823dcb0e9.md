There are certain contraindications to specific bowel preparations, which include but are not limited to:

- Low volume 2-L PEG-ELS with ascorbic acid should be avoided in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

- PEG-3350 should be avoided in those with electrolyte abnormalities.

- Magnesium citrate should be avoided in those with electrolyte abnormalities such as kidney disease and those with a greater risk of magnesium toxicity.

- Oral sodium sulfate in a single dose has been found to cause increased gastrointestinal (GI) events.

- Sodium phosphate is not recommended as a bowel preparation regimen due to its side effects. It should be avoided in those with renal dysfunction, dehydration, hypercalcemia, hypertension treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker because they have developed phosphate nephropathy.

- The bowel preparation combination of sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate is known to have a GI side-effect profile that includes abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

- The bowel preparation combination of sodium sulfate and sulfate-free PEG-ELS has been associated with vomiting.
