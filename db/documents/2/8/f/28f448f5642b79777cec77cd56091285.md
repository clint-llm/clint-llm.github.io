**Gross Microscopic Examination**

Light microscopic examination of wet mount (10x magnification), wood lamp, or histopathological examination of material withdrawn from the eyelids may confirm the parasitic infestation, revealing lice and nits, and help make the diagnosis of phthiriasis by showing the typical morphology of Pthirus pubis.

**Dermoscopy**

Dermoscopy, also called dermatoscopy or epiluminoscopy, is a method of skin evaluation by using skin surface microscopy. It is a safe and confirmatory diagnostic method for assessing louse infection without the risk of physical damage.

**Polymerase Chain Reaction and DNA sequencing**

Considering the forensic investigations, in cases of sexual trauma and abuse, the DNA of the host can be identified from the blood of the louse by using PCR.
