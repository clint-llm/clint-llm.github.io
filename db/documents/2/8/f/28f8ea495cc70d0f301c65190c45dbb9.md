Over time, most children outgrow or become tolerant of food allergens to eggs, milk, wheat, and soy. However, allergies to nuts and shellfish are more long-standing. Close to 20% of children have a resolution of their food allergy by school age. The non-IgE mediated food allergies resolve within the first year of life. Unfortunately, sporadic cases of fatal anaphylactic reactions still continue to occur.
