**Antibiotic Resistance**

First-line therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis should not include beta-lactam antibiotics. This is because E. Coli resistance rates above 20% are now common and widespread. Fluoroquinolone resistance is still generally below 10% in North America and Europe, but these agents should still be used prudently. Treatment should be individualized based on local resistance patterns.
