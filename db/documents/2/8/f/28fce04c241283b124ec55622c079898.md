The evaluation is dependent on the healthcare context in which the patient is seen. In general practice or emergency department, the main consideration would be cauda equina syndrome, which may be caused by a large Tarlov cyst.

As cauda equina syndrome or compression presents a spectrum with varying symptomatology, this is the main diagnosis to exclude, and evaluation is tailored in this manner.

MRI is currently the preferred imaging modality to evaluate Tarlov cysts. They appear as thin-walled cystic structures that are closely related to nerves. The cyst itself is extra-dural and contains the nerve root within its walls, and is classified as a type 2 spinal meningeal cyst by Nabor et al.

The cyst should appear as a low signal on T1 and a high signal (equivalent to CSF) on T2.
