Ricin is a globular glycoprotein that is composed of different protein chains connected by a disulfide bond. It is classified as a Type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP). The ricin toxin A chain inactivates ribosomes by hydrolyzing the N-glycosidic bond of an adenosine residue in the 28 S ribosomal RNA of eukaryotic cells; this inhibits protein synthesis by blocking the binding of elongation factors. This inhibition of protein synthesis by the ricin toxin A chain is a mechanism of ricin toxicity. The ricin toxin B chain binds to carbohydrates on the surface of eukaryotic cells and facilitates entry of the toxin into the cell. Ricin can enter the cell by numerous mechanisms including both receptor-mediated and adsorptive-mediated endocytosis. After endocytosis, ricin is transferred by vesicular transport from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, then undergoes retrograde vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus. Ricin has been shown to be transported from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum by the chaperone protein calreticulin. Once ricin reaches the endoplasmic reticulum, the disulfide bond between the A chain and the B chain is reduced by protein disulfide isomerase. The A chain then undergoes partial unfolding, after which it crosses the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via the Sec61p translocon. The unfolded A chain avoids ubiquitination because of its low lysine content, thus enabling the A chain to evadeÂ degradation by proteasomes and refold into its biologically active conformation, after which it resumes catalytic activity.
