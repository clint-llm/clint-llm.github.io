If patients are previously known to have severe allergic or hypersensitivity reactions, they are required to discontinue the use of the medication immediately. MercaptopurineÂ is also contraindicated for use in patients who have previously shown resistance to the drug.

There should be at least a two-month window between the cessation of mercaptopurine treatment and vaccination with live viral or bacterial vaccines to prevent severe and fatal infections.
