Propranolol is a competitive beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist devoid of agonist activity, making it the prototype for comparison to other beta-antagonists.

B-adrenoreceptor antagonists, including propranolol, have been advised to be used for the treatment of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease. Furthermore, they have been demonstrated to improve mortality and morbidity in those with hypertension complicated with heart failure, angina, or any history of previous myocardial infarctions.

Propranolol not only has extensive use in cardiovascular disease, but it also has several implications in the treatment of noncardiovascular disease processes. It is used as a means of migraine prophylaxis, treatment of restless leg syndrome, essential tremors, and has even been of great success in treating infantile hemangioma.

Off-label use of propranolol includes performance anxiety, which is a subset of a social phobia presenting with tachycardia, sweating, and flushing that occurs secondary to increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

The extensive use of propranolol in the medical field highlights the vast importance of the discovery of the drug to society.
