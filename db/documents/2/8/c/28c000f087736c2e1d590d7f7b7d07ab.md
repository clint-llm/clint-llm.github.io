**Congenital**

- Skull base defects

- Tegmen tympani defect

**Traumatic**

- Most common cause

- Fractures involving the skull base with breach of the dura

- Fractures of air sinuses

- Penetrating head injuries with a dural laceration

- High-pressure trauma to the conjunctiva

- Subarachnoid-pleural fistula

**Infectious**

- Meningitis or ventriculitis that is produced by gas-forming organisms

- Chronic otitis media and sinusitis

**Neoplastic**

- Dermoid cyst rupture

- Tumors eroding the skull or skull base, like osteoma, epidermoid or pituitary adenoma

**Iatrogenic**

- Trans-cranial surgeries (especially posterior fossa surgeries in a prone position and following chronic subdural hematoma evacuation in a supine position)

- Transsphenoidal surgeries

- Following lumbar puncture or spine surgeries

- Ventriculostomies

- Epidural or subarachnoid blocks

- Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy or septoplasty

- Secondary to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the surgical site

- Positive pressure ventilation

- Spreading of subcutaneous emphysema through the ventriculoperitoneal shunt track into the brain

**Spontaneous**

- Following the development of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea

- Secondary to CSF leakage from myelomeningocele

- Spontaneous otogenic pneumocephalus occurs when there is an anomalous communication between the intracranial space and a hyperpneumatised temporal bone.

**Others**

- Barotrauma
