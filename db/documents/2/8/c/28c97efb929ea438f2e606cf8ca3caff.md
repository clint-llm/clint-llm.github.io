**Hemostasis**

Clotting factors are arguably the crux and most essential components of hemostasis. Hemostasis is the bodyâ€™s physiologic response to vascular endothelial injury, which results in a series of processes that attempt to retain blood within the vascular system through the formation of a clot. Hemostasis can be further divided into primary and secondary hemostasis. Primary hemostasis, which results in the formation of a soft platelet plug, involves vasoconstriction, platelet adhesion, platelet activation, and platelet aggregation. Secondary hemostasis is primarily defined as the formation of fibrinogen into fibrin, which ultimately evolves the soft platelet plug into a hard, insoluble fibrin clot. Within primary and secondary hemostasis, 3 coagulation pathways exist: intrinsic, extrinsic, and common.

**Pathways**

The intrinsic pathway responds to spontaneous, internal damage of the vascular endothelium, whereas the extrinsic pathway becomes activated secondary to external trauma. Both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways meet at a shared point to continue coagulation, the common pathway. Clotting factors involved in the intrinsic pathway include factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Clotting factors involved in the extrinsic pathway include factors VII and III. The common pathway includes clotting factors X, V, II, I, and XIII. Clotting factors can also be referred to outside of their Roman numeral designations. In the intrinsic pathway, factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII are also known as Hageman factor, plasma thromboplastin antecedent, Christmas factor, and antihemophilic factor A, respectively. In the extrinsic pathway, factors VII and III are also known as stabilizing factor and tissue factor, respectively. The common pathway factors X, V, II, I, and XIII are also known as Stuart-Prower factor, proaccelerin, prothrombin, fibrinogen, and fibrin-stabilizing factor, respectively. Clotting factor IV is a calcium ion that plays an important role in all 3 pathways. Some of the clotting factors function as serine proteases, specifically factors II, VI, IX, and X.
