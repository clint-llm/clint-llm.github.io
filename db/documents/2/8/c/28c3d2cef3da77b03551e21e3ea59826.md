Giant cell tumors represent 4-10% of all primary bone tumors and 15-20% of all benign bone tumors.

Although benign, these tumors exhibit locally aggressive behavior and own the potential to metastasize. Around 1 to 5% of cases show metastasis and there is a positive correlation between the occurrence of metastases and local aggressiveness and recurrence.

The tumor is sporadic before the age of 20, with less than 5% of the tumors occurring in skeletally immature patients.
