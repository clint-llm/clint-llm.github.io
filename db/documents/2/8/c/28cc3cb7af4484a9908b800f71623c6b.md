Emphysema in AAT deficiency is considered due to an imbalance between neutrophil elastase in the lung. This destroys elastin, and the elastase inhibitor AAT, which protects against proteolytic degradation of elastin. This mechanism is known as a “toxic loss of function.” Specifically, cigarette smoking and infection increase elastase production in the lung, therefore increasing lung degradation. Also, the polymers of “Z” antitrypsin are chemotactic for neutrophils, which may contribute to local inflammation and tissue destruction in the lung.

The pathogenesis of the liver disease is different and is called a “toxic gain of function.” The liver disease results from accumulation within the hepatocyte of un-secreted variant AAT protein. Only those genotypes associated with pathologic polymerization of AAT within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes produce disease. Most patients are homozygous for the Z allele (i.e., PI*ZZ); liver disease does not occur in null homozygotes who have severe AAT deficiency but no intra-hepatocytic accumulation.
