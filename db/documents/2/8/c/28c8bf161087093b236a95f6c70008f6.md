The prediction of birth weight by ultrasonography or clinical measurement is imprecise. For suspected macrosomia, the accuracy of estimated fetal weight using ultrasound biometry is no better than that obtained via abdominal palpation. Women without contraindications should be encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength-conditioning exercises during pregnancy to reduce the risk of macrosomia. Control of maternal hyperglycemia reduces the risk of macrosomia. Therefore, maternal glucose optimization is recommended for pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Merely asking a parous woman for her estimate of the birth weight may provide an estimate as accurate as any other. In two studies, a parous woman’s ability to predict birth weight more than 4,000 g was as accurate as of that of clinicians using clinical palpation maneuvers alone.
