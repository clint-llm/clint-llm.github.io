The complications in Hirayama disease are mostly due to chronic motor deficits. These may include weakness in the functions of the hand, forearm, or arm. This may result in chronic disuse atrophy of the muscles and permanent contractures. There may be spasticity, or the disease may recur after many years ofÂ being stable.
