Proteinuria is an effective way to distinguish between different causes of edema. If there is severe proteinuria (>0.5 g/dL), this may suggest renal disease, preeclampsia, or renal vein thrombosis. On the other hand, minimal proteinuria (<0.5 g/dL) suggests etiologies such as congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, malnutrition/malabsorption, hypothyroidism, varicose veins, and inferior vena cava thrombosis below the renal vein. In patients with generalized edema, it is beneficial to obtain urine tests for red blood cells, casts, and albuminuria. Blood chemistries can also be helpful including urea, creatinine, albumin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/proBNP, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, and INR to rule in or rule out renal disease, cardiac failure, chronic liver disease, etc. A complete blood count to evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis, or leukopenia can also help to identify the etiology of edema. D-dimer has a high sensitivity and therefore has a role in ruling out conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or a pulmonary embolism. Additional testing such as chest x-ray, ultrasound of the abdomen, and echocardiography have their basis in the clinical presentation and core laboratory investigations. Rarely, renal biopsy hepatic biopsy is needed to make a precise diagnosis that will dictate therapy.
