Gilly classification: This system is used mainly for prognostic evaluation.

- Stage 0: No macroscopic disease

- Stage 1: Malignant implants less than 5 mm in size and localized to one part of the abdomen

- Stage 2: Diffuse to the whole abdomen

- Stage 3: Implants 5mm to 2 cm

- Stage 4: Large malignant nodules - greater than 2 cm

PCI score: As described in the figure, PCI scoring is the staging method most used preoperatively and intraoperatively for surgical patient selection, prognosis determination, and future outcome prediction.

CC score: Completeness of Cytoreduction: Surgeons use this scoring system to assess surgical resection to look for prognostic benefits. They subdivide into the following score levels depending on the presence of carcinomatousÂ lesions after surgery in any abdominal quadrant. CC 0 and CC 1 scores suggest better survival outcomes. Efforts remain directed at the achievement of complete cytoreduction whenever possible.

- CC 0 - no disease

- CC 1 - Present - less than 0.25 cm

- CC 2 - 0.25 to 2.5 cm

- CC 3 - greater than 2.5 cm
