Duodenal trauma is a rare and potentially life-threatening injury. It is most commonly caused by a penetrating mechanism. The duodenum is the first and smallest portion of the small bowel. These injuries, however, are challenged by complex anatomic and physiologic relationships. As a result, the diagnosis and subsequent management may be delayed. This delay is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment, as well, is difficult given these relationships and the surgical approach is often complex. This activity will review the pathophysiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of duodenal trauma. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the typical etiologies of duodenal trauma.
- Describe the pathophysiology of duodenal trauma.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with duodenal trauma.
- Describe the treatment considerations for patients with duodenal trauma.
