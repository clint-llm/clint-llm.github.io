In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended replacing the term apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) with brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) to better reflect the non life-threatening, transient nature of these events. A BRUE is a transient event with no clear cause that is frightening to the observer and consists of a combination of apnea, color change, muscle tone change, and choking, or gagging in an infant. This activity describes the pathophysiology of the brief resolved event and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management and follow-up of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE).
- Identify the workup for an infant with a resolved unexplained event (BRUE).
- Identify keys to successful patient and caregiver management for infants that have undergone brief resolved unexplained events.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients and families affected by brief resolved unexplained events.
