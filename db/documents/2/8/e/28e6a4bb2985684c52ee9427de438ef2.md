Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common pathogens involved in otitis externa. Otitis externa can also occur as a polymicrobial infection, and rarely, it may result from a fungal infection such as Candida or Aspergillus. Various factors can predispose patients to the development of OE. Swimming is one of the most common risk factors, and it increases the risk five times when compared to non-swimmers. Other risk factors include:

- Humidity

- Trauma or external devices (cotton swabs, earplugs, hearing aids)

- Dermatologic conditions such as eczema and psoriasis

- Narrow external ear canals

- Ear canal obstruction (cerumen obstruction, foreign body)

- Radiotherapy or chemotherapy

- Stress

- Immunocompromised patients
