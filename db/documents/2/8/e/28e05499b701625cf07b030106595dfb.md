Osteoporosis is a silent disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone microarchitecture leading to fragility and increased risk of fractures. Classically, it has been more studied in postmenopausal women due to the known effects of estrogen deficiency during that period in females and associated increased prevalence of osteoporosis. More recently, however, the medical society has increasingly acknowledged the significant impact the burden of osteoporosis has caused in males. Unfortunately, the shortage of studies in men and lack of consensus among medical societies challenge the treatment of osteoporosis in men. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of osteoporosis in males with the currently available literature and highlights the role of multidisciplinary care in the management of osteoporosis in males.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and risk factors associated with osteoporosis in males.
- Review the presentation of osteoporosis in males.
- Outline the current options available and possible future treatment for osteoporosis in males.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in males with osteoporosis.
