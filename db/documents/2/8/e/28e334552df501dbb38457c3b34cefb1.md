Any soft tissue injury to the head or face warrants a thorough history and physical examination. Superficial abrasions or injuries with minimal epidermal disruption may be suitable for management with local wound care and healing by secondary intention. However, all wounds require close inspection and evaluation of surrounding structural and concomitant injuries. Laceration repair can begin after associated facial injuries have been addressed. Wounds that violate multiple tissue planes require layered closure to restore tensile strength and resist dehiscence and unsightly scarring.
