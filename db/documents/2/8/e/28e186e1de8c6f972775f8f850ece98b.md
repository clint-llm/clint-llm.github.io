There are broad applications of ONSUS in both advanced medical centers and battlefield environments. It is often difficult and potentially life-threatening to transport critically ill intensive care unit patients to radiology suites. The mortality rate of inter-hospital transfer of critically ill patients has been reported as high as 2%, with adverse event rates as high as 68%.

Head CT accounts for more than 25% of ICU inter-hospital transports, and depending on the indication, ONSUS may be a modality in improving the decision-making process for obtaining such imaging.

Medics and physicians have used ultrasound in many environments, including high altitude, polar, battlefield, and in-flight expeditions, when other imaging is not readily available.

ONSUS provides the ability for rapid triage and the minimally invasive evaluation of intracranial hypertension in an equivocal clinical setting and provides useful data for the early medical treatment of intracranial hypertension while arranging evacuation to definitive neurosurgical care. Though ONSUS is not specifically mentioned by the most recent Joint Trauma System Clinical Practice Guideline on Traumatic Brain/Severe Head Injury (2 March 2017), the authors note that “treatment of known or suspected intracranial hypertension remains a cornerstone of therapy in patients with severe brain injury.” Further recommendations are that after conservative management (head of the bed elevation 30 to 45 degrees, SBP goals greater than 100 to 110 mm Hg, normoventilation with PaCo2 35 to 40 mm Hg, blood glucose less than 180 mg/dl, PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg, seizure prophylaxis, etc.) treatment with 3% saline with a target serum sodium goal of 150 to 160 should be instituted if there is no contraindication. When utilizing invasive ICP monitoring, a treatment goal of less than 22 mmHg is often cited.

Since invasive ICP monitors require some neurosurgical expertise, and traditional cutoffs of ONSD of 5 mm typically correlate to an ICP greater than 20 mmHg, ONSUS could be utilized as an aid in the decision-making process to start hypertonic therapy and as a real-time monitor of clinical effects.

A positive 30 degrees test (ONSD assessment in primary and 30 degrees from primary gaze) differentiates raised ICP due to fluid overload from that of infiltrative pathologies.

Invasive methods, though considered the gold standard for ICP measurement, harbinger significant risks of infection and hemorrhage, are not readily available, and have significant financial constraints, especially in low- and middle-income nations.

Competence can be easily attained despite any formal radiology training.

**Limitations of the study include:**

- Is operator dependent****

- Influence by type of settings (ER vs. ICU)

- A meta-analysis has demonstrated a wide range of diagnostic odds of measurement in quantifying raised ICP

- The optic nerve sheath is not perfectly circular and is a complex system comprising arachnoid trabeculae, pillars, and septa compartmentalizing the subarachnoid space

- ONSD expansion persisted even after the normalization of raised ICP owing to the impaired retraction capability of the ONS

- Alongside ICP, other factors may govern the optic nerve sheath in vivo

- Movement of the eyeball, axial length, myopia, lesions, and optic canal at the sphenoid bone can influence the ONSD
