Leadership can support the establishment of "a culture of habitual excellence" through the use of briefings and debriefings to demonstrate transparency and sharing of problems. Thoughtful crafting and/or facilitation of the debriefing process is demonstrated by the ability to establish the following essential elements: psychological safety, debriefing stance/basic assumption, debriefing rules, and a shared mental model. In a meta-analysis of factors moderating the efficiency and effectiveness of debriefing, researchers revealed that a general discussion of overall performance is enhanced when reflecting on specific past events couples with cue-strategy associations. This allows participants to examine actions and their underlying cognitions more deeply. Periods of silence allow for active listening and support transitions between difficult topics. This approach also provides an opportunity for facilitators to evaluate non-verbal communication and determine if participants are "ready to learn."

Through the simulation design process, contextual factors are augmented to optimize workflow representation, thus promoting the natural execution of tasks.**.******Functional task alignment can be confirmed by measuring participants' immersion in the simulation session.****As previously noted, the incorporation of global rating or behavioral assessment tools into the debriefing session allows for discussion of roles and expectations of the team as a whole**.******Finally, by asking open-ended questions, and confirming that learning objectives have been addressed, this critical component of successful healthcare simulation delivery optimizes the reflective experience of the participants.****By enabling teams and individuals to experience the appropriate conceptual, emotional, and physical fidelity of high-risk situations without the potential for patient injury, high fidelity simulation is well suited to HFE********through CRM.
