As the military begins to work towards a unified medical force under the Defense Health Agency, the goals for the advancement of military medicine will continue to require simulation as a critical aspect of training and maintenance of skills. The future of military medical simulation includes working towards remote surgical interventions to allow for those on the front lines of the battlefield or deployed aboard a ship to receive a life-saving surgery from a remote surgeon. These programs allow for the military to create the most prepared and skilled force of medics, corpsmen, technicians, nurses, and physicians to aid those in harm's way.
