Unfortunately, there are no physical exams, laboratory, or imaging findings that are diagnostic at this point for persistent postural-perceptual dizziness.

PPPD should be prompted for dizzy patients that have suffered a central, peripheral, or vascular insult that may have impacted the vestibular pathway. In addition, patients that suffered from concussions or whiplash injuries should also be evaluated early for the development of PPPD.

Allowing patients to describe their symptoms may serve as the best tool for postulating that PPPD surfaces as a cause for their symptoms. Timing of intervention is crucial for the management of PPPD. It is believed that intervention within the first eight weeks of a vestibular insult gives patients the best chance for PPPD to not be thoroughly intrusive into their daily lives.

The approach for PPPD should be made in a multidisciplinary matter, including management with a primary care provider, neurology, otolaryngology, and psychiatry. Patients often benefit significantly from vestibular balance rehabilitation therapy and cognitive-behavioral. Psychiatry can also be crucial in patients learning to cope with their new fears and anxieties.
