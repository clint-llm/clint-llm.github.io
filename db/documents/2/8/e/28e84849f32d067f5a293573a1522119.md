The healthcare professionals, acting as an interprofessional team, should educate the patient about the causes of hyperprolactinemia. If they diagnose the patient with prolactinoma, they should counsel the patient on symptoms of a prolactinoma and when to seek help. There should be effective coordination between endocrinologists and neurosurgeons, and with a psychiatrist, if hyperprolactinemia is the result of the action of dopamine-antagonist drugs. A pharmacist has a role in educating patients on the effectiveness of medication and side effects, and coordinating with the clinicians on drug therapy going forward, including agent selection, dosing, and potential interactions. Oncology nurses should take part to inform the patient about the possible need for radiation therapy for a large mass and the possibility of hypopituitarism.

These interprofessional actions will drive better outcomes in hyperprolactinemia cases. [Level 5]
