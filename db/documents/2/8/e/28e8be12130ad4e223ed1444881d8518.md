The cause of Todd paresis is a seizure immediately preceding the clinical manifestation of Todd paresis. The clinical manifestation occurring during the period following the seizure and lasting until the brain recovers all its functions is known as the postictal syndrome. Some seizures may not have it or it cannot be recognized, like in absence seizures, myoclonic seizures, and in short focal seizures.

The current and most accepted understanding of the condition is theorized to be the exhaustion of the primary motor cortex (or any other area of the brain) after neuronal hyperexcitation in a seizure state, or due to hypoperfusion to the affected area of the brain through vasoconstriction mechanisms, thus limiting the function of that area through relative oxygen starvation.
