Extracranial vessels represent vessels outside the brain and skull. The most common configuration is the three-vessel arch anatomy, where the first branch is the brachiocephalic artery which further branches into the right common carotid artery (CCA) and right subclavian artery. The second branch is the left CCA, with the left subclavian artery as the third branch.

The most common variant to this anatomy is the common origin of the brachiocephalic artery and left CCA from the aortic arch. The common carotid arteries bifurcate into the external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) at the upper border of the thyroid. The carotid bulb is the location of a bifurcation and the ICA origin.
