Monoamine oxidase inhibitor toxicity is rare but very serious. The toxicity is due to hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pharmacist, emergency department physician, toxicologist, nurse practitioner, internist and a cardiologist. The key is to prevent and manage the sympathetic overactivity. These patients need close ICU monitoring and aggressive hydration and control of hyperthermia.

The outcomes depend on the severity of the drug overdose, co morbidity, age of patient and prior history of cardiac disorders.
