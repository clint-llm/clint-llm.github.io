In patients with normal anatomy and delayed development, evaluating ovarian and pituitary hormones, including androgens, can assist in a diagnosis. Pituitary tumors, most often adenomas, can be associated with elevated prolactin levels and physical findings such as galactorrhea, headaches, visual changes, and amenorrhea. In primary amenorrhea, estradiol levels help measure ovarian function. If estradiol levels are low, reflexive testing of FSH and LH will differentiate between primary ovarian insufficiency (FSH/LH elevated) and secondary ovarian insufficiency (FSH/LH low or unmeasurable; pituitary insufficiency).

If physical examination reveals evidence of hirsutism or acne, testing androgen levels, including free and total testosterone, DHEA-S, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, can help rule out androgen-secreting tumors and congenital adrenal hyperplasia as a cause. Androgen levels may also be used to rule out or confirm a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It should be noted that the absence of menarche can also occur due to pregnancy, and ruling out pregnancy is essential in the evaluation.
