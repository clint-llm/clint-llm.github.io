The preoperative management of anesthesia in children differs from that in adults. These differences include employing cognitive and age-appropriate language, understanding the dynamics of the patientâ€™s family, and assessing a patient's developmental stage. This activity will review the specifics of a preoperative evaluation in pediatric patients and the role of the interprofessional team in the preoperative anesthesia management of children.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the components of an age-appropriate preoperative consultation of pediatric patients with various clinical diagnoses.
- Review age-appropriate pharmacologic management of pediatric patients.
- Summarize various behavioral methods used to alleviate preoperative anxiety and fear of parental separation in pediatric patients.
