There is minimal preparation needed to complete the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex. The patient should be relaxed, sitting, or lying in the supine position. The patient should be in a hospital gown without clothing covering the forearm and hand, so it is easily visible to the examiner. The practitioner should wash or sanitize his or her hands before performing the test. The examiner will need to stand on the side of the patient being tested in a position that they are easily able to hold the forearm and see the response in the hand and fingers of the patient.
