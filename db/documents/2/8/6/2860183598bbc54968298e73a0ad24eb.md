While inferior wall MIs traditionally have a good prognosis, there are a few factors that may increase mortality. Approximately 40% of inferior wall infarctions also involve the right ventricle. Right ventricular infarctions are veryÂ pre-load dependent, and nitrates may precipitate a drop in blood pressure. The addition of right-sided ECGs leads, especially lead V4r, will aid in that diagnosis. If timely treatment does not occur, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock as more myocardial death occurs. Also, because the right coronary artery perfuses the sinoatrial node, heart block and bradycardia may occur. A high degree heart block, defined as a second or third-degree block, is seen in 19% of patients with acute inferior wall MI. The amount of collateral circulation to the AV impacts the rate of heart blocks. If there is a concomitant disease to the other coronary arteries, collateral circulation to the AV node will be reduced, and the likelihood of heart block would be increased.
