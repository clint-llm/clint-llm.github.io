Evaluation should include but not be limited to a thorough physical examination. The physical should be coupled with diagnostic imaging (computed tomography scan of the head), followed by telemetry floor admission, as only a third of ischemic strokes are due to carotid artery disease. The remaining is due to the cardiac embolic phenomenon. Thus, consultation with a stroke specialist like a neurologist, as well as a cardiologist, is of paramount importance.

Regarding diagnosing carotid artery stenosis, one usually starts with the least invasive, inexpensive test, such as Carotid Duplex. This examination typically shows a high-resistance signal in the carotid bulb and the very proximal internal carotid artery. Distally, there are no Doppler signals audible in the carotid artery. As a confirmatory test, some form of contrast examination such as digital subtraction arteriography, magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA), or computed tomographic (CT) arteriography is required to confirm the diagnosis and plan a surgical approach. Gadolinium-enhanced MRA is better for differentiating high-grade stenosis than the time of flight, which sometimes overestimates. Conventional angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis.
