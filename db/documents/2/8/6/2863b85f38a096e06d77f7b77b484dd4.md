The differential diagnosis for rectal prolapse includes ileocecal intussusception, prolapsing rectal polyp, prolapsing rectal duplication cyst, and rectal hemorrhoids. While rectal prolapse is painless, intussusception presents with intermittent severe pain. Examination of prolapse tissue can distinguish between prolapsing rectal polyp, prolapsing rectal duplication cyst, and rectal hemorrhoids due to the circumferential nature of prolapse.
