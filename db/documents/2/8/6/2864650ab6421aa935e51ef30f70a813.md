Investigations of supraclavicular lymph nodes masses include imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) followed by ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).

As with any surgical procedure, procedures involving the supraclavicular lymph node require a firm grasp of the critical structures and anatomy that surround it. Complications that could arise from procedures such as supraclavicular lymph node harvest or biopsies include but are not limited to

- Carotid and subclavian artery bleeding

- Chylous fistulas, the leaking of lymph from lymphatic vessels, caused by damage to lymphatics such as the thoracic duct

- Chylous fistulas are preventable by asking the patient to cough; this will compress the intrathoracic lymphatics leading to distension of lymphatic vessels outside the thorax, resulting in a jet of chyle leaking from places of the defect, allowing their localization and ligation before closing the wound.

- Damage to the phrenic nerve, which could lead to dyspnea as the phrenic nerve supplies the diaphragm

- Wound infection

- Tumor seeding in cases of human papillomavirus-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-positive HNSCC)
