Brachial plexus injuries, also known as brachial plexopathies, occur via a variety of mechanisms. Patient presentation is highly variable. Electrodiagnosis, utilizing electromyography and nerve conduction studies, aids in the localization and prognostication of such injuries. This activity reviews the process of electrodiagnostic evaluation of brachial plexopathies and highlights the role of the interdisciplinary team in evaluating and treating patients afflicted with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy and physiology of the brachial plexus, as well as the pathophysiology of brachial plexopathies. 
- Explain the link between the physical exam of the patient with suspected brachial plexopathy, and the use of electrodiagnostic testing to localize and prognosticate such injuries. 
- Outline the basic techniques of nerve conduction studies, electromyography, and somatosensory evoked potentials in the evaluation of brachial plexopathies.
- Summarize indications and complications associated with electrodiagnostic testing.
