Cellulitis is characterized by erythema, warmth, edema, and tenderness to palpation resulting from cytokine and neutrophil response from bacteria breaching the epidermis. The cytokines and neutrophils are recruited to the affected area after bacteria have penetrated theÂ skin leading to an epidermal response. This response includes the production of antimicrobial peptides and keratinocyte proliferation and is postulated to produce the characteristic exam findings in cellulitis.
