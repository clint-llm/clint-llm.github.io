Considerable confusion exists in the literature regarding the nomenclature of these lesions, which has been clarified in recent years. Infantile hemangioma historically may be referred to as “infantile hemangioendothelioma,” a term which is not preferred due to its implication for malignant potential and the potential confusion with “kaposiform hemangioendothelioma” or “epithelioid hemangioendothelioma” a malignant vascular tumor of infancy. Both IH and CH should be distinguished from the hepatic hemangiomas of adulthood which is a separate disease process.
