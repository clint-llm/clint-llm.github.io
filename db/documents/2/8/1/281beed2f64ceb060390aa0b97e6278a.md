The female perineum is at risk for distribution through a variety of etiologies, including trauma, sexual abuse, parturition, infections, and cancer. When it occurs, and deeper structures are involved, operative intervention is required. Vulvar-vaginal reconstruction is not an uncommon procedure, and understanding the reconstructive ladder is key. This activity reviews the relevant anatomy and equipment used and highlights the inter-professional team's role in evaluating and treating patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for vulvar-vaginal reconstruction. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to vulvar-vaginal reconstruction.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of vulvar-vaginal reconstruction.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance vulvar-vaginal reconstruction and improve outcomes.
