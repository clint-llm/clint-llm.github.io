Studies have shown evidence of changes in oxyntic mucosa in longstanding autoimmune gastritis. The oxyntic mucosa is mainly composed of parietal cells, activation of which increases acid production in the stomach. The oxyntic mucosa undergoes four distinctive yet overlapping histological changes:

- In the early phase, the plasma cells and lymphocytes migrate into the lamina propria, and patchy destruction of oxyntic cells may be seen.

- The lymphocytes and plasma cells then form dense infiltrate in the lamina propria. A metaplastic process is observed in the oxyntic cells; the large pale staining oxyntic cells are replaced by a new phenotype of clear cells, also known as pseudo-pyloric metaplasia.

- Then follows intestinal metaplasia of gastric glands, which can later lead to malignancy.

- In advanced gastritis, atrophy of oxyntic mucosa is seen. There can also be fibrosis, polyp formation, hyperplasia of muscularis mucosae, and/or enterochromaffin-like cells.
