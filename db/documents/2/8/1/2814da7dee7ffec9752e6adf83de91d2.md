Initial common clinical signs are feeding difficulty, excessive sweating, breathlessness, failure to thrive, respiratory distress, cough, cyanosis, and swelling of the lower limbs. The most common presentation of endocardial fibroelastosis includes signs and symptoms of left heart failure following a recent respiratory infection.

Due to a wide variety of clinical presentations, Seki et al. proposed pathological criteria to narrow down the diagnosis:

- Absence of other congenital malformations

- Absence of underlying vascular, metabolic, or inflammatory disorders

- Spherical or dilated left ventricle (LV)

- Diffuse thickening of LV endocardium

- LV papillary muscles displaced upward towards the left atrium

- Thickened free edges of mitral valve leaflets

- Excessive straight elastic fibers in the endocardium (on microscopic examination)
