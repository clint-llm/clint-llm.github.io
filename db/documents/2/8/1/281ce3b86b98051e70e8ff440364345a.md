Warfarin has both absolute and relative contraindications. Most of the absolute contraindications are related to conditions and procedures with active bleeding or the tendency to bleed. Warfarin use is also contraindicated in pregnancy (except in those with mechanical heart valves with a high risk for thromboembolism) due to a risk of fetal warfarin syndrome, which manifests with fetal malformations and an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and stillbirth.
