The clinical features of protein-losing enteropathy depend on the underlying etiology. Loss of serum proteins leads to decreased oncotic pressure in capillaries, which, in turn, leads to peripheral edema (most common presenting symptom) due to transudation of fluids from capillaries to the subcutaneous tissue. Patients can also present with abdominal distension due to ascites and pleural effusions. In primarily gastrointestinal causes of protein loss, they can have diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, etc. This condition can cause loss of immunoglobulins and lymphocytes, which cause immunocompromised state leading to frequent infections, and also patients can get opportunistic infections. Patients with protein loss due to cardiac diseases can present with symptoms of heart failure like pitting edema, pleural effusion, shortness of breath, elevated jugular venous pressure.
