Heyde syndrome is an uncommon, underrecognized condition that carries an increased risk of serious morbidity and mortality. Heyde syndrome should be considered in any elderly patient who presents with gastrointestinal bleeding and evidence of aortic valve stenosis. Treatment and management require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. Consultation with the appropriate specialist, including an interventional cardiologist and a gastroenterologist, is recommended. Aortic valve replacement is necessary in most cases for definitive management; cardiothoracic surgeon consultation is appropriate if surgical valve replacement is considered. Consistent follow-up in the outpatient primary care setting is also recommended to ensure the resolution of symptoms. Cardiology nurses routinely monitor patients, provide education, and communicate with the interprofessional team, informing the clinicians of any concerns. They will also assist during procedures such as valve replacements. Pharmacists review medications for dosage and interactions, counsel patients on administration, side effects, and verify that there are no drug-drug interactions. These examples of interprofessional collaboration demonstrate the best approach to patients with Hyde syndrome, leading to optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
