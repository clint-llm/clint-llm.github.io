The pathophysiology of reentrant tachycardia depends on the origin and location of the reentrant circuit. A similarity that all reentrant arrhythmias possess is the formation of a circuit that allows for constant re-excitation of the myocardium. This constant re-excitation of the myocardium can manifest in dangerous arrhythmias, syncope, or even sudden death. Reentry has a characteristic mechanism by which tachyarrhythmias are started and sustained. Reentries can be divided into three main types; circus-type reentry, reflection, and phase II reentry.

**Circus Type Reentry**

This is the basic model of reentry, characterized by circus movement of an impulse around an anatomic or functional obstacle. The ring model of reentry was described by Mayers at the start of the 20th century. In 1913, G.R.Mines proposed the three basic requirements of a circus-type reentry, which included; 1) a unidirectional block, 2) circus movement that allows the excitatory wave to progress along a distinct pathway, return to its origin and recirculate again, and 3) Any interruption in the circuit should result in termination of the reentry.

**Reflection**

Reflection is an example of reentry without circus movement. The basic concept of reflection first came after studying the electrical characteristics of potassium-depolarized Purkinje fibers in the 1970s.

**Phase II Reentry**

It is the third mechanism of reentry, does not depend on circus movement, and has been found to have a focal origin in the ventricular myocardium. Phase 2 reentry occurs due to heterogeneity in the action potential in epicardial and endocardial myocytes.

Typical atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is a prototype of reentrant arrhythmias. It is characterized by two atrioventricular nodal pathways having different refractory periods (slow and fast pathways). When a premature atrial impulse comes, an antegrade impulse propagates via the slow pathway (the fast pathway is refractory). When the impulse reaches the lower end of the slow pathway, the fast pathway has already recovered, so the retrograde impulse goes via the fast pathway. When this alternate movement of the cardiac impulse continues, it starts a reentrant tachycardia.
