As mentioned above warfarin was initially used as a pesticide and then formulated as a medication. Resistance was noted though in rats resulting in the development of superwarfarins, which have become common in residences and business as a rodenticide which has resulted in potential human exposure. The superwarfarin labeled substances have become increasingly common with exposures or poisonings jumping from around 5,000 cases in 1988 to over 13,000 cases in 1955.
