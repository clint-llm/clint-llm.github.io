Understanding the composition of the rectus sheath is of great significance for surgeons. The arcuate line can be a potential point for entry into the preperitoneal space for a total extraperitoneal laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. For this type of repair, dissection is started at the umbilicus and continued inferiorly along the anterior surface of the posterior rectus sheath until entering the preperitoneal space at the arcuate line. This space is developed, and the repair is subsequently completed within this created space.

The rectus sheath is also involved in the repair of any ventral hernia. Mesh, used to reinforce the repair, can be placed anterior to the anterior rectus sheath, within the posterior rectus sheath (known as a retrorectus repair), posterior to the posterior rectus sheath (within the preperitoneal space), or posterior to the peritoneum (within the intra-abdominal cavity).  Additionally, the surgeon must exercise care regarding neurovascular structures to the rectus sheath and muscles during these repairs, as damage to the vessels can lead to bleeding complications, and the devascularization of these structures can lead to tissue damage and failure of the repair. Similarly, denervation injuries can lead to muscle atrophy, which can impact the contour and function of the abdominal wall.

The rectus abdominis muscle also has utility in many muscle flap repairs, so knowledge of the vascular supply of the muscle and its innervation are essential considerations in plastic surgery.
