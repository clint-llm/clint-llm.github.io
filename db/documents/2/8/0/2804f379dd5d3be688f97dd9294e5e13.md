The right ventricle conveys deoxygenated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. The lungs will then breathe in air, which transfers oxygen through the alveoli into the dense capillary network surrounding the alveoli. The blood will then travel through the pulmonary vein into the left atrium, where it gets ejected from the left ventricle into the aorta. The aorta is the major artery that further branches into the system arteries, delivering blood to the cerebral, coronary, renal, splanchnic, and skin. Systemic veins return deoxygenated blood from these tissues to the vena cava, where it enters the right atrium and begins the cycle again.

The following equation can express blood flow dynamics: Q = P/R, where Q is the flow/cardiac output, P is the pressure gradient,Â and R is the total peripheral resistance.
