Patients and their families should receive education regarding jaundice and its consequences. Patients need to understand the role of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the manifestation of jaundice and its severity. Patients require counseling regarding the physical appearance or symptoms of jaundice. In the case of neonatal jaundice, parents will need to know about the cause of physiologic or non-physiologic jaundice and the treatment options available for it. Patients with any change in mental or neural behavior should immediately consult with a physician. Future parents with a family history of inherited Crigler-Najjar syndromes should seek genetic counseling. Education on the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance must be provided to the patients and families.
