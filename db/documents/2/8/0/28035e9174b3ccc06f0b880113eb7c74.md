RTA with its all major subtypes is an uncommon entity. The disease is undiagnosed in most of the cases and also in cases with incomplete RTA. Inherited forms of RTA are much rarer than acquired forms. The most common Type in the United States and worldwide is type 4 hyperkalemic RTA, the main causes of which are diabetic nephropathy leading to hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and urinary tract obstruction. There is over 20% incidence of developing RTA after renal transplant in the setting of rejection or immunosuppressive drugs.

Type 2 Proximal RTA is rarer than type 1 distal RTA and Fanconi syndrome is very rare as a primary disease. The diseases which are associated with Fanconi syndrome, for example, Wilson disease, cystinosis, galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance and von Gierke disease, are also rare. RTA associated with certain drugs such as antivirals for the treatment of HIV and viral hepatitis is increasing in incidence

Type 3 Mixed RTA is vanishingly rare hereditary form of disease mostly affecting children from Arabic, North African, and Middle Eastern descent.
