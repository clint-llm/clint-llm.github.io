Complications during the sonographic assessment of AFI or MVP are minimal.   When performing the ultrasound, patients may experience discomfort with the pressure from the ultrasound probe or lightheadedness from the gravid uterus's compression on the vena cava in the supine position. A rolled towel under the patient’s flank to provide left lateral tilt may improve venous return and improve symptoms.
