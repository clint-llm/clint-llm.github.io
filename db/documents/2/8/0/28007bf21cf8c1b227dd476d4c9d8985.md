Disturbance of organogenesis during the embryonic period results in omphalocele. Around the sixth week of development, the abdominal contents become too large to be contained in the abdominal cavity and protrude at the base of the umbilical cord. This event is known as physiologic midgut herniation and is easily identified on prenatal ultrasound between the 9 and 11 weeks of gestation. The liver is never present in the physiologic midgut herniation. By 12 weeks of gestation, the hernia reduces, and when it persists, it is no longer physiological. Omphalocele occurs when the gut contents fail to rotate and return to the abdominal cavity. ItÂ can occasionally contain the liver in the presence of a large abdominal wall defect.

In general, omphaloceles are associated with advanced maternal age and are known to occur in twins.
