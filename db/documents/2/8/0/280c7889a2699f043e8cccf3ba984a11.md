History and clinical presentation/context are key in suspecting a diagnosis of MAS. This is crucial, as early interventions and management can be necessary for respiratory and cardiovascular support.

**Evaluation of MAS Includes**

- Chest radiograph (CXR): Early CXR findings are nonspecific. These include streaky densities bilaterally. Later findings on CXR include hyperinflation, flattening of the diaphragms, and atelectasis. Pneumothorax can also be seen.

- Arterial blood gas (ABG): ABG is a tool to assess the degree of respiratory failure and help guide management (intubation, mechanical ventilation). In severe cases, ABG will show hypoxemic, hypercapnic, and respiratory acidosis.

- Pulse oximetry: To assess oxygenation but also the degree of shunting (pre-ductal and postductal differential).

- Echocardiography (ECG): ECG is an important tool to assess heart function and help screen for signs of PPHN and right ventricular dysfunction. It also helps identify the cardiac anatomy and evaluate for any cardiac level right to left shunting.

- Blood and tracheal cultures: Evaluation for sepsis and pneumonia is crucial in the context of neonatal distress. Often empiric antibiotics are started.
