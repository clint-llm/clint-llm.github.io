It is important to understand the anatomy of the conjunctiva when considering the reconstruction and replacement of the conjunctiva.

Loss or scarring of the conjunctiva from injury or disease can result in eyelid malposition, restriction of ocular movement with double vision, and dryness. When replacing the injured conjunctiva, materials such as amniotic membrane, hard palate grafts, nasal septal mucosa, autogenous conjunctiva, and tarsus with conjunctiva have been used. Ideally, it is wise to replace like for like. Unfortunately, except for small defects, autogenous conjunctiva is limited by availability.

Oral mucosal grafts are used in two forms:

- Oral mucous membrane grafting (MMG)

- Minor salivary gland grafting (MSGG) for the treatment of severe dryness

Oral mucosa has multiple advantages:

- It has similar biological properties to the conjunctiva

- The donor site is easily accessible and universally available

- Obtaining donor tissue is technically easy

- Obtaining tissue is cheap

- Repeat harvesting is possible

- Complications are few

- It is an autograft avoiding the risks of allogeneic grafts.

In 1912, Denig first described the use of mucous membrane for lime burns; later, mucous membrane grafts were used by Weeks for the correction of trichiasis and symblepharon.

Indications for the use of mucous membrane grafts in Ophthalmology include the following:

- After removal of pterygia

- Repair of contracted anophthalmic sockets

- Globe surface and fornix reconstruction after tumor resection

- Deformities of the eyelids (cicatricial entropion, keratinization of the eyelid margin after chemical burns, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

- Repair of erosions over glaucoma drainage devices

- Repair over scleral buckle exposure

- Support of keratoprosthesis associated with corneal melt

- Formation of the lining during conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy or dacryocystorhinostomy
