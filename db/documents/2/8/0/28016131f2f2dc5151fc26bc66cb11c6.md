Many other conditions can mimic gallbladder disease. Patients who present with acute biliary colic are often worked up for cardiac issues. Other common conditions with similar presenting symptoms are peptic ulcer disease, irritableÂ bowel disease, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, pulmonary embolism, and musculoskeletal disorders. The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with possible hydrops in patients with a palpable gallbladder, Murphy sign, and a positive gallbladder ultrasound should not be confused with any other diagnosis.
