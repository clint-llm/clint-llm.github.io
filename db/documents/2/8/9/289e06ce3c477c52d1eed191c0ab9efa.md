Plasma infusion should be used if plasma exchange is not readily available. Rigorous infusion of plasma can lead to congestive heart failure but, once plasma exchange is established, this issue can be addressed and reversed.

Complications of PEX may be related to the central venous catheter placements and exposure to donor plasma. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) can occur.
