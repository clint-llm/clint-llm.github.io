Management of corneal dystrophy is a combined effort by many medical professionals. Despite the rarity of these diseases, optometrists and ophthalmologists performing routine screening exams on patients should always be aware of the slit-lamp findings that are pathognomonic of CD. A clinician, as well as medical assistants, technicians, and nurses, should be aware of symptoms and signs of CD and be thorough patient history gathering, especially family history, to increase the chance of recognizing potential dystrophy. Proper communication among team members of these clinical findings is crucial to appropriate diagnosis through a physical exam and laboratory testing. Over-testing should be avoided to limit the cost to the patient. Finally, proper communication and education should be given to the patient regarding diagnosis and treatment, follow-up, and potential surgical intervention. It is noteworthy that the ICD-10 codes for CD are divided into six categories: endothelial, epithelial (Juvenile’s), granular, macular, unspecified, and other hereditary corneal dystrophies.
