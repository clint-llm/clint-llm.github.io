The foramen spinosum is a surgical landmark that serves as a guide during the microsurgery of the middle cranial fossa. One other notable surgical consideration relates to the middle meningeal artery that runs through the foramen spinosum, which is surrounded by the auriculotemporal nerve. The close association of the two can lead to unintended damage to the nerve during surgery.
