Depending on the extent of anodontia, hypodontia, or oligodontia, different potential complications can arise. In patients missing most or all of their dentition, speech and mastication are generally affected, significantly impacting their quality of life. Patients missing two to four teeth may not be as severely impacted as more restorative or prosthodontic treatment options are available.

Supernumerary teeth, if mal-positioned, can prevent the normal eruption of developing teeth which would require removal â€“ a potentially invasive procedure. The multiple supernumerary teeth are generally indicative of an underlying syndromic or developmental condition which should be evaluated by the appropriate healthcare provider.
