The pathogenesis of medication-induced esophagitis involves a direct irritant effect and disruption of cytoprotective barriers.

**Drugs related factors**

Local acid burn and hyperosmolar properties of a medicine can cause esophageal mucosal injury. A clinical and experimental study which included 40 patients who were taking tetracyclines and developed esophageal ulcer showed similar appearance on endoscopy. The study demonstrated the corrosive effect of tetracycline on the esophagus of a cat in the experimental part of the study.

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause drug-induced esophagitis, albeit with a different mechanism by disrupting the cytoprotective prostaglandin barrier of the esophagus.

**Patient-related factors**

Patient-related reasons mainly include factors that cause prolonged transit time of medications in the esophagus. Geriatric-related low saliva production, altered esophageal anatomy, taking a medication just before sleeping, and motility disorder can all result in increased esophageal transit time for drugs, as demonstrated in several studies.

In drug-induced esophagitis, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy usually reveals pathology in the middle third of the esophagus.
