Untreated or refractory tarsal tunnel syndrome can result in neuropathies of the posterior tibial nerve and its branches. Patients may have persistent pain. Subsequent motor weakness and atrophy can develop. Postoperative complications include impaired wound healing, infection, and scar formation. Surgical decompression may not adequately resolve pain and other symptoms.
