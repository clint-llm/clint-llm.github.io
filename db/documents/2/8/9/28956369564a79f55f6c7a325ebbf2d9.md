As described above, the diagnosis and management of Leydig cell tumors can be particularly challenging, especially given the relative rarity of the tumor and extremely variable presentation. Generally, the longer the delay in diagnosis, the worse the outcomes, so an interprofessional healthcare team is the best method for diagnosis and management of suspected Leydig cell tumors. Because of this, primary care and emergency department providers should consider ultrasound as an extension of a physical exam for any patient with testicular swelling or unexplained scrotal pain and should refer patients with questionable or concerning ultrasound results to a urologist for further work-up and therapy. Likewise, primary care providers or endocrinologists should consider Leydig cell tumors in the differential diagnosis of infertility, hypogonadism, and especially gynecomastia. Urology and oncology specialty-trained nursing staff can be a valuable asset throughout the diagnosis and management of these tumors, providing patient counsel, assisting during procedures, and helping to followup and assess treatment effectiveness. While the oncologist may be at the head of the team, the entire interprofessional team needs to coordinate care for optimal patient results. [Level 5]

As with all malignancies, the earlier the diagnosis, the better the outcome.
