Prognosis is variable and depends on the presence of subtle psychiatric comorbidities and the initiation of early interventions.

Low intelligence capacities and a dysfunctional family environment with persistent criminality in parents predict a poor prognosis. Adequate treatment of ADHD, proper school placements with assistance for difficulties in learning, higher verbal intelligence, and positive parenting contribute to a better prognosis.
