There is significant variability in the structure of the ethmoid bone, both in terms of the number of nasal turbinates and in terms of pneumatization. Most individuals are born with at least three pairs of turbinates, two arising from the ethmoid bone - the middle and superior - and one comprising its own independent bone. The supreme turbinate, a small bony process superior to the superior turbinate, is not generally clinically significant and therefore is not consistently described in the literature. It may be present bilaterally, unilaterally, or not at all, and its presence is more common in certain ethnic groups.
