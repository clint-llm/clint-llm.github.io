The bone marrow of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) contains normal stem cells and contains abnormal clonal stem cells that suppress normal stem cell growth and maturation. The cause of panmyelosis is unregulated neoplastic proliferation. JAK2 kinase mutation likely leads to the signaling derangements resulting in PV. A valine to phenylalanine substitution at position 617 of the JAK2 gene, or JAK2V617F, leads to constitutively active cytokine receptors.
