The only absolute contraindication to acyclovir is hypersensitivity.

Cautions include renal failure/impairment, immunocompromised host, potential risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

Regarding pregnancy and lactation, acyclovir has been shown to cross the placenta. Acyclovir's manufacturer recommends caution during pregnancy and only using it when necessary and indicated, as only a few studies have been conducted. Specifically, cases of HSV hepatitis have received treatment during pregnancy.

Although rare, this condition can become disseminated and fatal in pregnant patients. Although all 56 patients studied had transaminitis, only 18.2% had a vesicular rash. For patients treated with acyclovir empirically, it conferred no risks to the fetus.
