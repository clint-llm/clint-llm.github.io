Around 52% of the worldwide adult population has had at least one tooth affected by apical periodontitis (AP).

Patients with diabetes typically have a higher frequency of tooth loss and endodontically treated teeth due to increased chronic inflammation, reduced tissue repair capacity, decreased response to infection, and delayed wound healing.

Patients who previously received endodontic therapy also had a higher incidence of AP than those with non-endodontically treated teeth.
