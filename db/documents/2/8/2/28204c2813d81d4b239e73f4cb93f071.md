V. parahaemolyticus can infect the host through different routes. Infected seafood can be consumed, causing direct contact with the gastrointestinal system. The bacteria can also make their way into an open wound during exposure to saltwater. In severe cases and those with comorbidities, once inside the host the bacteria can further spread into the blood. V.
parahaemolyticus has several virulence factors common to other bacteria. However, the major virulence factor of V.
parahaemolyticus is thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH). TDH is present in the majority of clinical specimens (88% to 96%) but only in approximately 1% of natural populations of V. parahaemolyticus. Despite this fact, TDH has been identified as a major virulence factor, the specific mechanism by which TDH causes gastroenteritis is not completely understood. TDH is a pore-forming toxin, and researchers postulate that this could be related to its ability to cause gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition to the TDH virulence factor, V. parahaemolyticus also uses a type 3 secretion system, similar to other gram-negative bacteria. Despite its virulence factors, the majority of V. parahaemolyticus infections only result in self-limiting enteritis.
