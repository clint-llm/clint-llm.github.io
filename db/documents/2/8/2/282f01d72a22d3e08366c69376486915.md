M. chelonae and the other RGM are not reportable infections in the United States, and the true prevalence is unknown. Most Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) shows increased prevalence in the southern states of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. The national survey done between 1981-1983 evaluating NTM prevalence, showed an annual disease prevalence of 1.78 NTM cases per 100,000 persons, with M. chelonae/M. abscessus reported as 0.08 case per 100,000 persons. In a study done in Oregon (2005 to 2006) an annualized prevalence of 7.2 cases per 100,000 persons was reported. In that study, M chelonae prevalence was 0.2 cases per 100,000 persons, with the majority causing skin and soft tissue infections. M. chelonae cases have been reported globally from the Americas, Eurasia, and Australia, and skin and soft tissues infections remain the most frequent. Overall, there is a trend towards increasing NTM infections worldwide. No age, sex or race predilection has been identified. No seasonal trend has been documented in the M. chelonae skin and soft tissue infections. M. chelonae have been found in drinking water systems, as the organism is resistant to chlorine. It has been reported more frequently than M. abscessus but less than M. fortuitum or M. gordanae.
M. gordanae is the most frequently reported mycobacteria found in drinking water systems.[8]
