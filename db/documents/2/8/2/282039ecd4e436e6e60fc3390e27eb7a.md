Vaccines affect the immune system, primarily through B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. Before exposure, the immune system contains B-Lymphocytes and T-Lymphocytes, each with the potential to respond to a unique antigen. In addition, many antigens require a combined response of both B-Lymphocytes and T-Lymphocytes. This form of immunity is termed T-cell-dependent. Less commonly, an antigen causes stimulation of B-Lymphocytes and antibody production without the help of T-lymphocytes. This form of immunity is termed T-cell-independent.

The vaccine introduces the antigen to begin the process, which stimulates the initiation of the immune response. Initially, the foreign material is phagocytized and broken down by macrophages. Then, the resultant peptides created by the breakdown of the protein material are sent to the surface of the macrophage cell, where it is displayed. These antigens are displayed by molecules called Major Histocompatibility Complexes, which exist in two forms: I or II (MHC-I or MHC-II). The presentation of the antigen stimulates the secretion of several inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and various interferons, which stimulate a further response.

In T-cell-dependent immunity, so-called T-helper cells recognize the antigen and stimulate the corresponding B-lymphocytes to proliferate and produce antibodies. As the B-lymphocytes proliferate, they also differentiate into antibody-forming plasma cells. The antibodies produced have various functions, the most important of which include those which inactivate soluble protein toxins (antitoxins), those which facilitate intracellular digestion of bacteria by damaging the bacterial membrane (lysins), those that prevent reproduction of pathogenic viruses (neutralizing antibodies), and those that prevent bacterial adhesion to mucosal surfaces (antiadhesion). In response to vaccines, the first antibodies produced are primarily IgM, with a gradual switch to IgG in the following weeks. **Vaccines can be classified as live attenuated vaccines, killed or inactivated vaccines, subunits, or toxoids (tetanus).**
