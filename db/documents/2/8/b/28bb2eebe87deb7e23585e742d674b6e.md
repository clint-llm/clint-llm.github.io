**Imaging**

Chest imaging is a fundamental step in the diagnosis and management of empyema. Despite advances in imaging modalities, plain radiographs still serve as a great screening tool for pleural effusions in patients with pneumonia. Typically, a unilateral, markedly asymmetric pleural effusion with blunting of the costophrenic angle can be appreciated. Smaller volume effusions are detectable with a lateral view X-ray. Decubitus views can be obtained to assess for layering and help quantify an existing effusion. Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scanning, however, have greater sensitivity for fluid detection and provide additional information for determining the extent and nature of the pleural infection.

**Thoracocentesis**

The recommendation is for diagnostic fluid sampling via thoracentesis in all patients with pleural effusions with greater than 2 cm depth on lateral decubitus film or computed tomography, associated with a pneumonic illness, recent chest trauma, surgery or features of ongoing sepsis.

**Other Tests**

Blood cultures are necessary for any patient with empyema. Although generally nondiagnostic, they can help identify causative pathogens and identify bacteremia if results are positive.
