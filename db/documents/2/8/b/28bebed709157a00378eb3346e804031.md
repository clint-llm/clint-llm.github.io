CADASIL should be suspected in patients with a strong family history of early strokes and dementia, keeping in mind that CADASIL is likely under-diagnosed. Though definitive diagnosis is via genetic testing or skin biopsy, a CADASIL scale has been proposed by Pescini et al. as a less expensive initial clinical screening measure.

Alternatively, CADASIL has a somewhat characteristic appearance on MRI, and a radiologist may suggest the diagnosis. Abnormal T2/FLAIR white matter hyperintensities, similar in appearance to those seen with the chronic microvascular disease, are present in CADASIL in the anterior temporal, external capsule, and paramedian superior frontal subcortical white matter. Importantly, these findings are present in younger patients (younger than approximately 60). Though this distribution is reported to be specific for CADASIL, older patients with the severe microvascular disease may have lesions in these locations because they have the diffuse disease. As expected, lacunar or subcortical infarcts can also be seen with CADASIL, which manifest as foci of restricted diffusion on DWI/ADC sequences (bright on diffusion, dark on ADC) typically measuring less than 1.5 cm. Finally, microbleeds are seen with a greater prevalence in CADASIL patients. These are best seen on a T2*-GRE MRI sequence as multiple punctate foci of susceptibility/hypointensity. These findings of lacunar infarcts and microbleeds in younger patients are less specific but suggestive MRI findings.

There are numerous differential considerations to keep in mind. Age-advanced traditional microvascular disease in the setting of diabetes and/or hypertension should be the first consideration. Besides the expected clinical findings, the traditional microvascular disease would not be expected to have the same MRI distribution of lesions. Multiple sclerosis is another consideration with a different MRI appearance and involvement of the optic nerves and spinal cord that would not be expected with CADASIL. Fabry disease is another heritable cause of early-onset microvascular disease and strokes that also features basal ganglia calcifications and is X-linked. Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) is a similar entity to CADASIL that presents with early-onset spinal degenerative disease and hair loss but typically does not feature migraines. More broadly, other causes of strokes and hemorrhage in younger individuals include primary CNS vasculitis, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), inflammatory amyloid angiopathy, venous thrombosis, septic emboli, metastatic disease, and toxic/metabolic exposures. These entities may demonstrate subtly different findings on CT or MRI that are beyond the scope of this discussion. Finally, other heritable conditions such as leukoencephalopathies and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) should be considered.
