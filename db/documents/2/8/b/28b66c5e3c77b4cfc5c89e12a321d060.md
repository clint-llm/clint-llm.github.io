Advances have improved outcomes in treatment; nonetheless, many treated patients have adverse results in visual acuity. One of the goals of treatment is the avoidance of unfavorable retinal structural outcomes, defined by the ETROP study as a posterior retinal fold involving the macula, a retinal detachment involving the macula, retrolental tissue or mass obscuring the view of the posterior pole or vitrectomy or scleral buckling procedure. A follow up to the ETROP study found that at 2 years, unfavorable structural outcomes had been reduced to 9.1% in high-risk pre-threshold eyes treated early.

The 6-year follow up of the same sample found that 34.6% of children had a visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or better, 40.3% had an acuity greater than 20/40 and less than 20/200, andÂ  23.7% had an acuity worse than 20/200 including light perception and blindness.
