The clinical significance of the microanatomy and function of the dermis is a broad and complex topic. Below is a brief list of diseases that involve the dermis. Please note many of these diseases can affect other cutaneous layers and organs of the body. Understanding the normal anatomy and physiology of the dermis is paramount in mastering the cutaneous manifestations of the diseases listed below.

**Structural Disorders**

- Structural disorders of the dermis include inherited and acquired diseases of collagen, elastic tissue, and fibroblasts.

- Solar elastosis
- Actinic, or senile, purpura
- Striae
- Scars, hypertrophic scars, and keloids
- Burns or wounds (e.g., puncture or laceration)
- Dermatofibroma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans
- Morphea
- Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis
- Genetic diseases (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Marfan's syndrome)

**Inflammatory and Autoimmune Disorders**

- Autoimmune blistering diseases (e.g., dermatitis herpetiformis)

- Drug eruption

- Granulomatous disease (e.g., sarcoidosis, granuloma annulare, mycobacterial infections)

- Lichen sclerosis

- Leukemia cutis

- Mastocytosis (e.g., urticaria pigmentosa)

- Polymorphous light eruption

- Sweet syndrome

- Urticaria and eczematous dermatitis

**Depositional Disorders**

- Cutaneous depositional diseases involve the deposition of endogenous or exogenous substances in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.
- Amyloidosis (protein)
- Calcinosis cutis (calcium)
- Gout (uric acid)
- Myxedema (mucopolysaccharides)
- Xanthoma/xanthelasma (cholesterol)
