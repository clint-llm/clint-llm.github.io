Cardiac trauma is best managed by a mutlidisciplinary team that includes the emergency department physician, trauma surgeon, cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, radiologist, the perfusioniost, cardiac nurses and the intensivist. Cardiac trauma is initially managed according to ATLS protocol. Depending on the type of trauma, one may either observe the patient or the patient may need open heart surgery to repair a defect. The prognosis of these patients depends on age, associated trauma, shock at the time of presentation, availability of a cardiac surgeon and mental status on arrival.
