Dyspareunia is usually a treatable disease and doesn't result in major complications. Regardless of the non-malignant nature of the disease, timely management and intervention are crucial to obviate distressing sequelae. If the patients do not seek prompt, appropriate medical care, it can result in loss of sexual interest and problems with relationships. It also results in significant distress and conflicts among the partners.

Psychiatric issues may arise if dyspareunia remains untreated. Psychiatric issues like major depression due to dyspareunia are more prevalent in younger women. In very few cases, fear of pain during sexual activity can result in female infertility.
