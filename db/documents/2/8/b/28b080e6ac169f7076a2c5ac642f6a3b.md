Phenazopyridine has a good safety profile, and severe adverse events are uncommon. Severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects are typically limited to cases of overdose, preexisting renal insufficiency, and exceeding the dosing and duration recommendations.

The following adverse drug reactions have been reported:

- CNS: Headache

- Dermatological: Rash, discoloration, pruritus

- Hypersensitivity: Anaphylactoid-like reaction and/or hypersensitivity hepatitis

- Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea

- Hematologic: Methemoglobinemia, sulfhemoglobinemia, and hemolytic anemia (potential hemolytic agent in G-6-PD deficiency)

- Other: Discoloration of body fluids, aseptic meningitis, visual disturbances, renal/hepatic toxicity associated with overdose, jaundice, and renal calculi

The drug is known to cause methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia, likely through a metabolite, aniline. In cases of hemolytic anemia, microscopic examination of red blood cells will reveal the presence of Heinz bodies and degmacytes(bite cells).

Treatment of drug-induced hemolytic anemia is discontinuing the offending agent and considering the use of corticosteroids.

Cases of hepatitis appear to be associated with dose-related hypersensitivity.****Other adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia and allergic-like skin reactions are rare.
