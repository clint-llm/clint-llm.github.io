In general, symptomatic patients meet indications for surgical reconstruction. When considering tracheal stenosis repair, knowing the Cotton-Myer grade and determining if it is a SSTS or LSTS are critical. These patients have three options for treatment: observation and conservative management, endoscopic surgical repair, and open surgical repair.

**Conservative Observation**

- Poor surgical candidate

- Ventilator dependent due to pulmonary disease

- Asymptomatic mild disease

- The pediatric patient still growing

**Endoscopic Repair**

- Symptomatic mild to moderate disease

- Thin scar band or web

- A stenotic segment of fewer than 1Â or 2 tracheal rings

- Adjunctive procedures following open repair

**Open Repair**

- SSTS and LSTS

- Failed endoscopic repair

- Complete tracheal rings

- Concomitant cardiopulmonary abnormalities requiring repair
