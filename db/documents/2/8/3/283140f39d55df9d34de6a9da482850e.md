Central cord syndrome (Figure 1B) has a bimodal distribution (young and old age groups), mostly affecting males, and accounts for 9.0% of adult spinal cord injuries and 6.6% of pediatric spinal cord injuries.

Anterior spinal cord syndrome is most common in adults as a result of postoperative complications.

Brown-Sequard syndrome is rare, estimated to account for 2 to 4% of spinal cord injuries.
