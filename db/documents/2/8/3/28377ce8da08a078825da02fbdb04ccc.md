The management of left ventricular wall pseudoaneurysm is challenging and complex. While once the domain of the cardiac surgeon, today it is realized that percutaneous transcatheter closure of the left ventricular pseudoaneurysm may be an alternative for patients not able to withstand surgical intervention. It also saves the patient a prolonged hospital stay, a sternotomy scar, and no need for cardiopulmonary bypass.****

To further improve outcomes, an interprofessional team involving the specialty-trained clinicians and nurse should assess the patient preoperatively to determine the patient's candidacy for the procedure. Exceptions occur often in emergent situations. In these situations, it is optimal to review recent imaging if possible. Even in an emergency, a proper assessment of cardiac anatomy must be made to ensure the procedure will not be futile. Ideally, the cardiac team will have time to assess cardiac hemodynamics before initiating PTC of the LVP.

In the post-op period, the role of the nurse and pharmacist is crucial. The patients must be monitored for pain, wound infection, hematoma or hemorrhage, and a variety of common postoperative complications such as atelectasis, deep vein thrombosis, and pain. Pharmacist involvement is essential for parenteral nutrition if complications result. The need for careful planning and discussion with other professionals involved in the management of the patient is strongly recommended to lower the morbidity and improve outcomes. (Level I)

To conclude, the outcomes relative to the procedure are not available yet. Operator experience and volume are important factors, but given the rarity of this condition, even large referral centers have limited experience.
