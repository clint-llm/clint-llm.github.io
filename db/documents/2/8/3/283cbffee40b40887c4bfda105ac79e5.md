Anagen effluvium is a form of nonscarring alopecia commonly associated with chemotherapy. In this disorder, affected anagen hairs suffer a toxic or inflammatory insult, resulting in fracture of the hair shaft. Anagen effluvium is often referred to as chemotherapy-induced alopecia, as it can be triggered by antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and mitotic inhibitors administered as chemotherapeutic therapy. Shedding usually takes place within 14 days of administration of the offending drug, however, in many instances it is reversible, with hair regrowth growth upon discontinuation of the offending agent. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anagen effluvium.
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with anagen effluvium.
- Outline the management options available to patients with anagen effluvium.
- Explain the modalities to improve coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by anagen effluvium.
