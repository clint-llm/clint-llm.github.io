The goal of suprapubic aspiration is to cannulate the urinary bladder with a needle for urine collection. An understanding of anatomy is essential to this procedure. In children and neonates, the urinary bladder is an abdominal organ. Later in life, it moves down into the bony pelvis and assumes a retropubic position.

The bladder lies superior and posterior to the pubic symphysis in young children. The anatomic landmarks that must be first identified in young children are the suprapubic crease and the umbilicus. The practitioner must envision an imaginary line from the umbilicus to the suprapubic crease. The cross-point of this imaginary line at the suprapubic crease level is the needle insertion site.

In adults, the urinary bladder is retropubic. The major anatomic landmark in adults is the pubic symphysis. It is important to recognize that the bladder dome has peritoneal attachments, and cannulation of this area can cause injury such as perforation of the intraperitoneal bladder. Practitioners must be aware of the major vascular structures such as the common iliac and internal iliac arteries that are lateral to the bladder.
