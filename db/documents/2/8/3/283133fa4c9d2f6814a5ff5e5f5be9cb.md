- **Light microscopy-**The glomeruli show hypercellularity (endothelial, mesangial, and inflammatory cells) which are non-specific.

- **Electron microscopy-**The most characteristic finding is the presence of sub-epithelial humps; which are electron-dense deposits in the subepithelial space near the glomerular basement membrane.

- **Immunofluorescence microscopy-**Evidence ofÂ IgG and C3 deposits in the first 2 to 3 weeks of the disease.
