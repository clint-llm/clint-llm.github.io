Establishing correct EDD is paramount in coordinating care between healthcare professionals that include a nurse, laboratory technologists, a pharmacist, and various physicians in different specialties. This will allow timely laboratory testing since most of the pregnancy tests are time-sensitive.

Having accurate birth dating might decrease maternal/fetal morbidity and or mortality through timely consulting with experts in the field of maternal-fetal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, oncology, or genetics. For example,  fetal genetic abnormalities can be detected in a timely fashion providing the mother with sufficient time to make a lifetime decision.
