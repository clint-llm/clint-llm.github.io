Unicameral bone cysts (UBCs) are common benign tumor-like bone lesions. They are also known as simple or solitary bone cysts. Most benign bone tumors have a characteristic appearance on radiographs that can aid in diagnosis and prevent unnecessary additional imaging or invasive diagnostic procedures. Unicameral bone cysts are typically asymptomatic and found on imaging incidentally. However, when symptoms occur, they are usually due to pathologic fractures that cause pain, swelling, or deformity. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with unicameral bone cysts and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the typical presentation of a unicameral bone cyst. 
- Identify radiological features of unicameral bone cysts. 
- Describe when a unicameral bone cyst requires treatment. 
- Summarize a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by unicameral bone cysts.
