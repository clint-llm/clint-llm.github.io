There is no exact data regarding the present prevalence of acrodynia. The disease is mostly seen in infants and young children. Newborn babies and adults are less vulnerable. The condition was prevalent in the first half of the 20 century in Europe, America, and Australia.

In the present, only rare cases of acrodynia with varied presentations are reported in the literature, most of which are related to accidental exposure to mercury in non-occupational settings. Mercury-containing preservatives (thiomersal), calomel containing diaper powders, plant fungicides, anthelmintics, mercury ointments, certain bactericidal agents, alternate, medicine drugs, folk medicines, and interior latex paints pose a hazard of causing mercury toxicity in domestic settings.
