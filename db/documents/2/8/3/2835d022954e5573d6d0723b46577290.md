Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous, non-specific, and highly variable. PTLD can present as a localized or disseminated disease. Malaise, fatigue, fever, and a mononucleosis-like picture are some presenting features of PTLD. B-symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss, as well as lymphadenopathy, are also frequent manifestations. PTLD develops rapidly and may cause compressive symptoms near the tumor site. Patients who are high-risk (EBV IgG Donor+/Recipient-) are generally noted to be at risk for developing PTLD of the transplanted graft causing a decline in organ function. It may be the only presenting symptom. The high index of suspicion for PTLD is necessary given highly variable presentation also rising EBV PCR in post-transplant recipient raises the possibility of PTLD.
