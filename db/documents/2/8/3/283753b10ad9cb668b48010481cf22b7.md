The chemical structure of a CAS contains a steroid nucleus and a 5 or 6-membered lactone ring. Cardenolides, which are 5-membered rings, are mostly from plants, while, bufadienolides, with a 6-membered ring, are mainly animal-based.

CAS primarily serve as inotropic agents in therapeutic settings. Apart from myocytes, they also have effects on vascular smooth muscle and sympathetic nervous system. The primary mechanism of action is the reversible inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which leads to increased intracellular sodium and decreased intracellular potassium levels, leading to the inactivation of sodium-calcium anti-porter pump, which in turn causes an accumulation of calcium intracellularly. This accumulation of intracellular calcium consequently triggers further calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and finally causes increased myocardial contractility. Besides increased inotropy, CAS causes increased vagal tone in SA and AV nodes decreasing conduction in the nodes with a decreased duration of the refractory period, which increases the risk of automaticity and arrhythmias.
