The most common adverse events noticed with the use of vemurafenib are cutaneous manifestations which include but are not limited to nonspecific maculopapular eruptions, hyperkeratosis, and photosensitivity, especially with radiation therapy.

One of the most significant cutaneous adverse events with the use of vemurafenib is skin cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma in approximately up to 30% of cases and, less commonly, the development of new primary melanoma.

Other adverse events include hepatotoxicity, particularly when used when immunotherapy, QT prolongation, arthralgia, and diarrhea are present.

There are some anecdotal reports of Dupuytrenâ€™s contracture and acute pancreatitis developing after the use of vemurafenib.
