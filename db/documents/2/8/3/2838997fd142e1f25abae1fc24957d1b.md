Patients with DSD usually present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), frequently complaining about problems with voiding and/or storage. Symptoms generally include chronic urinary retention, intermittent voiding, and irregular small volume voiding or incontinence without an associated urge to void (reflex incontinence). Neurological symptoms may be predominant and lead to neurological workup initially. DSD is only likely to be found if there is some neurologic disorder affecting the central nervous system.

The history and physical examination aim are to discover the etiology and pattern of bladder dysfunction, to search for complications, and to evaluate for changes in bowel and bladder habits together with any associated neurological symptoms. Clinicians should screen for unseen neurological disease and investigate unexplained vision problems, back or neck pain, weakness, numbness, dysesthesia, and unexplained urinary or bowel symptoms. An abdominal examination is necessary to look for a palpable bladder, retained fecal matter, tenderness, and evidence of past surgeries. Examine the genitalia for any pathology and skin irritation. A digital rectal examination should be done to assess the anal tone at rest and also during voluntary contraction. Perineal sensation should be noted, and various other perineal reflexes should be noted.
