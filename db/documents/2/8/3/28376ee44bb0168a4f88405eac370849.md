The ACC recommends at least two office measurement on at least two separate occasions to diagnose hypertension.

The ESC/ESH recommends three office BP measurements at least 1 to 2 minutes apart, and additional measurements only if the initial two readings differ by greater than or equal to 10mmHg. BP is then recorded as the average of the last two readings.

Both societies endorse the use of higher BP readings and putting patients into higher stage/grade for adequate medical therapy.

The patient should remain seated quietly for at least 5 minutes before taking the blood pressure, and proper technique is necessary. The blood pressure cuff should cover 80% of the arm circumference because larger or smaller pressure cuffs can falsely under-estimate or over-estimate blood pressure readings.

Ambulatory blood pressure measurement is the most accurate method to diagnose hypertension and also aids in identifying individuals with masked hypertension as well as white coat effect.

The evaluation consists of looking for signs of end-organ damage and consists of the following,

- 12 lead ECG (to document left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac rate, and rhythm)

- Fundoscopy to look for retinopathy/ maculopathy

- Blood workup including complete blood count, ESR, creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes, HbA1c, thyroid profile, blood cholesterol levels, and serum uric acid

- Urine albumin to creatinine ratio

- Ankle-brachial pressure index - ABI (if symptoms suggestive of peripheral arterial disease)

- Imaging including carotid doppler ultrasound, echocardiography and brain imaging (where clinically deemed feasible)
