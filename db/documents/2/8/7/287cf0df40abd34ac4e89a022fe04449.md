The human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are gene loci in the major histocompatibility complex class I of genes on chromosome 6, present on all nucleated cells. This activity reviews the varied presentations of HLA-B27 associated syndromes. Diverse disease presentations often require interprofessional approaches to care for patients with HLA-B27 syndromes. Evaluation and management strategies for these diseases are reviewed.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of HLA-B27 associated medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the evaluation of HLA-B27 associated syndromes.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for HLA-B27 associated syndromes. 
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance HLA-B27 associated syndromes and improve outcomes.
