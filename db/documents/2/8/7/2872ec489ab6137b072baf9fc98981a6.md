The prognosis for ureterolithiasis is generally favorable; however, there is evidence that it is associated with other systemic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. As mentioned above, reoccurrence rates are very high at an estimated 39% at 15 years. In patients with recurrent stones, it is prudent to do a full evaluation to try to identify the etiology; thus, lifestyle changes and medication management can be instituted to reduce reoccurrence. There is a large financial burden due to loss of work and emergency department visits due to recurrent nephrolithiasis as well as the complications of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and thus prevention of recurrence is key.
