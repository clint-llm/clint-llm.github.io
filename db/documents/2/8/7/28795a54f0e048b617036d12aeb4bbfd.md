When neoplasia is suspected in the setting of basophilia, the pathologist should contact the clinical team. Recommendations should be clearly communicated and should reflect the peripheral smear findings.  For example, if there is unexplained basophilia with left-shifted neutrophilia, the pathologist may recommend that the clinician order BCR-ABL1 FISH to rule out CML.
