Most varicoceles are discovered incidentally and do not require treatment unless symptomatic.  In patients with infertility, varicoceles offer an opportunity to easily improve sperm count and function which should not be overlooked if present.

Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants should be aware that the best available current evidence indicates that varicocele treatment should be offered to infertile males with a palpable varicocele and abnormal semen parameters. This also agrees with the current American Urological Association and European Association of Urology Guidelines regarding varicocele treatment.  Unfortunately, at this time, there there are no available, randomized prospective trials of sufficient size, duration, and statistical validity to be considered absolutely definitive on the issue of varicocelectomy for male infertility. The best available evidence supports the conclusions, recommendations, and guidelines previously described.

However, multiple studies have shown no significant improvement in pregnancy rates nor sperm counts, morphology, or motility from repairs of sub-clinical varicoceles.

An interprofessional team approach to the evaluation and treatment of this condition will result in the best outcomes.
