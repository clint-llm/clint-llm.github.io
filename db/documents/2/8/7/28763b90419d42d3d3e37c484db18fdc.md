There is a range of diseases that are associated with the intestinal tract, causing alterations in bowel habits. Usually, due to a particular inciting event, patients get changes in the microbes found in the gut, leading to significantly distressing various gut disorders ranging from antibiotic-associated diarrhea to chronic irritable bowel syndrome.

A systematic review was conducted by McFarland and his colleagues to provide the most up-to-date information on the strain specificity of probiotics.Saccharomyces boulardii I-745, three lactobacillus strains (L. acidophilus CL1285 + L. casei Lbc80r + L. rhamnosus CLR2), and Lactobacillus casei.3. The treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections includes many side effects. Strong evidence linked the use of two probiotics, S. boulardii I-745 and the mixture of L. helveticus R52 + L. rhamnosus R11, in offsetting many of the unwanted side effects. The prevention of post-surgical complications occurred with one synbiotic: Pediococcus pentosaceus 5–33:3, Leuconostoc mesenteroides 77:1, L. paracasei ssp. paracasei F19, L. plantarum 2362. One probiotic, S. boulardii CNCM I-745, prevented traveler's diarrhea. Pediatric diarrhea had the most definite link with probiotics, displaying seven different strains found to be preventative.Clostridium difficile, nosocomial infections, respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, and constipation had no definite evidence linked to probiotics.
