The condition is usually detected during the antenatal scan and is not associated with any antenatal complications.

Pediatric ureteropelvic junction obstruction might be associated with other congenital anomalies as an imperforated anus, multicystic kidney, and ipsilateral ureterovesical reflux, in similar patients,Â ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) should be treated first as distal ureteric diseases are commonly not severe.

In cases of the duplex renal system, the lower moiety is more commonly affected, and in this case, ureterovesical reflux is likely to be found and can be diagnosed using voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).

Common symptoms in older children:

- Periodic abdominal pain (loin pain), usually after diuresis

- Vomiting

- Recurrent pyelonephritis

- Fever

- Uncommonly, abdominal mass, or hematuria secondary to infection

Similarly, adults present with symptoms similar to those in the pediatric age group; however, hematuria and chronic loin pain are commonly seen. Usually, it is associated with increased fluid intake, diuresis, as tea and coffee.

On examination, patients will have chronic loin tenderness in association with hematuria; other signs of pyelonephritis might be present as well, like fever and rigors.
