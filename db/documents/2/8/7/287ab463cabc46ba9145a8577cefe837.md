All of the conditions that comprise fetal alcohol spectrum disorders stem from one common cause, which is prenatal exposure to alcohol. Alcohol is extremely teratogenic to a fetus. Its effects are wide-ranging and irreversible. Although higher amounts of prenatal alcohol exposure have been linked to increased incidence and severity of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, there are no studies that demonstrate a safe amount of alcohol that can be consumed during pregnancy. There is also no safe time during pregnancy in which alcohol can be consumed without risk to the fetus. Alcohol is teratogenic during all three trimesters. In summary, any amount of alcohol consumed at any point during pregnancy has the potential cause of irreversible damage that can lead to a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

**Risk Factors**

- Women more than age 30 with a long history of alcohol are more likely to give birth to an infant with fetal alcohol syndrome

- Poor nutrition

- Having one child with fetal alcohol syndrome increases the risk for subsequent children

- Women with genetic susceptibility may metabolize alcohol slowly may be at a higher risk
