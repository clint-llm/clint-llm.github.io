The radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) scan is a non-invasive way of assessing the ventricular function and intracardiac hemodynamics. It assesses the ventricular systolic function precisely with less interobserver variability. Additionally, it can assess the diastolic function, wall motion abnormality, regional contractility of the ventricle. This activity reviews the indication, anatomy and physiology of cardiac cycle, contraindication, adverse reaction, clinical significance, and other key elements of the radionuclide ventriculography. It also highlights the interprofessional team approach for the radionuclide ventriculography.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for using radionuclide ventriculography.
- Summarize the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique used in radionuclide ventriculography.
- Review the potential complications and their clinical significance when using radionuclide ventriculography.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with the radionuclide ventriculography.
