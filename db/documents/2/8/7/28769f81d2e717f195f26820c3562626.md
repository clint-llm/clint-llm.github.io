**Postoperative Management**

The patient should be prescribed topical prednisolone acetate 1%, topical flurbiprofen, topical moxifloxacin or tobramycin, eye ointment atropine 1% in the immediate postoperative period to control inflammation. Intraocular pressure should be monitored digitally, and medication is given if required.  If the patient was on oral corticosteroids or any antimicrobial prophylaxis, the maintenance dose should be continued. The drugs should be tapered gradually as the inflammation subsides. Oral corticosteroid is indicated for eyes with severe inflammation, mainly eyes with panuveitis ( Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, Behcet disease), one-eyed patients. In pseudophakic patients, the accommodation for near vision is lost. Hence once the postoperative ocular condition is stabilized, refractive glasses for near vision should be prescribed to give a better vision to the patient.
