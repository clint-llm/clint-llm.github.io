The surgical procedures associated with afferent loop syndrome have historically taken place in the treatment of gastric/duodenal ulcer disease and distal gastric cancer. With the advent and widespread availability of acid suppression medications and antibiotics for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori, fewer patients require surgical management of benign gastric disease. Thus, the overall incidence of afferent loop syndrome has declined in recent years. However, the incidence of gastric carcinoma remains high in some geographic regions, including China and Japan.

With the increased prevalence of morbid obesity, recent decades have seen increased numbers of patients undergoing bariatric surgeries. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was once the most common bariatric procedure in North America, though sleeve gastrectomy has become more common in recent years.

Up to 1% of patients who undergo partial gastrectomy with Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstruction will experience afferent loop syndrome.

While the majority of patients present in the early postoperative period,Â the diagnosis should not be excluded in those with remote surgical histories. There are multiple case reports of afferent loop syndrome presenting a decade or more following gastrectomy.
