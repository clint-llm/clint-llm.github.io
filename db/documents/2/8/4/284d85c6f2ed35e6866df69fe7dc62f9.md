**External snapping hip syndrome**

In most cases, patients are minimally, if not completely, asymptomatic from the clinical condition.

In the setting of persistent pain despite exhaustion of all nonoperative treatment modalities (therapy, activity modification, injection of corticosteroid), surgical consideration is warranted.

Surgical techniques for painful external snapping hip syndrome include open versus endoscopic ITB z-plasty and excision of the greater trochanteric bursa.  A successful z-plasty lengthening procedure can have excellent outcomes when performed appropriately (in either the open or endoscopic setting).

**Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS)**

Similar to snapping hip syndrome, ITBS most often improves with nonoperative management modalities alone.  In painful, recalcitrant cases, however, several techniques have been described:

- Lateral bursal excision/synovial recess debridement (arthroscopic versus open)

- ITB z-plasty

- Similar to the aforementioned procedure at the hip, an analogous procedure can be performed distally over the lateral femoral condylar area of irritation

- Elliptical surgical excision

- An incision is made over the ITB at the lateral distal femur with incision of the posterior ITB at the lateral femoral epicondyle
- Typically, there is excision of a 2cm x 4cm area of tissue
