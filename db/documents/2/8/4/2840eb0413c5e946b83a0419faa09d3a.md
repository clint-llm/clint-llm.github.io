There are limitations in available diagnostics when evaluating nickel toxicity. Diagnosis begins with clinical suspicion obtained through detailed patient history. Acute toxicityÂ is more commonly seen in inhalation and ingestion. Symptoms associated with respiratory impairment and gastrointestinal upset can be seen. Nickel is distributed in different organs and body fluids, but the primary analysis is through serum and urine samples.

The average serum concentration of nickel is typically around 0.3 mcg/L in individuals without excessive exposure. However, in cases of significant exposure, such as occupational or environmental exposure, serum concentrations can reach as high as 8 mcg/L. When assessing nickel exposure, urine nickel levels are also considered. A urine nickel concentration greater than 10 mg/dL may indicate excessive exposure and requires intervention or further evaluation.

Case reports have documented specific radiographic findings on chest x-rays in individuals with nickel exposure. These findings may include pleural effusion, irregular linear shadows, and nodular mottling. These radiographic changes can be suggestive of lung involvement and should raise suspicion for potential nickel toxicity. Furthermore, abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings have been observed in some cases of nickel exposure. These ECG abnormalities may include sinus tachycardia (an abnormally fast heart rate originating from the sinus node) and myocardial injury, which can be reflected by ST segment and T wave changes. These cardiac manifestations indicate potential cardiovascular involvement and should be considered in the evaluation and management of individuals exposed to nickel****

Patch testing is a valuable tool in the evaluation of patients with dermatitis. It is particularly useful when there is a clinical suspicion of contact dermatitis and further investigation is required to identify or confirm the causative substance. During a patch test, diluted allergens are applied to the patient's skin, usually on the back, using adhesive patches. The test allows for an extended period of contact between the allergens and the skin, typically 48 hours. After the designated time, the patches are removed, and the skin is carefully examined for allergic reactions, such as erythema, edema, or a characteristic rash.

One commonly used patch test is the dimethylglyoxime spot test, which can be obtained over the counter. This test specifically aids in the identification of nickel allergy by applying dimethylglyoxime to the skin and observing the development of a pink coloration as a positive reaction. Patch testing plays a crucial role in diagnosing contact dermatitis, guiding appropriate treatment, and helping patients avoid exposure to allergens
