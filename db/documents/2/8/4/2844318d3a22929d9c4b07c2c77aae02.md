Airway monitoring involves assessing both a patient’s ventilatory function and ability to perform the adequate gas exchange. Determining a patient’s airway status is part of a thorough physical exam and interpretation of appropriate adjunct monitors. Like many tools in medicine, monitors provide valuable information to guide the diagnosis and management of patient care. However, they have their limitations and are subject to interpretation. Various airway monitoring modalities will be described and their function and limitations.
