The most common methods of diagnostic investigation include probing, irrigation, and washing of the lacrimal system and radiological methods with dacryocystography or nuclear scintigraphy.

At first presentation, gentle probing of the fistula orifice is performed in an office setting, with subsequent irrigation. The fluorescein dye disappearance test may be used in children, which would generally be uncompliant to probing and irrigation.

In an uncommon clinical setting, as described by several studies, more advanced techniques have been used, including dacryocystoendoscopy, computerized tomography with contrast media injected within the lacrimal system, and casting with polyvinyl siloxane. The latter method is quite uncommon, but according to some reports, it may help create three-dimensional models of the lacrimal system. In some cases, the dacryocystoendoscope aids in visualizing the normal lacrimal anatomy and positioning a silicone drainage tube, thus facilitating eventual fistula excision.

In some reports, methylene blue has been suggested to trace the fistula's path, especially during surgery.
