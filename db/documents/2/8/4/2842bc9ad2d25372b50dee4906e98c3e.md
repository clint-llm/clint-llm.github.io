Tooth eruption is the movement of theÂ developing tooth from its non-functional position in the alveolar bone to its final functional position in the oral cavity (occlusal plane).

In general, teeth eruption involves bone remodeling mechanisms regulated by the dental follicle. The dental follicle regulates the metabolic changes in alveolar bone that mediate tooth eruption (bone formation and resorption) and gives rise to the periodontal ligament (believed to contribute to tooth eruption in the supraosseous stage).****The beginning of eruptive movements coincides with the start of****root formation.
