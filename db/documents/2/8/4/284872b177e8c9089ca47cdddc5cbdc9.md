The prognosis of CM-II is variable, dependent on the extent of the malformations and the patient's symptoms. Typically the symptoms of the patient are improved after surgery, though results vary from patient to patient. If nerve damage was present prior to the surgery, this could be long-term and difficult to treat. Some patients may require repeat surgeries. Large retrospective studies have demonstrated postoperative stabilization or improvement for the majority of patients.
