Management is mainly a multidisciplinary approach. It is vital to counsel family regarding the immediate and long-term effects of treatment. Surgery is preferred as soon as it is practical on large meningoceles. In suspected central nervous system infection or meningitis, treatment is started with prophylactic antibiotics and anticonvulsants immediately. Patients require monitoring in the neonatal intensive care unit with an assessment of electrolytes and blood counts. Consider blood grouping and cross-match for possible transfusion.

The association of meningocele with tethered cord syndrome is high. MRI is essential for the diagnosis of meningocele. Active surgical treatment is suggested immediately after definite diagnosis. During surgery, the surgeon should explore the spinal canal and release the tethered cord after repairing the protruded meninges.
