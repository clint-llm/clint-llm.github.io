The nasal choanae are paired openings that connect the nasal cavity with the nasopharynx. Choanal atresia is a congenital condition in which these openings are occluded by membranous soft tissue, bone, or a combination of both due to failed recanalization of the nasal fossae during fetal development. If unilateral, it presents with unilateral mucopurulent discharge. If bilateral, the neonate is unable to breathe. Since newborns are obligate nasal breathers, establishing an airway is an acute otolaryngologic emergency. The interprofessional team should promptly recognize this condition to avoid severe morbidity and mortality.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the presenting features of unilateral versus bilateral choanal atresia.
- Describe how choanal atresia is diagnosed.
- Explain how and when to implement acute and definitive management of choanal atresia.
- Explain how the interprofessional team can work collaboratively to prevent the potentially profound complications of choanal atresia by applying knowledge about the presentation, evaluation, and management of this disease.
