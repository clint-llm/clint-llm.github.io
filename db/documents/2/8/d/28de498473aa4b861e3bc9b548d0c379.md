Although physicians commonly utilize screening instruments to identify cognitive problems and psychological issues in patients with various neurological etiologies, situations frequently arise when referral to a neuropsychologist is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.

Clinical neuropsychologists are doctoral level health care providers who have specialized training in brain-behavior relationships and perform comprehensive evaluations in addition to providing certain forms of treatment. Therefore, cognitive screening tests can be useful to indicate the need for a consult with a neuropsychologist for further, more formal, and comprehensive examinations.
