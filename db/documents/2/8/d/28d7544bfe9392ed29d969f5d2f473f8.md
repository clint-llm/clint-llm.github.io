Bacterial endophthalmitis necessitates prompt and early management with intraocular antibiotics, often combined with a pars plana vitrectomy. Patients should be hospitalized and have broad-spectrum intravenous, topical, and potentially intravitreal antibiotics initiated after collecting the appropriate cultures. The antibiotic of choice should be determined once the etiology of the infection is verified, and once cultures come back, the clinician can make appropriate changes to antibiotic therapy. Patients should receive topical cycloplegic such as atropine 1% twice daily and topical prednisolone acetate 1% every 1 to 6 hours. Intravitreal antibiotics offer higher intraocular concentrations of antibiotics and can be a consideration if they cover the correct etiology. Intravitreal antibiotics include ceftazidime 2.2 mg, vancomycin 1 mg, and amikacin 0.4 mg. The susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was highest to vancomycin. Pars plana vitrectomy is beneficial because it reduces the infective and inflammatory load as well as providing material for diagnostic studies.

Periocular injections or subtenon injections can also be options if necessary.Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed in order by Aspergillus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
