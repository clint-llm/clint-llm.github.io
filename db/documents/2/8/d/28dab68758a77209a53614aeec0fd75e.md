Malakoplakia is a very rare inflammatory condition that typically occurs in immunocompromised individuals. Case reports from the literature have reported successful treatment with antibiotics, surgical excision, or a combination of both. Large randomized controlled studies do not exist for any specific treatments. Given that malakoplakia can affect nearly every organ system, this condition is best handled with anÂ interprofessional team approach. Such a team may include the provider managing the immunosuppressive condition or regimen (such as an infectious disease specialist, rheumatologist, primary clinician, oncologist, or transplant clinician), dermatologist, surgeon, and pharmacist.

The initial provider may work in coordination with the pharmacist to decide upon the ideal immunosuppressive regimen. When malakoplakia is suspected, a dermatologist or surgeon may be consulted to perform a biopsy. Depending on the location and complexity of the lesion(s), an infectious disease specialist, dermatologist, and/or surgeon may be needed to maximize the management of the malakoplakia. Identifying and treating patients who are at risk early, and keeping malakoplakia on the differential may reduce morbidity.
