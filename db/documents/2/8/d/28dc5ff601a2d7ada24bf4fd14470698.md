The conus medullaris receives vascular supply via the following vessels-

- The anterior spinal artery, which traverses the anterior median fissure and ends at the filum terminale.

- Two posterior spinal arteries; these traverse the posterolateral aspect of the spinal cord along with the posterior nerve roots.

- One or two small arteries arise from the anterior spinal artery and circumferentially connect it with the posterior spinal arteries at the lower end of the cord, this is called the arterial basket of the conus medullaris. This structure is frequently involved in arteriovenous fistulas and malformations of the conus.

- Radicular arteries: 8 anterior and 12 posterior arteries form longitudinal arterial trunks along with the anterior and posterior spinal arteries and supply the corresponding nerve roots. The anterior arteries at the T1 and T11 segmental levels are very large, termed the arteries of Adamkiewicz, which supply the lumbosacral region of the cord. These radicular arteries are clinically important as they are end arteries, and occlusion leads to spinal cord ischemia.

- The artery of Desproges-Gotteron is an uncommon anatomic variant that arises from the iliolumbar artery, courses along the L5 or S1 nerve roots up to the conus, and anastomoses with the conal basket.
