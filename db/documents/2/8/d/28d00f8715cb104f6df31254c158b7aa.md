The reported incidence of Caplan syndrome is 1 in every 100,000 people, with a decline in incidence due to a decrease in exposure to coal, asbestos, and silica material. Silica exposure in particular is related to higher prevalence. The first epidemiologic study undertaken by the pneumoconiosis research unit observed an increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among men with progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). Miall et al. found no increased prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis in miners when compared to a community where PMF and rheumatoid arthritis were prevalent and therefore concluded that the etiology of RA was not associated with exposure to dust or lung changes of complicated pneumoconiosis. There was a high prevalence rate of PMF and tuberculosis among miners and ex-miners with rheumatoid arthritis.
