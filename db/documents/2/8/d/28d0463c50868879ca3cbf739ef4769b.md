The only absolute contraindication to a D&C is the desire to maintain a viable intrauterine pregnancy.

There are relative contraindications that should be contemplated to determine if the procedure should be performed in the outpatient clinical setting or the operating room. For example, depending on your facility, patients with bleeding diatheses or takingÂ anticoagulant medications could potentiate a problem in the outpatient setting.

In general, first-trimester abortions performed on anticoagulated patients are considered safe and incur similar amounts of bleeding compared with patients not on anticoagulants.

In the setting of a suspected molar pregnancy, the D&C should be performed in the operating room in order to control anesthesia complications and the potential for severe hemorrhage. A scheduled or elective D&C should be delayed in a patient with an active pelvic infection. However, in the circumstance of a septic abortion or endometritis with possible retained products of conception, the surgeon should proceed with uterine evacuation.
