Type A and Type C toxins are known to cause human disease. Type A is responsible for most C. perfringens-associated food poisoning and non-foodborne diarrheal disease. According to CDC epidemiology surveillance data for foodborne disease outbreaks, C. perfringens accounts for 5% of outbreaks, 10% of illnesses, and 4% of hospitalizations.

Type C has been associated with endemic enteritis necroticans in post-World War II Germany from 1944 to 1949 and in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, named Darmbrand and Pigbel, respectively.
