The hyaline vascular type has an increased number of lymphoid follicles with a broad mantle zone and hypoplastic germinal center. Centrally placed germinal center is surrounded with small lymphocytes arranged in concentric circles, forming an "onion skin-like" structure. The center of these follicles is penetrated by hyalinized capillaries resembling a "lollipop" (also known as the lollipop sign). Strong endothelial vascular proliferation and hyalinization in the interfollicular zones along with a varying number of small lymphocytes and immature plasma cells, and prominent follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) occasionally appearing dysplastic can be seen.

A high number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells can be found around these lesions. Mature lymphocyte infiltration can be observed in plasma cell CD with maintained mantle zone and germinal zone proportions. The interfollicular zones are filled with mature plasma cells and are less vascular than HV-CD. Sometimes irregular aggregates of polyclonal plasmablasts can be seen in the mantle zone of B-lymphocytes.

The mixed type has the characteristics of both HV-CD and the plasma cell type. HHV-8 associated CD manifests as significant proliferation of angiogenesis between the lymphoid follicles with unclear boundaries and immature plasmablasts that might have restricted lambda light chains in specific immunoglobulins.
