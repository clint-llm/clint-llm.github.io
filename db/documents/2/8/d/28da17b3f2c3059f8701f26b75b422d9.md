There is a clear distinction between a group of individuals working together and a team. Improving patient outcomes revolve around improving teamwork. The effectiveness of team performance in improving outcomes holds a shred of solid evidence in cardiac care. The most frequent contributor to adverse events is a lack of communication and teamwork. Team training and debriefing have been crucial in decreasing mortality to minimize the rate of adverse events.

One of the many interventions ensuring multidisciplinary collaboration is the checklist, which has gained attention for improving patient safety. Substantial evidence supports the implementation of surgery checklists and other specialties.

It is not about utilizing tools to improve quality endeavors but how these tools produce awareness, engage team members, provide feedback and pursue progress. The primary purpose of implementing checklists, safety protocols, and process maps are to help healthcare professionals function as a team and improve patient outcomes.
