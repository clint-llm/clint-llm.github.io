The Children’s Hepatic Tumors International Collaboration (CHIC) constructed a staging and risk stratification system intended to standardize the assessment of this tumor across the globe. This new staging system is called the Children’s Hepatic Tumors International Collaboration – Hepatoblastoma Stratification and incorporates confirmed prognostic factors from prior risk stratification systems with new additional factors to stratify patients into 4 risk groups.

Found to be most predictive are AFP levels, patient age, Pretreatment Extent of Disease (PRETEXT) group (I, II, III, or IV), the presence of metastases, and PRETEXT annotation factor. PRETEXT group is based on the extent of the tumor in the liver. PRETEXT annotation factor is determined to be positive if at least 1 of the following 5 factors are present: involvement of the vena cava or all 3 hepatic veins, or both (V); involvement of portal bifurcation or both right and left portal veins, or both (P); extrahepatic contiguous tumor extension (E); multifocal liver tumor (F); tumor rupture at diagnosis (R). Gender, low birth weight, prematurity, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome were not found to be significant. Of note, the histologic type was not included in this risk stratification system but may be incorporated at a future date. Validation of these risk groups is in progress.
