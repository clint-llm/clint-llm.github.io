Lifestyle medicine is a branch of evidence-based healthcare emphasizing disease prevention over curative medicine. Contemporary medicine follows the same basic approach to the clinical encounter: data-gathering, conducting any needed tests, providing the patient with a treatment plan, and possibly a referral or hospital admission. This approach can be described as essentially end-stage care. The modern character of healthcare has neglected prevention. Patients often receive little or no practical education on disease prevention. Studies employing direct observation of primary care practices have reported that preventive care has been underemphasized.

The reasons for this may be varied, with some suggesting that too much time is required to provide the information needed by the typical patient visit.

The cost of healthcare in the United States has become prohibitive. At the time of this publication, it is estimated that the cost to provide care to the average adult is over $13,000 annually in the US.

Chronic diseases include heart disease, Alzheimer disease, type II diabetes, cancer, stroke, and other similar disease processes. The United States is the outlier of all countries in healthcare expenditures, spending far more per capita as a function of GDP (gross domestic product).
