The middle layer of the eyeball, called the vascular tunic, is composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. In the anterior section of the vascular tunic, the choroid becomes the ciliary body. It extends from a jagged margin of the retina to a point just behind the junction of the sclera and the cornea. The jagged anterior portion at which the ciliary body begins is called the ora serrata. The ciliary body appears as dark brown because of the melanocytes that it produces. Furthermore, it consists of ciliary processes and ciliary muscles. The ciliary processes are protrusions on the internal surface of the ciliary body. These protrusions, or folds, contain blood capillaries that secrete aqueous humor. Extending from the ciliary processes are zonular fibers. These fibers act as suspensory ligaments that attach to the lens. The zonular fibers are in contact with the ciliary muscle, which is a circular band of smooth muscle that controls the tightness of the zonular fibers. The ciliary muscle alters the tightness of the zonular fibers by contracting and relaxing, thereby altering the shape of the lens and leading to the adaptation to near or far vision.
