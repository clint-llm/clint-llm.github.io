Delirium is multifactorial and has various predisposing and precipitating factors.

On the other hand, dementia is a neurogenerative process that occurs due to the accumulation of tau protein, beta-amyloid, or alpha-synuclein or due to multiple vascular insults to the brain. It is usually sporadic, sometimes genetic such as the APOE e4 allele for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and seldomly due to prion infections as in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
