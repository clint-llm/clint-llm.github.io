The overall differential for abdominal pain constitutes the differential for acute pancreatitis. It can be significantly narrowed down to a specific diagnosis with a good history and physical examination described above. Differential diagnoses for acute pancreatitis include but are not limited to the following:

- Peptic ulcer disease

- Cholangitis

- Cholecystitis

- Bowel obstruction

- Bowel perforation

- Mesenteric ischemia

- Acute hepatitis

- Diabetic ketoacidosis

- Basilar pneumonia

- Myocardial infarction

- Aortic dissection

- Renal colic

In many cases of abdominal pain, a lipase level three times the upper limit of normal allows for the diagnosis of pancreatitis as the source of abdominal pain due to its high specificity. An abdominal ultrasound helps to differentiate cholecystitis, whereas high suspicion of mesenteric ischemia warrants a CT angiogram. In high-risk patients, the cardiac source should be concurrently ruled out as it can present atypical epigastric pain. Though the pain of a progressing aortic dissection is more severe and tearing in nature, it should be considered due to its particularly urgent nature.
