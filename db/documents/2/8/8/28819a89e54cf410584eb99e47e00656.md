Given the variable clinical presentation and difficulty in clinical diagnosis, the exact prevalence of the disease is not known. The diagnosis is frequently missed, and it is difficult to estimate the true incidence and prevalence of acute myocarditis. Acute myocarditis is more common in younger adults and appears to affect both sexes and various races equally.

According to the Global Burden of the Disease report (2019), the estimated rate of the disease is 6.1 per 100,000.

It is also estimated that the myocardium is involved in up to 5% of patients who develop an acute viral illness. In patients presenting with angina-like symptoms, mildly elevated Troponin-I, and absence of coronary artery disease, the prevalence of myocarditis by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is 13%.
