Bruton agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, is an inherited immunodeficiency disorder. It is characterized by the absence of mature B cells which in turn leads to severe antibody deficiency and recurrent infections. It can manifest in an infant as soon as the protective effect of maternal immunoglobulins wanes at around six months of age. This activity reviews Bruton agammaglobulinemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its evaluation and management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common presenting features of Bruton agammaglobulinemia.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Bruton agammaglobulinemia.
- Describe how to counsel a patient with Bruton agammaglobulinemia.
- Examine interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients with Bruton agammaglobulinemia.
