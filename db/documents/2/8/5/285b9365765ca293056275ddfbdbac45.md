The lymphatic system can easily be overlooked, but it has a drastic impact on the immune system. This mesh of tissues and organs exports toxins, waste, and unnecessary materials via lymph fluid out of the body. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is used to treat somatic dysfunctions. This activity outlines lymphatic osteopathic manipulation treatment (OMT) and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo lymphatic OMT.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the lymphatic OMT treatment considerations for patients with somatic dysfunctions involving the lymphatic system.
- Explain how to counsel a patient with somatic dysfunctions involving the lymphatic system on indications and contraindications for OMT.
- Review the anatomy involved in treatment considerations for patients with lymphatic somatic dysfunctions.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients considering or receiving lymphatic OMT.
