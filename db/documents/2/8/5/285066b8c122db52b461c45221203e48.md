The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and the lingual nerve (LN) are branches of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The IAN supplies somatic sensory innervation to the chin, lower lip, lower vestibular gingiva, molars, premolars, and alveolar bone. The LN supplies somatic sensory innervation to the lingual oral gingiva and the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

Even though it is comparatively uncommon, these nerves can be damaged during procedures performed near the mandible or the lower face; certain mandibular fractures and tumors may also injure these nerves. Patients with these injuries can experience significant discomfort during daily activities such as chewing, eating, and speaking. Healthcare providers, especially dental professionals, should be able to identify and properly manage these injuries to minimize the risk of permanent neurosensory deficits.
