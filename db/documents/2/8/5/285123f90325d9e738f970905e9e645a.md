The attending hyperbaric medicine specialist will prescribe the time, the pressure and the breathing gas in a treatment table for the patient (and if the treatment is scheduled in a multi-place chamber, they will also plan the dive profile for the inside attendants). Common treatment tables for acute traumatic peripheral ischemia are 2 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 2 hours or 2.4 ATA for 90 minutes. The number of treatment tables that have been suggested varies by type of injury. For preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury, a single treatment may be sufficient. For crush injuries, a much more aggressive schedule of 8 treatments (1 treatment 3 times a day for 2 days, the twice a day for 2 days followed by once a day for another 2 days) may be required. For an impending compartment syndrome, 3 treatments (2 twice a day on the first day and 1 on the second day) are recommended. While any established compartment syndrome requires a fasciotomy, hyperbaric oxygen may still be useful following the fasciotomy to treat residual concerns such asÂ tissue ischemia, massive swelling or nerve injury and may require twice daily treatments for up to 7 days.
