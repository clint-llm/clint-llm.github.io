Cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational therapy, and psychotherapy are necessary for treatment and to avoid remission. Unfortunately, barriers often prevent or deter health professionals from getting the help they need.

**Barriers to Deterrence, Identification, and Treatment for Individuals**

Barriers can make it challenging for health professionals to seek help for alcohol and drug addiction. These include:

- The belief they can stop the substance use on their own

- Concern over being labeled with a substance use disorder

- Concern over loss of confidentiality

- Concern over loss of license

- Denial of substance use

- Embarrassment

- Fear of criminal prosecution

- Fear of social stigma

- Lack of understanding of disease

- Lack of understanding of treatment available

- Lack of understanding of how to obtain assistance

- Reduced employment opportunities once diagnosed and public.

- Scared to expose themselves

- Unaware of alternative treatment programs that avoid public discipline

- Unwillingness to seek help

**Barriers to Deterrence and Identification by Peers**

- Belief addiction is not a disease.

- Danger and concern over retaliation

- Denial

- Easy to explain behavior as an error and not attribute it to impairment

- Embarrassment if wrong

- A false belief that the appearance of a person that uses substances is always disheveled

- Fear of social stigma of reporting a peer

- Not aware of the risk factors

- Poor attitudes about the success of treatment programs

- Reluctant to report if not 100% sure

- Unsure if stress versus impairment

- Unsure of consequences to a peer such as loss of license and job

- Unsure of reporting requirements
