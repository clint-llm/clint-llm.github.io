This procedure uses the most cephalad rib as the main rib. The physician uses respiratory attempts and supplementary inhalation muscles to aid with treatment. In supine position:

- Stand on the opposite side of the compromised rib and plant your thenar eminence on top of the most medial aspect of that rib aiming the costotransverse articulation;

- Clutch the ASIS on the compromised ribâ€™s side with your other hand;

- Push the costotransverse articulation anterolaterally by inclining onto it while pulling the ASIS posteriorly;

- Request the patient to take a deep breath and exhale afterward. At maximum exhalation, apply a brief and quick thrust on the rib in an anterolateral direction;

- Reexamine rib mobility.
