Pancreatic head cancer and cholangiocarcinoma result in obstructive jaundice. Although benign diseases may be the cause of obstructive jaundice, they still have deleterious effects if not treated promptly, as obstructive jaundice would lead to hepatocellular dysfunction, biliary cirrhosis and increases the incidence of cholangitis.

Occlusion of the biliary stent is a common complication caused by sludge in plastic or metal stents or by tissue overgrowth in self-expanding metal stents (SEMSs). Bacteria have the ability to deconjugate bilirubin, producing bilirubinate salt that may lead to stent occlusion. To prevent bacterial adhesion, a double-layer plastic stent with no side holes and with an internal coating of perfluoroalkoxy material was developed. Several plastic stent models have side holes at both ends to continue drainage if the tip of the stent is clogged; however, these side holes may favor sludge formation. Adding an antireflux valve or use of different coatings on stent surface are ways to avoid stent occlusion.

Dislodgment of the stent is another common complication as many of the covered SEMSs are smooth, thus causing little adherence to the bile duct walls. This complication is lessened through stents with multiple anchoring side flaps and with no side holes. These stents with multiple side flaps are known as “Tannenbaum” stents, German for "firtree."
