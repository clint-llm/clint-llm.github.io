Locoregional anesthesia must be performed by qualified anesthesia and resuscitation personnel capable of managing the complications. For some nerve blocks, sedation is recommendedÂ depending on the patient's stress level.

The assistance of a nurse trained in regional anesthesia is beneficial to assist the anesthesiologist with proper procedure performance and patient sedation management if necessary.
