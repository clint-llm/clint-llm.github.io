Diabetes is one of the most common medical illnesses, with a 12% prevalence among the US population 18 years or older. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), encompassing a broad array of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, is the most common cause of mortality among the US adult population. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) encompasses the spectrum of coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). ASCVD and diabetes are closely linked with each other. Due to the sheer burden of these diseases, there are national guidelines for screening, prevention, diagnosis, and secondary prevention of complications. This activity will discuss briefly screening and early management of diabetes by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify risk factors for developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease among adults.
- Outline screening recommendations for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in primary care.
- Review national guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
- Explain adverse outcomes in the affected population.
