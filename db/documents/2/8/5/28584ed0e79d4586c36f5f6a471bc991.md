Early diagnosis and timely management of ptosis help in the prevention of amblyopia and postural abnormality in children. Any child presenting with unilateral or bilateral ptosis should be evaluated thoroughly to differentiate the type of ptosis: simple congenital ptosis, congenital ptosis associated with superior rectus dysfunction, ptosis associated with blepharophimosis syndrome, and congenital synkinetic ptosis. This differentiation of the type of ptosis is necessary as the management of each entity is different.

Ideally, cases of unilateral mild to moderate ptosis without any permanent postural abnormality should be operated on at 3 to 4 years of age. By that time, the muscles are strong enough to withstand the surgical trauma, accurate measurement of ptosis is possible, and precise post-operative follow-up is possible. Cases of bilateral severe ptosis should be operated on early to avoid amblyopia and permanent chin elevation position. Parents are advised to take sequential photographs of the child at timely intervals to get an idea about the duration, severity, and progression of ptosis. By the time the child is fit for surgical correction, crutch glasses or tapes could be used to temporarily elevate the upper eyelid, although this is rarely used now.
