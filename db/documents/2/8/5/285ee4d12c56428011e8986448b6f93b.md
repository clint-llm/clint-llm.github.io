Prostaglandin I2 and the COX-2 system is found widely in the body, so the effects of regulation are diverse, and many have not yet been adequately studied.

The induction of the arachidonic acid pathway via inflammatory mediators is well-described: phospholipases (especially A2) cleave arachidonic acid from sources including the cellular membrane, and arachidonic acid is then acted on by cyclo-oxygenase enzymes that convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandins which enter circulation.

Prostaglandin I2 is the most potent known natural inhibitor of platelet aggregation and found in most mammals that use platelet mediated thrombosis for blood clotting.

Prostaglandin I2 also provides potent vasodilatory effects by acting on smooth muscle as a relaxant. COX-2 and its corresponding PGI-Synthase are upregulated in hypoxia to promote a vasodilatory response.

Prostaglandin I2 also appears to play a regulatory role in immune cells, exerting a protective effect on organs from immune-mediated injury. However, many of these pathways have not been adequately explored.
