Traumatic muscular hematomas will typically resolve spontaneously. However, if a patient does develop a hematoma as a result of a trauma, the patient may benefit from evaluation from a trained medical provider to assess for other injuries. Patients who develop a spontaneous muscular hematoma should be evaluated by a healthcare professional who can carefully weigh the risks and benefits of all treatment options. Anticoagulation therapy should only be stopped by a clinician who knows all medical comorbidities in play, as decisions in management are determined on a case-by-case basis.
