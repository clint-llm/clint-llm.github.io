As this is a newly termed condition, little is known regarding the epidemiology of this syndrome; however, case reports indicate a higher prevalence in elderly individuals with both underlying cardiac and renal impairment. The risk of developing this complication increases further when the patient is on multiple AV nodal blockers. ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers also increase the risk as these medications increase the likelihood of developing an acute kidney injury as well as hyperkalemia.
