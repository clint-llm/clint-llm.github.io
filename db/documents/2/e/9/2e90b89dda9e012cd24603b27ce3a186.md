The most common form of blepharospasm, benign essential blepharospasm, is the etiology where the epidemiology has been studied. The mean annual incidence is about 0.10%, with a peak incidence in the 50-60 year age group (0.19%). It is only slightly more prevalent in females (0.12%) than males (0.07%).

Risk factors include a high level of urbanization and certain occupations. There are several co-morbidities associated, which include dyslipidemia, parasomnias, psychiatric (depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder), dry eye-related diseases (idiopathic or related to Sjögren's syndrome), and to a lesser degree, Parkinson's disease and rosacea.
