Diagnosis of the bullous pemphigoid relies on the clinical scenario and laboratory tests. Histology with direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies aid in diagnosis.

Histology will show a subepidermal split with a superficial perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and numerous eosinophils. Spongiosis and superficial papillary dermal infiltrate of eosinophils without vesiculation characterize urticarial lesions and may provide a clue to the dermatopathologist for diagnosing urticarial or pre-bullous pemphigoid.

Direct immunofluorescence involves directly detecting tissue bound autoantibodies and is the gold standard of evaluation in autoimmune blistering diseases. It is necessary to biopsy the site of the skin lesion for direct immunofluorescence. At least two punch biopsies should be obtained at the time of evaluation: one for hematoxylin and eosin staining and another using perilesional, uninvolved skin for direct immunofluorescence. DIF pattern for bullous pemphigoid demonstrates deposition of C3 and IgG in a linear homogeneous pattern at the basement membrane zone.

ELISA testing to detect antibodies to the NC16A domain of BP180, also known as BPAG2, is available and has a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 98%. Autoantibodies to BP180 and BP230 may be identified in normal subjects without bullous pemphigoid, but they will not bind to the NC16A domain.

The clinical predictors of bullous pemphigoid were described in a report from the French Bullous Study Group in 1998. They suggested that patients with a subepidermal blistering disorder associated with linear deposits of IgG or C3 along the epidermal basement membrane without skin atrophy, mucosal or head, and neck involvement, and older than 70 years strongly supports a diagnosis of BP. Their reports stated three out of four diagnostic criteria have a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 83%.
