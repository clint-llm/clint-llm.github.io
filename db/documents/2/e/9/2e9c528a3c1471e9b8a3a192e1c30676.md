Mifepristone is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4; thus, medications that are CYP3A4 inhibitors can result in higher concentrations of mifepristone in the patient. Also, for patients taking multiple doses of mifepristone, for instance, in managing hyperglycemia in Cushing syndrome, the half-life of the medication is reported to be around 85 hours. During this time, the significant symptoms to watch for are cardiogenic. Hypokalemia is very common due to the effects of cortisol on unopposed mineralocorticoid receptors.
