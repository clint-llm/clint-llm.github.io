Conjugated estrogen and bazedoxifene is a combination drug regimen strongly considered, in parallel with bisphosphonates, as the first line of treatment for postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporosis, hot flashes, or night sweats. The recommended dosage for this medication consists of 20 mg bazedoxifene, and 0.45 mg conjugated estrogen consumed via oral administration once daily. This pharmaceutical agent is usually available as a 30-day supply, with the average treatment duration lasting around two years.

In most cases, women are instructed to take this medication with supplemental calcium 600 mg or vitamin D. It is strongly advised not to exceed the dosage threshold, which constitutes not taking more than one tablet within 24 hours. If the patient missed a previous dose, the clear instructions are to take the oral medication as soon as possible, without regard to the timing of meals.
