The suboccipital region consists of four major muscles: the rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis superior, rectus capitis posterior minor, and obliquus capitis inferior.

Within this muscle group is the suboccipital triangle, consisting of rectus capitis posterior major, rectus capitis posterior minor, and obliquus capitis superior. This critical landmark contains both the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve. The suboccipital nerve is what innervates these muscles. Superficial to the suboccipital triangle are the larger muscles that support the head and neck. These muscles include the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and trapezius. The posterior portion of the SCM attaches to the lateral mastoid process and superior nuchal line.

When these muscles are compressed, this can cause compression of both the suboccipital nerve and the vertebral artery, causing decreased blood flow to that region. Subsequently, this can cause neck pain, headaches, and other symptoms. It has been noted that the "myodural bridge" connecting these muscles and the dura is a cause of cervicogenic headaches.
