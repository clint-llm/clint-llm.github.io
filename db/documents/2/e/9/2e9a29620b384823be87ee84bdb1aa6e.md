Failure to identify and treat DDH can lead to functional disability, Hip pain, and accelerated osteoarthritis.

**Complications Following Pelvic Harness**

- The most severe complication is Avascular necrosis of the femoral head, which varies from 0% to 5%.

- Femoral nerve palsy: if the infant stops demonstrating spontaneous knee extension while in the Pavlik harness, suspect femoral nerve palsy. Incidence of about 2.5 %, most of them are associated with severe dysplasia or maintaining the hip flexion beyond 120 degrees. Femoral palsy resolves if the harness is removed.

- Residual hip dysplasia: follow up x-ray bi-annual or annual till skeletal maturity are needed to monitor this condition. A normal X-ray at age is two years of life indicates a good prognosis.

- Other complications include skin irritation and knee subluxation.

**Complication following open or closed reduction**: redislocation, osteonecrosis, infection, and stiffness.
