The differential diagnoses include, but are not limited to:

- Pancreatitis secondary to other causes

- Gastritis or gastroenteritis

- Biliary disease secondary to obstructive or infectious pathology

- Bowel perforation or obstruction

- Nephrolithiasis

- Ectopic pregnancy

- Ischemic heart disease

- Pneumonia

- Aortic pathology

There is a broad differential diagnosis for this condition, as conditions affecting the gallbladder, stomach, or upper GI tract may present with a similar pain pattern.Â A history of frequent alcohol use, in combination with the characteristic abdominal pain patterns, elevated lipase, and imaging findings can help narrow down the differential.

Also, sickle cell crisis or diabetic ketoacidosis should also merit consideration in patients with a corresponding past medical history.
