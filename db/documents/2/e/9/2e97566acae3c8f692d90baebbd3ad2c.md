Patients with corneal abrasions and foreign bodies (FB) commonly present to emergency departments, urgent care centers, primary care, and eye care providers.

The cornea is crucial for focusing light on the retina, allowing functional vision. As much as 67% of the focusing power of the eye is derived from the cornea. A corneal injury will cause physical and functional discomfort. Subsequent corneal edema leads to photophobia and decreased visual acuity. When objects are deeply embedded, corneal scarring or irregularities may occur, resulting in significant visual disruption.

The cornea is essential for physically protecting the internal structures of the eye from external elements.
