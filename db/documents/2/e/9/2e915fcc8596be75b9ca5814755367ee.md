Soft tissue plasmacytoma staging is as follows:

- Limited to extramedullary site

- Involvement of the regional lymph nodes

- Multiple metastases

Extramedullary plasmacytoma staging is also done using a staging system for multiple myeloma because of the lack of a unique staging system of EMP to check survival and subsequently design treatment.

- Stage 1: Absence of both factors

- Stage 2: The presence of one factor

- Stage 3: The presence of both factors
