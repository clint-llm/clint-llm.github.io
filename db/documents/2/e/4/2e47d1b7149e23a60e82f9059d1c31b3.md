Treatment and management of caput succedaneum are observational. A majority of cases will self-resolve within forty-eight hours, and management includes observation and reassurance only. Infants should continue to receive a standard of care monitoring for neonatal jaundice. Rarely, caput succedaneum can result in new or worsening hyperbilirubinemia as the bilirubinÂ is resorbed back into the systemic circulation.
