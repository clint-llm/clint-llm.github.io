The etiologic agents of rickettsial diseases have varied mechanisms of transmission, wide geographic distributions, and an array of disease manifestations. Rickettsiae are most commonly transmitted through flea, tick, mite, or mouse vectors, with humans acting as incidental hosts.R. rickettsii (rocky mountain spotted fever), R. prowazekii (louse-borne typhus), Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. typhi (murine typhus); and, in rare cases, other SFG organisms. Most rickettsial species are limited to a particular region due to climatic conditions and natural host constraints; however, some rickettsia species can be encountered globally, such as R. felis and R. typhi.

Epidemiologic clues can be used to narrow the possible bacterial etiologies of a suspected rickettsial infection.R. prowazekii typhus), and history of previous louse-borne typhus (recrudescent typhus).
