Metacarpal fractures should undergo fixation if there is any component of malrotation to ensure that patients can make a closed fist and grip properly.

Surgery is indicated in the treatment of these fractures when the fracture pattern falls outside of acceptable angulation tolerances, and thus the patientâ€™s functional outcome would benefit from surgical fixation by lag screw fixation and/or plating techniques, or via percutaneous pinning of the fractures.

include MCP or IP dislocations that are irreducible will also need to undergo surgical fixation to facilitate the restoration of function.
