The repetitive extension-flexion results in a friction injury at the crossover junction of the first dorsal compartment (abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis) and the second dorsal compartment (extensor carpi radialis brevis/extensor carpi radialis longus) tendons leading to an inflammatory response and subsequently a tenosynovitis. The presentation is typically one that the patient complains of pain or tenderness over the dorsal aspect of the wrist proximal to the radial styloid. There may also be swelling and crepitus that isÂ palpable on the exam with wrist and/or thumb extension.
