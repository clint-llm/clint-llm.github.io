Complement deficiency is not typically treated with complement protein supplementation due to the infeasibility of overly frequent infusions, the risk for bloodborne infections, and the risk of developing antibodies to exogenous complement proteins. This condition is managed on a case-by-case basis with antibiotics for each episode of infection as well as regular visits with their immunologist.

Some patients may develop flare-ups of their autoimmune disease. These patients should be managed with immunosuppressive therapy.
