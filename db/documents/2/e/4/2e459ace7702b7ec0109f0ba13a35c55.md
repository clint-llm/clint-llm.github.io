Neonatal EEG recording is an objective method of measuring the functional integrity of the maturing brain of the newborn. It is a valuable tool used by the neonatologist to gage the behavioral state of the newborn. But more importantly, it guides the Pediatric Neurologist to understand the impact of neurological insults on the brain and to detect and confirm the presence of seizures.

Indications of EEG in neonates in general includes, but not limited to:

1. Assessment of abnormal movements

2. Neonatal seizures

3. Evaluation of hypoxic encephalopathy

4. Hypotonia

5. Altered mental status
