The incidence of lower back pain originating from the sacroiliac joint may be as high as 27%. Patients often describe a specific trauma or inciting event, although this is not always true. Pain originating from the sacroiliac joint is likely more common than most providers realize due to difficulty in localizing symptoms and referred pain patterns. Using a pain diagram to map out the location of the pain is often very helpful in diagnosis. SI joint pain is commonly found 10 cm caudally and 3 cm laterally from the patient's posterior superior iliac spine. SI joint pain is commonly referred to the buttocks, lower lumbar region, groin, and lateral thigh. Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction describe their pain being aggravated by getting out of a chair, prolonged standing or sitting, with climbing stairs or morning stiffness. Numbness and tingling in the leg may also be present. Risk factors for sacroiliac joint pain include leg length discrepancy, age, arthritis, history of spine surgery, pregnancy, and trauma.

The potential differential diagnosis of lower back pain is extensive. Therefore the clinical examination of the patient with sacroiliac joint dysfunction begins with an evaluation of gait, leg-length inequality, and examination of the lower lumbar region. During a physical examination, localization over the SI joint should be attempted using the Fortin finger test. The test is considered positive when the point of tenderness is within 2 cm inferomedial to the posterior superior iliac spine. In addition to the physical exam maneuvers above, the hip joint and spine should be properly evaluated to rule out other pathologies.

**Sacroiliac Joint Dysfunction**

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction is a broad term that refers to the abnormal biomechanical function of the SI joint. Some causes of sacroiliac joint dysfunction include the following:

**Trauma**

Increased mobility of the SI joint may be the result of injury to the supporting ligaments. This can be seen in high impact injuries such as a motor vehicle accident, fall, or repetitive trauma from weight lifting or sports.

**Hypermobility**

Hypermobility can also be genetic, a term often labeled "multidirectional instability" for ligamentous laxity at multiple joints, not strictly the sacroiliac joint. Other causes of inherited laxity can include Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Hormonal changes may also cause hypermobility. The ligaments of the sacroiliac joint slacken during pregnancy due to the hormone relaxin. This loosening, along with that of the related symphysis pubis, permits the pelvic rim to widen during the birthing process. The ligaments may also be stretched due to increased lumbar lordosis. Therefore, SI joint pain is common in pregnancy. However, this pain may persist after pregnancy if the ligaments do not return to physiologic tension. Risk factors include extended labor and delivery of large babies.

**Degeneration**

Structural abnormalities of the SI joint may also cause dysfunction. Individuals with altered gait patterns, spinal deformities or leg-length discrepancies can have reduced interlocking ability leading to laxity and pain. This equates to repetitive and uneven stress to the SI joint articular surfaces, causing laxity and pain.

Osteoarthritis of the SI joint is also common, and the incidence increases with age. Other risk factors for osteoarthritis include previous trauma.

**Inflammation**

Inflammation of the sacroiliac joints is termed sacroiliitis. There are many causes of sacroiliitis, with some mentioned above. An infectious cause of sacroiliitis includes the presentation of arthritis from brucellosis. Sacroiliitis may also be related to other inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and seronegative spondyloarthropathies.
