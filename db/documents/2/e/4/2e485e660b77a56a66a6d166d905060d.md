Triplane ankle fractures are classified based on the number of parts as well as the pattern.

**Classification by Parts**

- **2-part**
- Part 1: anterolateral and posterior epiphysis
- Part 2: anteromedial epiphysis

- **3-part**
- Anterolateral epiphysis
- Posterior epiphysis
- Anteromedial epiphysis

- **4-part**
- Comminuted

**Classification by Pattern**

- **Lateral**
- Most common
- Epiphyseal fracture: sagittal plane
- Physeal fracture: axial plane
- Metaphyseal fracture: coronal plane

- **Medial**
- Epiphyseal fracture: coronal plane
- Physeal fracture: axial plane
- Metaphyseal fracture: sagittal plane

- **Intramalleolar**
- Type I: intraarticular, involving weight-bearing surface
- Type II: intraarticular, not involving weight-bearing surface
- Type III: extraarticular
