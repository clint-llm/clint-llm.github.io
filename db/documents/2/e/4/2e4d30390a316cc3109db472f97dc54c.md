Candidemia is a life threatening infection with very high mortality. The infection is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an infectious disease expert, intensivist, microbiologist, laboratory specialist and an internist. These patients should be monitored by ICU nurses. The key is to reverse the state of immunosuppression. Most patients have involvement of multiple organs and the prognosis is poor, despite optimal treatment.
