Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus which causes a multisystemic disease called acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ocular manifestations are commonly seen in HIV patients. HIV retinopathy is fairly common in HIV positive patients and is the most common cause of loss of vision in these patients. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of HIV retinopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of HIV retinopathy.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with HIV retinopathy.
- Review the treatment and management options available for HIV retinopathy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of HIV retinopathy and improve patient outcomes.
