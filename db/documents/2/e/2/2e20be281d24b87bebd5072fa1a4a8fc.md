Although autosomal dominant, the clinical manifestations of HHT are variable, even within families.

**Epistaxis**

The earliest clinical manifestation and primary complaint in up to 96% of patients are spontaneous, recurrent epistaxis, stemming from nasal mucosal telangiectasias. Epistaxis can occur as early as childhood and increases in prevalence with age, potentially resulting in anemia and the need for blood and/or iron transfusions. The average age of epistaxis onset is 12 years, with almost 100% of HHT patients affected by 40 years and an average number of 18 bleeds per month.

Evaluation of epistaxis should involve anterior rhinoscopy of the nasal cavity. If resources are available, nasal endoscopy and/or upper airway endoscopy with a rigid or flexible fiberoptic scope can be done to evaluate for the presence of telangiectasias in the nasal or oral mucosa. [Figure 1] However, great care needs to be taken to avoid unnecessary bleeding.

**Mucocutaneous Telangiectasias**

Telangiectasias of the skin and oral mucosa appear around the 3rd decade and increase in number and frequency with age.

**Visceral Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM)**

Patients may also develop AVMs of the lungs, GI tract, brain, liver, or spine. AVM-related symptoms and complications should be assessed, including a history of stroke, heart failure, venous thromboembolism, iron deficiency, brain abscesses, arteriovenous shunting, liver disease, migraines, and pulmonary hypertension.

Cerebral and pulmonary AVMs typically form perinatally and pre-puberty, respectively.

On exam, patients may present with hepatomegaly, or hepatic bruits due to the left-to-right shunting of blood in hepatic AVMs.

**Family History**

In patients with a positive family history of HHT, the presence of a visceral AVM essentially confirms the diagnosis since AVMs are rare in the general population. For unaffected patients with a parent with HHT, the disease cannot be ruled out due to variable age-related onset of signs and symptoms. European studies on HHT patients estimate the probability of clinical HHT in patients with an affected family member to range from 0.5, 0.22, and 0.01 at 0-, 16-, and 60 years.

**Classification Criteria**

The diagnosis of HHT has relied on Curaçao Criteria, which encompasses the classic features of the disease: 1) spontaneous, recurrent epistaxis, 2) positive family history, 3) cutaneous or mucosal telangiectasias, and 4) visceral lesions. A definitive diagnosis is made if patients have 3 of the 4 criteria, and a possible or suspected diagnosis is made if patients meet 2 of the 4 criteria.
