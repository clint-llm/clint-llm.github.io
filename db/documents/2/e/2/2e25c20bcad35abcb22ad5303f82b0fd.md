There are many approaches to providing anesthetic care for patients undergoing eye surgeries. Anesthetic plans may vary from moderate sedation to monitored anesthesia care to full general anesthesia. The inclusion of topical and regional anesthesia has improved the anesthetic techniques that can be performed to facilitate eye surgeries while providing excellent patient care. Developing an anesthetic plan should always be specific to the comorbidities of the patient in addition to particular factors that may influence cooperation, comfort, and safety in the perioperative period. For instance, most eye surgeries are performed in the supine position.

If the decision to pursue regional or topical anesthesia is selected in conjugation with monitored anesthesia care, then the patient must be able to follow directions, respond appropriately, and tolerate the procedure and positioning. Comorbidities like heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obstructive sleep apnea, for example, may cause patient harm and discomfort from the inability to lie flat on the operating room table. Also, securing an airway in the event of respiratory distress can be more challenging in these situations as there is limited access to the patient's head which is typically covered with drapes to perform eye surgeries.

Moreover, patient cooperation must be assessed when developing an anesthetic plan because cognitive decline and diseases such as Parkinson disease and dementia may preclude patients from responding appropriately. Similarly, pediatric patients may have difficulty remaining still, and thus, general anesthesia may be the best option. The type of eye surgery performed will have separate indications that will influence anesthetic care as well. For example, most cataract and glaucoma surgeries are completed under monitored anesthetic care combined with topical anesthesia and regional anesthetic techniques. Peribulbar and topical anesthetic techniques are the most commonly utilized approaches in the united states for cataract procedures.

This is in contrast to patients who present for vitreoretinal surgeries and will typically receive a combination of a regional anesthetic technique with general anesthesia. The use of topical anesthesia is not utilized because vitreoretinal surgeries may take longer to perform. This avoids the possibility of the local anesthetic wearing off and thus limiting operating conditions for the ophthalmologist. However, vitreoretinal surgeries are usually performed under peribulbar block in India and other countries. As stated earlier, general anesthesia is typically reserved for pediatric patients and for those who may have difficulty in cooperating and communicating through the procedure.
