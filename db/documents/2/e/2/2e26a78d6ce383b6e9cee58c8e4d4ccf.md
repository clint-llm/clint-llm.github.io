It is natural to expect that as a patient progresses through various treatment stages, several providers will be involved, such as primary care physicians and physician-extenders, neurologists, pain management physicians, and neurosurgeons, all operating as a cohesive interprofessional team. Pain psychologists are regularly utilized to assess any psychosocial barriers to improvement (as with any chronic pain condition), evaluate whether patients are suitable candidates for the more invasive procedures, and help guide patients through emotional aspects affecting care. Physical therapists or chiropractors mayÂ play a role if there is a movement component associated with pain, and they can also address detrimental movement patterns that exacerbate the pain state. During interventional procedures, having a competent operating room staff, including operating room nursing staff, leads to better outcomes and can confer a comforting experience to the patient. With these interprofessional methods, open communication and data sharing, and coordinated effort between various interprofessional team members, patients will experience improved outcomes. [Level 5]
