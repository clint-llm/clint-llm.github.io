With the provided history of high-energy trauma to the foot and ankle and the above clinical findings, the primary differential diagnoses are fractures of other bones of the foot and ankle with or without injuries to the soft tissues of the foot and ankle such as ligaments, tendons, and neurovascular structures. Radiographic evaluation often narrows the differential diagnosis. Accessory ossicles are common variants of the foot and ankle which require differentiation from traumatic injury. The os trigonum can mimic a fracture of the posterior process. An acute fracture will have radiographic findings of irregular, jagged margins, while an os trigonum will have smooth, well-corticated margins.
