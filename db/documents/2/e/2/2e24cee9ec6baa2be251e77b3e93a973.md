Retinal hemorrhages are an important ophthalmic diagnostic sign for an underlying systemic vascular disorder. They range from the smallest dot and blot hemorrhage to massive sub-hyaloid hemorrhage. The location, size, and distribution of the hemorrhages provide clues to the etiology and uncover underlying systemic disorders such as vascular disease, hematologic disorders, and dyscrasias, infections, trauma, or hypoxia. Rarely it can also be seen idiopathically. Most require a detailed systemic work up to detect the underlying cause for the hemorrhages. Management consists of observation, treating the primary cause, and intraocular management to reduce the ischemic and neovascularization sequelae following the hemorrhages.
