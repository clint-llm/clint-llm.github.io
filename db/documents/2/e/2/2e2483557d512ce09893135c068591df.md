Bartter syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of salt reabsorption resulting in extracellular fluid volume depletion with low/normal blood pressure.

Patients often present in infancy with failure to thrive. Various phenotypes are classified according to the site of impaired salt transport.

Important clinical variants are neonatal (antenatal) Bartter syndrome, classical Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome.
