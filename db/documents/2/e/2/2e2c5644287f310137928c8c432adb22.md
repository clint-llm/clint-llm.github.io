Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a rare malignancy of the epithelial cells from various areas of the biliary tree, including intrahepatic, perihilar, and extrahepatic bile ducts. Histopathologically they are predominantly adenocarcinomas (95% of cases). Cholangiocarcinomas are highly lethal because most cases are locally advanced at the time of presentation.Â About 50% of cases are perihilar, 40% are distal, and 10% are intrahepatic.
