Classically, histamine toxicityÂ is associated with eating the dark meat fish, especially the Scombridae and Scomberosocidae families (tuna, mackerel, bonito, skip-jack), hence the name scombroid poisoning. In first-world countries, scombroid poisoning occurs mostly in recreationally caught fish rather than commercial harvests due to strict regulations of commercial fishing vessels. Non-scombroid species, such as amberjack, bluefish, mahi-mahi, sardine, yellowtail, and herring are also commonly responsible. Rarely, contaminated Swiss cheese may cause a reaction.
