In the case of overdose with antiarrhythmic drugs, clinicians should establish and maintain a patent airway, breathing, and circulatory support. In addition, vasopressor support is required for severe hypotension. Selected overdose management is described below.

Digoxin toxicity presents nausea, vomiting, neurological symptoms, and fatal arrhythmias. For digoxin toxicity, lidocaine can be administered for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and atropine for bradyarrhythmia. In addition, digoxin-specific antibody fragments are effective in severe toxicity.

In the case of beta-blocker poisoning, catecholamines, high-dose insulin euglycaemic treatment, and vasopressors are administered. Glucagon has been associated with improvements in hemodynamics.
