The treatment of the small cysts of cavum veli interpositi is mainly based on their collapse. Shunting or endoscopic ventricular fenestration are valid alternatives for the treatment for the large cysts of CVI when they become symptomatic because it creates a communication between the cavity of the midline filled with CSF and the νentricular system. The ventriculoperitoneal shunting works to create communication between the cystic cavity and the ventricular system.
