Acute or repeated traumas represent the most frequent causes of elbow stiffness. Extension loss is more common than flexion loss.

Cellular events occurring after trauma and its implications in stiffness are currently being studied. Participation of relaxin in capsular laxity together with the increase of cross-collagen bridges and decreased proteoglycans and water content are findings involved in an abnormal tissue of induced contractures.

Decrease range of motion depends on factors related to the type of joint trauma and soft tissue, treatment, rehabilitation and patient response. During the evaluation, it is important to consider previous surgeries, type of initial trauma and surgery, an affection of soft tissue, time of immobilization, and type of rehabilitation.
