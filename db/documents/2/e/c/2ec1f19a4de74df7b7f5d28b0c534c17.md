Anything that may lead to ulnar nerve palsy can cause claw hand. Ulnar nerve palsy can arise from a laceration anywhere along its course. Proximal injuries to the medial cord of the brachial plexus may also present with sensory loss distally. Ulnar nerve palsies can also be due to cubital tunnel syndrome and ulnar tunnel syndrome. These are compression neuropathies at the elbow and wrist. Another cause of ulnar nerve palsy may be a failure to splint the hand in an intrinsic-plus posture following a crush injury.Â There are a few systemic diseases that may also lead to ulnar nerve palsy. These include leprosy, syringomyelia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. However, these systemic diseases usually involve more than one nerve.

When a claw hand results, it is usually due to paralysis of the lumbricals.
