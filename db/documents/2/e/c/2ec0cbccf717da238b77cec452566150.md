Congenital hearing loss occurs in 1 to 3 per 1,000 live births. Normal hearing thresholds are between 0 to 20 dB HL (decibels hearing level). At least 3 children per 1000 will have a hearing loss greater than 20 dB HL. Approximately 1 infant in 1000 will have bilateral severe to profound hearing loss (greater than 70 dB HL). The incidence of hearing loss is 10-times higher for infants with 1 or more risk factors associated with hearing loss versus those without risk factors. Risk factors include a family history of hereditary childhood SNHL, craniofacial anomalies, weight less than 1500 g, hyperbilirubinemia, bacterial meningitis, APGAR score of 0 to 4 at 1 minute or 0 to 6 at 5 minutes, or 5 or more days of mechanical ventilation. Other risk factors include TORCH infections (an acronym for certain in utero infections) including toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and other viral infections.
