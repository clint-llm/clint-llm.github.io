The most obvious and concerning complication of penile fracture is sexual dysfunction. All patients who are subject to penile fracture will experience some degree of sexual dysfunction. Some may be limited to the immediate postoperative period; however, many patients will experience long-lasting dysfunction. Many patients will have anxiety over sexual performance after a penile fracture. Patients may also exhibit changes in sexual practices due to fears of recurrent injury. Counseling is also essential to guide a patient through the postoperative period to minimize sexual dysfunction following a penile fracture.

Additionally, there is a significant risk for concomitant urethral injury. Special attention is necessary to ensure foley placement intraoperatively during cystoscopy does not cause further harm due to a missed urethral injury.

Conservative management of penile fracture has significantly more complications than surgical intervention, most concerning erectile dysfunction.
