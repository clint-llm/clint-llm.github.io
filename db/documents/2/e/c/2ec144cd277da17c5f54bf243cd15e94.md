Randomized controlled trials observed the following early complications (in descending order):

- Voice alteration

- Hoarseness

- Cough

- Tingling

- Dyspnea

But generally, the patients show improved tolerance over a period of time. Intraoperative complications are rare and may include the following:

- Vocal cord paralysis

- Implant site infection

- Left facial nerve paralysis

- Horner syndrome

Chronic use of vagus nerve stimulation has not been evidenced to cause any significant or deleterious changes to cardio-respiratory functions.

The VNS manufacturer's guidelines have to be strictly adhered to while performing magnetic resonance imaging scans of the cranium in patients having implanted VNS.

The VNS battery usually has a lifetime of 3-5 years, after which it needs to be replaced.
