One should suspect vestibular neuritis if the patient experiences an acute onset of persistent vertigo that lasts hours to several days.

Patients who experience the above seek consultation with their primary care, emergency, or ENT physician.

PhysiciansÂ will primarily exclude vertigo secondary to another more severe disease of the brain or its blood vessels, and refer the patient to an ENT (otolaryngologist) for further testing and treatment.
