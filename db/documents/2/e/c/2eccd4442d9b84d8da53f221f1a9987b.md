Current guidelines on the management of Pleural effusions

- The use of bedside ultrasound improves success rates and reduces the risk of pneumothorax during aspiration

- Ultrasound can detect pleural fluid sequestrations

- Always send fluid for biochemistry, culture, and cytology

- Use light's criteria to distinguish exudate from transudate

- Lymphocyte predominant effusions are usually due to heart failure, malignancy, and TB

- Check pH when aspirating pleural effusions

- Do not inject air or local anesthetic into the sample as this may alter the pH of the fluid

- If pH is less than 7.2, drainage of the fluid is recommended

- Malignant effusions can be detected on cytology (40 to 60%)

- CT scan is recommended when complete removal of pleural fluid is not possible

- Thoracoscopy can be used to make a diagnosis of malignancy

- Routine flexible bronchoscopy is not recommended for pleural effusions
