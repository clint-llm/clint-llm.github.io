Elderly and bed-bound individuals are more prone to developing pressure (decubitus) ulcers. The hip and buttock region accounts for approximately two-thirds all pressure ulcers. Also, the skin underneath the nasogastric or endotracheal tubes might be affected by pressure ulcers. They are slightly more predominant in females than males. Pressure ulcers are caused by a prolonged period of repeated friction and shearing pressure of the skin overlying the bony prominences along with some of the following intrinsic causes:

- Loss of skin fragility

- Decreased blood flow

- Loss of muscle volume

- Spinal cord injuries

- Nutritional insufficiency

- Moisture due to fecal and/or urinary incontinence

Understanding how a pressure injury happens requires a review of the basic layers of the skin. The epidermis is the most superficial layer. Just below the epidermis is the dermis, and then right below the dermis is the capillary bed which feeds, perfuses, and supplies the dermis and epidermis. Below the capillary bed is the fatty subcutaneous tissue, followed by muscle and then bone. Hence, in a patient who is sitting in the chair for a really long time, the coccyx bone which is obvious the bony prominence is going to place the patient at risk for developing a pressure injury by exerting upward pressure on bottom skin layers. In addition, there is the external hard surface of the chair that can also place pressure on the skin and bony prominences. If the pressure is prolonged, it can compromise blood supply to the skin.

It is very important to avoid friction and shear force injuries. These injuries may occur when the patient is sliding down in the bed. For example, when the coccyx bone is moving upwards and the skin is moving downward (i.e., the two forces move in opposite direction), the middle layer which supplies and perfuses the dermis and epidermis may tear, leading to decreased perfusion and eventually resulting in a pressure injury. There are various stages of pressure injury, all of which classify the injury based on the depth of skin injury. Pressure ulcers are categorized into four stages:

- Stage 1: just erythema of the skin

- Stage 2: erythema with the loss of partial thickness of the skin including epidermis and part of the superficial dermis

- Stage 3: full thickness ulcer that might involve the subcutaneous fat

- Stage 4: full thickness ulcer with the involvement of the muscle or bone

The most common sites for pressure injuries include the sacrum (tailbone) followed by the heels, trochanter (hip bone), and the ischium (sitting erect bone), especially in paraplegic patients.
