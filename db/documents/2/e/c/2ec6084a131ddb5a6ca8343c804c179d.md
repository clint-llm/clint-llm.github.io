The differential diagnosis for chronic shoulder pain includes several etiologies:

**Impingement**

- External/subacromial

- Subcoracoid

- Calcific tendonitis

- Internal (including SLAP lesions, glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), little League shoulder, posterior labral tears)

**Rotator Cuff (RC) Pathology**

- Tendonitis (acute), tendinopathy (chronic or acute on chronic)

- Partial- versus full-thickness tears (PTTs versus FTTs)

- RC arthropathy

**Degenerative**

- Advanced degenerative joint disease, often associated with rotator cuff arthropathy

- Glenohumeral arthritis

- Adhesive capsulitis

- Avascular necrosis (AVN)

- Scapulothoracic crepitus

**Proximal Biceps**

- Subluxation – often seen in association with subscapularis injuries

- Tendonitis and tendinopathy

**Acromioclavicular Joint Conditions**

- AC joint separation

- Distal clavicle osteolysis

- AC joint arthritis

**Instability**

- Unidirectional instability – seen in association with an inciting event/dislocation (anterior, posterior, inferior)

- Multidirectional instability (MDI)

- Associated labral injuries/pathology

**Neurovascular Conditions**

- Suprascapular neuropathy – can be associated with paralabral cyst at the spinoglenoid notch

- Scapular winging – medial or lateral

- Brachial neuritis

- Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS)

- Quadrilateral space syndrome

**Other Conditions**

- Scapulothoracic dyskinesia

- Os acromiale

- Muscle ruptures (pectoralis major, deltoid, latissimus dorsi)

- Fracture (acute injury or pain resulting from long-standing deformity, malunion, or nonunion)
