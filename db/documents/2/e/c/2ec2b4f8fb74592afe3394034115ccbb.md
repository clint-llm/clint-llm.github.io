Pulmonary regurgitation is a disease entity that can present years after a surgical tetralogy of Fallot repair. Primary care providers play a pivotal role in the follow up of such patients. Paying close attention to the history and physical examination can lead to detecting pulmonary regurgitation earlier on in the course of the disease before irreversible biventricular remodeling sets in. Alerting a cardiologist to symptoms of decreased exercise tolerance can be beneficial in determining the optimal timing for a pulmonary valve replacement. At this stage, pharmacists, nurses, and other health care providers contribute to the interprofessional collaborative efforts.
