Histologic findings in the early stages of the disease are limited to the periosteum. Gradually the periosteumâ€™s fibrous layer breaks down and becomes associated with muscles, tendons, and fascia. Osteoid trabeculae enter the muscles, soft tissue, and connective tissue, forming new bone and resulting in increased diameter. Eventually, the periosteum reforms a fibrous layer over the new bone, and the extra bone is removed.
