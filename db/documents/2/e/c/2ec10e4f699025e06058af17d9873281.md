Mastery learning supports competency-based education (CBE). The shift towards CBE derived from the need for supplemental education with the advent of the mandate in reduced working hours in graduate medical education. Residents have subsequently had less exposure in the clinical environment; therefore, a more systematic approach for the acquisition of skills is necessary.

Skills retention has been shown to wane over time.  Mastery learning has been studied as a means of overcoming skill degradation and increasing patient safety.
