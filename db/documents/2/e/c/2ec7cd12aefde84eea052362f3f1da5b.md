In addition to understanding the prognosis of surgical interventions (above), patients need to understand the overall etiology of their condition. Subclavian artery stenosis is most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, usually affecting the left subclavian artery.

Prevention is essential, and the same measures apply to preventing the worsening of the condition or restenosis following surgery. Most importantly, this involves preventing atherosclerosis, PAD, and subclavian artery stenosis by working toward a healthy lifestyle. This includes good nutrition, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight, and avoiding all forms of smoking and tobacco. Careful management of other medical problems is also essential; the risk of vascular problems can be reduced by managing hypertension, lowering cholesterol levels, maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, and taking medications for these conditions as prescribed.
