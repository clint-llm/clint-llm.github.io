Gastroparesis is defined by objective delaying of gastric emptying without any evidence of mechanical obstruction. Diabetic gastroparesis is a potential complication that occurs in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes, resulting from dysfunction in the coordination and function of the autonomic nervous system, neurons, and specialized pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal, ICC) of the stomach and intestine, and the smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of diabetic gastroparesis and interprofessional team members' role in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of diabetic gastroparesis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of diabetic gastroparesis.
- Summarize the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.
- Outline the evaluation and management of diabetic gastroparesis and the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.
