Glaucoma is a condition of increased intraocular pressure in the eye that may progress to a loss of vision. This results in a characteristic optic nerve head appearance on fundoscopic examination and a corresponding progressive loss of vision. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of glaucoma and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of glaucoma.
- Outline the use of fundoscopy, visual field testing, tonometry, optical coherence tomography, and gonioscopy in the evaluation of glaucoma.
- Summarize the management of glaucoma.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for the patient affected by this condition.
