Evaluation should focus on the airway, breathing, and circulation and be followed with a thorough skin exam. A complete blood count (CBC) can be obtained to assess for leukocytosis or leukopenia. Hepatic function panel and the basic metabolic panel may be obtained to assess for liver injury, kidney injury, or acidemia or electrolyte disturbances in severe injuries. A chest x-ray should be obtained as clinically indicated for a cough, abnormal findings on pulmonary exam or any signs of respiratory distress. A burn specialist should evaluate cutaneous burns, and ocular injury should have urgent ophthalmology referral.
