Finger joint dislocation is a common hand injury. Finger dislocation can occur at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP), distal interphalangeal (DIP), or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. Unrecognized or untreated finger dislocations are associated with deformities, stiffness, loss of function, and chronic pain. This activity reviews the epidemiology, anatomy, key examination findings, imaging, treatment, surgical approaches, and complications of finger dislocation. The activity also highlights the examiner's role in evaluating potential complications, the mechanism of injuries, and the importance of orthopedic and hand surgery consultations to improve care for patients with finger dislocations.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the important stabilizers of the finger joints.
- Describe a proper patient history and physical exam and choose the correct imaging to evaluate finger joint dislocations.
- Outline the nonoperative treatment options for MCP, PIP, and DIP joint dislocations and potential complications of the missed treatment.
- Summarize the importance of communication between players, healthcare professionals, and orthopedic or hand surgeons.
