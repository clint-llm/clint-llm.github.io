Cricothyrotomy is performed by inserting a tube through an incision in the cricothyroid membrane. To perform a cricothyrotomy under emergent circumstances, physicians must have some knowledge of the relevant anatomy. The cricothyroid membrane (CTM) is bordered superiorly by the thyroid cartilage, inferiorly by the cricoid cartilage, and laterally by the bilateral cricothyroideus muscles. Begin by palpating the laryngeal prominence, colloquially known as the “Adam’s Apple,” on the thyroid cartilage. Within the thyroid cartilage are the vocal cords. Inferiorly, palpate the round “signet ring” of the cricoid cartilage. The CTM is approximately 2 cm inferior to the laryngeal prominence and superior to the cricoid cartilage, which is identified by palpating a slight depression between the two cartilaginous structures.
