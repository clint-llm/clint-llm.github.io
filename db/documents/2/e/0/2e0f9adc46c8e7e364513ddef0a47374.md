Mycosis fungoides tends to affect the older population. Generally, patients older than 50 years are predisposed as well as males compared to females with a ratio of 2:1. The incidence of Sezary syndrome in the United States is about 0.8 to 0.9 cases per million persons per year. Like mycosis fungoides, it tends to affect the elderly population and males more commonly. The incidence is higher in white compared to African Americans. There is no genetic predisposition and thus no increased risk of developing Sezary syndrome in families of affected patients.
