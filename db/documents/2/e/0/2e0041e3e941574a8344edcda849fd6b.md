The exact cause of hyperemesis gravidarum remains unclear. However, there are several theories for what may contribute to the development of this disease process.

**Hormone Changes**

- Levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been implicated. hCG levels peak during the first trimester, corresponding to the typical onset of hyperemesis symptoms. Some studies show a correlation between higher hCG concentrations and hyperemesis.

- Estrogen is also thought to contribute to nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Estradiol levels increase early in pregnancy and decrease later, mirroring the typical course of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Additionally, nausea and vomiting are the known side effects of estrogen-containing medications. As the level of estrogen increases, so does the incidence of vomiting.

**Changes in the Gastrointestinal System**

- It is well-known that the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes during pregnancy due to the elevations in estrogen and progesterone. This leads to an increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in pregnancy, and one symptom of GERD is nausea.

**Genetics**

- An increased risk of hyperemesis gravidarum has been demonstrated among women with family members who also experienced hyperemesis gravidarum.

- Two genes, GDF15 and IGFBP7, have been potentially linked to the development of hyperemesis gravidarum.
