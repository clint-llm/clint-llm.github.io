An initial trauma assessment is performed. Adequate resuscitation is followed by rapid imaging studies with the identification of possible surgical injuries. Proper immobilization should be maintained until the stability of the entire spine has been confirmed. The mechanism of trauma is obtained from the patient, relatives, or paramedics.

A detailed neurologic examination is performed. If sedation was given, it should be stopped for an adequate neurological assessment. The patient is evaluated for response to stimuli with a response in eye, motor, and verbal forms. The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was established in 1974 by Teasdale and Jennett.

Glasgow coma scale:

Eye opening (Score 1-4)

- Spontaneous – 4

- To speech – 3

- To pain – 2

- No response – 1

Verbal function (Score 1-5)

- Alert and oriented – 5

- Confused/disoriented – 4

- Inappropriate words – 3

- Incomprehensible sounds – 2

- No response – 1

Motor function (Score 1-6)

- Obeys commands – 6

- Localizes pain – 5

- Withdraws from pain – 4

- Decorticate flexion – 3

- Decerebrate extension – 2

- No response – 1
