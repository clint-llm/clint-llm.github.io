At two months of gestational age, the sacroiliac joint can be identified. At this time, a well-formed articular joint can be identified with a thin and pliable capsule anteriorly. The stability of the immature joint is provided by the posterior ligamentous architecture. The joint surfaces are smooth and flat which allows for ample gliding movement in all directions. At five months of gestational age, a thin fibrous septum joins the two surfaces. At 37 weeks gestation, a synovial membrane lines the joint capsule. The cartilage on the sacral side is 3-5 times thicker than the iliac side at this point of development. The two distinct cartilage types can be identified. The iliac cartilage consisting of hyaline cartilage and the sacral sides consisting of fibrocartilage. During the first decade of life, the joint grows proportionally and the capsule develops into a tough, fibrous structure. The articular surfaces of the joint remain flat and allow for gliding motion in all directions. In the second and third decades of life, the articular surfaces begin to become uneven and the iliac surface has a convex ridge that runs in a sacral groove. The posterosuperior to anteroinferior motion is limited by this bony development.
