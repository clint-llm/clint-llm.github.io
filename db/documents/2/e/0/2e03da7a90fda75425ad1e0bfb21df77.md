A diagnosis of epilepsy means an individual will need to make adjustments to their life. It is a lifelong disease with well-known precipitant factors and a need for strict medication compliance. Patients and family members require education on safety precautions, along with lifestyle training such as showering rather than bathing, avoiding unprotected heights, and unsupervised areas of water. They require counseling on sleep hygiene as a poor nightâ€™s sleep will increase the likelihood of seizure. Thye should be counseled against alcohol consumption as well as other illicit drug use at every visit. Driving restrictions vary depending on the country or region they reside in, and patients and parents will need to understand the reasoning for this restriction. In some cases, they may need to contact their local motor vehicle authorities.
