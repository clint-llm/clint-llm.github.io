The main functions of bile are 2-fold:

- To facilitate lipid absorption and digestion

- To eliminate waste products from the body

**Lipid Absorption and Digestion**

Through the process of emulsification, bile acids break down large lipid droplets into smaller ones, increasing the surface area for digestive enzymes. Emulsification is possible due to the amphipathic property of bile salts

**Elimination of Waste Products**

Cholesterol is eliminated through its conversion into bile acids, allowing the body to maintain cholesterol homeostasis. Bile acid sequestrants, medications intended to lower cholesterol, function by binding bile acids in the small intestine, and increasing their excretion in the stool. Bilirubin is also eliminated through its secretion into bile, where it eventually forms the dark pigment of feces
