The defect usually occurs at the myocardial infarct border zone, in the apical septum with anterior wall myocardial infarction, and the basal posterior septum with inferior wall myocardial infarction. A VSR almost always occurs in the setting of a transmural infarction. The defect can range in length from one to several centimeters. It can be direct through an opening or more irregular and serpiginous. Multiple fenestrations are especially common with inferior infarctions.
