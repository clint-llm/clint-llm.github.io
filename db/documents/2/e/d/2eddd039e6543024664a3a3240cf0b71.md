Myxopapillary ependymomas account for 1% to 5% of all spinal neoplasms and approximately 13% of all spinal ependymomas. In the American population, their incidence was 1.00 per million person-years. The age at onset varies between 30 and 50 years (mean age, 35 years). The most common location of myxopapillary ependymoma is the lumbosacral spine segment, mainly in the conus medullaris and cauda equina regions. Other rare locations include the cerebral ventricles and the brain.
