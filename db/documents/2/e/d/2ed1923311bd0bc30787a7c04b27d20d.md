Patients with hypertensive urgency are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, internist, nephrologist, specialty cardiac nurse, pharmacist, and ophthalmologist. The key is to educate the patient on medication compliance. Patients without symptoms or signs of target organ damage have not been shown to benefit from aggressive antihypertensive therapy in the acute setting. Rapid lowering of blood pressure in these patients offers no benefit and carries the theoretical risk of causing relative hypotension and end-organ hypoperfusion, especially in those individuals who have longstanding severely elevated blood pressure. However, it may be beneficial to start these patients on oral antihypertensives with the goal of lowering the blood pressure slowly over 24 to 48 hours.

The primary care providers, nurses, and pharmacists should educate the patient on the importance of a healthy lifestyle that includes discontinuing smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, and regular exercise. Any concerns noted by a care team member should immediately be communicated to the appropriate practitioners for remediation. Accurate patient records are essential, as they keep the entire team informed regarding the patient's status and progress. This interprofessional care model will help drive improved patient outcomes.
