The stylohyoid muscle is a part of a significant anatomical structure known as the stylopharyngeal septum/styloid diaphragm. This septum is considered an essential surgical landmark when attempting to enter the pharyngeal spaces. The septum divides the space into two compartments - prestyloid and retrostyloid - based on its relationship with the septum.

Partial ossification of the ligament of the stylohyoid muscle may lead to Eagle syndrome, also known as the stylohyoid syndrome.

The facial nerve has a significant contribution to the oropharyngeal phase of deglutition through various muscles. It innervates the stylohyoid muscle in association with other muscles, such as the buccinator muscle, perioral muscles, and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Patients with peripheral facial palsy may experience swallowing difficulty.

Pathologic conditions associated with the stylohyoid muscle may result in cervical and pharyngeal symptoms such as neck pain laterally in the area of the angle of the mandible, submandibular space, and anterior upper neck. The pain may get exacerbated by normalÂ actions such as speaking, swallowing, yawning, or head-turning. Myofascial pain syndrome can result in severe pain in the stylohyoid muscle; treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain and inflammation. Severe cases may require injections to numb the affected area.

If the stylohyoid muscle inserts in an unusual fashion where it covers the hyoid bone as a belt, patients may report stylohyoid syndrome symptoms, including orofacial and cervical pain usually triggered by neck movements.
