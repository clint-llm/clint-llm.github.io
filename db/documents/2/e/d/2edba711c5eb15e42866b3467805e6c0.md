The heart is the organ that pumps blood through the vessels. It pumps blood directly into arteries, more specifically, the aorta or the pulmonary artery. Blood vessels are critical because they control the amount of blood flow to specific parts of the body. Blood vessels include arteries, capillaries, and veins. Arteries carry blood away from the heart and can divide into large and small arteries. Large arteries receive the highest pressure of blood flow and are thicker and more elastic to accommodate the high pressures. Smaller arteries, such as arterioles, have more smooth muscle, which contracts or relaxes to regulate blood flow to specific portions of the body. Arterioles face a smaller blood pressure, meaning they don't need to be as elastic. Arterioles account for most of the resistance in pulmonary circulation because they are more rigid than larger arteries. Furthermore, the capillaries branch off of arterioles and are a single-cell layer. This thin layer allows for the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste with tissues and organs. Also, the veins transport blood back to the heart. They contain valves to prevent the backflow of blood.
