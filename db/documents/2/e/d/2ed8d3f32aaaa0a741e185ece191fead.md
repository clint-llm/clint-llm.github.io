Ketogenesis occurs primarily inÂ the mitochondria of liver cells. Fatty acids are brought into the mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT-1) and then broken down into acetyl CoA via beta-oxidation. Two acetyl-CoA molecules are converted into acetoacetyl-CoA via the enzyme thiolase; this is also known as acetyl coenzyme A acetyltransferase (ACAT). Afterward, acetoacetyl-CoA is converted to HMG-CoA via the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase. HMG-CoA lyase then converts HMG-CoA to acetoacetate. Acetoacetate can be converted to either acetone through non-enzymatic decarboxylation or to beta-hydroxybutyrate via beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase.

Acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are the two ketone bodies used by the body for energy. Once they reach extrahepatic tissues, beta-hydroxybutyrate is converted to acetoacetate via the enzyme beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, and acetoacetate is converted back to acetyl-CoA via the enzyme beta-ketoacyl-CoA transferase. Acetyl-CoA goes through the citric acid cycle, and after oxidative phosphorylation, produces 22 ATP per molecule. Acetone does not convert back to acetyl-CoA, so it is either excreted through urine or exhaled.

**Regulation of Ketogenesis**

Ketogenesis can be upregulated by hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, thyroid hormones, and catecholamines by causing a more significant breakdown of free fatty acids, thus increasing the amount available to be used in the ketogenic pathway. However, insulin is the primary hormonal regulator of this process.

Insulin regulates many key enzymes in the ketogenic pathway, and a state of low insulin triggers the process. A low insulin state leads to:

- Increased free fatty acids (FFAs)

- 
              
- Due to decreased inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase

- Increased uptake of FFAs into the mitochondria

- 
              
- Due to decreased activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, decreasing malonyl CoA, which disinhibits Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1)

- Increased production of ketone bodies

- 
              
- Due to increased HMG-CoA activity
