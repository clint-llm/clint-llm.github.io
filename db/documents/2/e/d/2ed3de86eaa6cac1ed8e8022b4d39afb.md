Treatments described for pelvis diastasis include non-operative treatment with application of pelvic binder coupled with physical therapy and immediate weight-bearing, non-weight bearing with bedrest, closed reduction with application of binder, application of anterior external fixator with or without sacroiliac screw fixation, and anterior internal fixation with plate and screws. In most cases, conservative, non-operative management is recommended and yields good functional outcomes. While early operative management has been advocated in cases where pubic diastasis measures more than 4 cm, the patient is at increased risk for perioperative complications in the postpartum state. Distorted pelvic anatomy, increased pelvic vascularity, and peripartum hypercoagulability complicates surgical intervention and must be considerations.
