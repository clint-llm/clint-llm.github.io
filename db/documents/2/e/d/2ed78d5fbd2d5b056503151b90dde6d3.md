Although intended to act as safeguards for the patient, pharmaceutical packaging may hinder medical adherence. With child-resistant and tamper-evident packaging, many individuals face difficulties in opening the prescription packaging, discouraging them from taking their medications. Difficulties opening pharmacy packaging may include individuals using sharp objects in an attempt to open the packaging, breaking tablets during efforts to push them out of blister packs, and simply being unable to open the drug container due to tamper-evident packaging.

Also, with some forms of packaging, it may be difficult for individuals to be able to ascertain if they have taken the previous dose. Whereas blister packs and pill organizers aim to mitigate this problem, some individuals have difficulty removing the pill from blister packs without breaking the drug itself. Individuals also must accurately separate medications into the pill organizer in order for it to be beneficial.

There are also concerns regarding differences in how drug information is conveyed to the general public versus the health care providers. While the Food and Drug Administration regulates both the medication guide insert and patient package inserts in the U.S., the patient targeted pharmacy brochures are not regulated. This lack of regulation on patient targeted brochures is of particular concern because unregulated pharmacy leaflets may address adverse drug reactions in a manner that may undermine their severity.
