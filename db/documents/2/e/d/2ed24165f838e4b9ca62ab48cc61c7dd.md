Vacuum delivery is usually only done by an experienced obstetrician. However, the care of the newborn is usually by a nurse. Vacuum delivery can sometimes result in complications to the mother, including an extension of vaginal lacerations, including sphincter, and vaginal pain. In the labor and delivery room, the nurse should monitor the infant for scalp lacerations, cephalohematoma, intracranial hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, hyperbilirubinemia, and neurological injury. Absolute rates of complications are low; it is estimated that the rate of intracranial hemorrhage following operative vaginal delivery is at one in 650 to 850 live births. [Level 5]
