**Radiation**

The use of radiation in the treatment of vestibular schwannomas is well established. It is a noninvasive means of controlling tumor growth with excellent functional and oncological outcomes. Several treatment delivery approaches have been utilized. All have a different side effect profile, but all produce high rates of local control**.**

**Treatment Delivery**

Single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can be delivered using several platforms, including GammaKnife®, Cyberknife ®, or Linac-based systems. The advantage, in this case, is patient convenience; however, there are size limitations and a higher risk of side effects. Stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) is another option and can be employed on both linac-based and cyber knife treatment platforms. It is typically delivered over five fractions. Conventionally fractionated radiation can also be employed and may be used if the dose constraints cannot be met; there are concerns regarding long-term hearing viability or large tumor size.

**Doses**

For single fraction treatments with SRS, the dose typically ranges from 12 to 13Gy. SBRT dosing ranges from 20 to 25Gy in 5 fractions. Conventionally fractionated doses range from 46.8Gy to 50.4Gy in 26-28 fractions.

**Dose Constraints**

Constraints used vary based on the dose fractionation scheme used. The critical organs at risk include the brainstem, spinal cord, and cochlea. For SRS, The brainstem dose max should be kept below 12.5Gy, which has a <5% risk of radio necrosis.

For SBRT/hypofractionated radiotherapy, the brain stem dose with a 5-fraction regimen should have a dose max of 28Gy with <0.5cc getting less than 23Gy. The V24Gy for the brain should be kept under 20cc for a <10% risk of radionecrosis. Cochlear doses should be kept at <27.5Gy max dose. The spinal cord maximum dose is kept below <30Gy.

For conventionally fractionated dose constraints, the brainstem max dose should be kept under 54% with the risk of necrosis <5%.

**Simulation and Treatment Planning**

Patients undergoing radiation treatment will require immobilization of the head. Although a CT simulation is needed for planning and calculating isocurve curves using the attenuation data, target visualization is quite poor. Therefore a thin-cut MRI of the brain is typically required T1 with contrast, or T2 weighted imaging is needed to better identify the target.

**Outcomes**

A retrospective comparison of microsurgery versus SRS suggests that local control rates are comparable (91% vs. 100% at one year).

Fractionation schemes ranging from SRS to conventional treatment have also been compared in retrospective or prospective trials. One prospective trial randomized schwannoma patients based on whether or not they had teeth. They were randomized to either a 5-fraction regimen (Dentate) or single fraction SRS (Edentate). The results demonstrated comparable tumor control, hearing preservation, facial neuropathy, and trigeminal neuropathy.

Proton therapy has also been used for the treatment of schwannomas. The dosimetric properties of protons make proton therapy ideal when the dose constraints cannot be met using other techniques. Proton therapy can be used to deliver SRS (10-18CGE) or fractionated radiation (54-60CGE). Serviceable hearing in this group is approximately 30%, with local control rates exceeding 90% at four years.
