Most patients are initially asymptomatic from hepatocellular carcinoma but often present with related symptoms due to chronic liver disease. Patients may complain of upper abdominal discomfort and distention, weight loss, fever, poor appetite, early satiety, diarrhea and other symptoms. Any acute liver decompensation with the development of ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice, or hematemesis should raise a suspicion for hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma may rarely present with unusual symptoms due to a paraneoplastic syndrome presentation that may include hypoglycemia, erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, or severe watery diarrhea.

Physical examination may reveal signs of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis stigmata, including hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, jaundice, or engorgement of collateral veins (caput medusa, also known as the palm tree sign, which are dilated superficial epigastric veins) which could be a sign of cirrhosis.
