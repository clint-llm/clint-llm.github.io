Apolipoproteins serve a structural role in phospholipid membranes, act as ligands for lipoprotein receptors, guide the formation of lipoproteins, and serve as activators and inhibitors of enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are critical for absorbing and transporting dietary lipids by the small intestine and moving lipids from the liver to peripheral tissues and back from peripheral tissues to the liver and intestine. They are also crucial for transporting toxic foreign hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds, including bacterial endotoxin from areas of invasion and infection.
