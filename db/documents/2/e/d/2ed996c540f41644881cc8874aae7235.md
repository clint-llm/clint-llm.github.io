Respiratory physiology can be divided into two separate processes – ventilation and oxygenation.

Ventilation is the process of carbon dioxide clearance via the lungs (i,e., alveolar ventilation). Removing carbon dioxide requires diffusion and ventilation but is more dependent on ventilation. Pulse oximetry is a dynamic measure of oxygenation, and end-tidal capnography is an active measure of ventilation. Oxygenation refers to the diffusion of oxygen from the alveolus into the blood. Ventilation is an active process, meaning the lungs cannot ventilate without the actions of the respiratory muscles (or mechanical ventilators in intubated patients). Oxygenation is passive, meaning it relies solely on the diffusion gradient across the alveolar membrane. Respiratory failure occurs if one or both of these respiratory process is impaired (ventilation and oxygenation).

In type 1 respiratory failure, the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60 mmHg with a normal or decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). While in type 2 respiratory failure, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) > 45 mmHg due to the inability to ventilate from respiratory pump failure with a pH < 7.35 and normal or reduced PaO2.
