The prognosis for a patient with a concussion is usually good, with symptom improvement in the first one to two weeks post-injury. Previous research indicated the recovery timeframe after a concussion was typically about ten days. However, the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sports recently relaxed the expected recovery timeframe for sports-related concussions, stating that most injured athletes clinically recover within a month.
