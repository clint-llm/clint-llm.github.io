Physicians or any sonographer trained in diagnostic obstetric ultrasonography may perform pelvic sonography. Obstetricians, gynecologists, and radiologists are the physicians who usually perform pelvic sonography. Nurse practitioners, ultrasound technicians, and other healthcare providers trained as sonographers perform sonography in primary healthcare settings or as routine in many countries where only interpretation isÂ performed by physicians.
