Most cases of endophthalmitis are exogenous and are seen in the postoperative period. Patients with uncontrolled blood sugar levels, high temperature (can be secondary to underlying septicemia) are prone to postoperative endophthalmitis. Hence the nursing staff and physician must check for systemic stability before any surgical procedure to reduce the chances of postoperative endophthalmitis. Nursing staff posted at the daycare or inpatient ward should look for preoperative risk factors such as blepharitis, dacryocystitis, open wound, etc. before shifting the case to the operating room. Nursing staff plays a vital role in monitoring the patient, charting the vital parameters, and reporting the issues to the treating physician. Certain cases with fulminant endophthalmitis might require evisceration/ enucleation; hence pre-surgical counseling of patients by a psychiatrist helps to reduce the morbidity. Cases with endogenous endophthalmitis have systemic comorbidities such as invasive aspergillosis or chronic renal failure with prolonged catheterization, etc., and hence may not primarily present to the ophthalmologist with ocular complaints. Therefore specialists other than an ophthalmologist must be aware of such an entity and promptly refer such cases to improve outcomes.
