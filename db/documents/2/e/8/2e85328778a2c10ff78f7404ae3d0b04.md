Just like any form of medical treatment, HBOT has potential side effects, complications, and contraindications. Side effects can be divided into two categories, those related to oxygen and those related to the hyperbaric conditions and the chamber itself. Breathing 100% oxygen at greater than 2 ATA for prolonged periods of time can result in oxygen toxicity. This phenomenon is still not completely understood, but it is thought to be due to natural byproducts of cellular respiration called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage cell structures like cellular membranes and cause oxidative stress.
