A skin biopsy is the diagnostic gold standard for atypical fibroxanthoma since it is a rare condition that clinically mimics basal and squamous cell carcinomas, Merkel cell carcinomas, and amelanotic melanomas. Immunohistochemistry is a common test performed to make the diagnosis (see "histopathology" above).

When atypical fibroxanthoma lesions have metastasized or are poorly accessible (e.g., subungual lesions), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful, which shows intermediate T1 and T2-weighted signal intensity compared to the high signal intensity of squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma.
