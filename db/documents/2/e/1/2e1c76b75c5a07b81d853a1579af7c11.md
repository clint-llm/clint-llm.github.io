It is important to consider the anti-doping regulations present in many athletic programs. Some medications utilized for Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may require a therapeutic use exemption (TUE). ICS, LTRA's, MCSA's, inhaled anticholinergics, SABA (including albuterol and formoterol), antibiotics, 1st generation antihistamines with or without oral decongestant, nasal ipratropium, dextromethorphan, nasal corticosteroids, topical decongestants, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in appropriate doses do not enhance performance and therefore do not require a TUE.
