Several tissues require continuous glucose supply, including the brain, erythrocytes, renal medulla, the lens and cornea, testes, and skeletal muscles during exercise. The brain uses glucose exclusively in both the fed and fasting states except for prolonged fasting, which uses ketones. Notably, the daily amount of glucose used by the brain accounts for 70% of the total glucose produced by the liver in a normal fasting person.

Initially, during the first hours of fasting, hepatic glycogenolysis is the primary source of glucose. Glucose stored as glycogen can cover the energy needs roughly for one day; the amount of glucose supplied by glycogen reserves is 190 g, while the daily requirements for glucose are 160 g. After several hours of starvation, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis contribute equally to blood glucose. The amount of glucose supplied by glycogen decreases rapidly while the increase in the glucose fraction contributed by gluconeogenesis results in keepingÂ constant the total amount of glucose produced. Estimates are that 54% of glucose comes from gluconeogenesis after 14 hours of starvation, and this contribution rises to 64% after 22 hours and up to 84% after 42 hours.

Alanine, produced in skeletal muscles by protein catabolism and subsequent transamination reactions, is shuttled out in blood and taken up by the liver. Inside hepatocytes, alanine undergoes transamination into pyruvate, used for gluconeogenesis. Glucose produced in the liver is shuttled out in circulation and taken up by muscle cells for use in ATP production (Cahill cycle). Other gluconeogenic amino acids (e.g., methionine, histidine, valine) and gluconeogenic and ketogenic (e.g., phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, tryptophane) become transaminated into different intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway.****

In red blood cells and other tissues (lens) that lack mitochondria and the exercising muscle tissue that favors anaerobic metabolism, glucose is converted to pyruvate and subsequently to lactate. Lactate is secreted into plasma and picked up by the liver for conversion into glucose (Cori cycle) via a redox reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase.

Fatty acids are stored as triglycerides and mobilized by the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL); glycerol from the triglyceride structure is released in blood to be taken up by the liver, phosphorylated by glycerol kinase, and oxidized into dihydroxyacetone phosphate -an intermediate of gluconeogenesis/ glycolysis pathway- by glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase. In contrast to the ketogenic even-chain fatty acids, Odd-chain fatty acids are converted into propionyl CoA during beta-oxidation. After several steps, propionyl CoA is converted into methylmalonyl CoA. Methylmalonyl CoA mutase/B12 catalyzes the conversion of the latter into succinyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA is an intermediate of the TCA cycle that is eventually converted into oxaloacetic acid and enters the gluconeogenesis pathway. Even-chain fatty acids and purely ketogenic amino acids (leucine, lysine) converted to acetyl-CoA cannot enter gluconeogenesis because the step is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is irreversible.

In certain conditions, such as ischemic strokes and brain tumor development, astrocytes have increased activity of gluconeogenic enzymes, and they use lactate, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate as substrates.

**Regulation of Gluconeogenesis**

Multiple factors contribute to the regulation of substrates, enzymes, and reactions involved in gluconeogenesis, including:

- Glucagon regulates gluconeogenesis through
- Changes in allosteric regulators (reduces the levels of fructose-2,6 bisphosphate)
- Covalent modification of enzyme activity (phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase results in its inactivation)
- Induction of enzymes gene expression (glucagon via CRE response elements increases the expression of PEPCK

- Acetyl CoA activates pyruvate carboxylase allosterically

- Substrate availability might increase or decrease the rate of gluconeogenesis

- AMP inhibits fructose-1,6 bisphosphatase allosterically

For gluconeogenesis to occur, the ADP/ATP ratio must be very low since gluconeogenesis is an energy-demanding process requiring high energy molecules to be spent in several steps.
