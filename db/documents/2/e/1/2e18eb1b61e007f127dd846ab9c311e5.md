**Treatment of Nocturnal Oxygen Desaturation**

The most appropriate and well-established therapeutic option for COPD-OSA overlap is positive airway pressure (PAP). Studies have shown that patients with hypoxemia, COPD, and concomitant OSA treated with PAP have an increased survival rate than those who refuse PAP therapy.

Likewise, PAP therapyÂ for patients with overlap syndrome was associated with fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits from any cause, a lower rate of severe acute COPD exacerbations, and lower healthcare costs.

**OSA Predominant**

- Standard treatment is continuous PAP (CPAP) or auto-adjusting CPAP mode.

**COPD Predominant**

- When deciding on the type of PAP therapy for COPD-predominant overlap syndrome, it is essential to consider the phenotypic differences of COPD. The emphysematous type may have increased sleep-related hypoventilation due to anatomical changes resulting in the downward displacement of the diaphragm and accessory muscle paralysis during REM sleep. These patients have been shown to benefit from CPAP or EPAP to nullify patients' auto-PEEP. This therapy also supports ventilation and reduces muscle fatigue. Titrating the CPAP is crucial, and studies have shown that if the applied PEEP exceeds auto-PEEP, this can increase the expiratory load and thus dampen ventilation and worsen lung function.

- In the chronic bronchitic phenotype, BiPAP is more appropriate as it supports ventilation and has been shown to improve quality of life and dyspnea and reduce mortality and hospitalizations.

- Recent studies evaluate high-intensity NIV use, particularly in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. This strategy utilizes high IPAP settings and backup respiratory rate to achieve increased minute ventilation to normalize PaCO2. This strategy is currently under investigation.

- To summarize, the choice of PAP depends mainly on the phenotype predominating in overlap syndrome. For OSA, the standard choice is CPAP. With COPD, it depends on whether obesity or emphysema predominates. With the chronic bronchitis phenotype and increased BMI, BiPAP is the preferred choice. When emphysematous COPD with hypoventilation predominates, high-intensity NIV is still currently being evaluated and may be of benefit.

**Pharmacologic Therapies**

- Patients suffering from nocturnal hypoxemia have shown benefits with inhaled long-acting beta-agonist and anticholinergic treatment, with mean nocturnal oxygen saturation around 2% to 3% greater on each treatment compared to placebo alone, although neither medication affects sleep quality.

- Theophylline also reduces nocturnal hypoxemia and has been shown to benefit OSA by reducing the AHI. The proposed mechanism is stimulation of the central respiratory drive and may be more beneficial in central sleep apnea. Side effects limit the use of this medication.

- The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is still currently under debate. A study has shown improvement in AHI, nocturnal hypoxemia, daytime PaCO2, and improved lung function by decreasing inflammation. Unfortunately, other studies demonstrate that ICS may increase myopathy risk, leading to worsening upper airway collapsibility.

- Respiratory stimulants such as acetazolamide are not recommended in the setting of overlap syndrome. Their use has been shown to improve oxygenation; however, clinical benefit has not been demonstrated. Additionally, such medications' side effect profiles can potentially cause harm, such as worsening respiratory acidosis in severe COPD.

**Supplemental Oxygen**

- Supplemental nocturnal oxygen may be necessary when considerable NODs continue after the patient's medication regimen has been optimized, particularly in individuals with COPD. Supplemental oxygen does not appear to be related to an increased risk of hypercapnia in these patients.

- Supplemental oxygenation can improve nocturnal oxygenation. However, studies have demonstrated that nocturnal oxygen alone increases obstructive events. Earlier studies on nocturnal supplemental oxygen in apnea-prone COPD patients showed increased PVCs. Oxygen in this population should be used cautiously when the individual has known CAD or left ventricular dysfunction. Thus oxygen therapy alone is not recommended for the treatment of overlap syndrome.

- In the recent International Nocturnal Oxygen (INOX) trial, nocturnal supplemental oxygen did not reduce mortality or delay the progression of long-term oxygen therapy in COPD patients with nocturnal hypoxemia.

- Studies have suggested that the effects of nasal high-flow air on a nocturnal gas exchange may be superior to those of oxygen supplementation. It may also benefit OSA by providing a stimulating effect on breathing.

**Lifestyle Modifications**

- In both OSA and COPD, structured exercise programs and pulmonary rehabilitation have been demonstrated to improve AHI, daytime sleepiness, and overall sleep quality. Particularly in COPD patients, structured exercise regimens are intended to address skeletal muscle atrophy.

- Pulmonary rehab has been shown to improve mood index, dyspnea scores, and quality of life and reduce hospitalization frequency.

- Weight loss has well-documented benefits for patients with OSA and obesity. Conversely, cachexia is associated with increased mortality in patients with advanced COPD. There is a clear distinction between therapeutic goal-directed weight loss and cachexia as part of the pathologic process in the end stages of COPD. As stated above, COPD patients can benefit significantly from a structured exercise program such as pulmonary rehabilitation.

- All patients must be counseled on smoking cessation, and this will reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with overlap syndrome.
