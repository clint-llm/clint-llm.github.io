Early diagnosis leads to expedited treatment with excellent functional outcomes. Surgery within 10 days after the injury correlates with excellent patient-reported outcomes.

Patients may return to sports with both full active functional range of motion and the absence of pain (approximately 8 to 12 weeks).

Functional consequences of impaired DIP joint motion includes loss of dexterity and loss of pinch strength.

Postoperative functional and aesthetic results depend on accurate reduction, repair quality, and an adequate rehabilitation protocol. Prevention of scar contracture formation is crucial to maintain finger function.
