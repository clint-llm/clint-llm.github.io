Complications of posterior shoulder dislocations include osteonecrosis, posttraumatic arthritis, and joint stiffness. Osteonecrosis of the humeral head may occur after a simple dislocation but is more commonly seen with associated fracture-dislocations of the anatomic neck.

Surgical complications for recurrent posterior shoulder instability are unique to the specific procedure performed. Complications of open treatment include infection, pain, weakness, and shoulder stiffness.

The most common complication following surgical treatment of posterior shoulder instability is the recurrence of instability with rates varying depending on treatment method and cause of instability. DeLong et al. found an 8.1% rate of recurrence in over 800 shoulders treated via arthroscopic treatment as well as a recurrence rate of 19.4% in over 300 shoulders undergoing open surgical procedures.
