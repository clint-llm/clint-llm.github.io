Cefepime has a similar mechanism of action to other beta-lactams. Cefepime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by covalently binding enzymes responsible for the final step in transpeptidation during peptidoglycan wall synthesis. This binding causes defects in the cell wall leading to autolysis and subsequent death of the organism.

Cefepime has increased gram-negative coverage and is more stable against beta-lactamases when compared to third-generation cephalosporins due to a few mechanisms. One such mechanism is that penicillin-binding enzymes have a lower affinity for cefepime. Another is the chemical structure differs from older generations with a substitution of a side chain, lending it more activity against staphylococcal species. Cefepime is also a zwitterion giving it an advantage for faster cell wall penetration of gram-negative bacteria, which is why it has broader gram-negative coverage than the third-generation.

Cefepime, like most cephalosporins, is widely distributed throughout body tissue and fluids, including pleural fluid, synovial fluid, bones, cerebral spinal fluid, and breast milk. Cefepime rapidly metabolizes with less than 10% of the metabolized product undergoing excretion. The remaining compound gets excreted through glomerular filtration as an unchanged drug. The half-life is about 2 to 2.3 hours and is longer in patients with renal failure.
