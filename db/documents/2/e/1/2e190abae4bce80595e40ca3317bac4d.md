The C-shaped cartilages of the trachea are connected posteriorly by a membranous wall, and a longitudinal strip of smooth muscle called the trachealis muscle that is in contact with the anterior esophagus. The trachealis muscle functions to constrict the airway by pulling the cartilages together, allowing for increased expiratory force during coughing. Smooth muscle contained in the walls of the lower conducting airways is necessary for bronchoconstriction.
