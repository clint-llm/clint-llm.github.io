Most patients present to the clinic between ages 3Â to 5 when parents generally become concerned about knocked kneed appearance. Bilateral genu valgum in this age group is typically physiologic but can also be secondary to skeletal dysplasia such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and chondroectodermal dysplasia (Ellis van Creveld syndrome), metabolic bone diseases such as rickets (renal osteodystrophy and hypophosphatemic rickets), and lysosomal storage disease such as Morquio syndrome. Unilateral genu valgum is most often secondary to physeal or metaphyseal trauma. Radiographs should be assessed for physeal narrowing, premature closing, and the presence of growth recovery lines (Park-Harris lines), giving attention to their morphology.

Cozen phenomenon is a post-traumatic valgus deformity seen after proximal tibial fractures.
