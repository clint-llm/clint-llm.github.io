Preoperatively, a marking pen is needed to denote the location of the tear troughs and NLFs. The patient, even under general anesthesia, will benefit from injection with local anesthetic or a tumescent solution to lessen the requirement for anesthetic drugs and to improve hemostasis. Surgical prep can be performed with either betadine or isopropyl alcohol, the latter of which provides the benefit of not obscuring the patient's skin color and texture subtleties, and does not need to be cleaned off after the procedure; however, it must not be allowed to make contact with the corneas, which it can damage severely.

Intraoperatively, a #15 blade scalpel is used for incisions and removal of excess skin. A set of facelift instruments with scissors, such as Gorney-Freeman or Goldman-Fox, a retractor and light source, fine and heavy forceps, needle drivers, and electrocautery are necessary as well. Several different sutures may be used, but many surgeons prefer heavy, 2-0 polyester or polydioxanone material to suspend the ptotic soft tissues, with 4-0, 5-0, and 6-0 sutures for skin closure.

Postoperatively, a bulky dressing is applied using fluff sponges, gauze rolls, and a compressive wrap, often in the form of a Barton dressing or similar.Â Ice packs are recommended to limit bruising and swelling, and drains may be placed, depending on the extent of dissection and the amount of bleeding encountered.
