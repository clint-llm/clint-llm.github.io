**Prothesis Infection**

The infection rate post-RTSA ranges from 1 % to 10 %.**.**

**Prothesis Instability and Dislocation**

The reported prosthesis dislocation rate after RTSA is about 3.6%.

**Axillary Nerve Palsy**

Transient axillary nerve neuropraxia may result from nerve traction caused by the arm position during glenoid exposure.

**Scapular Notching**

Mechanical impingement of the humeral prosthesis against the scapular neck may result in scapular notching.

Sirveaux classified the scapular RTSA notching based on the extend of scapular bony defects in X-rays into four grades:

- Grade 1; scapular bony defects are confined to the pillar

- Grade 2; scapular bony defects extend to the glenoid baseplate lower screw

- Grade 3; scapular bony defects extend beyond the glenoid baseplate lower screw.

- Grade 4; loose glenoid base plate

**Base Plate Failure**

The glenoid baseplate failure can result from increased motion at the baseplate–bone interface and inadequate bone growth into the plate. Several advancements in prosthesis design have been introduced to overcome this mode of prosthesis failure. The use of variable angle locking screws to fix the base plate has been suggested to engage the dense bone in the coracoid base scapular spine.

**Other Less Common Complications After RTSA**

- Iatrogenic intraoperative Periprosthetic fracture

- Vascular injury

- Heterotopic ossification

- Surgical scar complications
