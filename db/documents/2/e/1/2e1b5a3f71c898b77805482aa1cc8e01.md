Adjacent epidermal structures other than melanin within the hair bulb can compete for absorption, and may cause laser energy to be absorbed by pigment in the epidermis. This hampers the effectiveness of the treatmentÂ and causes adverse effects due to adjacent epithelial damage.

Common adverse effects of laser or IPL-based hair removal include post-treatment erythema, pain, and burning.

More severe adverse effects include blistering, crusting, dyspigmentation, purpura, and sometimes scarring.
