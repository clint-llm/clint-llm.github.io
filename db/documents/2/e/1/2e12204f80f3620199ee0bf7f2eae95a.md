The dissociated vertical deviation is a rare form of squint, and it might be challenging for the evaluating optometrist/ophthalmologist to choose the best suitable management option. A thorough history, visual acuity, examination details, and parents' concerns related to the condition be helpful to choose the best-customized treatment plan for each patient. Observation with or without patching along with refractive correction can be sufficient for most of the patients. Surgery can be reserved for patients with frequent deviations, large degrees of deviation, large degrees of anomalous head posture, or apprehensive parents.
