The pathophysiology of ascites and pleural effusion in Meigs syndrome is not well established. Meigs theorized that ascites are due to the pressure of the tumor on the abdominal lymphatics, and the ascitic fluid then transudates into the pleural cavity. He demonstrated the presence of India ink particles in the thoracic cavity when injected into the ascitic fluid.

Another theory is fluid enters the peritoneum through the ovarian tumor capsule. The fluid can enter the pleural cavity through diaphragmatic defects or via the lymphatic channels to cause pleural effusion.

Stromal edema may lead to transudation due to changes in venous and lymphatic drainage. An imbalance between the blood supply to a large tumor and its venous and lymphatic drainage may be responsible for stromal edema and transudation.

The other proposed theories are hormonal stimulation, torsion of the tumor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by the tumor, increasing capillary permeability. However, these theories are not proven, and there is no consensus on the pathophysiology of Meigs syndrome.
