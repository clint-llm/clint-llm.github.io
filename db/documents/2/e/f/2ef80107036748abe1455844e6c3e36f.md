**Polymerase Chain Reaction**

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)Â is a method of rapidly amplifying DNA. It is used clinically to test for the presence of specific bacteria and viruses in patients with certain diseases. Nucleic acid amplification testing uses PCR and is used to diagnose chlamydia. Also, reverse transcriptase PCR is used to detect HIV.

**Southern Blot**

Southern blotting is done by separating DNA fragments through electrophoresis, and then transferred the DNA from the electrophoresis gel to a filter. The filter is then washed with radioactively labeled hybridization probes that target for the DNA sequence of interest. Once the probes bind, the filter is exposed to x-ray, and the probes marking the DNA of interest are visible. Southern blot can be useful clinically for detecting mutations in certain DNA sequences.
