Echinococcosis is a zoonotic larval infection that infects humans globally. The parasite Echinococcus causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global burden of controlling the disease exceeds three billion US dollars annually.

There are several identified species of Echinococcosis, four of which are of concern in humans:

- Echinococcus granulosus:Â infections cause cystic echinococcosis, also called hydatidosis.

- Echinococcus multilocularis: infections cause alveloar echinocccosis.

- Echinococcus vogeli: infections cause polycystic echinococcosis.

- Echinococcus oligarthrus: infections cause polycystic echinococcosis.

This article will discuss and summarize the essential aspects of Echinococcus granulosus infections.
