Only sufficiently trained surgeons who are comfortable with the anatomy involved and experienced in performing middle ear surgery for otosclerosis should proceed with stapedectomy. It is continually more evident that the procedure chosen to remedy a patientâ€™s conductive hearing loss, whether it be complete or partial stapedectomy, stapedotomy, or stapes mobilization and the utilization of lasers versus drills versus plain instrumentation (handpick) is less critical than the proficiency of the surgeon performing them. If a surgeon is obtaining a 90% closure of the ABG and less than a 1% chance of worsening sensorineural hearing, then there is no need to change the technique being used.
