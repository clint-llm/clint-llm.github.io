The greater saphenous vein (GSV) is the longest vein in the body and is the most common site for venous cutdown. It is part of the superficial venous collecting system of the lower extremity originating in the foot and traveling up the medial leg and upper thigh where it enters the femoral vein within the femoral triangle. Specifically, at the foot, it originates at the confluence of the dorsal vein of the first digit and the dorsal venous arch of the foot. It travels up the medial leg alongside the saphenous nerve which must be preserved during vein harvesting. At the knee, it runs over the posterior border of the medial condyle of the femur bone. It takes a slightly lateral course along the anteromedial thigh before entering an opening in the fascia lata called the saphenous opening at the saphenofemoral junction. Anatomic consistency and its superficial location at the ankle anterior to the medial malleolus make the GSV an ideal target vessel for cutdown allowing rapid access and minimal dissection. It is also the most commonly used conduit for cardiovascular bypass operations.
