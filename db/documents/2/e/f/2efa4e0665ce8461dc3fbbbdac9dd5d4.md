Numerous situations can lead to false-positive interpretations, including image artifacts, normal tissue uptake of 18-FDG, and benign inflammatory processes and tumors.

Image artifacts from high-density objects (such as metal implants or contrast) can result in falsely high SUV (due to computer attenuation correction error when the average x-ray photon energy is less than the PET’s 511 keV photon annihilation energy). In addition, misalignment between fused PET and CT data can cause photon attenuation correction artifacts that result in incorrect SUVs. For this type of artifact, the PET images can be interpreted without using computer software that is pre-set to correct for tissue photon attenuation.

Normal 18-FDG physiologic uptake in the head and neck can occur from:

- Thyroid and salivary glands

- Brown adipose and lymphoid tissue (e.g., thymus)

- Orbital, speech, and swallowing muscles (especially in children)

- Other skeletal muscles used prior to or during the exam, and

- Smooth muscle (particularly within the gastrointestinal tract).

Muscle uptake increases in the setting of hyperinsulinemia. The tissue density’s Hounsfield units (HU) should be measured using CT to differentiate brown fat from abnormal tissue.  If the tissue average HU measures -50 to –150, then it can be concluded that the tissue is fat.

The list of inflammatory processes that can mimic cancer is extensive, and only several (iatrogenic ones) are mentioned here:

- Post-surgical/biopsy inflammation, infection, or hematoma

- Post-radiation/post-chemotherapy inflammation

- Inflammation from therapy is indirectly related to cancer therapy (e.g., tracheostomy site, feeding, and drainage tubes).

If patients have active infection or hematoma, then the PET-CT scan will likely indicate a false-positive result.

The list of benign tumors, hyperplastic conditions (e.g., bone marrow hyperplasia after chemotherapy), and dysplastic conditions (e.g., fibrous dysplasia) that can increase SUVs in the head, and neck tissues are also extensive.

The following list details situations that can lead to false-negative FDG-PET/CT interpretation:

- Small lesion size (<2x the resolution of the imaging system, usually between 8 to 10 mm)

- Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia

- Recent medical therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, steroid therapy)

- Tumors with low metabolic activity (such as medullary thyroid cancer and adenocarcinoma)

There are other situations where PET-CT can lead to a correct conclusion of malignancy but not be able to distinguish between types of malignancy. For example, lymphoma is difficult to differentiate from HNC based on imaging; the presence of associated mucosal lesions and/or necrotic nodes favors a diagnosis of HNC.
