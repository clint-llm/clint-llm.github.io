Imaging

Standard radiographs are the initial step in evaluating coronoid fractures after the physical exam. Anterior-posterior, lateral, and oblique views are standard images to obtain. The lateral view may often be the best image to appreciate the size and displacement of the coronoid fracture.

Computed tomography (CT) scans can often be helpful in better characterizing these fractures as interpreting plain film radiographs can be difficult due to overlapping cortical lines.

Classifications

Traditionally, the Regan and Morrey classification has been used to describe coronoid fractures based on the amount of the process that is involved. Type one fractures include only the tip of the coronoid. Type two fractures involve 50% or less of the coronoid height; whereas, type three fractures involve large fragments over 50% of the coronoid height.

The O’Driscoll classification system provides a more comprehensive scheme, which importantly brings attention to fractures involving the anteromedial facet.
