The QLB differs from the TAP. It is a block of the posterior abdominal wall. It is also referred to as an interfascial plane block because it requires the injection of a local anesthetic into the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF), which is a posterior extension of the abdominal wall muscle fascia and encompasses the back muscles (quadratus lumborum [QL], psoas major [PM], and the erector spinae [ES] muscles). The TLF extends posteriorly to connect with the lumbar paravertebral region. It has 3 layers – anterior, middle, and posterior – based on its relation to the back muscles it encapsulates. The TLF extends from the lumbar spine to the thoracic spine in a craniocaudal direction.

The TLF contains mechanoreceptors, nociceptors, and sympathetic fibers. The spread of local anesthetic to the paravertebral space and inhibition of these sympathetic fibers is believed to be responsible for the visceral pain coverage provided by this block.

Variants of this block have been described, each involving a different injection site relative to the quadratus lumborum muscle. QL1 or lateral QLB refers to the deposition of local anesthetic lateral to the QL muscle. QL2 or posterior QLB refers to injection posterior to the QL muscle (anterior to the TLF separating QL muscle from erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscles) in an area termed the "lumbar interfascial triangle." QL3 or anterior QLB, also referred to as the transmuscular approach due to the typical needle approach, refers to injection anterior to the QL muscle at the level of the L4 vertebral body. To acquire the ultrasound view for this block, the clinician should obtain the "shamrock sign," which consists of the transverse process of L4 as the "stem" and psoas major, QL, and erector spinae as "3 cloves of the shamrock."
