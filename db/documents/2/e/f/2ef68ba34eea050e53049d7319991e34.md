The following is a list of adverse effects of fibrates:

- The most common adverse effects of this drug class include reporting of deranged AST, ALT levels, along with infrequent elevations in serum CPK (creatinine phosphokinase) levels during therapy.

- Most likely, due to the effect mediated by PPAR-alpha, fibrates can reversibly increase serum creatinine and homocysteine levels. But clinical trials have failed to prove renal failure associated with this.

- Patients can present with leg cramps, abdominal pain, etc., as fibrates can cause a slightly increased risk (less than 1.0%) of myopathy, cholelithiasis, and venous thrombosis.

- Fibrates generally should be avoided in combination with statins since they can inhibit statin metabolism, causing an increased risk of myopathy. Recommendations are to always to measure serum creatinine levels and renal function before using the two drugs simultaneously. Gemfibrozil has proved to be unsafe for this interaction, whereas clinicians can still use bezafibrate and fenofibrate.

- Discontinue fibrate therapy or reduce the fibrate dose if a clinically significant elevation of serum creatinine occurs in the patient, after excluding all possible causes for the same.
