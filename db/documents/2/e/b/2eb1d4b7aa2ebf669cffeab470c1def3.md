Hepatitis D virus (HDV) was discovered in 1977 in patients with chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Originally thought to be an unrecognized HBV antigen, the HDV nuclear antigen was later discovered to be a part of a new pathogen, initially known as the delta agent. HDV is considered a hybrid virus as it uses Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as its envelope protein and therefore is only able to infect patients that concomitantly harbor the HBV. For unknown reasons, HBV replication is suppressed in HDV-infected individuals. This activity outlines the presentation, evaluation, and management of hepatitis D and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Hepatitis D infection is caused by the Hepatitis D virus. 
- Hepatitis D is clinically similar to other forms of hepatic viral infections. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic. Signs and symptoms can include fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, confusion, bruising, or bleeding depending on the severity of illness.
- Treatment options for hepatitis D are limited and optimal treatment is not known. There are no known treatments for acute hepatitis D. Although; it is not FDA-approved for chronic hepatitis D, interferon alpha (IFN alpha) has been shown to be beneficial in most clinical trials. When the disease progresses to cirrhosis, liver transplantation is the only viable option.
- Hepatitis D virus is not one of the common viruses inflicting the liver. When diagnosed, it is important to have a multi disciplinary approach including the Hepatologist as treatment options are very limited. For advanced liver disease, a liver transplantation may be needed.
