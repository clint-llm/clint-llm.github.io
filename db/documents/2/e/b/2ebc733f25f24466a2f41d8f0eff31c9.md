Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem. Resistance genes exist for all known antibiotics in use today, and extremely resistant pathogens are becoming more common. Gram-negative bacteria have developed the broadest spectrum of resistance due to multiple structural adaptations and antibiotic degradation enzymes, including expanded spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), AmpC cephalosporinases, and carbapenemases. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are of particular concern.

Carbapenem antibiotics are typically reserved for treating ESBL and AmpC producing bacteria.

Care is necessary when diagnosing, treating, and preventing CRE infections. Bacteria may have multiple resistance mechanisms to carbapenems, but the most common is carbapenemase enzyme production.Enterobacteriaceae (cpCRE) use diverse moieties to degrade antibiotics. Other resistance mechanisms include increased efflux pump-action and specific porin blocking at the bacterial cell membrane to limit permeability of the antibiotics, rendering them ineffective.
