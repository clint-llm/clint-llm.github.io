If the diagnosis is in question, consultation with either a neurologist or physiatrist is necessary.  Referral to an electrodiagnostic laboratory is essential to confirm the localization of injury and determine severity, which impacts the outcome. Referral to physical therapy for gait evaluation and fall prevention, and brace management is indicated. Consultation with an Orthotist is necessary whether the patient requires a temporary brace while awaiting regeneration of the nerve or a permanent brace in case of poor recovery.  Psychiatric referral, hematology, oncology, neurosurgery, and orthopedic surgery may all have potential roles in the patient's comprehensive care presenting with foot drop.
