Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common valvular abnormalities, second only to aortic valve stenosis.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the initial imaging modality for screening and evaluating mitral valve morphology and pathology, determining the mechanism of Mitral regurgitation, and quantifying MR severity, assessment of Left ventricular function, size, and Left atrial size.

**[Table 1] Etiology of Mitral Regurgitation**

Infectious (Infective endocarditis, vegetation, perforation)

Inflammatory (Rheumatic, collagen vascular disease)

Drug-induced,

Radiation-induced

**[Table 2] Stages of Primary Mitral Regurgitation**

Moderate - Severe LA, LV enlargement

C1  LVEF >60%, LVESD <40 mm

C2  LVEF <60%, LVESD >/=40 mm

Recent studies have shown Percutaneous MV repair as an alternative option for high-surgical-risk patients with severe symptomatic Mitral regurgitation. The procedure can be accomplished with low morbidity and mortality rates in a substantial portion.

Many percutaneous options exist for patients with MR, multi-system dysfunction, and comorbidities, which may put them at high risk for surgical interventions.

This article will discuss primary and secondary mitral regurgitation and non-invasive catheter management options, including indications, contraindications, procedural techniques, and complications. We will discuss the FDA-approved edge-to-edge repair devices as the primary focus.
