**Congenital Esotropia**

The main factor responsible for congenital esotropia is the innervational imbalances between fusional convergence and divergence mechanisms. Since the fusional convergence mechanisms are more robust of the amplitude of >30prism diopters, compared to fusional divergence mechanisms of the amplitude of 4 to 6 prism diopters, the esodeviations, even though intermittent in onset, tend to become constant quickly with poor stereo acuity.

**Accommodative Esotropia**

The underlying pathophysiology is blurred retinal image secondary to uncorrected hypermetropia. This retinal blurring leads to extra accommodative efforts leading to excessive accommodative convergence. Further, the development of esotropia depends on the fusional divergence capacity and AC/A ratio. Those with insufficient fusional divergence develop refractive accommodative esotropia or esophoria, while those with low AC/A ratio usually remain orthotropic.

**Non-Accommodative Esotropia**

The main etiopathogenesis is an excessive accommodative convergence associated with the normal amplitude of accommodation (3 to 5 prism dioptres). This deviation is usually small and intermittent at onset and becomes constant over time. Also, the near deviation is more with no or minimal deviation for distance.

**Partially Accommodative Esotropia**

The underlying cause is an uncorrected high hypermetropia, with a normal AC/A ratio and the deviation that is partially corrected with the help of spectacles.
