Acute cholangitis is a life-threatening medical condition that can be treated if identified early. High clinical suspicion is necessary to correctly diagnosis this condition. It rarely presents with the classic triad of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Ultrasound can be useful; however, CT is often required to aid in diagnosis and identify potential sources of obstruction. Early antibiotics and fluid resuscitation are key to initial management. Early consultation with gastroenterologists and surgical specialties is essential.Â Be mindful that many individuals require biliary decompression and intensive care management.
