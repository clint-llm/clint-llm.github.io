The diagnosis and management of necrotizing enterocolitis requires an interprofessional team approach. Diagnosis may be challenging given the vague and variable symptoms. The initial evaluation is often by an emergency department physician. Radiologists play a critical role in determining the presence of pneumatosis intestinalis, which is pathognomonic for NEC. Once the diagnosis is made, the initiation of treatment requires involvement of a large team of professionals. Nurses play a vital role in establishing vascular access for antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and lab analysis. Early surgical consult is paramount.

These infants are typically admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, with a consult to a neonatal intensivist. Again, nursing staff plays a key role in frequent assessment, as the patient's condition may change quickly. Pharmacists will be involved in the antibiotic selection and dosing for these patients. A nutritionist must be involved for the initiation of total parenteral nutrition. An interprofessional team approach is vital to improve the outcomes for patients suffering from necrotizing enterocolitis.
