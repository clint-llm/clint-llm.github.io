Once the clinician has determined that the injury is ligamentous and other structures are intact, the treatment is conservative care in most cases.

For mild cases of acute wrist sprain: rest, elevation, and ice with emphasis on mobilization will work, and most patients will feel better in 24 to 48 hours. For patients with a suspected sprain and negative MRI findings, immediate mobilization has been shown to have quicker recovery and improvement of range of motion compared to immobilization with a cast.

Moderate to severe injuries may require the use of a semi-rigid brace, soft lace-up brace, or a volar/dorsal forearm splint to allow protection and healing of the injury. The decision to undergo, as well as the length of conservative therapy, is dependent on multiple factors such as demands of the patient (e.g., professional athletes), functionality, pain, chronicity, disability, etc.

If not improving after conservative therapy or if there is a definite ligament tear or full rupture, then further imaging, if not already obtained, may be indicated to determine the need for surgical evaluation. If the situation indicates the need for surgery, surgical fixation, and debridement via arthroscopic or open approaches are common treatment modalities. When possible, arthroscopic approaches carry the benefit of the preservation of joint capsule, less damage to soft tissues, and less reduction in joint mobility when compared to open procedures.
