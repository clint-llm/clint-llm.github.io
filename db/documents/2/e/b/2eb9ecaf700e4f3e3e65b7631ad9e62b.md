Vitamin B1 is one of the eight B vitamins, also known as thiamin (thiamine). Because thiamin can only be stored in the body for a short time before it is readily excreted, a regular dietary intake of thiamin is necessary to maintain proper blood levels. The recommended daily intake (RDI) for adults over age eighteen is 1.2 mg/day for men and 1.1 mg/day for women. For children, adequate intake levels are lower. Women of any age who are pregnant should increase their daily intake of thiamin to 1.4 mg/day. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring of vitamin B1 so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the physiological role/mechanism of action of thiamine (vitamin B1).
- Describe the signs and symptoms of thiamine deficiency.
- Review appropriate dosing of thiamine for patients exhibiting deficiency.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use vitamin B1 to improve patient outcomes for indicated deficiencies.
