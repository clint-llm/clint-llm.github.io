There are indications for late preterm, early term, late-term, and post-term timing of delivery depending on a patient's obstetrical and medical history. IOL is indicated when it is thought that the outcomes for the fetus, the mother, or both are better than with expectant management, that is, waiting for the spontaneous onset of labor.

- Oligohydramnios with the timing at 36 0/7 to 37 6/7 weeks of gestation

- Fetal intrauterine growth restriction, with no abnormal Doppler, with the timing at 38 0/7 to 39 6/7 weeks of gestation

- Fetal intrauterine growth restriction, with absent end-diastolic flow, with the timing at 34 0/7 weeks of gestation

- Fetal intrauterine growth restriction, with reversed end-diastolic flow, with the timing at 32 0/7 weeks of gestation

- Chronic hypertension, not on medications, with the timing at 38 0/7 to 39 6/7 weeks of gestation

- Gestational hypertension with the timing at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation or at the time of diagnosis if diagnosed later

- Preeclampsia without severe features with the timing at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation or at the time of diagnosis if diagnosed later

- Preeclampsia with severe features with the timing at 34 0/7 weeks of gestation or at the time of diagnosis if diagnosed later

- Pregestational diabetes well-controlled, with the timing at 39 0/7 to 39 6/7 weeks of gestation

- Gestational diabetes (GDM), diet, or exercise controlled, with the timing at 39 0/7 to 40 6/7 weeks of gestation

- Preterm prelaborÂ rupture of membranes (PPROM) with the timing at 34 0/7 weeks of gestation or at the time of diagnosis if diagnosed laterLate-term with the timing at 41 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation

- Abruptio placentae

- Chorioamnionitis

- Intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD)

Labor may also be induced for logistic reasons, such as the risk of rapid labor, distance from the hospital, or psychosocial indications. In such circumstances, fetal lung maturity should be established. In the absence of appropriate clinical circumstances, a mature fetal lung test result before 39 weeks of gestation is not an indication for delivery.
