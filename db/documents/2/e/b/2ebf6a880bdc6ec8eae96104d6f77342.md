As hyperemesis gravidarum involves at least two patients, both the mother and the fetus(s) must be considered when discussing complications.

**Maternal Complications**

In severe cases of hyperemesis, complications include vitamin deficiency, dehydration, and malnutrition, if not treated appropriately. Wernicke encephalopathy, caused by vitamin-B1 deficiency, can lead to death and permanent disability ifÂ left untreated.

**Fetal Complications**

Studies report conflicting information regarding the incidence of low birth weight and premature infants in the setting of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.
