The inferior rectus and the superior rectus areÂ vertical rectus muscles. The medial and lateral rectus muscles are the horizontal rectus muscles. Each rectus muscle originates posteriorly at the annulus of Zinn and courses anteriorly.

Each rectus muscle inserts on the globe at varying distances from the limbus, and the curved line drawn along the insertion points makes a spiral known as the Spiral of Tillaux. Starting at the medial aspect of the globe, the medial rectus inserts at 5.5 mm from the limbus, the inferior rectus inserts at 6.5 mm from the limbus, the lateral rectus inserts at 6.9 mm from the limbus, and the superior rectus at 7.7 mm from the limbus.

The inferior rectus is 9.8 mm wide at its insertion on the globe. The tendon is 7 mm in length, measured from the origin. The entire length of the muscle is 40 mm.

Extraocular muscles have a large ratio of nerve fibers to skeletal muscle fibers. The ratio is 1:3 to 1:5; other skeletal muscles have a ratio of 1:50 to 1:125. Extraocular muscles are a specialized form of skeletal muscle with various fiber types, including slow tonic types, which resist fatigue, and saccadic (rapid) type muscle fibers.
