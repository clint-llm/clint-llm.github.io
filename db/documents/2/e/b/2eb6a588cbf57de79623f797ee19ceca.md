The most important prognostic value in patients with acute compartment syndrome of the forearm is the time to diagnosis and fasciotomy. Reports suggest a rate of fasciotomy between 2% to 24% in acute compartment syndrome patients. This is mainly due to uncertainties in diagnosing this condition. The timing of the diagnosis and immediate surgical intervention is critical and limb saving. Delayed diagnosis can have devastating consequences on the patient. Prognosis varies from full recovery to amputation depending on the time of presentation, symptoms at presentation (absent pulses, as well as paralysis of the affected limb, are signs associated with late presentations), time to diagnosis, and surgical intervention.
