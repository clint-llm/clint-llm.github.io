Traditionally, Actinomyces israelii was thought to be the organism responsible for canaliculitis, causing this condition to be variously named as streptothrix canaliculitis or streptothricosis.Bacillus. Recent studies, however, demonstrate an increased incidence of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. Many other organisms like Eikenella, Lactococcus, Nocardia, and fungi also have been isolated from patients with canaliculitis. Studies have demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common organism isolated in plug-associated canaliculitis; whereas, other studies implicate Hemophilus species, Actinomyces species along with Pseudomonas.
