Up to 91% of patients receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer and 20% to 40% of patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapyÂ will develop mucositis.

The importance of basic oral care measures, irritant avoidance, and appropriate diet should be emphasized by all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), dentists, and nurses. An interprofessional group of specialists should be in charge of managing oral mucositis cases to improve patients' outcomes.
