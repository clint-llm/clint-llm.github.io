The primary presentation of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is anginal chest pain in >90%, followed by an angina equivalent. Peripartum patients tend to present with serious complications like ventricular arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or even sudden cardiac death. Elevation in jugular venous pressure with positive hepatojugular reflux, bilateral pitting pedal edema, and crepitations in the lung is present due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.

Delayed mentation and delayed capillary refill are common in congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock from pump failure. The cardiovascular system examination may reveal sinus tachycardia and S3 gallop rhythm with anterior wall MI and congestive heart failure, sinus bradycardia, and complete heart block when the right coronary artery is involved.

A pansystolic murmur from an acute mitral regurgitation may be present when anterior wall MI is complicated by papillary muscle rupture, predominantly posteromedial papillary muscle, which is supplied by RCA only; and ventricular septal defect from acute septal wall rupture.

Distant heart sounds, raised jugular venous pressure, hypotension, and pulsus paradoxus suggest pericardial tamponade from free wall rupture. While the patient is in the hospital, daily cardiovascular system examinations are important to diagnose post-MI complications in a timely manner.

Comprehensive vascular physical examination may give clues about FMD and potential extra coronary vascular abnormalities associated with SCAD. A bounding pulse may suggest an aneurysm, while a diminished and asymmetrical pulse with a bruit may indicate a stenotic or dissected artery. The presence of an epigastric and flank bruit may suggest renal FMD, while a carotid bruit may suggest extracranial carotid artery involvement.
