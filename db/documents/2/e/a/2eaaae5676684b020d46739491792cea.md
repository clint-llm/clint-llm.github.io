The most common presenting symptoms for cardiac sarcoidosis include palpitations, pre-syncope, and syncope. Palpitations could be due to a number of conduction disorders, including AV blocks, atrial fibrillation, or other supraventricular tachycardias.

An autopsy study in Finland showed that sudden cardiac death was the first manifestation of CS in 14% of patients and that undiagnosed CS made up for 64% of sudden cardiac deaths. AV blocks can also lead to more chronic symptoms of fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and chest discomfort.

Physical examination findings can include bradycardia, and irregular rhythm can suggest AV block and atrial fibrillation. In addition, a third or fourth heart sound can indicate left ventricular dysfunction, systolic or diastolic murmurs at the apex can be found in mitral valve involvement, and a loud second heart sound can occur in pulmonary hypertension.

Sarcoidosis involving other organ systems, typically cutaneous, ocular, and neurological disease, or family history of sarcoidosis can help diagnose CS in patients with concerning symptoms. Other organ involvement from sarcoidosis can include skin findings like erythema nodosum or lupus pernio, ocular findings like uveitis, neurological findings like cranial nerve palsies or seizures, and/or pulmonary findings like hilar lymphadenopathy or parenchymal lung disease.
