Venous stasis, endothelial damage, or inflammation are typically present and lead to a hypercoagulable state. Activation of the clotting cascade, as well as aggregation of platelets and blood cells, occurs simultaneously to form a thrombus. The thrombus can cause complete or partial occlusion of the vein leading to venous stasis, lymphedema, and possibly ischemia to surrounding tissue. A DVT can propagate and lead to PE.
