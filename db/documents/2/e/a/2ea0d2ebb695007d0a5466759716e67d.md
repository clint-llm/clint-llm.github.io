The primary pathology of Wallenberg syndrome is occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or one of its branches.

Atherosclerosis is the most common condition affecting the vertebrobasilar system, in which atheromatous plaques narrow and occlude large vessels. However, the pathology of small vessel disease differs from that of large vessels, which atherosclerosis affects. Small vessels are affected by lipohyalinosis, which is closely associated with hypertension. Ischemic infarctions of these small vessels lead to small round infarctions called lacunae, which are scattered throughout the brainstem.
