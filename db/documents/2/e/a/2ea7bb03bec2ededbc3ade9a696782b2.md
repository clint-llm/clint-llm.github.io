Normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (nHPT) is a condition characterized by normal serum calcium in the face of elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH). It can be primary (nPHPT) due to the autonomous secretion of PTH from one or more parathyroids, or secondary (nSHPT) due to reflex rise as a result of a low calcium stimulus. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of nPHPT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism.
- Identify the typical nuclear imaging findings in normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism.
- Review the indications for parathyroidectomy for normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism.
- Explain the importance of proper collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members in selecting appropriate evaluation and management strategies for patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism to improve outcomes.
