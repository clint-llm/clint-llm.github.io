Treatment of an ileus requires time and supportive management. Bowel rest, intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, and,Â if warranted, nasogastric (NG) decompression are important steps. Historically these treatments were thought to lower complications and improve outcomes, but a recent review of the evidence shows otherwise.

Treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. Treating the infection, electrolyte abnormalities, decreasing opiate use, can all potentially decrease the durability of an ileus. These can be difficult to treat in the case of prolonged illness with mechanical ventilation, and septic shock that leads to lengthy bed-bound periods. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is recommended if the patient is unable to tolerate adequate oral intake after seven days. Decreasing opiate use and transitioning to a multimodal pain regimen has benefits, as does early ambulation. In the setting of postoperative ileus, the best treatment is prevention. Enhanced recovery protocols, regional anesthesia, opioid-sparing analgesics, and laparoscopy have all shown improvement in the number of postoperative ileus cases.
