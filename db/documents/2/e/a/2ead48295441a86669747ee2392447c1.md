**Non-Operative Management**

An established consensus among trauma and urological surgeons that initial, non-operative management in the hemodynamically stable renal trauma patient have better overall outcome.

**Angiographic Embolization**

Selective angiography with angioembolization has revolutionized the evaluation and management of the bleeding patient from a renal injury with a successful embolization rate as high as 88% and renal salvage rate up to 92%.

**Operative Management**

Renal injury patients who are hemodynamically unstable, unresponsive to resuscitative measures or fail non-operative management should be taken for operative intervention.

**Management Highlights**

- Most renal injuries are low grade (I through III) and are managed supportively but it doesn't preclude these patients from angiographic embolization (i.e, active bleeding) or surgery (i.e hemodynamic instability)

- Grade IV injuries without expanding hematomas with hemodynamic stability can undergo a trial period of supportive management

- Pelvis-calyceal system injuries can be managed initially with stenting or drainage of the urinoma followed with surgical repair or nephrectomy if failed

- Complete ureteropelvic injuries or renal pedicle avulsion as seen in grade V injuries require surgical repair

- Partial ureteropelvic injuries can be treated with stenting or by diverting the urinary drainage

- All penetrating wounds associated with active bleeding, urine leakage or involve the hilum need to be surgically explored
