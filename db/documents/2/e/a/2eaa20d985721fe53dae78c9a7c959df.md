Xanthelasmas have many causes and are often associated with an independent risk factor for ischemic heart disease. These lesions are best managed by an interprofessional team to improve outcomes.

Assessment of any patients with xanthelasma palpebrarum starts with taking a full, detailed history and doing a proper physical examination. The interprofessional team can optimize the treatment of these patients through communication and coordination of care. Primary care physicians, dermatologists, endocrinologists, and nurse practitioners provide diagnoses and care plans. Specialty care nurses should work with the team for coordination of care and are involved in patient education. Pharmacists should evaluate medications prescribed, recognize drug-drug interactions, provide patient education, and monitor compliance. A family history of ischemic heart diseases is important, and it might give a clue for the depth of hyperlipidemia in the family. Dietary lifestyle modifications like reducing carbohydrate and fat intake and replacing these with vegetables and fruits will help in reducing the cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Physical exercise is very important to lower the lipid level. Treatment of the underlying causes such as diabetes, thyroid problems, and obesity will improve the overall result of the treatment sessions. The patient should be educated that there is no good remedy for xanthelasma, and prevention is the best treatment.
