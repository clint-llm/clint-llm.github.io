Allgrove’s syndrome results from mutations of the AAAS gene located on chromosome 12q13 that encodes a nuclear envelope protein known as ALADIN (alacrimia-achalasia-adrenal insufficiency neurologic) and highly expresses in different human tissues.

Linkage analysis shows evidence for an Allgrove syndrome locus on band 12q13.AAAS gene mutations often have functional impairment with little or absence of any structural abnormalities.
