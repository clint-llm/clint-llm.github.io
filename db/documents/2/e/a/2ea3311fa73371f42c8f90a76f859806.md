Brachioplasty can often be performed as a day-case operation, although high-risk patients (BMI>30, other comorbidities) may warrant overnight admission and monitoring. Pain management can be guided in consultation with the anesthesiologist, and a multi-modal approach is preferable to reduce opiate dependency. The use of closed suction drains is surgeon-dependent, but current evidence does not indicate that the use of drains reduces seroma incidence.

Many surgeons will recommend postoperative compression garments to reduce swelling and provide comfort, but there is no robust evidence that they reduce the incidence of any complications.
