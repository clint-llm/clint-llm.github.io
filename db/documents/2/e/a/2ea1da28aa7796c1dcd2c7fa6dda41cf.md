Septic bursitis happens more commonly in males with the mean age at onset approximately 50 years. Some studies suggest increases in the incidence of septic bursitis in relation to peopleÂ with comorbid disease conditions, but most cases are due to repetitive trauma related to occupational behaviors. Plumbers, carpenters, roofers, clergy, and athletes are commonly affected. Septic bursitis can also be caused by joint steroid injections meant to relieve the symptoms of non-infectious bursitis. Patients with underlying crystal-induced arthropathy like Gout have an increased amount of bursal fluid and can have higher incidences of septic bursitis. People with inflammatory arthritis, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, are also at an increased risk.
