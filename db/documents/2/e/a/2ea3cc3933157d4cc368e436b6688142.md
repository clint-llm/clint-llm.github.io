Generally speaking, chin augmentation using alloplastic implants (whether placed via a transoral or subcutaneous approach)  represents a relatively straightforward procedure with a low-risk profile and a high (97.8%) satisfaction rate.

Nevertheless, complications arising from alloplastic chin implantation certainly exist and include:

- Hematoma

- Infection - less than 1%

- Paresthesia/dysesthesia - generally transient in nature but can be prolonged (months)

- Implant malposition - 2.5%

- Implant migration (i.e., secondary displacement) - 5.0%

- Implant extrusion - 0.4%

- Implant-induced resorption of the mentum - 8.3%

- Implant rejection

- Alopecia of the submental incision

Tips to avoid complications have been elucidated above, but include:

- Maintaining a small supraperiosteal strip centrally (limits bony resorption)

- Dissecting a narrow subperiosteal plane laterally to accommodate the chosen implant (limits implant migration) snugly

- Staying along the inferior border of the mandible (lessens mental nerve injury and promoted an aesthetically positioned implant)

- Limiting the manipulation of the implant once removed from the sterile packaging (lowers infection risk)

- Using an antibiotic solution to bathe the implant and irrigate the recipient compartment (lowers infection risk)

- Creating a multilayered and watertight wound closure (prevents extrusion and infection).

- Using the transcutaneous approach versus the transoral approach (theoretically lessens infection risk, though the literature remains inconclusive)

- Using a transoral approach in men (avoids submental scar and associated alopecia)

NOTE: While not routinely used, some authors advocate using screw fixation to prevent the migration (secondary displacement) of an implant.
