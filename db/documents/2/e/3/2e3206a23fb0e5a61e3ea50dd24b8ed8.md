Metachromatic leukodystrophy is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disorder that results in a buildup of sulfatides that leads to the destruction of the myelin sheath, leading to progressive demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system. Once the diagnosis is made, an interprofessional approach is vital.

Medical centers with specialty teams can offer information about the disorder, coordinate care among specialists, help evaluate options, and provide treatment. Primary care physicians, neurology physicians, pathologists, radiologists, physiotherapists, among others, can form a collaborative team for the best possible outcome. A physical therapist, occupational therapist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, neuropsychologist, and other specialists may be involved are often needed for long term follow up and evaluation. Working with a nutrition specialist (dietitian) can help provide proper nutrition. Eventually, it may become difficult to swallow food or liquid. This may require assistive feeding devices as the condition progresses.

The role of the nurse in education is indispensable. The patient and the family need to know about the course of the disease, lifestyle modifications, and the need to follow up. The physical and occupational therapist should be consulted to assist with ambulation, use of an ambulatory device, and how to perform daily living activities. Couples with a family history of the disease should be offered genetic counseling during pregnancy.
