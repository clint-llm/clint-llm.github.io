The mainstay of treatment is radical surgical excision of the lesion including the wall of the cysts to avoid the recurrence. Then the content should be sent to the pathology department to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is complete excision of the cyst. If the cysts return or become inflamed, then it is not recommended to remove surgically, and it is better to wait until the inflammation subsides to proceed to the option of surgical removal. Wound swab and culture sensitivity for the inflamed lesion is mandatory to exclude infection and to guide treatment options. Proliferating trichilemmal cysts might need need multiple surgical removal sessions along with radiation therapy and/ or chemotherapy.
