Patients with UVCP will present with a sudden onset of dysphonia, often described as a weak or "breathy" voice. In addition to voice change, a significant proportion of patients will present with swallowing difficulties such as dysphagia and regurgitation. Many will also describe poor exercise tolerance, with shortness of breath on minimal exertion despite normal lung function.

Given the plethora of underlying etiologies, other features of the clinical history may indicate the cause. It is important to ensure the patient has no major red flags for head and neck cancer such as odynophagia, cervical lymphadenopathy, night sweats, referred otalgia, weight loss, and hemoptysis. A patient's past medical history including lung or cardiovascular disease, smoking, and alcohol consumption status are all important indicators of potential malignant disease. Occupational hazards, risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use, and foreign travel may suggest rarer causes.

Clinical evaluation of the patient should include a full otolaryngological examination, with particular attention to inspection and palpation of the neck and flexible nasal endoscopy of the oropharynx and glottis. Assessment of voice quality can be graded with GRBAS scale (Grade, Roughness, Breathlessness, Aesthenia, Strain)
