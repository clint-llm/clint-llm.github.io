Patients with early pregnancy and concerning clinical symptoms of abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or vaginal bleeding must be evaluated by pelvic ultrasonography and human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) serum levels testing, which, in combination, help guide patient management.  These two tests assist in differentiation between the IUP, pregnancy of unknown location, and ectopic pregnancy.

Embryonic development between 5 and 7 weeks of gestation follows a predictable pattern, which can be used in early pregnancy to determine the location of pregnancy and gestational age.  The first sonographic feature of pregnancy is a gestational sac, appearing at 4.5 to 5 weeks of gestation. A normal gestational sac appears as a round structure in the central echogenic portion of the uterine body, initially measuring 2 to 3 mm in diameter and increasing by 1.13 mm per day.  By 5.5 weeks gestation, a thin-walled circular structure, the yolk sac, can be seen within the gestational sac, which reaches approximately 6 mm by the time the yolk sac is visible. By six weeks of gestation, a 1 to 2 mm structure within the yolk sac is visible, which represents the embryo.  Embryo size is measured using crown-rump length (CRL) assessment, which is the most accurate gestational age estimation tool in early pregnancy. By eight weeks of gestation, the head, body, and limb buds become apparent.

Intrauterine gestational sac identification via ultrasonography has 97.6% specificity for the diagnosis of IUP, while the yolk sac visualization has 100% specificity.

Given the predictability of early embryonic development, the gestational sac diameter of a certain size without an embryo is diagnostic of pregnancy failure.  Mean sac diameter (MSD) of 25 mm without an embryo is indicative of pregnancy failure, while MSD between 16 and 25 mm without an embryo is suggestive of possible pregnancy failure. Additional criteria for pregnancy failure diagnosis include failure of yolk sac to develop two or more weeks after visualizing the gestational sac and failure of an embryo with a heartbeat to develop 11 or more days after visualization of the yolk sac within the gestational sac. In this case, a repeat ultrasound is an option in 11 to 14 days.

In the past, B-hCG “discriminatory levels” were the method to aid in the diagnosis and management of early pregnancy.  However, research has shown that serum B-hCG levels vary significantly during pregnancy, and isolated B-hCG serum level should not be solely relied upon in the diagnosis of early pregnancy when there is no definitive IUP identified sonographically.
