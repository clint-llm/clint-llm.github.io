A complete history and physical examination are critical in diagnosing and treating bacterial endophthalmitis in a timely and effective manner. Prompt and effective diagnosis can be the difference between a lifetime of vision or a lifetime of blindness. The most common symptom of endophthalmitis that patients will complain of is decreased vision. Eye pain, discharge, or red-eye are also common but may be present or absent in different cases of bacterial endophthalmitis. The timeline of symptoms can also serve as a clue to healthcare providers whether the patient is suffering from a bacterial etiology versus a fungal etiology.

Bacterial endophthalmitis presents in a much more acute timeframe, often within days of a penetrating event, versus fungal endophthalmitis, which has a much more subacute presentation, worsening over days to weeks. Healthcare providers should inquire about a history of ocular surgery, ocular injections, or any penetrating ocular injury that are often present in exogenous endophthalmitis. Healthcare providers should also inquire about systemic symptoms such as fevers, chills, recent infections, recent surgery, recent hospitalization for sepsis, recent antibiotic use, intravenous drug use that are often present in endogenous endophthalmitis cases.
