1. Cardiovascular risk: Hypothyroidism is associated with increased vascular resistance and decreased cardiac output. Lack of triiodothyronine (T3) impairs the vasodilatory action of nitric oxide on the vasculature resulting in increased vascular resistance. Thyroid hormones have positive chronotropic action by directly stimulating the sinoatrial node and positiveÂ inotropic effect by modulating myocyte-specific regulatory proteins increasing cardiac contractility. Lack of thyroid hormone results in bradycardia and decreased cardiac output.

2. Functional capacity: Subclinical hypothyroidism has been associated with decreased muscular strength and exercise capacity. Mainenti et al. randomized 23 women with subclinical hypothyroidism to receive levothyroxine or placebo. After 6 months of TSH normalization an increase in the exercise performance was noted in the treatment group.

3. Cognitive impairment: Hypothyroidism has been known to be associated with cognitive decline. Triiodothyronine plays an important role in neuronal growth, migration and myelination. However, studies have yielded conflicting results on the association of subclinical hypothyroidism and cognitive impairment. Pasqualetti et al. in their meta-analysis of 13 studies found an increased risk of cognitive decline in patients younger than 75 years with subclinical hypothyroidism.
