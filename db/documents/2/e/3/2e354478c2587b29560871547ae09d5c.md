A 2017 meta-analysis investigating low levels of serum albumin in orthopedic patients suggested a 2.5-fold increased risk of surgical site infections (SSI) following various procedures.  Procedures investigated included:

- Femur fracture patients (trauma patients, including femoral neck fractures)

- Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) and Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) patients

- Spinal procedures (fusion, decompression, metastases cases, and spondylectomy studied groups)

Albumin levels <3.5 g/dL conferred this aforementioned risk
