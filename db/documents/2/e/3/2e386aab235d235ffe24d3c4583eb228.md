Tick infection occurs when larval ticks feed on small rodents infected by B. burgdorferi. When ticks reach the nymphal stage, they feed on, infect a wide range of mammals, and perpetuate the infectious cycle. In the nymphal stage, infection is more likely to spread to humans due to: the small size of the nymphal tick, the ticks increased numbers, and increased seasonal human activity in woodland areas (late spring and summer). B. burgdorferi infects the skin after a tick attaches for at least 24 hours. From the skin, the spirochete spreads hematogenously or lymphatically to other organs. The human host mounts an adaptive and innate immune response resulting in macrophage, and antibody-mediated control and eradication of B. burgdorferi. Several weeks or months may pass before the host immune system gains control of the infection, which will occur despite the presence of antibiotics. If not treated, the spirochete can survive in localized recesses of the body for several years causing arthritis or neurologic sequelae.

Lyme disease may present in one of 3 stages:

Early Localized Disease

This stage presents days to weeks after a tick bite that many do not remember due to the small size of the nymphal tick. Erythema migrans initially appears as a small red papule or macule that enlarges to form an annular lesion. The lesion may or may not exhibit central clearing. This presentation is due to the outward spread of the spirochete through the skin tissues. Common locations for this rash include thigh, groin, and axilla.

Early Disseminated Disease

After hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination of the disease, patients may exhibit secondary annular lesions accompanied by headaches, neck stiffness, fever, chills, arthralgias, muscle aches, and profound malaise. After several weeks to months, neurologic abnormalities present as meningitis, subtle encephalitis, cranial neuritis, neuropathy, ataxia, or myelitis. Rarely, cardiac complications occur and present as atrioventricular blocks of varying degrees, myopericarditis, or cardiomegaly.

Late Disease

This stage occurs months after infection by B. burgdorferi. At this point, sporadic episodes of arthritis affecting large joints (i.e. knees) can present and last weeks to months in a single joint. Chronic neurologic sequelae may occur as another manifestation of late-stage disease. A subtle encephalopathy affecting memory, mood, or sleep settles in months to years after the onset of infection.
