Hydroquinone is only used topically as a depigmentation agent. A thin layer is applied with fingertips and rubbed into the face (or other affected areas) 1 to 2 times a day for 3 to 6 months. If there are no results after 2 to 3 months, hydroquinone should be discontinued. It is essential to evenly apply hydroquinone over the entire face to prevent uneven pigmentation and use concurrently with sunscreen to protect from damaging UV light, which increases pigmentation.  Physicians recommended stopping treatment after this time for a few months before restarting to decrease the risk of side effects. It can also be applied during weekends only or three times a week for more extended maintenance therapy with minimal complications.

Hydroquinone is available in 2% over the counter or as 4% prescribed.

Multiple studies have shown that maximum results occur when using hydroquinone as a combination therapy with a retinoid and corticosteroid. The most widely used triple combination cream is composed of hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05%, and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%.

Results vary among each patient.

About 35% to 45% of hydroquinone is absorbed systemically after topical use.
