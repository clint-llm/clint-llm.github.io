The ultrastructure of granulocytes is characterized by the abundance of the granules s in the cytoplasm. Azurophilic granules are present in all granulocytes, and also in monocytes and lymphocytes. The neutrophil specific granules are smaller, less electron-dense, more numerous, and rounded than the azurophilic granules. The specific granules of the eosinophils are oval, electron-dense, characterized by having a central crystalloid formed of major basic protein.
