**Pearls**

- It is essential to anticipate when a difficult airway may occur. Many patients that otherwise appear normal/easy to intubate may prove difficult. The 3-3-2 rule can help to anticipate complications.

- The 3-3-2 rule is useful, but its significance is greater when combined with the Mallampati score.

- The 3-3-2 rule, along with other estimations, does not play a role in emergent intubations.
