Diastasis recti is an increased distance between the rectus abdominis muscles at the midline caused by weakness in the anterior abdominal wall.

While diagnosis and treatment options should focus on patient perception of the bulge or other symptoms, several studies have been performed to look at normal versus widened distance between the rectus muscles. While it is accepted that the supraumbilical distance of the rectus muscles is usually higher than the infraumbilical distance, most authorities consider separation more than two centimeters to be abnormal, although less or more may be present with or without bothersome symptoms.

Diastasis recti can be confused with a ventral hernia; however, there is no fascial defect in diastasis recti. Diastasis recti is associated with conditions in which there is an increase in intraabdominal pressure, including pregnancy and obesity, as well as diseases that result in weakness of the connective tissues. The treatment of diastasis recti is somewhat controversial and ranges from conservative management with lifestyle modifications and exercises to surgical repair with mesh recommendations.
