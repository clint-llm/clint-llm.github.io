MCC is a very rare skin tumor that may present to the primary care provider, nurse practitioner or internist. These lesions may present as an aymptomatic growth or a painful lesion on the head and neck area. It is important to refer these patients to the dermatologist for definitive work up. Patients with a diagnosis of MCC require an interprofessional approach that includes an oncologist, radiologist, surgeon and require close follow-up with their dermatologist. Todate, the prognosis for most patients is guarded; if the lesion is metastatic at the time of diagnosis, survival past 12 months is rare. Fortunately, clinical trials utilizing immunomodulating agents such as anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have shown great promise in providing improved progression-free survival.
