Hemianopsia is a debilitating condition. Patients with visual impairment may have difficulty navigating environments or performing essential tasks such as reading, writing, and driving. Consequently, patients with visual field deficits may suffer from depression and anxiety. A team-based and patient-centered approach for rehabilitation may improve patient quality of life. Occupational, physical therapy, and psychological therapy are essential resources for facilitating recovery.
