The risorius muscle, along with its arterial supply, arises from the second pharyngeal arch mesoderm, which forms approximately during the fourth week of gestation. The motor and sensory innervation to the risorius come from the facial and trigeminal nerves, respectively, which arise from the neural crest cells, as do the mandible bone and the connective tissue upon which the risorius lies.
