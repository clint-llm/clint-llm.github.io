Pneumococcal infections are present throughout the world and are most common during the winter and early spring months. IS. pneumoniae is prevalent in large part due to its colonizing ability in the nasopharynx. Almost 40%-50% healthy children and 20%-30% of healthy adults are carriers.

Although S. pneumoniae pneumonia can occur in all populations, it is more common in patients older than 65 years, younger than 2 years, those who smoke, abuse alcohol, have asthma or COPD, or are asplenic. The overall rate of confirmed S. pneumoniae infection in the United States is 5.16 to 6.11 cases/100,000 in adults with the rate for those older than 65 years being 36.4/100,000 and infants younger than 1Â year being 34.2/100,000.
