Routine echocardiographic assessment is universally recommended before initiating trastuzumab treatment. Cardiac risk factors such as hypertension and smoking should also be noted. The role of screening echocardiography for asymptomatic patients during treatment is uncertain. A reasonable, guideline-based alternative is to obtain echocardiography at baseline, at the conclusion of treatment, and 6 to 12 months following treatment.

When trastuzumab is combined with paclitaxel, an increased serum concentration of trastuzumab has been observed. Serum paclitaxel concentrations may also be decreased in the presence of trastuzumab.

When added to cytotoxic chemotherapy, trastuzumab may further increase the risk of neutropenia, infections, and anemia. Trastuzumab should not be used in combination with belimumab due to an increased risk of neutropenia and infection.
