After an episode of decompression illness or other diving-related injuries, many divers want to go diving again either for recreation, work, or military service. Thorough knowledge of the factors that led to the injury and careful clinical exam will help the diving medicine specialist to decide if additional tests are indicated and to advise the diver of his future risk with a return to diving. Guidelines do exist for military, government, scientific and commercial divers. However, no guidelines have been published in the United States for recreational divers, including dive masters and dive instructors. This activity reviews the current status of returning to diving and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in minimizing the recurrence of decompression illness.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the issues associated with return to diving after decompression illness.
- Describe the clearance of a patient who wants to return to diving after decompression illness.
- Summarize the complications of decompression sickness.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in divers who want to return to diving after decompression illness.
