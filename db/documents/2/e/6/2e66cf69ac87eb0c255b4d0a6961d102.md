In today's healthcare climate, it is crucial for healthcare providers to have an open discussion with patients about their medication use. Some patients may be supplementing their diets with herbal medications without knowing the side effect profile of the specific drug. Interprofessional healthcare team members should have their patients listÂ all supplements on the medication list and be available to answer any questions that may arise about the risks and benefits of their use. It is also the responsibility of the pharmaceutical companies and the pharmacist to educate patients on herbal supplements and their intended use. This education can be by appropriately labeling over-the-counter medications with side effect profiles and lists of the most common drug class interactions. Education material related to supplements should be available at pharmacies to help patients make informed decisions about which products best suit their needs. Patients should also be instructed to consult their primary care providers before initiating any supplement use. Nurses should also be able to answer questions, and if need be, reach out to a pharmacist to check for interactions with other supplements or medications that patients may be taking. This interprofessional strategy can help to greatly reduce the unintended side effects that can potentially cause harm to patients. [Level 5]
