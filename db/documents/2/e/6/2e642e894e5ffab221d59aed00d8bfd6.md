May-Thurner syndrome (MTS), described in 1957 by Dr. May and Dr. Thurner, as a left common iliac vein (LCIV) thrombosis secondary to compression by an overriding right common iliac artery (RCIA). There have been reports of right-sided MTS. While LCIV compression is common, MTS is largely an underdiagnosed cause of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis. This activity reviews the role of the healthcare team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of May-Thurner syndrome medical conditions and emergencies.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of May-Thurner syndrome.
- Review the treatment and management options available for May-Thurner syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance May-Thurner syndrome and improve outcomes.
