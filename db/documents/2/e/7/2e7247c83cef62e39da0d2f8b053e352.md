Electron microscopy (EM) is a form of microscopy that allows a higher magnification than light microscopy (LM). EM allows visualization of many ultrastructural features, such as tight junctions, adherens junctions, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, gap junctions, and the basal lamina, which separates the epithelial cells from connective tissue.
