BP is by definition idiopathic in nature.  Increasing evidence in the literature demonstrates multiple potential clinical conditions and pathologies known to manifest, at least in part, with a period of unilateral facial paralysis.  The literature has highlighted several viral illnesses such as herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus.  Providers may ambiguously (and incorrectly) refer to a diagnosis of BP in the setting of a potentially known etiologic mechanism.  This can occur, for example, in the setting of known associations (e.g. Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and Lyme disease).

While there are many potential causes, including idiopathic, traumatic, neoplastic, congenital, and autoimmune, about 70% of facial nerve palsies wind up with a diagnosis of BP.
