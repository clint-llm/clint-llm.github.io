Brain tumors are serious conditions that require immediate attention and appropriate treatment. An interprofessionalÂ healthcare team is needed to manage these conditions. A collaborative effort by the neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, radiation oncologists, neuroradiologists, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, nurses, and other support medical staff is essential to enhance patient care and achieve a good overall prognosis and outcome. Important treatment decisions are made through multidisciplinary tumor board conferences that help the treating physician manage the patients. Thus enhanced team performance and educating the patient are crucial in managing low-grade gliomas.
