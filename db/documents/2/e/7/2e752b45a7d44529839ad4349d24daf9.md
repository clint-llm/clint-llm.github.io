**Professional Responsibilities**

Nursing and other health professionals in Florida should be aware of the reporting steps and option to report to either the Intervention Project for Nursing or the Department of Health. All health professionals should know how to do the of the following:

- Evaluate peer job performance and consider the possibility of a drug or alcohol problem resulting in deficient performance

- Appropriately intervene

- Identify the patterns of alcohol or drug dependence.

- Know when to contact a supervisor, institutional administration, or government agencies

- Recognize the signs and symptoms of impairment

Virtually all health professionals will encounter one or more impaired peers in the course of their careers. Without a solid knowledge of how to deal with the situation and a plan of action, significant and dangerous impairment problems may get buried and ignored. This burial has the potential to place the individual, peer, and the institution at risk.

The key is to recognize an impaired peer and needs help, documenting all findings clearly and concisely, report it to the appropriate manager or state authority, and then making sure the individual gets the help they need.
