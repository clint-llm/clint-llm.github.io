Ulcerative colitis is a systemic disorder with no cure. The disorder has numerous extraintestinal involvement in addition to the colon. Thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team. All patients with the disorder need lifelong monitoring. Because of the risk of colorectal cancer, surveillance colonoscopy should occur every 1-2 years. Further, since patients are often treated with biological agents, they need to undergo screening for melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer.

The pharmacists should assist the team by educating the patient on the importance of medication compliance to avoid relapse. The nurse should encourage regular vaccinations, hand washing, and cancer screening. A dietary consult should be obtained to educate the patient on foods to eat and what not to eat, especially if they have a stoma. In addition, a stoma nurse should be involved in the teaching of stoma care.

An infectious disease nurse should monitor the patient in the outpatient setting to ensure that they are not immunocompromised. Social workers should be involved to ensure that the patient has ample support and finances; so that the treatments are not missed. Patients with risk factors for osteoporosis need screening for bone mineral density periodically. Patients should be encouraged to undergo annual vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus. Finally, many patients with ulcerative colitis develop depression and anxiety and should be referred to a mental health counselor.

**Outcomes**

Ulcerative colitis has no cure and despite treatment, many continue to have increased bouts of stool frequency. An increase in mortality is usually seen in elderly patients, those with complications like infection, shock, anemia, and those who require repeated surgical interventions. Data show that when the disease involves the muscularis propria, it can lead to bowel dysmotility, necrosis, and gangrene. A certain number of patients also develop toxic megacolon with poor outcomes. It is estimated that about 5% of patients will develop colorectal cancer over time. The risk of colon cancer is higher in patients with pancolitis and in patients whose disease started before the age of 15. Overall, the quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis is poor.
