The heterogeneous nature of frontotemporal dementia, along with its insidious onset, precipitous decline pattern, and substantial impact on patients' and caregiver's lives necessitates a comprehensive diagnostic, management, and educational care plan. InterprofessionalÂ cooperation and communication are imperative to shape a capable healthcare team and to minimize the physical, mental, and emotional burden of the disorder. A patient-centered medical home model comprised of a primary clinician coordinating care between neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, physical, occupational, and speech therapists, dieticians, nurses, home health workers, palliative specialists, support groups, and community resources are essential to improving the quality of life of all involved.
