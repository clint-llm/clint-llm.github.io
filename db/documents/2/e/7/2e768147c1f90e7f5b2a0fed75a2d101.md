When orally administered, diclofenac is absorbed rapidly and binds to albumin in the plasma. The drug concentrates in synovial fluids, where it renders its targeted action as an NSAID for relief musculoskeletal inflammation and ailments.

Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, should be administered at the lowest effective dose to achieve clinical goals to limit the risk of adverse reactions and toxicity.
