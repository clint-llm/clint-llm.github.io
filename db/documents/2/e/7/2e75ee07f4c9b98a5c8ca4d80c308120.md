Researchers recently initiated a study; A Prospective Phase II Trial of Cabazitaxel in Male Patients With Chemotherapy Pre-treated Metastatic Non-seminomatous Germ-cell Tumors. Cabazitaxel is a new generation taxane with a high capacity for blood-brain barrier crossing and limited peripheral neurotoxicity, two major potential advantages in patients with advanced NSGCTs. Cabazitaxel has a broader in vitro spectrum of activity than docetaxel. Taxanes have demonstrated activity in pre-treated GCTs and are now part of standard treatment, but cabazitaxel has not yet been tested in patients with NSGCT.

A risk-adapted strategy of using dose-dense chemotherapy in patients with poor-prognosis disseminated non-seminomatous germ cell tumors is a randomized phase III trial that compares two different combination chemotherapy regimens to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II or stage III non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.
