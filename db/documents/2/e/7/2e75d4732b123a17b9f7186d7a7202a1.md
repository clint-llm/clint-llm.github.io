Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The disease can occur due to true fungi, referred to as eumycetoma, or by bacteria, referred to as actinomycetoma. Eumycetoma is, therefore, a deep fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by filamentous fungi. Morphologically and histologically, eumycetoma is characterized by deep granulomatous inflammation and the formation of grains which lead to the destruction of deep tissue, muscle, bone, joints, and tendons. Mycetoma is a WHO-recognized neglected tropical disease with a significant disease burden. It primarily affects those in tropical and subtropical climates who are in direct contact with soil. The most common site of infection is the foot, followed by hands. Less frequently, other areas may be involved.

The most common organism causing a eumycetoma is Madurella mycteomatis.

The treatment course is often protracted, challenging, and consists of systemic antifungal therapy combined with surgical procedures. Severe tissue destruction is an undesired consequence of neglected infections. Eumycetomas are chronic and deep skin infections that carry a medical significance and pose a treatment challenge. In endemic areas, eumycetomas lead to socio-economic consequences involving affected patients, their families.
