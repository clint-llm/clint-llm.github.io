There are many glycogen storage diseases (GSD) caused by genetic mutations in enzymes directly involved in the anabolism and catabolism of glycogen.  They are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and often present in early childhood. The major GSDs and the enzymes perturbed are as follows

- Type 0: muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) or liver glycogen synthase (GYS2)

- Type Ia (Von Gierke disease): glycogen-6-phosphatase, specifically G6PC (removes the phosphate group from G6P)

- Type 1b (Von Gierke disease): glycogen-6-phosphatase, specifically G6PT (transports G6P into the endoplasmic reticulum)

- Type II (Pompe disease): acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA; this enzyme is localized in the lysosome)

- Type III (Cori disease): glycogen debranching enzyme

- Type IV (Andersen disease): glycogen branching enzyme.

- Type V (McArdle disease): muscle and heart glycogen phosphorylase

- Type VI (Hers disease): liver glycogen phosphorylase
