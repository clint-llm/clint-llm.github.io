**Conventional Technique**

The conventional inferior alveolar nerve block technique is the most commonly used approach. Recognition of the following anatomical landmarks is imperative: the coronoid process, coronoid notch, anterior and posterior margin of the mandibular ramus, and the sigmoid notch. Other significant landmarks are the coronoid notch and the pterygomandibular raphe formed by the buccinator and superior constrictor muscles; the preferred location of needle entry is between these 2 structures. The syringe barrel is placed over the premolars opposite the side of the injection. The insertion point is an imaginary line starting at the deepest part of the pterygomandibular raphe and continuing to the coronoid notch. The exact location of the entry point is one-fourth the distance towards the raphe above the occlusal level of mandibular teeth. The needle is inserted after locating the target area until bony resistance is felt. The depth of penetration is between 19 and 25 mm. After that, the needle is withdrawn gently and slowly. When the needle can be inserted more than 25 mm, it may be posterior to the posterior border of the mandible. If the bone is touched prematurely, it suggests an anterior position of the needle.

**Modifications to the Conventional Technique**

Various modifications or alternatives to the conventional inferior alveolar nerve block technique have been reported.

- Thangavelu et al. proposed the internal oblique ridge as the only pertinent anatomical landmark. This technique requires placing the thumb on the retromolar area; the tip of the thumb will indicate the internal oblique ridge. The insertion point will be 2 mm posterior to the internal oblique ridge and 6 to 8 mm above the midpoint of the thumb. The syringe is located over the opposite premolars, and the needle is moved along until it touches the bone. This technique has a success rate of 95%.

- Boonsiriseth et al. employed a 30 mm long needle, and the insertion point was similar to the conventional inferior alveolar nerve block technique. However, the syringe barrel was located at the occlusal level of the ipsilateral teeth, whereas in the conventional method, it is located on the opposite side.

- Suazo Galdames et al. advocated for the inferior alveolar nerve block via the retromolar triangle approach. This technique involves the deposition of the anesthesia at the retromolar triangle. It is based on the fact that the bone in this area is perforated by holes of different sizes, allowing for the passage of the buccal artery that anastomoses with the inferior alveolar vessels in the mandibular canal. Anesthesia administered in this area can reach the inferior alveolar nerve through communication between the mandibular canal and the retromolar triangle. This technique has a success rate of 72%. It can be particularly valuable in patients with blood disorders where the conventional inferior alveolar nerve block may be difficult.

- Other available techniques mainly target the mandibular nerve branches rather than the inferior alveolar nerve. These include the Gow-Gate, Vazirani or Akinosi closed mouth, and the Fischer 3-stage techniques.

**Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (CCLAD)**

This automatic device reduces the pain inflicted during the injection by slowly and continuously administering a small anesthetic solution. There are single-use, disposable, and lightweight hand-piece devices. These are generally utilized for the attached gingiva, hard palate, and periodontal ligament anesthesia. These devices can also provide more accurate anesthesia delivery when a deep tissue block, like an inferior alveolar nerve block, is needed.
