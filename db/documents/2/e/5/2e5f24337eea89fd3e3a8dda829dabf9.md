The majority of germ cell tumors are benign, with only 20% being malignant. Of that 20%, seminomas make up the majority (about 50%) of malignant germ cell tumors. The mediastinum is the most common location for extragonadal germ cell tumors to reside. Mediastinal germ cell tumors represent a rare 3-10% of all mediastinal tumors and account for less than 5% of all germ cell neoplasms. Only 3% of mediastinal germ cell tumors arise in the posterior mediastinum, while the majority arise in the anterior mediastinum.

Mediastinal seminomas are just one type of mediastinal germ cell tumors affecting mostly male patients between the ages of 20 and 35. It is unknown as to why mediastinal tumors appear mostly in men. Mediastinal tumors are not typically discovered in patients from abroad until the fourth decade of life, most likely due to the fact that these countries are underdeveloped and have insufficient diagnostic methods. Though the rarity of this condition is not often questioned, it cannot be excluded that increased recognition of mediastinal seminomas would occur with more research and familiarity - not only by clinicians but also by pathologists.
