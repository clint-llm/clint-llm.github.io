Syrup of ipecac is no longer available for over-the-counter (OTC) sale or prescription use. There are, however, various unregulated formulations of ipecacuanha available.  In the 1950s, syrup of ipecac was considered superior to gastric lavage and was the standard of care for toxic ingestions. It was available for sale in one-ounce bottles and became the mainstay for home treatment of childhood poisonings. It was approved for OTC sale in 1965 by the US Food and Drug Administration. In 1989 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended each home keep a bottle for emergency use.

The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT), the European Association of Poison Centres, and Clinical Toxicologists (EAPCCT) or the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) no longer recommend ipecac for routine use.
