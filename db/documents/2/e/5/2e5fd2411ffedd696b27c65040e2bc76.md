In vitamin B6-deficient states and illnesses, treatment dosage is variable and depends on the severity of symptoms. The vitamin is available therapeutically in both oral and parenteral formulations. Neonates with B6 deficiency seizures may require 10 to 100 mg intravenous (IV) for effective treatment of active seizures. Less serious or less acute presentations can be supplemented with doses ranging from 25 mg to 600 mg per day orally depending on symptom complex.

Importantly, Vitamin B6 therapy can be life-saving in refractory INH overdose-induced seizures. The dose is equal to the known amount of INH ingested or a maximum of 5 gms and is dosed 1 to 4 grams IV as the first dose, then 1 g IM or IV every 30 minutes.

Additional, less common uses are in hydralazine overdose, where the recommended dose of vitamin B6 is 25 mg/kg, the first third administered intramuscularly, and the remainder as a 3-hour IV infusion. Gyromitra (mushroom) toxicity treatment is at 25 mg/kg infused IV over 30 min.

Hyperemesis gravidarum may respond to vitamin B6 at a dosage of 25 mg orally every 8 hours.
