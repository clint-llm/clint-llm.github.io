The etiology of tendinosis is not fully understood. Practitioners theorize that an insult causing damage and acute inflammation sets the process in motion. The insult can be mechanical stressors, repetitive overloading, or toxic chemicals. Multifactorial confounding variables, including age, genetic predisposition, and/or comorbidities, make one more prone to healing failure that causes tendinosis.
