The retroperitoneum divides into three main anatomical spaces:Â  the anterior pararenal space, perirenal space, and posterior pararenal space. The anterior pararenal space contains the head, neck, and body of the pancreas (the tail of the pancreas is within the splenorenal ligament), ascending and descending colon, and the duodenum (except for the proximal first segment). Structures contained within the perirenal space include the adrenal gland, kidney, ureters, and renal vessels. The posterior pararenal space, which is surrounded by the posterior leaf of the renal fascia and muscles of the posterior abdominal wall, contains no major organs and is composed primarily of fat, blood vessels, and lymphatics.
