From a functional point of view, the ossicular chain represents the most efficient system for transmitting sounds from the outer ear to the inner ear. The membrane of the eardrum (TM) vibrates and transmits its movement to the malleus, and this to the anvil and the incus to the stapes. When the TM moves medially (towards the hollow of the eardrum), the stapes also move medially and deepen into the oval window; when the TM moves laterally (towards the external acoustic meatus), the stapes also moves in the same direction. The displacements of the stapes are transmitted from its base to the perilymph of the vestibule. However, the sound waves can also propagate to the inner ear by vibration of the air contained in the eardrum cavity due to the total vibration of the bone formations surrounding the cochlea.
