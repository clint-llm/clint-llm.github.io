The ESR test measures the rate at which the red blood cells (RBCs), or erythrocytes, in a whole blood sample fall to the bottom of the Westergren tube. This process of "falling" is called sedimentation.

Typically, RBCs have negative charges on the outside of the cells, which cause them to repel each other. Many plasma proteins have positive charges and can effectively neutralize the negative surface charges of the RBCs, which allows for the formation of the rouleaux. Therefore, an increase in plasma proteins (present in inflammatory conditions) will propagate an increase in rouleaux formations, whichÂ settle more readily than single red blood cells.

Rouleaux formation (and thus the ESR) is affected by the amounts of immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins (prothrombin, plasminogen, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, haptoglobin, complement proteins) that are present in several inflammatory conditions.

The detection of the first acute phase protein in the 1930s, the C-reactive protein (CRP), occurred during the analysis of the plasma of patients diagnosed with acute pneumococcal pneumonia.

Although many inflammatory illnesses will increase the ESR, other conditions exist that can lower the ESR. These "lowering factors" can exist either as isolated disease processes or in conjunction with other pathologic conditions that raise the ESR, thus giving a "lower than expected" ESR result in light of a serious underlying inflammatory process.
