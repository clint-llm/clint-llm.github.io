The cellular makeup of the gastrocolic reflex is multisystemic and includes cell bodies from the nervous, endocrine, and gastrointestinal systems. The primary mediators are neurons of the autonomic nervous system, neurons of the myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus, interstitial cells of Cajal, and enteroendocrine cells that line the GI tract.

Sympathetic nerve fibers contribute an inhibitory effect on the colon, while parasympathetic nerve fibers contribute a stimulatory effect. The nerve supply to the colon is broken up between midgut and hindgut derived structures. Structures derived from the midgut include the ascending colon and proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. These midgut derived structures receive their sympathetic supply from nerves that originate from the superior mesenteric plexus and their parasympathetic supply via the vagus nerve. Structures derived from the hindgut include the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, and the sigmoid colon. These structures receive their sympathetic innervation from the inferior mesenteric plexus and parasympathetic innervation via pelvic splanchnic nerves.

Located in between the inner and outer layers of the muscularis externa, the myenteric plexus generates and helps coordinate gut motility. A sensory component of the myenteric plexus has been identified, and this is thought to help with coordination and the propagation of migrating motor complexes. The myenteric plexus propels a food bolus distally by contracting the radius of the lumen of the bowel and extending the length of the bowel.

Interstitial cells of Cajal are located between smooth muscle cells and nerve endings throughout the GI tract and are responsible for the inherent pacemaker activity of the GI system. These cell bodies interact with smooth muscle cells to transduce contributions from the enteric motor neurons and turn these signals into the stimulus needed for phasic smooth muscle cells to propel the food bolus distally.

Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are cells derived from endoderm epithelial cells that are abundant throughout the GI tract. These cells form the largest endocrine organ in the body and are responsible for many tasks, including GI secretion and motility. These cells function via endocrine and paracrine roles. They sense the contents of the lumen of the bowel and excrete neuropeptides that can act on distal organs or even act on cells nearby, including neurons of the enteric nervous system that control motility. Research has shown that EECs can act directly on cells of the enteric nervous system to help initiate and propagate the proper physiological response.
