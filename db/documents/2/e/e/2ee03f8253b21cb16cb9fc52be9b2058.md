Spectral-domain optical coherence topography (OCT) is non-invasive, quick, and widely available. It is suitable for diagnosing and monitoring retinal pigment epithelium atrophy, myopic CNV, and myopic tractional maculopathy. OCT provides a regular measurement of retinal and choroidal thickness, plus the presence of subretinal or intraretinal fluid. It also highlights the presence of macular holes, retinoschisis, or detachments. Dome-shaped maculopathy is best visualized on radial or vertical OCT slices.

Fluorescein angiography (FA) provides detailed information about the type and activity of myopic CNV and helps plan treatment. Myopic CNV resembles the appearance of type 2 or classic CNV on FA, demonstrating early hyperfluorescence that increases in size and intensity through to the late phase. It can help differentiate between hemorrhage from a myopic CNV versus a lacquer crack, with the latter displaying blocked fluorescence instead of increasing hyperfluorescence.

Other tests such as OCT angiography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and Indocyanine Green Angiography may be useful at evaluating the shape and perfusion of the retina and choroid. However, these tests are rarely utilized in a clinical setting.
