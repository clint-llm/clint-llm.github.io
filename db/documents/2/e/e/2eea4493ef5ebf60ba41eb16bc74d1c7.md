With excessive lamotrigine overdoses, some reportedly as high as 16 g, fatalities have occurred following complications, including seizures, coma, and conduction abnormalities. Immediate-release lamotrigine is rapidly absorbed, and inducing emesis may not be the appropriate intervention indicated in this instance. However, hospitalization and supportive care are indicated, as well as the usual precautions to protect the airway. As of this writing, there is no known specific antidote for lamotrigine toxicity.
