As with all surgical procedures, there are possibleÂ acute complications of uncontrolled bleeding, infection, acute postoperative pain, and broader medical complications, including acute blood loss anemia and stress-induced cardiac ischemia. With a BKA performed for infection or acute soft tissue trauma, a second operation may be necessary if distal skin edges further demarcate or if the area of infection was not adequately resected.

Chronic complications of BKAs include the development of painful neuromas from transected nerves, highlighting the importance of proper intraoperative technique as described above. Phantom limb pain, or the perception of pain or troubling sensation in the missing limb, is a common complaint. They address this with a mirror box, local injections, adjustment to the prosthesis, or various other modalities. The psychiatric and psychosomatic effects of a BKA should not be overlooked in postoperative patients, as this cohort has been shown to have higher rates of depression and suicide.
