Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs when compartment pressures increase to the point that circulation and tissue function is compromised. Human limbs are especially susceptible to ACS due to the separation of muscle groups by fascial membranes. Trauma to a limb, as can occur with crush injury, fractures, or overuse can lead to swelling within a compartment that can increase rapidly and result in ACS. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of skeletal muscle compartment syndrome and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of acute compartment syndrome.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with acute compartment syndrome (ACS).
- Describe the management options for acute compartment syndrome (ACS). 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the management of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) and optimize outcomes.
