There is a significant variation in clinical presentation and the onset of symptoms. Some patients retain ambulation untll old age and some present earlier. Growth is slower, leading to short stature. Obtaining a complete family history assists in genetic counseling. Becker muscular dystrophy has a milder clinical course and later onset than Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Suspicion of BMD is made when a child presents with muscle weakness selectively affecting proximal earlier than distal limb muscles and lower limbs before upper limbs with positive family history. Patients may present with symptoms like cramping with strenuous activity, the delayed ability of jumping, running, stair climbing, and cognitive impairment.

On physical examination, atrophy with pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles and occasionally quadriceps, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, fasciculations, Gower sign (use their hands and arms support to push them upright from squatting position), lumbar lordosis, shortening of Achilles tendons along with contractures of joints like knee, elbows, and hips are the common findings.

Female carriers may only present with cardiomyopathy. Sometimes carrier females may have mild muscle weakness. Approximately 22 percent of carriers become symptomatic with a high degree of variability. Genetic analysis is required for proper investigation of a mutation in case of suspicion.
