Epigenetics is the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence.

Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.

In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.
