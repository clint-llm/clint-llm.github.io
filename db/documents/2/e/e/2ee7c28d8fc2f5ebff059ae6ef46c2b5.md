Tolcapone is FDA indicated as adjunctive therapy to treat patients with Parkinson disease who are currently on levodopa/carbidopa. Only patients who are experiencing motor fluctuations or who cannot tolerate other therapies should use tolcapone. Research shows that a majority of patients with Parkinson disease who have received treatment with levodopa and carbidopa experience a "wearing-off" phenomenon. During this "wearing-off" phenomenon, patients experience shortened periods of benefit from their levodopa/carbidopa therapy. Patients experience a so-called "off" time where they do not experience any therapeutic benefit of their medication; this usually requires an increase in dosage or more frequent dosing of levodopa so that patients experience more "on" time of therapeutic benefit from levodopa.

Studies show that patients with Parkinson disease who are currently experiencing motor fluctuations while taking levodopa and carbidopa showed reduced "off" time and increased "on" time when adding tolcapone to their medication regimen compared to placebo. These studies also showed that patients were able to tolerate a dose reduction of their levodopa. However, if patients do not show improvement on tolcapone within three weeks of initiation, tolcapone should be discontinued.

There are no off-labeled uses for tolcapone. However, researchers have studied the use of tolcapone in patients with Parkinson's disease who are stable on levodopa/carbidopa. Researchers found that when they added tolcapone to levodopa/carbidopa, patients saw improvement in scores for activities of daily living and motor function on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The groups receiving tolcapone also saw a decrease in their total daily dose of levodopa.
