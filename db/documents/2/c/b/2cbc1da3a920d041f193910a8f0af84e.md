Scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder characterized primarily by the thickening and hardening of the skin. The combining form “sclero” means "hard" in Greek, and the word “dermis” means skin. There are two primary types of scleroderma: localized and systemic (also called systemic sclerosis). In localized scleroderma, the disease affects mainly the skin and may have an impact on the muscles and bones. In systemic scleroderma, there is an involvement of the internal organs, such as the digestive tract, heart, lungs, and kidneys, among others. The severity and outcome of scleroderma are variable.
