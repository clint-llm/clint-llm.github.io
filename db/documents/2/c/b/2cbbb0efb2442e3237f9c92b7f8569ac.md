There are not many risk factors associated with sex cord-stromal tumors (SCST). As compared to germ cell tumors (GCTs), which have a quite strong correlation with****undescended testis, SCSTs have not shown any such associations, although further studies are needed.

There is testicular atrophy in KlinefelterÂ (KF) syndrome, a higher incidence of cryptorchidism, lower androgen, and higher gonadotropin levels. Despite all this, there is no evidence of excess risk of testicular cancer amongst patients of KF syndrome, although they may have an elevated risk of various other tumors.
