The first step of pediatric tracheostomy is identifying the cricoid cartilage and sternal notch; then, a midline horizontal incision is made between the two landmarks. The incision is deepened up to the strap muscles after dissecting the subcutaneous fat. The strap muscles are displaced laterally, and bipolar cautery is used for hemostasis. Sometimes, isthmus of thyroid obscure the view of the trachea; hence, it can be clamped and divided. The anterior surface of the trachea is identified and exposed over 2 to 4 rings. The two vertically placed stay sutures are taken on either side of the midline, and a vertical midline incision is made on the anterior wall of the trachea between 2 and 4 tracheal rings.

The anesthetist is asked to withdraw the endotracheal tube just below the level of vocal cords. Now, the tracheostomy tube of appropriate size is placed inside the tracheal lumen and connected to the ventilatory circuit for confirming its position. The endotracheal tube is kept at its place till the proper position of the tracheostomy tube is not confirmed. The distal tip of the tracheostomy tube is kept approximately 2Â or 3 rings above the carina, which can be confirmed with the help of a flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope. The tracheostomy tube is secured around the neck with the help of tracheostomy ties and stay sutures are labeled as right or left depending upon their position on trachea around the incision and are taped on the anterior chest wall. These stay sutures help to rapidly identify newly created stoma in case of accidental decannulation.
