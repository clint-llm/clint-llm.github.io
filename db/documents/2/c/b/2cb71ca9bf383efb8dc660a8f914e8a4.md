Complement deficiencies are rare worldwide; high-risk populations are screened to estimate prevalence. The mannan-binding lectin (MBL) of the lectin-based pathway is the most prevalent form of complement deficiency at 5% of the White population and it may be clinically silent. Apart from the MBL pathway, complement deficiencies are prevalent in 0.03% of the population.

In the cases of meningococcal infection, the prevalence rate is nearly 30%. Patients with C1q deficiency are observed to have a 93% chance of having SLE in the future. Similarly, C1rs deficiency is found to have a 57% association with SLE, and C4 deficiency is associated with a 75% association with SLE.

Properdin and C2 deficiencies have been more commonly observed in the White population, C6 deficiencies have been observed to have a predisposition in Africans, and deficiencies in C8 and C9 are more commonly seen in Asian populations. Specifically, two distinct C8 deficiency states have been studied: C8 alpha-gamma deficiency that is seen mostly in Afro-Caribbeans, Hispanics, and Japanese; and C8beta, mainly evident in Whites.
