In utero, ductus venosus blood flow waveforms are assessed using Doppler ultrasound to determine the patency of the shunt. It is recommended to use two positions for optimal results.

1. A midsagittal view with the fetus supine to identify the ductus venosus, umbilical vein, and inferior vena cava.

2. A transverse plane abdominal Doppler to identify theÂ ductus venosus.

Flow patterns may vary even in normal pregnancies.
