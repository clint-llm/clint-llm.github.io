Cyanide is a rapidly acting substance that is traditionally known as a poison. Hydrogen cyanide was first isolated from Prussian blue dye in 1786 and cyanide first extracted from almonds around 1800. Cyanide can exist as a gas, hydrogen cyanide, a salt, potassium cyanide. Natural substances in some foods such as lima beans, almonds can release cyanide. Cyanide is also found in manufacturing and industrial sources such as insecticides, photographic solutions, plastics manufacturing, and jewelry cleaner. It has been used as a poison in mass homicides and suicides. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of cyanide toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic pathophysiology and toxicokinetics of cyanide toxicity. 
- Outline the examination and evaluation procedures for diagnosing cyanide toxicity, including any applicable laboratory testing. 
- Summarize the treatment and management strategy for cyanide toxicity.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with the management of cyanide toxicity.
