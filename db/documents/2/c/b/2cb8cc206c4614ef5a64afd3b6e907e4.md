Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality. Sodium levels need to be closely monitored, as this could lead to life-threatening complications if left untreated. This is even more important in patients with renal disease and those who are on diuretics. Good interprofessional communication between the primary care provider and a nephrologist is imperative to keep a close eye on sodium level and its proper correction as and when needed.
