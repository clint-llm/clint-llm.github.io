The most commonly used dose form of scopolamine in the United States is a transdermal patch. Each patch is a circular shape of about 2.5 cm in diameter and 0.2 mm in thickness. Its design is in four layers for step-wise delivery of a priming dose of 140 micrograms of scopolamine initially, followed by a steady 1.5 mg release over 72 hours.

Patch placement should be on the postauricular area (the hairless area behind the ear). The stratum corneum, which acts as a significant barrier to percutaneous absorption, is the thinnest at this location. Patients should not cut the scopolamine patch, as it will alter the delivery system, and blood levels become less controlled. There are two other scopolamine products available outside the USA: scopolamine hydrobromide and scopolamine butylbromide. Both are useable in parenteral, intramuscular, intravenous, and subcutaneous forms. The short duration of action, less predictable blood levels, and common side effects resulted in the exclusion of these products from U.S. markets.
