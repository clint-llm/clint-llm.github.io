Reactive arthritis usually has a self-limited course, and the symptoms resolve within 3Â to 5 months. Symptoms lasting beyond 6 months indicate a chronic element of the disease. Sacroiliitis is the most common chronic joint involvement. Patients who are HLA-B27 positive have a higher risk of recurrence of ReA. 15-30% of patients with ReA can develop long-term arthritis or other joint abnormalities. The presence of hip involvement, unresponsiveness to NSAIDs, and ESR greater than 30 portend a worse outcome.
