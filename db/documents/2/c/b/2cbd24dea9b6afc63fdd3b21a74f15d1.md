Interprofessional team-based practices are vital for a successful awake craniotomy. The anesthesiologist and surgery team should discuss and plan for the procedure before a patient comes to the operating room. Equipment needed for surgery and patient position should be discussed with the operating room nurse. Effective communication between all team members, including the anesthesiologist/nurse anesthetists, surgeon, technician, and nurses, minimizes complications and makes the procedure successful.
