Procedures of the head and face must be done carefully due to complex anatomy and critical structures that lie in close proximity to one another. Understanding the anatomy and surrounding structures is imperative to prevent surgical complications of the region of the pterygoid plexus. A common nerve block given when working on posterior maxillary teeth is the posterior superior alveolar nerve block. Due to the location of the posterior superior alveolar foramen, which is the target of the nerve block, if one is not careful, the pterygoid plexus can be punctured, along with the maxillary artery and posterior superior alveolar nerve. The result of this is the formation of a hematoma.

A crucial surgical consideration of the pterygoid plexus and the region surrounding it is the proximity and connection to the cavernous sinus. Upon performing a procedure, usually due to a dental infection, it is critical to ensure the infection's proper removal with no perforations leading to the infratemporal fossa and pterygoid plexus are present. Lastly, it is essential to use sterile equipment when performing surgery to prevent any infection of the tissue and area and potential complications.
