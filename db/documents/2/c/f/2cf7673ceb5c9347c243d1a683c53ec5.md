Antibodies or immunoglobulins (Ig) play an important role in the immune system's mechanisms of defense. They fight off extracellular pathogens, for instance, bacteria, and can neutralize viruses when they are in the bloodstream and other body fluids. Normal individuals have 5 classes of immunoglobulins, which are IgM, IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE, and immunoglobulin subclasses including IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, and IgA2.

The most common antibody deficiency disorders

- X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton disease)

- Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of newborn

- Selective Ig immunodeficiencies, for example, IgA selective deficiency

- Super IgM syndrome

- Common variable immunodeficiency disorder
