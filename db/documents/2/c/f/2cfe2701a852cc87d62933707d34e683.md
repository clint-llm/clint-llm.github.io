After cannabis, amphetamines are the most widely abused illicit drug worldwide. According to the 2019 United Nations World Drug Report, it is estimated that in 2017, roughly 0.6 percent of the global population aged 15–64, or 29 million people, had used amphetamines in the past year. Of these, an estimated 17 million people are dependent on amphetamines. Based on the most recent 2018 United States National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 1.9 million people aged 12 or older used amphetamines in the past year, with overall use remaining steady since 2015. Overdose deaths attributed to amphetamines increased by 33% from 2015 to 2016, with 10,333 overdose deaths in 2017.

In addition to this, patients who have an amphetamine use disorder and are entering substance abuse treatment centers have a higher likelihood of being referred by the criminal justice system than patients with all other substance use disorders combined (59% versus 38%). Users of amphetamines are also twice as likely to need long-term treatment than users of other drugs (17% versus 8%). Some studies have suggested about 30% of patients with amphetamine-induced psychosis end up with a primary psychosis over time.
