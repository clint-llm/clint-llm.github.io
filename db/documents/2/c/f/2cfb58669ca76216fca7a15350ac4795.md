Management of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) remains controversial. Coronary artery anomalies contain many entities, and no one group has collected large enough data to clarify the natural prognosis of each entity, which contributes to the difficulty in understanding their clinical implication. With that in mind, the consensus is that the decision process should be individualized, taking into account the symptoms and the type of anomaly. Patients with high-risk anomalies, such as those with arteries that arise from the opposite coronary sinus should be restricted from excessive and unnecessary exertion. As mentioned before, patients should have an evaluation with a nuclear stress test to evaluate for reversible ischemia and coronary angiography with IVUS to determine the degree of stenosis, area of dependent myocardial territory, and risk of sudden cardiac death. Patients then have three treatment options: conservative management with medical treatment and observation, coronary angioplasty with stenting, or surgical correction.
