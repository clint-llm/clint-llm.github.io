As cardiac rhabdomyoma most commonly correlates with tuberous sclerosis, a baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) is necessary at the time of diagnosis, even in the absence of any cardiac symptoms, with routine EKGs every 2 to 5 years thereafter. The imaging modality of choice is echocardiography (ECHO). Cardiac rhabdomyoma presents as multiple, echogenic, and nodular masses in the ventricular myocardium. Cardiac rhabdomyoma can also protrude into the ventricular cavity. They are more homogenous and hyperechoic as compared to the normal myocardium.

The findings can be misinterpreted as a different cardiac tumor-like atrial myxoma if the location is atypical (atria) or there is a single large solitary tumor. Other imaging modalities like cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be also be used as an adjunct to ECHO in cases of equivocal findings. The MRI gives a better delineation of the tumor and can be very helpful in cases of planned surgical resection. It also provides a more reliable estimate of ventricular systolic function.
