Palatal and gingivalÂ cysts of the newborn involute or spontaneously rupture, eliminating their keratin contents into the oral cavity within the first few weeks to months of postnatal life. The lesions are hardly ever seen after three months of age. However, it has been suggested that part of the cystic epithelium may remain inactive even in the adult gingiva.

Palatal and gingival cysts of the newborn are believed to resolve spontaneously because their cystic wall fuses with the oral epithelium, consequently discharging the cystic content.
