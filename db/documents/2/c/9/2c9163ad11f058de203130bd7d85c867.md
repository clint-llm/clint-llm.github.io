There is no known preventative method for the development of atypical moles, but those with a history of atypical moles should be especially vigilant in wearing high factor sun protection.

The management of atypical moles is controversial amongst dermatologists. Excision biopsy is usually performed when there is any clinical concern regarding atypical moles which have developed de novo, or where morphological changes are noted in pre-existing atypical moles. More than half of physicians surveyed by the American Academy of Dermatology reported that it is their practice to re-excise atypical moles when margins are not complete, or lesions recur. Reexcision of positive margins is based on the principle that the recurrence of an excised lesions along a biopsy scar may become indistinguishable from melanoma, known as the 'pseudo-melanoma' phenomenon.

Exceptions include instances where there is concern that the clinical examination is not in keeping with the histology, there is severe atypia, or histological examination cannot differentiate the lesion from melanoma. In these cases, the lesion should be treated in line with guidelines for the management of melanoma and re-excised with appropriate margins.
