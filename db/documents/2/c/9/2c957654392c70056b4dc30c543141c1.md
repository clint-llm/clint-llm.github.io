The entire nervous system forms via the process called neurulation in which neural tube and neural crest form initially. In the third week of embryogenesis, three germ layers arise, namely, ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, through the process of gastrulation. The overlying ectoderm is induced and thickened by the notochord and the neural plate forms. The neural plate then gives rise to the neural tube by folding upon itself, which makes up the central nervous system, which includes the brain, brainstem, and the spinal cord. The brainstem and spinal cord are composed of plates separated by the sulcus limitans, which is in the fourth ventricle of the brain. It separates the alar plate, which gives rise to sensory neurons and a basal plate, which gives rise to motor neurons.
