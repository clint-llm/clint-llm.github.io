Unexplained progressive dyspnea, which evolves over days to weeks, is the commonest presentation in almost 60 % of patients. Although a history of underlying malignancy is noted in most cases, lymphangitic carcinomatosis could rarely be the initial presentation of an occult malignancy. Pleuritic chest pain will be present if the neoplasm obstructs the subpleural lymphatics. Cough, hemoptysis, weight loss, and lethargy are usually uncommon though a report of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis presenting with isolated chronic cough is reported in the literature.

Physical examination may reveal a low-grade fever, tachypnoea, and tachycardia. The respiratory evaluation usually reveals a clear chest, with the rare occurrence of adventitious sounds. The clinical signs &symptoms of pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis and pulmonary tumor embolism could often overlap. Features of cor pulmonale and pulmonary hypertension, such as prominent pulmonary second heart sound, right ventricular heave, elevated jugular venous pressure, and cyanosis are less commonly noticed in pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis when compared to pulmonary tumor embolism.
