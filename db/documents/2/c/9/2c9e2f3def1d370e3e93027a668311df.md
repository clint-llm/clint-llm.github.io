A team-based approach is essential for the care of a patient with atopic dermatitis, especially in moderate to severe cases. Eczema is a common condition seen in pediatric and family medicine offices. Typically patients with mild to moderate eczema can be treated in the office by their primary care provider with standard therapy. Patients with moderate to severe cases may require referral to dermatology for systemic treatments. If a patient is not responding to typical treatment regimens, they may benefit from a consult with an allergist for a patch or skin scratch testing. an interprofessional team of a specialty trained dermatology nurseÂ and specialty-trained dermatology clinician will provide the best patient care.
