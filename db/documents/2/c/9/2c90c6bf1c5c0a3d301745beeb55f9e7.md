If the patient has trichiasis with conjunctival scarring and theÂ direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is negative, a clinical examination should be performed to exclude the following diseases:

- Chemical burns

- Trauma

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome

- Atopy

- Graft-versus-host disease

- Toxicity to medication

If these diseases are excluded, the patient should still be treated as having MMP as immunomodulation therapy is vital to control this disease.
