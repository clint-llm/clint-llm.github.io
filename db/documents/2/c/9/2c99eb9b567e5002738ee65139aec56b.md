Contraindications to mediastinoscopy can be classified as either absolute or relative.

Absolute contraindications include:

- Anterior mediastinal mass

- Inoperable tumor

- Previous recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

- Extremely debilitated patients

- Ascending aortic aneurysm

- Previous mediastinoscopy

Previous mediastinoscopy is a strong contraindication to a repeat procedure because of the elimination and distortion of the plane of dissection from scar tissue.

Relative contraindications include:

- Thoracic inlet obstruction

- SVC syndrome

- Severe tracheal deviation

- History of radiation therapy to the chest

Anything that distorts the anatomy, such as those contraindications listed above, increases the risk of vascular or airway injury which can be catastrophic in this location.
