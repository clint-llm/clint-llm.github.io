Patients with MDS may be clinically asymptomatic for years and may have incidental findings of cytopenias on routine labs. Others may present with signs and symptoms related to bone marrow failure such as fatigue, bleeding, or infections. These symptoms may be gradual and progressÂ with time. Anemia is the most common clinical manifestation, and patients may complain of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain or dizziness due to this. Bleeding or petechiae from thrombocytopenia, as well as infections from neutropenia, are less commonly noted.

On physical exam, patients may only be noted to have signs consistent with anemia such as pallor or petechiae. Organomegaly can be seen in overlap syndromes but is otherwise infrequently seen in MDS.
