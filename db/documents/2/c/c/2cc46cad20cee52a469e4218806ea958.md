A fundamental, albeit simplified concept in oncogenesis, is the overexpression of oncogenes and silencing of tumor suppressor genes. Environmental lifetime exposure of the oral cavity to known carcinogenic agents leads to DNA damage, and the accumulation of genetic events ultimately leads to the development of carcinoma. Despite numerous genetic alterations that have been linked with the development of cancer, we have only begun to scratch the surface in terms of understanding the relationship between these genetic changes and their relative importance in carcinogenesis. Two of the most well-established genetic alterations that lead to tongue cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in general, are mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 and overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) oncogene.
