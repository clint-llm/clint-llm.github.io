Niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency results in a condition known as pellagra. Pellagra includes the triad of dermatitis, dementia, and diarrhea and can result in death. In addition, niacin deficiency can occur through genetic disorders, malabsorptive conditions, and interaction with certain medications. Today, niacin deficiencies are uncommon in industrialized nations primarily due to sufficient dietary intake; however, specific populations remain at risk of this mostly eradicated condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of niacin deficiency.
- Review the risk factors for developing niacin deficiency.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with niacin deficiency.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with niacin deficiency.
