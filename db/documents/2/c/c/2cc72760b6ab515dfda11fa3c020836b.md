Biopsy w/ H&E is recommended for persistent suspicious lip lesions to rule out invasive skin cancer. Basic histopathology for actinic cheilitis would be:

- **Hyperkeratosis****:**thickening of stratum corneum

- **Solar elastosis:**loss of eosin staining, accumulation of irregular thick elastic fibers and tangled fibrillin

- **Epithelial dysplasia (mild-moderate**): disordered maturation of epidermal cells, loss of rete ridges, variable cytological atypia

- **Perivascular inflammation:**inflammatory cells around the blood vessels

- **Severe dysplasia:**increase in dyskeratosis, keratin pearls, drop-shaped projections, and nuclei related changes such as mitoses and pleomorphism indicate the progression of dysplasia and increased malignant transformation.
