Interprofessional consultations play an integral role in the setting of delusions. Patients often present to non-psychiatric specialties due to a lack of insight. Instead, these patients may present to emergency departments and police stations with bizarre complaints of persecution and poisoning. These eccentric presentations should incite concern, and a subsequent consultation should be requested. Once in the appropriate setting, efficient healthcare teamwork is essential. Nursing staff are paramount to orient and address patient needs, while case management assists in the litigious aspects of the case. Psychiatric technicians provide security for patients and staff. Persons suffering from delusions can prove challenging to treat, but with cohesive teamwork, this daunting task becomes manageable.
