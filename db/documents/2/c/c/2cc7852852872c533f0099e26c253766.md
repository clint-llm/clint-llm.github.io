Whenever there is an ischemic insult of an organ, its management involves revascularization or thrombolytic therapy. Following this management, if there is progressive clinical deterioration it is indicative of reperfusion injury. It is imperative to diagnose this as early as possible and to differentiate it from other post-ischemic complications such as arrhythmias due to possible electrolyte imbalance, activation of latent infections due to ischemic stress, blood loss resulting in hypovolemia in addition to ischemia resulting in acute renal shutdown or hypoxia-induced brain injury resulting in neurological and possible autonomic deficits.
