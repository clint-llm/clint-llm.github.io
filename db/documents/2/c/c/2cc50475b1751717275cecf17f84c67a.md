There are ongoing studies to determine the normal and abnormal findings observable by OCT-A. Below is a listing ofÂ findings from studies referenced by De Carlo et al.

**Diabetes**

- Choriocapillaris abnormalities

- Retinal microvasculature abnormalities

- Vascular remodeling of adjacent foveal avascular zone

- Enlarged foveal avascular zone

- Capillary tortuosity and dilation

- Areas of retinal non-perfusion

- Reduced capillary density

**Dry age-related Macular Degeneration**

- Areas of impaired choriocapillaris flow extending beyond areas of geographic atrophy

- A decrease in choriocapillaris density

**Neovascular age-related Macular Degeneration**

- Choriocapilalris alterations surrounding choroidal neovascularization

- Retinal angiomatous proliferation

**Vascular Occlusion**

- Areas of capillary non-perfusion with clear delineation of the ischemic boundary

- Microaneurysms

- Telangiectasis

- Anastomosis

**Glaucoma**

- Attenuation of peripapillary microvasculature
