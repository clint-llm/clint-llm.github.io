Shoulder and Upper limb muscles are specialized to perform functions of pressure and manipulation of objects. Skeletal muscle is formed by myofibers which contain millions of myofibrils, and each of them is formed by sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the contractile unit, therefore skeletal muscle fibers are completely dedicated to generating force. Skeletal muscle also carries out multiple functions such as voluntary locomotion, the protection of internal organs, generation of heat, and assisting in postural behavior.

The muscle mass relies on the balance between synthesis and degradation of proteins, the regulation of this process is sensitive to several factors such as nutritional status, hormone levels, physical activity, underlying diseases, injuries, among others.
