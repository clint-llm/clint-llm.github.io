Electron microscopy is extremely useful when connecting physiology to histology because the definition allows an average observer to appreciate the critical structures that light microscopy can’t. The following description can be used to understand an electron microscopy image of striated skeletal muscle.

When viewing a sarcomere image, it is best to determine the boundaries: the Z-discs. These are lines on each fiber that run perpendicular to the fiber as a whole. From there one can start to determine the areas. Between two Z-discs, there are seven distinct color changes and the sarcomere is symmetric. The zone on either side of the Z-disc is named the I-band; this is where there is only thin filament exists, which is why it is the lightest of the grayscale. The remaining 5 zones in the middle of the sarcomere are the A-band. The A-band is where the thick filament is. The A-band further divides into the H-zone and the M-line. The M-line is the centermost color gradient of the sarcomere and represents anchor for the thick filament. The zones on either side of the M-line are named the H-zones and denote where there is only thick filament. The last part of the A-band, the darkest on electron microscopy, is where there is overlap between the thin and thick filaments. During a contraction, this area increases in size, while the H-zone and I-band get smaller.

Review from left to right of a sarcomere

- Z-line – Dark perpendicular line – The sarcomere boundary and anchor for thin filament

- I-band – Lightest – Thin filament alone

- A-band - Thin and Thick filament overlap – Dark area

- A-band - H-zone - Thick filament alone – Second lightest area

- A-band - M-line - Anchoring protein for thick filament – Second darkest line, middle of sarcomere

- A-band - H-zone – Thick filament alone – Second lightest area

- A-band -  Thin and Thick filament overlap – Dark area

- I-band – Lightest – Thin filament alone

- Z-line – Dark perpendicular line – The sarcomere boundary and anchor for thin filament
