Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin. Cephalexin is a beta-lactam antibiotic, meaning its structure contains a beta-lactam ring. In a bacterial cell, peptidoglycan gives the cell wall mechanical stability. Cephalexin (and other beta-lactam antibiotics) use a beta-lactam ring to inhibit the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is a critical step in the formation of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically, the beta-lactam binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), resulting in inhibition of the last phase of peptidoglycan synthesis, a transpeptidation reaction required for bacterial peptidoglycan cross-linking. This activity results in the loss of cell viability and eventually leads to bacterial cell autolysis.

Although this mechanism of action inhibits a vital step in maintaining the bacterial cell wall, bacteria can acquire resistance to cephalexin, which can occur through various mechanisms.

- The most common resistance mechanism is a bacterial expression of beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that can degrade beta-lactam antibiotics like cephalexin.

- Additionally, bacteria can obtain resistance to cephalexin by modifying the penicillin-binding proteins, which alter the binding of cephalexin to their target site.

- Also, bacteria can synthesize efflux pumps that pump cephalexin outside the bacterial cell.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: Rapid in adults; acid-stable, and can be given without regard to foods.

Time of peak plasma concentration: 1 hour

Distribution: Widely distributed in most body fluids

Plasma Protein binding: 10% to 15%

Metabolism: Cephalosporins like cephalexin do not affect hepatic CYP450 enzymes, which drastically limits the potential for drug-drug interactions when administering cephalexin.

Excretion: The majority (90%) of unchanged drugs is excreted in the urine. It is a characteristic that makes it particularly useful in treating urinary tract infections.
