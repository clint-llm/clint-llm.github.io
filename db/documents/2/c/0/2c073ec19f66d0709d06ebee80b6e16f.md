Anatomically, the respiratory tract divides into two zones: the conducting zone and the respiratory zone. These two zones of the lung contain different cells to support the specialized functions of the respective regions. The conduction zone conditions and facilitates the movement of air entering the lungs. This zone mostly contains a respiratory epithelium that is ciliated or pseudostratified columnar. This dominating cell type helps moisturize and filter the air. The five types of specialized cells in the conducting zone include ciliated cells, goblet cells, basal cells, brush cells, and neuroendocrine cells.

- Ciliated cells: most plentiful cell types and functions to remove debris.

- Goblet cells: trap and destroy micro-particles by mucin granules. This cell type decreases in number down the respiratory tree and eventually becomes replaced with club cells.

- Basal cells: connects ciliated and goblet cells to the basement membrane.

- Brush cells (also known as type 3 pneumocytes): Columnar or pear-shaped cells with microvilli and unmyelinated nerve ending throughout a small portion of the mucosal epithelium. The function is uncertain. However, some literature indicates a possible chemoreceptor function that monitors air quality.

- Neuroendocrine cells (also known as Kulchitsky cells): located in the bronchial submucosa and secretes catecholamines and polypeptide hormones (serotonin, calcitonin, and gastrin-releasing factor).

The respiratory zone includes the alveolar epithelium, which has a lining with three types of pneumocytes.

- Type 1 Pneumocytes: squamous cells line the majority of alveolar surfaces to promote optimal gas diffusion.

- Type 2 Pneumocytes: secrete pulmonary surfactant, which ultimately decreases alveolar surface tension to prevent alveolar collapse as well as decreasing elastance and increasing compliance. These cells are precursors to type-1 cells and other type-2 cells. This ability to proliferate makes type 2 pneumocytes helpful during lung damage.

- Club cells (previously known as Clara cells): nonciliated, low-columnar/cuboidal cells with secretory granules. Club cells secrete part of the surfactant, degrade toxins, and also act as regional progenitor cells in conditions of lung damage.
