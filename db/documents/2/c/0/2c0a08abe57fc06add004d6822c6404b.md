Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diffuse pulmonary lung disease (DPLD), including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE), are the most common disease-causing chronic hypoxia and are associated with the highest incidence of pulmonary hypertension in this group.

Other conditions that PH may also develop are cystic fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, lung cancer, and other less common chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary Langerhans histiocytosis and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The severity of PH is reported to be proportional to the extent of illness and parenchymal involvement.

Other causes include pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxia at high altitudes, which develops in people living over 2500 meters above sea level.
