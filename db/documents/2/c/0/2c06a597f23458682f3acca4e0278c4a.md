The prognosis for coronary artery ectasia is directly related to the severity of concomitant coronary artery disease. Coronary artery ectasia with underlying coronary artery disease is a dangerous combination with an increased potential for adverse cardiac events. Isolated CAE still carries the risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction. Type 1 and Type CAE demonstrate a higher risk than Type 3 and type 4 CAE. No reported data shows a relationship between the diameter of an artery and the outcome.
