Tendinopathy results in vascular changes and adaptations to the macroscopic and microscopic environment of the muscle and tendon. Increased vascularization is due to hypertrophy and hyperplasia, which occurs in the presence of an angiogenic cytokine such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inflammation due to injury increases the local concentrations of VEGF. The increase in blood flow decreases the strength of the tendon with a reduction in the sliding capacity of the different connective layers. The same increase in nerve fibers occurs superficially in the tendon and toward the inside; nociceptive fibers also increase, causing pain.

There is an increase in sympathetic nerve fibers near the blood vessels. It is hypothesized that altered tenocytes can synthesize nociceptive neurotransmitters, which will then be recorded by the sympathetic system with the onset of pain.

**Enlers-Danlos Syndrome**

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of genetically-based connective tissue disorders that affects the skin and the mobility of joints due to abnormal collagen synthesis. Collagen gives strength and elasticity to connective tissues, including tendons and joint components, skin, and blood vessels. The incidence of EDS has been estimated at 1 in 5000 cases, or 1% to 3% of patients.

The clinical manifestations of EDS vary widely, and the disease varies in severity. Diagnosis of EDS is based on physical examination and observation of the patient’s movements, as well as the patient’s medical history.

Joint hypermobility or laxity is one of the most characteristic signs of EDS. Small joints are typically more affected than large joints. The condition is often painful, and joint dislocations and sprains are common. Other complications of EDS include scoliosis, osteoarthritis, chronic pain, and aortic dissection.

As aforementioned, EDS is a group of disorders. There are currently 13 identified subtypes, with 19 known causal genes, each involved in developing the extracellular matrix and collagen. Inheritance is often manifested in an autosomal dominant manner. Collagen abnormalities are present in most known variants of EDS.

Classical EDS (types I and II) is characterized by abnormal type V collagen production. Vascular EDS (type IV) exhibits abnormal type III collagen. EDS type VII exhibits deficiencies in type I collagen. The genetic and biochemical basis of the most common variant

Diagnosis of EDS is difficult because joint hypermobility is multi-factorial; gender, age, training, and body weight are all contributing factors.

Pain is a common symptom of EDS.

**Marfan Syndrome**

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder with variable penetrance, resulting in many symptoms, the most dangerous of which involve the cardiovascular system.

Abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system are often the presenting physical signs of Marfan syndrome. Increased joint laxity, excessive long bone growth, scoliosis, and sternal deformities such as pectus excavatum are common.

During the physical examination, the Steinberg or “thumb sign” may indicate Marfan syndrome. The sign is positive if the entire distal phalanx of the thumb protrudes beyond the ulnar border of the hand while the thumb is abducted with the fingers curled over it. The Walker-Murdoch or “wrist” sign is evaluated by having the patient encircle the wrist proximal to the styloid process with the thumb and finger of the other hand. The sign is positive if the thumb overlaps so that it completely covers the nail of the encircling digit.
