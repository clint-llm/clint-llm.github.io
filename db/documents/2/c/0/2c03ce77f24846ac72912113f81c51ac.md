The recommendation is for close follow-up when initiating this medication if intolerable side effects develop; these may necessitate discontinuation of this drug, and starting a new medication must be considered. Recommendations also include monitoring for the development of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy, regardless of the presence of acute renal failure; cases have been reported when gemfibrozil is simultaneously administered with statins. There is no established evidence that recurrent monitoring of creatine kinase (CPK) will prevent the experience of severe myopathy and kidney damage.Clinicians should follow the serum lipoproteins (LDL, VLDL, HDL, triglycerides, total cholesterol) regularly to determine therapeutic response.
