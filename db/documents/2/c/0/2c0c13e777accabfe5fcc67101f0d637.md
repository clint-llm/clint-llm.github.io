LeFort fractures are not uncommon and often present to the emergency department. Because these fractures are also associated with other facial, skull and ocular injuries, an interprofessional team must be involved. The trauma surgeon should call the appropriate specialist after workup. The decision to operate on these patients depends on the stability of the fracture, compromise of neural and ocular elements, and bleeding. Even after treatment the recovery is often prolonged and most patients do have some residual neurological or visual deficit. The role of the primary care provider and nurse practitioner is to educate patients on safety in sports, wearing seatbelts while driving and wearing helmets when riding motorbikes.
