Modifiable risk factors include atherosclerosis, portal hypertension, liver transplantation, pregnancy, and connective tissue disorders such as Marfan or Ehler-Danlos syndrome. Recent studies demonstrate splenic pseudoaneurysms occur in up to 21% of patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. Non-modifiable risk factors include advanced age and female gender. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms have been associated with blunt and penetrating trauma as well as iatrogenic trauma during instrumentation.
