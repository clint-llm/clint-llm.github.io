Type 1 cardiorenal syndrome occurs when there is acute decompensation of cardiac function leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration. Researchers have previously proposed a decline in cardiac output with decreased renal perfusion as the leading underlying cause for worsening kidney function in cardiorenal syndrome types 1 and 2.Â  However, recent studies have postulated that increased central venous pressures are a more critical factor.
