The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend umbilical cord blood gas analysis to be performed in all high-risk deliveries in which there is a suspicion of a fetal metabolic abnormality. Examples include category III fetal heart rate tracings and low Apgar scores at birth.

In some centers, this practice is routinely performed after all deliveries, regardless of the presence or absence of risk factors.
