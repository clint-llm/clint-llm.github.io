A bioptome is used to obtain a cardiac biopsy. The procedure can be performed under fluoroscopy (more commonly used) or echocardiography. Different bioptomes are now available, which are more flexible and finer than the early versions. Vascular access for right or left heart biopsy is achieved through venous (internal jugular or femoral vein) or arterial puncture (radial or femoral artery), respectively. The bioptome is advanced through a sheath that has been placed using the Seldinger technique.
