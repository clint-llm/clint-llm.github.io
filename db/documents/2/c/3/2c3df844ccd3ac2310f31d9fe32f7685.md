**COPD Patients with Renal Failure and Acute COPD Exacerbation**

The kidneys cannot reabsorb bicarbonate in these patients to compensate for chronic respiratory acidosis. Over time, mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis sets in, causing dangerously low pH levels. The mortality rate is much higher in these patients.

In addition, low pH can lead to harmful effects on the heart. Low pH causes heart muscle and heart rhythm dysfunction, which predisposes these patients to arrhythmias. In addition, it can also cause a drop in blood pressure. However, acute Hypercapnia per se due to acute COPD exacerbation does not predict increased mortality. In contrast, chronic Hypercapnia has been shown to lead to a decreased five-year survival.

**Cautious use of Supplemental Oxygen to Prevent Hypercapnia**

There is emerging evidence to support conservative administration of O2 (to achieve O2 saturation between 88-94%), particularly in patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbation.

In patients with COPD, oxygen treatment can lead to an acute increase in CO2, but the effect of O2 on the hypoxic ventilatory drive is relatively small.
