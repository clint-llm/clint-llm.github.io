Nephrogenic streptococci infection precedes PSGN, which initially affects skin or the oropharynx. More recently, PSGN is associated with skin infections (impetigo) more frequently than throat infections (pharyngitis).

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) has been subtyped depending on the surface M protein and opacity factor, which are known to be nephrogenic and can cause PSGN.Â Other causes of post-infectious glomerulonephritis include bacterial infections including endocarditis, enterocolitis, pneumonia, and intraventricular shunt infections, viral (hepatitis B and C infections, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, parvovirus B19), fungal (coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis), and parasitic infections (malaria, leishmania, toxoplasmosis, and schistosomiasis).

Poor hygiene, overcrowding, and low socioeconomic status are important risk factors for streptococci outbreaks, and this explains the higher incidence of PSGN in impoverished countries. Genetic factors are expected to predispose to the condition since almost 40% of patients with PSGN gave a positive family history. There is no specific gene found to cause PSGN.
