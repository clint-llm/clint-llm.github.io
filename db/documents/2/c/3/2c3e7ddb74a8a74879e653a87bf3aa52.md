In general, papular acrodermatitis is a clinical diagnosis with no laboratory testing indicated unless there are symptoms or physical exam findings, such as hepatomegaly, to suggest an underlying viral illness, such as hepatitis, that may require further management. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed and include the following symptoms:

- Lesions lasting at least 10 days;

- 1 mm to 10 mm papules or papulovesicular lesions with involvement of three of the four following sites: extensor surfaces of the forearms, extensor surfaces of the legs, cheeks, or buttocks;

- Symmetrical distribution of lesions.

Practitioners may need to further evaluate the causative virus in children who are immunocompromised or who reside in endemic areas. If a patient presents with jaundice, hepatomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy, evaluation for other viral infections, including hepatitis B or Epstein-Barr virus, may be indicated. Rarely, a skin biopsy may be performed to exclude other conditions in immunocompromised or other high-risk patients. Normally, biopsy findings are non-specific, with dermal perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates and capillary endothelial swelling.
