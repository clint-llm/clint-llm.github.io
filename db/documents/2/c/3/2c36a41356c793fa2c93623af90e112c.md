Historically, many different treatment options have been used to stop lacrimation. A 5% solution of guanethidine was used to block the adrenergic receptors in the lacrimal gland.

Surgical options include excision of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland, cutting of the chorda tympani nerve, denervation of the lacrimal gland either by dissection or diathermy, and sphenopalatine ganglion blockage by alcohol or cocaine, and vidian neurectomy.

The treatment of crocodile tears syndrome depends on the severity of the hyperlacrimation and the need of the patient. Mild cases are generally managed by counseling and regular monitoring. Less drastic surgical options are used, and they are proving to be an effective way to control the tearing. Subtotal resection of the palpebral lobe of the lacrimal gland is considered beneficial by McCoy et al., and pre-operative Schirmer’s test helps to control the amount of gland to be resected and thus prevent dry eye.

The most widely accepted treatment of crocodile tears syndrome is botulinum toxin injection into the lacrimal gland.
