The prognosis depends on the diagnosis of the specific disease, its extent and severity at the time of initial presentation, the general health and comorbidities of the patient, and their willingness to comply with necessary treatment, follow-up, and preventive measures. If the disease process is found in the acute phase and can be treated effectively with antivirals, antibiotics, or antifungals, the outcome is dependent on the treatment course and patient compliance. Medication adherence plays a primary role in treating an infection that is treatable or a chronic condition such as HIV, HSV-1/HSV-2, and partially treated or asymptomatic STIs.

Worldwide, health services for diagnosing and treating STIs are generally underfunded, neglected, and inadequate.

Problems include the cultural stigmatization of STI patients, inadequate education of healthcare workers in this area, limited resources, overall poor quality of healthcare services, and the frequent need for patients to bear a significant financial burden for their own treatment, which many cannot afford.

Populations at the highest risk (workers in the sex trade, prostitutes, men who have sex with men, illegal drug users, prisoners, and young people in countries with high rates of STIs and HIV) often lack access to proper, affordable healthcare and STI treatment services.

In many parts of the world, STI services are not seen as significant or important, so they are underfunded and neglected. This only leads to higher numbers of infected but untreated patients, poorer training of healthcare workers, reduced laboratory testing ability, and inadequate supplies of appropriate medications.
