The evolution of hemoglobin follows gene mutations, such as gene duplication, gene conversion, and translocation of genes in ancient hemoproteins. Mutations that resulted in changes to the primary structure of globin altered its properties and genetic regulatory regions. The gamma-globin genes of fetal hemoglobin are products derived from duplications of beta-globin gene clusters. In the fetus, HbF is preceded by the embryonic hemoglobins, whose production in the yolk sac (weeks 3 through 8) decreases shortly after HbF is produced in the liver (weeks 6 through 30), followed by the spleen (9 through 28), and finally the bone marrow (28 through birth). Approximately all HbF is replaced by HbA by 6 to 12 months of age unless hemoglobinopathy is present in the individual; the average adult has less than 1% of HbF as a result. The switch from gamma to beta chain occurs through a transcriptional switch in erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow.
