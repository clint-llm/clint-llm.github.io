There are many causes of tinnitus:

- The most common cause of subjective tinnitus is noise trauma. For example, an employee who works in a noisy industry loses hearing at the 4000 Hz tone. Now the employee hears a sound that is similar to the 4000 tone.

- Metabolic diseases: Heart, hypertension, diabetes are associated with an onset of tinnitus. Various drugs are ototoxic to some individuals or at sufficient doses. For example, high doses of aspirin cause tinnitus, and the issue resolves when aspirin is stopped.

- Ear diseases cause tinnitus including Meniere disease or lesions affecting the eighth cranial nerve.

Twenty percent of persons visiting tinnitus clinics have normal hearing. Some have somatosensory tinnitus. Here, stimulation from cervical or TMJD has activated the dorsal cochlear nucleus and sends impulses to the auditory center. Evidence for this is that stimulation similar to whiplash or TMJD has been shown to cause anatomical changes in the dorsal cochlear nucleus.

A rare cause of tinnitus is the Chiari malformation. Tinnitus occurs when low-lying cerebellar tonsils cause auditory nerve tension and can be unilateral or bilateral.
