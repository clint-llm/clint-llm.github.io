Extremity arterial stenosis is a commonly encountered pathology in arterial sonography. Ultrasound characteristics include the following:

- Increased PSV

- PSV Ratio > 2 indicates more than 50% stenosis

- PSV Ratio > 3 indicates more than 70% stenosis

- Triphasic to monophasic waveform change from proximal to distal

- Spectral broadening distal to stenosis

- Parvus Tardus waveform distal to stenosis

- Complete lack of flow indicates 100% total occlusion

Deep venous thrombosis is one of the most commonly encountered pathologies in venous duplex imaging. Commonly encountered ultrasound characteristics include the following:

- Incompressibility of the thrombosed venous segment

- Loss of phasicity from respiration distal to thrombosis, even with Valsalva

- Lack of color doppler flow

- Loss of augmentation

Lymphadenopathy is commonly encountered and may be due to either malignant or reactive processes. Several ultrasound factors may favor a malignant lymph node. This most commonly includes the following:

- Lack of fatty hilum

- Cystic necrosis within the lymph node

- Long axis to short axis ratio < 2, which correlates to a rounder lymph node

- Large lymph node size, with size criteria varying upon anatomical location

- A resistive index greater than 0.8

- High resistance waveform within a lymph node

- Calcifications
