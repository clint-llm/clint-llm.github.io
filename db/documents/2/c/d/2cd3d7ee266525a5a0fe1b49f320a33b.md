Misoprostol has four primary effects: cytoprotection of the gastrointestinal mucosa, uterotonic, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (diarrhea and abdominal pain are considered adverse effects). Currently, misoprostol is FDA approved only for the prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs and at high risk for ulceration. It has an indication (but not FDA approved) in the short-term treatment of active duodenal or gastric ulcers with other etiologies. Although misoprostol is used around the world in gynecology and obstetrics, however, none of these indications are FDA approved. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of misoprostol, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with conditions where misoprostol has a therapeutic purpose.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of misoprostol.
- Identify both the approved and off-label indications of misoprostol.
- Review the adverse event profile and contraindications for misoprostol.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from misoprostol therapy.
