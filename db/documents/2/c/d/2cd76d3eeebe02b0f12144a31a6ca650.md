Thrombosis and hemorrhagic events are the most common complications in MPNs. Other complications based on diseases are as follows:

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): CML patients if not treated are at increased risk of blast transformation.

Polycythemia vera (PV): Arterial and venous thrombosis and thromboembolic complications may manifest as transient ischemic stroke (TIA)/stroke and pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and hemorrhage. Some patients with PV may present as acquired von Willebrand disease, and they have an increased tendency for bleeding, particularly if they are taking aspirin. Post-PV myelofibrosis and transformation to AML or MDS are other complications of PV. Erythromelalgia is the microvascular complication of PV which manifest as pallor, erythema, or cyanosis of the hands and feet.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET): Small and large vessel thrombosis, hemorrhage, thromboembolic complications such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension, and priapism.

Primary myelofibrosis (PMF): Portal hypertension, GI bleeding, spinal cord compression, bleeding, respiratory distress, transformation to acute leukemia, thrombotic events,  infections, and pulmonary hypertension.
