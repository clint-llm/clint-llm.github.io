Although usually readily apparent on colonoscopy and angiography, angiodysplasia is often extremely difficult to detect on the gross examination of a resected specimen without the use of specific injection techniques. As a result of vascular injection studies of resected colons, the determination was that angiodysplasia develops as a result of intermittent partial obstruction of small veins that drain the colonic mucosa and submucosa as they course through the muscularis propria. Over time, obstruction of the penetrating veins of the muscularis propria leads to dilation and tortuosity of the submucosal veins and, consequently, the venules and capillaries that drain them.

Angiodysplasias are often challenging to diagnose in pathologic specimens. In resected specimens examined while fresh, one may visualize only a small focus of enhanced vascular markings and erythema, and even these subtle signs may be absent. In specimens examined after formalin fixation, the lesions are usually not visible on the mucosal surface. If a vascular lesion is detected, the histologic examination typically reveals a discrete cluster of dilated, tortuous veins and venules within the submucosa, some associated with dilated capillaries in the overlying mucosa as well.
