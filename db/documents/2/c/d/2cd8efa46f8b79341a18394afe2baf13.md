The diseases that target the DCML pathway are largely degenerative.

Tabes dorsalis, a potential but now rare manifestation of tertiary syphilis, is an example of a degenerative disease that affects the DCML pathway and results in severe neurological deficits. The pathogenesis of tabes dorsalis is characterized by the demyelination of the axons of the posterior column pathway, generating an array of symptoms all due to the compromised relay of sensory input. These symptoms include loss of peripheral reflexes, impairment of vibration and position sense, and progressive ataxia. The sudden onset of severe idiopathic pain of an unknown origin, often described as "lightning pain, " can also be seen in tabes dorsalis. In addition to the posterior column pathway-related symptoms, tabes dorsalis can cause degenerative joints, also known as "Charcot joints." Moreover, the loss of the pupils' ability to constrict with the preservation of its ability to accommodate (i.e., Argyll Robertson pupils) is common in patients with tabes dorsalis.

Another degenerative disease affecting the posterior column pathway is subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCD) resulting from severe vitamin B12 deficiency. SCD affects two pathways in the spinal cords: the lateral cortical motor pathway and the posterior column pathway. SCD is characterized by axonal myelin abnormalities resulting from vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to a compromise in nerve transmission. Myelination of the axons speeds up the action potential via saltatory conduction. Thus, disruption in the myelination process slows down nerve conduction. Symptoms related to damage in the posterior column pathway include paresthesias, loss of vibratory sensation, and proprioception. In contrast, symptoms associated with damage in the lateral cortical motor pathway include spastic paresis and hyperreflexia.

The role of vitamin B12 deficiency in the cause of SCD is related to the production of myelin in two separate pathways.

Adenosylcobalamin serves as a cofactor in the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which is an essential step in lipid synthesis. Consequently, methylmalonyl-CoA accumulates in B12 deficiency, causing the inclusion of abnormal fatty acids into the synthesis of neuronal lipids. Nevertheless, the build-up of methylmalonyl-CoA makes it a useful lab marker tool to diagnose B12 deficiency.

In a different pathway, the lack of vitamin B12 impedes oligodendrocyte growth, as vitamin B12 is involved in DNA synthesis and is a cofactor in the generation of tetrahydrofolate. Other vitamin B12 deficiency findings besides SCD include psychiatric issues and macrocytic anemia. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also be secondary to folate deficiency, methotrexate therapy, and nitric oxide intake.

The DCML pathway can rarely be affected due to infarction of the posterior spinal artery, causing what is known as posterior cord syndrome or posterior spinal cord syndrome. Posterior cord syndrome (PCS) is characterized by loss of vibration and proprioception sensation, and the posterior spinal artery supplies reflexes below the level of the lesion as the posterior column pathway. However, motor strength, pain, and temperature sensations are spared in PCS, as the spinothalamic and cortical motor tract are unaffected; their vascular supply is via the anterior spinal artery.

Lastly, Brown-Séquard syndrome, which is spinal cord hemisection involving either the left or right side of the spinal cord, affects the posterior column pathway. It is usually due to an insult or injury at the cervical level. Unlike the previous causes of damage to the posterior column pathway, Brown-Séquard syndrome usually is caused by traumatic events such as a fracture or stab wound to one side of the spinal cord; tumors and abscesses are rarer etiologies. Along with the posterior column pathway, the motor and spinothalamic tract pathways are severed in Brown-Séquard syndrome, resulting in unique symptoms. The classic clinical features of Brown-Séquard syndrome include contralateral loss of pain and temperature (spinothalamic tract), ipsilateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract), and ipsilateral loss of vibration and proprioception (posterior column pathway).
