Histopathology displays specific histologic features. The tumors are mainly located in the dermis and less frequently in subcutaneous tissues.Â  A combination vascular-inflammatory component is present. The lesions show a proliferation of capillary-sized vessels lined by prominent, enlarged endothelial cells giving the typical cobblestone appearance. The cells are mostly cuboidal, with intracytoplasmic vacuoles and uniform ovoid nuclei. A dense vascular and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils is seen. Mitoses are rarely observed, but lack anaplasia and atypical figures. The vascular component predominates in early or actively growing ALHE, while the lymphoid infiltrate is more prominent in the late stages of the disease. Histological evidence of arteriovenous shunts is present in 42% of the cases.
