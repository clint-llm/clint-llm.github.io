Modafinil is a non-amphetamine central nervous system (CNS) stimulant with wakefulness-promoting properties. It is used in the treatment of conditions that cause excessive daytime sleepiness.

**FDA-approved Indications**

- Narcolepsy: First-line treatment; Modafinil is used to treat the daytime fatigue associated with narcolepsy, and it has not been shown to improve symptoms of cataplexy.

- Sleep Work Shift Disorder: First-line treatment

- Obstructive sleep apnea: Adjunct to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)

**Off-labeled Indications**

- Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder

- Acute unipolar and bipolar depressive episodes

- Cocaine dependence: Evidence regarding the efficacy of modafinil for this purpose appears mixed

- Cancer-related fatigue: Evidence regarding the efficacy of modafinil for this use appears mixed

- Multiple sclerosis-related fatigues

The use of modafinil as a “cognitive enhancer” in healthy subjects has been suggested in the literature; however, the precise benefits and risks associated with this use remain uncertain.
