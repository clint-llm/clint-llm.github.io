Due to the marked improvement in symptoms over 3 years, the prognosis of diffuse esophageal spasm is a moderate one.

The appropriate workup for DES should ensue as the chest pain can mimic cardiac, pulmonary and rheumatological disorders.

The chances of mortality with DES is low but it can significantly hamper the quality of life in a patient and can lead to high morbidity in these patients. The increase in the rate of morbidity can be due to:

1. Decreased ability to eat which is mostly secondary to the associated pain

2. The incapacitating pain can lead to a marked reduction in a normal activity which can further challenge the patient emotionally as well as physiologically.

3. The nutritional status of the patient is significantly affected.

The main principle behind counseling the patient of DES should be to relieve the plethora of psychosocial and emotional aspects that present with this disorder, and the patient should have reassurance about the positive aspects and how appropriate monitoring can lead to normalizing of the quality of life.
