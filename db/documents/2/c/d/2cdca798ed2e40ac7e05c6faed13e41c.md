The procedural outcomes depend on correctly identifying the eligible patients. Children and young adults with very high resting peak gradients of ≥100mmHg should undergo SM. ASA is not preferred in the following situations:

- Asymptomatic patients with good exercise capacity.

- LVOT peak gradient of ≥100mmHg leads to suboptimal results.

- Septal thickness <15mm due to increased risk of VSD.

- HCM with septal hypertrophy but without a major septal perforator vessel

- Septal perforator giving collateral blood supply to other areas of the myocardium.

- Septal perforator supplying the larger area of the myocardium than the focused area.

- LVOT obstruction is mainly contributed by mitral valve pathology.

- Other associated cardiac conditions like aortic stenosis, intrinsic mitral valve pathology, or anomalous papillary muscle require surgical repair.
