Wood's lamp does help in the diagnosis of erythrasma. However, if no lamp is available, it is reasonable to start empiric treatment based on the exam. The color fluorescence is due to the coproporphyrin lll manufactured by the bacteria. The biopsy of suspected erythrasma sometimes shows the rod-like organisms. However, these are often difficult to observe, and the biopsy specimen may require a Giemsa stain or Periodic Acid-Schiff stain. This makes biopsy somewhat impractical for diagnosis.
