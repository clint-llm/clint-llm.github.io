The facial nerve follows a complex path. The middle part of the facial nerve runs along the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. It is deeply embedded in its anterior portion, but superficial in its posterior portion, bulging in the tympanic cavity and constituting the prominence of the facial canal. The tympanic portion is located above the dimple of the vestibule window. At this level, the wall of the facial canal is thin exposing the facial nerve. Without pressure equalization of the middle ear, a descent of just 4 feet underwater yields a 90-mmHg pressure differential. This pressure is sufficient to impinge the facial nerve if it is exposed in the facial canal.
