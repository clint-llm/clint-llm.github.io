Etanercept administration is via subcutaneous injection, usually on the thigh, lower abdomen, or upper arm. If given on the abdomen, the injection should not be within the 2-inch area around the navel. Injections should be administered at least 1 inch away from previous injection sites. The medication comes in a pre-filled syringe, automatic injection device, or multiple-dose vial. After the initial injection of etanercept at the clinicianâ€™s office, the patient can self-inject at home with appropriate training.

To treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, 50 mg of etanercept is injected once a week. An alternative dosing regimen is 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly, with at least 72 to 96 hours between injections. For psoriasis, the dosage is 50 mg twice weekly for three months, followed by 50 mg once weekly. Children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis are administered 0.8 mg/kg once a week, up to 50 mg.
