Pharmaceutical RAAS blockade is a common and successful strategy in treating several diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease of all types, including diabetic nephropathy. Indications for the use of ARBs are similar to those for ACEIs. However, in patients who cannot tolerate ACEI therapy due to an ACEI-induced cough or angioneurotic edema, ARB therapy is appropriate and suggested as an alternative. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of ARB therapy in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with hypertension and its related conditions and sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ARBs.
- Summarize the indications for ARB therapy and their place in antihypertensive strategy.
- Review the need for monitoring and follow-up with ARB therapy, including possible adverse reactions.
- Explain the importance of ARB therapy in hypertension management and how it affects therapeutic strategy to improve care coordination and communication among the interprofessional team when using these agents to achieve therapeutic outcomes.
