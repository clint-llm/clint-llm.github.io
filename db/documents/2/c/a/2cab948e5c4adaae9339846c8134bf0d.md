**Respiratory Disease**

Pulmonary involvement may occur in the form of hypoventilation, aspiration pneumonia, or interstitial lung disease. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is present in approximately a third of patients with dermatomyositis and is strongly associated with the presence of anti-histidyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase antibodies. Aspiration pneumonia can occur due to respiratory muscle weakness and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

**Malignancy**

Patients with dermatomyositis are at an increased risk of malignancies, which occur in 24% of cases.

**Heart Disease**

Cardiac involvement in dermatomyositis is usually subclinical. Electrocardiography (ECG) may reveal conduction abnormalities and arrhythmias. Cardiac involvement may occur in the form of myocarditis, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease.

**Esophageal Disease**

Patients can develop dysphagia due to oropharyngeal and esophageal muscle weakness. These conditions can lead to malnutrition and can also increase the risk of aspiration.

Other complications may also include calcinosis, muscle atrophy, and contractures.
