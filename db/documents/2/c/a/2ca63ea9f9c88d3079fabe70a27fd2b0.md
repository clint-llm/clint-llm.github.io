Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening, hyper-inflammatory disorder affecting both newborns and adults alike. The disease is characterized by dysregulated immune activity resulting in malignant inflammation and multi-organ failure. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of HLH and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- Review the laboratory findings consistent with a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- Outline the management options available for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and improve outcomes.
