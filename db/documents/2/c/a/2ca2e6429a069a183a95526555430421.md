The management of lupus nephritis is interprofessional that includes a nephrologist, hematologist, rheumatologist, internist, cardiologist, and intensivist. The aim of treatment is to prevent the progression of renal disease. These patients need very close monitoring because not only does lupus have high morbidity, but the drugs used to manage the symptoms also have a number of serious adverse effects. The overall prognosis for patients with lupusÂ nephritis is guarded. When the disease advances, end-stage renal failure is inevitable.
