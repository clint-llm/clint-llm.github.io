Complications that can occur with paraphimosis include pain, infection, and inflammation of the glans penis. If the condition is not relieved in a sufficiently prompt timeframe, the distal penis can become ischemic or necrotic. Operative complications include bleeding, infection, injury to the urethra, and shortened penile skin.
