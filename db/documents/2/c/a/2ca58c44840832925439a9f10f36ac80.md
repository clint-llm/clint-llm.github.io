Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by the raised levels of ammonia, a nitrogen-containing compound. Normal levels of ammonia in the body vary according to age. Hyperammonemia can result from various congenital and acquired conditions in which it may be the principal toxin. Hyperammonemia may also occur as a part of other disorders that involve various other metabolic abnormalities. Normally, ammonia is produced in the colon and small intestine from where it is transported to the liver to be converted to urea via the urea cycle. Urea, a water-soluble compound, can then be excreted via the kidneys. Ammonia levels rise if the liver is unable to metabolize this toxic compound as a result of an enzymatic defect or hepatocellular damage. The levels may also rise if portal blood is diverted to the systemic circulation, bypassing the liver, or there is increased production of ammonia due to an infection with certain microorganisms.
