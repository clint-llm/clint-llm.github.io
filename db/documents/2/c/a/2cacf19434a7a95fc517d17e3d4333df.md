There are no specific complications to NAVA ventilation mode use. However, it can cause the same complications as other mechanical ventilator modes, such as ventilator-induced lung injury, ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction, ventilator-induced pneumonia, and pneumothorax. The chances of ventilator-induced lung injury and ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction are less with NAVA as delivery of pressure is proportional to the patientâ€™s efforts, and reports have shown the lower need for PIP when using NAVA.
