Chronic inflammation leading to joint damage and destruction is the hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammed synovium in rheumatoid arthritis is thickened and hypertrophied, and consists of an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, plasma cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. The histopathology may simulate a granulomatous structure rich in macrophages and plasma cells, giant cells, lymphoid follicles, and the development of areas of fibrinoid necrosis with longstanding uncontrolled disease.

The classic histologic feature of rheumatoid arthritis, the pannus consisting of fibroblasts, macrophages, lymphocytes, and osteoclast-like cells, can form at the interface of bone/cartilage and synovium and is thought to play a role in bone destruction and erosions by invading the bone and cartilage. Rheumatoid nodules exhibit palisading granulomas on histopathology, with central fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by palisading histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts.
