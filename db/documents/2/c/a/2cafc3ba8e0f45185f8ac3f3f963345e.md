Pulmonary emphysema is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is defined as a pathological, permanent dilatation of distal airways (respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs) due to the destruction of airway walls without fibrotic change. Emphysema interrupts gas exchange, causing an obstructive ventilation defect. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute emphysema and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify risk factors for emphysema.
- Summarize how a patient with emphysema would likely present.
- Describe how to evaluate a patient with suspected emphysema.
- Explain the role of interprofessional teams in caring for patients with emphysema.
