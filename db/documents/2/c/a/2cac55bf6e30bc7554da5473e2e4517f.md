Social anxiety disorder must be differentiated from other disorders, including neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, panic disorder and agoraphobia, depressive disorders, substance-related and addictive disorders, body dysmorphic disorder, and personality disorders such as schizoid personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder. As indicated in the DSM-5 criteria, to make a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, the individual's symptoms must not be better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder.  Other diagnoses to rule out include hikikomori, an extreme form of social withdrawal lasting more than 6 months, occurring among 1.2% of adults in Japan, and schizophrenia.
