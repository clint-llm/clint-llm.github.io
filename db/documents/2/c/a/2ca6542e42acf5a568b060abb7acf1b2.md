The foundation of treatment for medial epicondyle apophysitis is rest from the exacerbating sport and cessation of its repetitive overhead arm motion. Athletes should fully rest the affected arm for 4 to 6 weeks. The use of ice and analgesics such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications may be used for pain control. After refraining from overhead motions for at least 6 weeks, if pain-free, athletes may begin physical therapy focusing on elbow and shoulder strengthening exercises and can initiate a gradual return to a throwing program over the subsequent 6 weeks, with set limitations on throws/pitches.

A common complication of medial epicondyle apophysitis is an avulsion fracture of the medial epicondyle, which responds well to nonoperative treatment. Treatment begins with a long arm cast for 2 to 4 weeks followed by a posterior splint accompanied by passive range of motion exercises 3 to 5 times daily. Once the patient has no tenderness to the medial epicondyle, the patient wears a hinged elbow brace for 6 to 8 weeks. After brace removal, the patient can begin physical therapy to avoid strengthening the flexor and pronator muscle groups until the bony union has been confirmed.
