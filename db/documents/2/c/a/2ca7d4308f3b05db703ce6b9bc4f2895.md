The difficulty with diagnosing and treating aortic stenosis lies with the vast array of nonspecific symptoms the patient may present with, creating a substantial differential. In patients with whom cardiac comorbidities do not exist, and patients do not regularly see a cardiologist, the duty often falls on the primary care physician to perform a proper physical exam that includes auscultation of the heart as the first step in diagnosing asymptomatic aortic valve disease. If symptoms or physical exam findings warrant suspicion, it is vital to send the patient for an echocardiogram and consult a cardiologist for proper staging. A significant responsibility also falls on the patient to give a detailed history and description of symptoms and their progression. The sooner those symptoms are identified and management initiated, the better the patientâ€™s long-term survival.

Proper management of comorbidities by primary care physicians, nurses, and other specialists is essential in ensuring the patient is optimized for surgery if necessary.

In summary, caring for patients with aortic valve disease requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians/specialists, mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
