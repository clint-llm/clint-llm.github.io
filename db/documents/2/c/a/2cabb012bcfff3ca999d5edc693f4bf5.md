Aside from the supplies necessary for vascular access, an ultrasound machine with a high-frequency capable probe is all that is necessary. If the procedure is for central access, full sterile precautions are also required.

Clinicians should be familiar with the specific US machine of the home institution, as there are some differences in design. The US probe indicator is a bump or marking on the side of the probe, which correlates with a marker on one side of the screen  (generally the left) for location identification. The probe indicator should be oriented to correlate with the side of the screen that the marker is on so that the movements of the probe correlate with the movements seen on the screen. This usually is achieved by keeping the probe marker facing towards the patient's right side. The machine also should have markers vertically on the screen to indicate the depth of structures seen, which can be adjusted based on the depth of the target vessel. Long angiocatheters should be used in deep vein access.
