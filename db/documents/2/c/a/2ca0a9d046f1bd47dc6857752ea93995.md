There is limited documentation on the prognosis of trench fever, but the overall mortality is low. Some patients do not require treatment as the infection may result in a self-limited illness. However, due to increasing documentation of bacteremia, recommendation to treat the disease takes precedence. The prognosis can also differ based on the patient's immune status. More severe cases that lead to critical complications and worseÂ outcomes are observed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), transplantation on immunosuppressants, and alcoholism.
