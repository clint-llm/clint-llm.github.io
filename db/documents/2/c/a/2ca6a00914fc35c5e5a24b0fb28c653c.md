Acarbose is a commonly used medication for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. While the drug is useful, it is not a highly effective agent when used as monotherapy. Because the drug works in the gastrointestinal system, the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal upset/bloating. Hence, the prescribing clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA), nurses (especially certified diabetes educators), and pharmacists must educate the patient on how to use the drug. Further, patients should receive counsel to avoid cola beverages, as the adverse abdominal symptoms may worsen.

While hypoglycemia is extremely rare with this agent, one should consider other antidiabetic drugs as the cause if it occurs. The patient should be treated for hypoglycemia and then counseled on preventing further low sugar episodes. Only through patient education can the side effects be limited, and as with any medication, acarbose management is best by an interprofessional healthcare team across various disciplines, who engage in open communication with other team members regarding any changes in the patient's status so appropriate corrective action can be taken if necessary.
