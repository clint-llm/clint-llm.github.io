Surgical resection of gastric lymphoma was the initial first-line treatment. It is now reserved for complications such as perforation, obstruction, or bleeding not amenable to endoscopic therapy. Surgery by an experienced surgical oncologist can be considered in progressive gastric lymphoma despite H. pylori eradication, chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and radiation if the patient defers an expected observation approach. The patient and physician should discuss the risks (as discussed in the Complications section) and the benefits of surgery.
