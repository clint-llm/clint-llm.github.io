Pemphigus herpetiformis is an uncommon subtype of pemphigus with atypical clinical, histological and immunopathological findings. The exact mechanisms underlying pathogenesis remain unclear. The diagnosis of pemphigus herpetiformis is challenging since it is a rare disease with unusual presentation. A significant delay in diagnosis is, therefore, often reported. Intense pruritus associated with urticarial plaques, vesiculobullous eruption in a herpetiform pattern and the absence of mucosal involvement should prompt consideration of the diagnosis. Pemphigus herpetiformis has a good prognosis and responds well to dapsone and/or low doses of steroids; however, some cases may progress into pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceous.
