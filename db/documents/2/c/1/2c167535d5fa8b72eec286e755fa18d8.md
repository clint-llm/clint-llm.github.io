Laboratory evaluation plays a critically important role in diagnosing TTP because signs and symptoms are variable, and end-organ damage can be delayed. For diagnosis, the laboratory data must show anemia and thrombocytopenia along with an indication of active hemolysis, such as the presence of schistocytes, increased unconjugated bilirubin, increased reticulocyte count and increased lactate dehydrogenase.

**PLASMIC Score**

The PLASMIC score is calculated using findings on presentation and predicts the likelihood of ADAMTS13 activity being less than or equal to 10% to help make a presumptive diagnosis of TTP in the appropriate clinical setting.

- Platelet count less than 30,000/microL

- Presence of hemolysis (reticulocyte count greater than 2.5%, undetectable haptoglobin, or indirect bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dL)

- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) less than 90 fL

- International normalized ratio (INR) of less than 1.5

- Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL

- Absence of cancer

- Absence of solid organ or stem cell transplant

The higher the score, the greater the likelihood of TTP, with a score of greater than 5 suggesting a high probability of TTP and a score lower than 5 suggesting a low probability of TTP. This score has been validated with a reported sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 57%. Due to its high negative predictive value, it is recommended as a screening tool for patients who are unlikely to have TTP.

ADAMTS13 activity assays report the activity of the protease as a percentage of normal. An activity level of less than 10% confirms the diagnosis of TTP in patients with evidence of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. However, this assay is not specific for TTP, and levels less than 10% have been reported in cases of severe sepsis and systemic cancer.

Evaluation of end-organ damage is completed by measuring serum troponin levels and obtaining a brain magnetic resonance imaging study.
