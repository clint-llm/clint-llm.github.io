Given a presentation of isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, hemolytic disorders such as sickle cell anemia and pyruvate kinase and G6PD deficiencies need to be excluded. Disorders such as hepatic failure and portosystemic shunts can also contribute to impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake and should be considered, though the clinical presentation of these particular disorders will be obvious. It should be noted that in addition to inherited disorders and particular medication side effects, advanced cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, and immature conjugating ability, which is often seen in neonates, could cause impaired bilirubin conjugation.
