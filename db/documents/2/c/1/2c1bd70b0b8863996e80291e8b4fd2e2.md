There is no established treatment for La Crosse encephalitis, and the approach is primarily focused on symptomatic management.

Intravenous ribavirin has been studied in La Crosse encephalitis; however, its effectiveness remains unclear. Ribavirin has been associated with in vitro inhibition of RNA virus replication and has an off label use in La Crosse encephalitis.

Milder forms of the disease that present with fevers and headaches are often treated conservatively with analgesics, rest, and hydration. In patients presenting with acute encephalopathy, where a high clinical suspicion for viral encephalitis exists, it is reasonable to initiate treatment with intravenous acyclovir until HSV encephalitis has been ruled out.

In patients who develop seizures, antiseizure medications may be indicated to achieve seizure control. Long term use of antiseizure medications can be considered in patients who develop epilepsy.

For patients who develop coma with respiratory compromise, airway management, and ventilatory support, including mechanical intubation, may be required. In some cases of La Crosse encephalitis, central venous pressure monitoring may be useful in maintaining normal intravascular volume in the setting of hyponatremia associated with La Crosse encephalitis.
