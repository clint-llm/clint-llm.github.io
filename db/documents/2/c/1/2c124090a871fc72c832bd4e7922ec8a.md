The management of stroke is with a multidisciplinary team that includes the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, neurologist, radiologist, and the stroke team. The key is to first identify if the stroke is embolic or hemorrhagic and then institute thrombolytic treatment accordingly. For those who recover, physical, speech and occupational therapy may be necessary. The outcomes for patients with mild embolic strokes are good but those with hemorrhagic strokes tend to have poor outcomes.
