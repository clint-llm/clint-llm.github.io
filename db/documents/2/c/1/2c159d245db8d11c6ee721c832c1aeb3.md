Typically, a clinician arrives at the diagnosis of CTS from a thorough history and physical exam. Provocative maneuvers such as Tinel's and Phalen's tests may elicit symptoms of CTS.

It is considered a gold standard in diagnosing CTS as it provides objective, measurable information regarding the median nerve's physiologic health. However, performing electrodiagnostic studies in patients who have unlikely manifestations of CTS (i.e., lack of symptoms in the first three digits) is not helpful, regardless of the result of the NCS.

Other studies used to diagnose CTS include ultrasound (to measure the cross-sectional area of the median nerve) andÂ magnetic resonance imaging of the wrist (to demonstrate abnormal nerve signal).
