While a great deal of embryologic investigation has occurred relative to the triangular fibrocartilagenous complex, studies targeting other ligamentous structures of the wrist are lacking. There are reports that the ligamentous structures begin to appear in Oâ€™Rahilly stage 23 embryos and are complete by week 14 of gestation.

The Interzone is a portion of the condensed mesenchymal structure whose appearance signals the beginning of wrist joint formation. The Interzone forms three layers of which the intermediate layer is thought to be most important to the formation of the ligamentous structures of the wrist.
