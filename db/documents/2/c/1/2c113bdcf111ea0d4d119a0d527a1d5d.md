The substantia nigra is a critical brain region for the production of dopamine and this neurochemical affects many systems of the central nervous system ranging from movement control, cognitive executive functions, and emotional limbic activity. A loss of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra leads to Parkinson disease, and the symptoms of this disease can be treated using dopamine-supplementation approaches. One such treatment is the oral administration of L-DOPA, the precursor in the biological synthesis of dopamine which has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and be used to synthesize dopamine within the central nervous system. The inhibition of the metabolic breakdown of dopamine is also pharmaceutically possible, called monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Dopamine can is replaceable with dopamine receptor agonists such as apomorphine, pramipexole, and ropinirole, but the effects are short-lived and systemic side effects such as emesis and increased sympathetic tone are common.
