Histological evaluation of bone in a patient with osteopetrosis will likely show empty lacunae with plugged Haversian canals, calcified cartilage dispersed within bony trabeculae, and defective osteoclasts that lack a clear zone and ruffled border. These clear zone and ruffled border structures are the trademark findings in osteoclasts undergoing active resorption, and their absence corresponds perfectly with the findings of osteopetrosis.
