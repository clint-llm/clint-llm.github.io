The typical history of a patient with XGP is a middle-aged female presenting with recurrent urinary tract infections most commonly due to Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. In children, the presenting complaint may be fever, flank or abdominal pain, and growth retardation.

The presentation is similar to renal tuberculosis. Hence, the history of travel to the endemic region should be evaluated.

The adult patient with XGP may present with the following symptoms:

- Unilateral flank pain and fever, which are the most common presenting complaints in a patient with XGP. Flank pain is usually unilateral, and the nature of the pain is dull and persistent.

- Urinary symptoms like dysuria, hematuria, and increased urinary frequency

- Anorexia, chills, and weight loss in a few cases

Physical findings:

- High temperature

- Conjunctival pallor due to anemia

- Unilateral or bilateral renal mass on palpation
