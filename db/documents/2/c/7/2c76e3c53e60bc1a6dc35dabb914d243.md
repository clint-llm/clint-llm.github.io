Administration of magnesium can occur in various ways. Dietary intake is the primary source of magnesium for a healthy individual. The recommended daily intake varies with gender and age. Green leafy vegetables, fish, legumes, and whole grains are good sources of magnesium.

Magnesium comes in various salts and forms, including magnesium oxide, magnesium citrate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium gluconate.

- Treatment can be via oral magnesium salts or intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) magnesium sulfate. IV or IM magnesium sulfate is given for severe hypomagnesemia or those unable to tolerate or adhere to oral therapy.

- Patients with alcohol use disorder are treated empirically to avoid hypomagnesemia. For patients with renal insufficiency, the clinician must increase the dose to adjust for the increase in renal loss.

- The clinician must also address concurrent hypokalemia or hypocalcemia.
