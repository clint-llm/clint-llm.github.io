Clobazam was synthesized in the 1960s with the primary goal of providing greater efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-related side effects. FDA indications include adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennoxâ€“Gastaut syndrome in patients two years or older. Non-FDA-approved indications include adjunctive therapy for seizures seen with Dravet syndrome, adjunctive therapy for refractory status epilepticus, adjunctive therapy of refractory focal epilepsy, catamenial epilepsy, and anxiety. This activity reviews indications, mechanism of action, administration, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity associated with clobazam and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with conditions that indicate therapy with clobazam.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of clobazam.
- Identify the approved and non-approved indications for clobazam.
- Review the potential side effects of clobazam.
- Explain the importance of detailed handoffs and interpersonal communication with other professionals involved in managing the patient receiving therapy with clobazam.
