Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the entry of calcium ions into the slow L-type calcium channels in the myocardium and vascular smooth muscle during depolarization. This inhibition will produce relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle as well as coronary vasodilation, which is helpful in patients with hypertension. Verapamil also increases myocardial oxygen delivery, which helps patients with vasospastic angina. Verapamil correlates with negative chronotropic effects and decreased sympathetic nervous system activity.
