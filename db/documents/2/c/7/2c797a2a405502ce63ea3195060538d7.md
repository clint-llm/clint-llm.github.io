**Absolute Contraindications**

- Pregnancy or woman who is likely to become pregnant

- Non-compliance with contraception

- Nursing mothers

Hypersensitivity to drug or components, pregnancy, intent to become pregnant within three years after treatment discontinuation, severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, chronic abnormally elevated blood lipid levels, or concomitant use with methotrexate or tetracyclines.

It is vital that clinicians who prescribe acitretin to women of childbearing age ensure that they do not get pregnant for at least three years after discontinuing the medication.

**United States Boxed Warning**

Female patients should abstain from ethanol during therapy and for at least two months after discontinuing treatment.

**Caution**

- Concomitant administration with methotrexate increases the risk of hepatic adverse effects.

- Concomitant administration with cyclosporine increases the risk of hypertriglyceridemia.

- Acitretin can undergo reverse metabolism to etretinate with acitretin if used in combination with alcohol.

- The use of other vitamin A compounds can lead to hypervitaminosis A-like toxicities.

- The combination of tetracyclines and retinoids can lead to pseudotumor cerebri and should be avoided.

Individuals prescribed acitretin should receive counsel against giving blood donations for at least three years. The drug is known to remain in the blood for a long time, and the risk of genetic defects is high.
