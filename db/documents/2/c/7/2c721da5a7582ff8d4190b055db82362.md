Plastic surgeons primarily perform breast reconstruction. However, in many cases, the primary care provider provides follow-up care. These healthcare professionals need to know the different types of breast construction procedures and how to provide follow-up care for breast cancer screening. Breast reconstruction is only performed after the patient has completed the treatment course for breast cancer and is deemed free of malignancy. Finally, before breast reconstruction, primary care providers should encourage the patient to discontinue smoking to reduce postoperative complications. The overall outcomes after breast reconstruction are good.
