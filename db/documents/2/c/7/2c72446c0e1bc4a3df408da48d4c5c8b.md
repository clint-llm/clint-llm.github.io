Cisatracurium, like the other NMBDs, binds to the nicotinic cholinergic receptor at the muscle motor end-plate but is not capable of inducing the conformational change necessary for ion channel opening. Because acetylcholine cannot bind to its receptors, no end-plate potential can develop. Cisatracurium acts as a competitive antagonist to acetylcholine; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine antagonize this action.

The neuromuscular blocking potency of cisatracurium is roughly three times that of atracurium.

Cisatracurium undergoes organ-independent Hofmann elimination—a chemical process dependent on pH and temperature—to form the monoquaternary acrylate metabolite and laudanosine. Patients with hypothermia, which typically occurs in surgeries needing cardiopulmonary bypass and therapeutic hypothermia, may need a lower dose of cisatracurium. Alternatively, a persistently febrile patient in ARDS on cisatracurium drip may require higher doses of this medication.

The following lists diseases that can lead to hypersensitivity to NMBDs:

- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

- Autoimmune disorders

- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Polymyositis
- Dermatomyositis

- Familial periodic paralysis hyperkalemia

- Guillain-Barre syndrome

- Muscular dystrophy (Duchenne type)

- Myasthenia gravis

- Myasthenic syndrome

- Myotonia

- Dystrophic
- Congenital
- Paramyotonia

The following lists diseases that can lead to a resistance to NMBDs:

- Burn injury

- Cerebral palsy

- Hemiplegia (on the affected side)

- Muscular denervation (peripheral nerve injury)

- Severe chronic infection

- Tetanus
- Botulism
