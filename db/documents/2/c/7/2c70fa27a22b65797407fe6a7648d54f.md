Dakin solution is a strong topical antiseptic widely used to clean infected wounds, ulcers, and burns.

Dilute Dakin solution (0.05% to 0.025%) can be used to irrigate, cleanse, or as a component in wet-to-dry dressings to treat or prevent skin and soft tissue infections.

The mechanism of action of the Dakin solution is mostly unknown, but it acts as a germicidal, bacteriostatic topical agent that can dissolve necrotic tissue debris. Dakin solution is an effective agent against a broad spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as viruses, fungi, and spores. It has bactericidal activity against a variety of organisms, including Enterococcus, Streptococcus mitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It even has been effective against organisms highly resistant to antibiotics, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
