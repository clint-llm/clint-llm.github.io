The closest differential diagnosis for PRS include the following:

- **Rassmussen encephalitis (RE):**It presents with unilateral cerebral involvement and intractable seizures. Focal neurological deficits and subsequent atrophy mimic the presentation of PRS. The histopathological findings of lymphocytic vasculitis in both RE and PRS may complicate the diagnosis. PRS may be associated in cases of RE, developing progressive hemifacial atrophy.

- **Barraquer-Simons syndrome:**It is an acquired progressive lipodystrophy disorder affecting the face, neck, thorax, abdomen, and rarely the extremities. Central nervous system involvement is suggested by epilepsy and bilateral cerebral atrophy. A gradual symmetric bilateral loss of subcutaneous fat tissue with renal involvement helps differentiate this syndrome from PRS.

- **Hemifacial hypertrophy:**This condition shows an asymmetric enlargement of half of the face and head instead of hemiatrophy.

- **Hemifacial fat necrosis:**The causes range from bulbar poliomyelitis, connective tissue diseases to trauma. The absence of muscular or osseous involvement helps differentiate these causes from PRS.

- **Congenital deformities:**Conditions like congenital hemiatrophy or torticollis may mimic facial asymmetry caused by PRS. A careful history of onset helps differentiate these entities.
