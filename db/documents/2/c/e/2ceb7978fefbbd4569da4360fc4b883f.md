Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy arising from the secretory glands, most commonly seen involving the salivary glands. Although uncommon, it is an important differential to consider for a painless swelling in the head and neck region because of its high tendency to metastasize. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ACC and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of adenoid cystic carcinoma.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of adenoid cystic carcinoma.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for adenoid cystic carcinoma.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the treatment for patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma and improve outcomes.
