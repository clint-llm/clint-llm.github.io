Prior to MIP, a localization study is critical to guide operative planning. The gold standard of parathyroid localization is single-radioisotope scintigraphy with technetium-99m (99mTc). In this study, the radioisotope is administered, and either planar or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging follows. An alternative is dual-radioisotope imaging, in which both 99mTc pertechnetate and thallium-201 (201Tl) are given. Thallium is taken up by both the thyroid and parathyroid, while pertechnetate only has avidity for the thyroid. Subtraction imaging is then used to visualize the glands. Drawbacks to this method include the necessity of a subtraction program, long imaging times, and limited views. Other methods of localization such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound are available but are less sensitive.
