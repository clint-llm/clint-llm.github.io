The differential diagnosis for MAS includes other causes of newborn distress:

- Respiratory distress syndrome: This is more common in a preterm infant.

- Transient tachypnea of the newborn: This usually resolves within 72 hours.

- Sepsis/infection/pneumonia: Any newborn with distress should be assessed for infections.

- Congenital heart disease: Usually diagnosed with an echocardiogram.
