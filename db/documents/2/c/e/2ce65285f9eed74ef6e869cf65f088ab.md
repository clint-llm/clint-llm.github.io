Most patients with gout have other comorbidities. The prevalence of gout is higher among individuals with chronic diseases such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction.

Gout treatment requires the collaboration of an entire interprofessional healthcare team approach. The physician (MD, DO, NP, PA) must promptly identify the pathology and rule out differentials. Some cases may require a rheumatology consult. The pharmacological approaches to gout require considering these comorbidities and monitoring their response to treatment. The pharmacist and nurse both must educate the patient on medication compliance. Also, the pharmacist should assist the team by performing medication reconciliation, verifying appropriate dosing, and consulting on agent selection in the event of initial treatment failure. The dietitian should urge the patient to abstain from alcohol, avoid meat-containing foods, and maintain a healthy body weight. The role of specialists, primary care physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and dieticians are all critical in reducing gout morbidities. The medical team should coordinate the patient's education on lifestyle modification, which can contribute to reducing the risk and frequency of gout flare-ups; this is only possible via open communication between all disciplines on the interprofessional team.

All healthcare providers, including primary care and nurse practitioners, should identify classic gout symptoms and have a low threshold for referring the patients for an arthrocentesis if they are uncertain of the diagnosis. Then, working with the interprofessional team as outlined above, direct the treatment as needed and interact with the interprofessional team to drive outcomes. [Level 5]

Referral to a specialist/rheumatologist should be a consideration in the following patients with joint pain:

- Unclear etiology with hyperuricemia

- Unclear etiology with normal serum urate level

- Patients with renal impairment

- Failed trial of xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment

- Multiple side effects from the medications

- Refractory gout

Only through an interprofessional team approach with close communication can the morbidity of gout be lowered.
