Maxillary sinus fractures (MSFs) are most commonly caused by blunt force trauma to the face. Depending on the magnitude and location of the direct injury, MSFs can vary in appearance and symptomatology. Trauma etiologies include motor vehicle accidents, domestic disputes, falls, industrial accidents, or assaults with or without a weapon. After appropriate workup, including a focused history and physical with imaging, management options need to be discussed with the patient based on the extent of the damage to the maxillary sinus and its surrounding structures. This activity reviews the role of the various members within an interprofessional team in improving care for patients with MSFs.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of maxillary sinus fractures.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of maxillary sinus fractures.
- Outline the management options available for maxillary sinus fractures.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with maxillary sinus fractures.
