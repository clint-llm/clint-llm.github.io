The clinically significant growth of pathogenic microorganisms into the sterile abdominal cavity is most often accomplished by violation (most commonly perforation) of the gastrointestinal (GI) viscera anywhere along the track, which can be precipitated by a chronic disease process and make tissue friable and more susceptible to rupture, or an acute onset disease (e.g., cholecystitis, pancreatitis). Mechanical violations of the abdominal wallÂ are also responsible for a significant proportion of infections, including but not limited to trauma, surgery, and seeding from dialysis catheters. To a lesser degree, an infection can manifest as a result of hematogenous spread in immunocompromised patients and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in individuals with ascitic fluid collection resultant from cirrhosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and nephrotic disease.
