Drug testing is now commonly done in clinical medicine for a variety of reasons. Because of the stigma associated with drug use and positive drug tests, the physician has an important role in setting the non-judgemental tone that may influence a patient's care. It is important that every member of the care team (physicians, nursing, ancillary staff, etc.) understand why drug testing is being performed. In the clinical setting, positive drug test results should not be used for punitive purposes. Instead, the result should be looked at as an opportunity to have a discussion concerning potential drug use in a patient. Finally, random drug testing on every patient is not recommended; it has to be supported by history and a physical exam. Healthcare workers including nurses and pharmacists should be aware of the laws surrounding drug usage, drug test results, and confidentiality laws.

Drug testing in the workplace is vastly different in purpose than in the clinical setting and it is an important tool to identify those who may be working under the influence, as this can be a potential safety concern. It is important that test results are confirmed prior to any sanctions against an employee being made.
