It is paramount to monitor the blood glucose concentrations while using insulin for optimal glycemic control without causing hypoglycemia (or hyperglycemia). This monitoring is commonly done with regular blood glucose checking with finger prick glucose testing using a glucometer. There are novel techniques now available for continuous glucose monitoring that work via a sensing device inserted subcutaneously. The device measures the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid between the cells and transmits this information to a monitoring device. The glucose concentrations can be tracked consistently during the day as well as at night with this device. Also, long-term glycemic control can be monitored by using glycated hemoglobin, also known as hemoglobin A1C.
