NK cells are large and exhibit various shapes and express microvilli more prominently in the area of effector-to-target contact. At the same time, microvilli are scant cell surface in the absence of target cells. Membranes are not extensively fused in the region of target and effector cell contact.

NK cells have structurally distinct granules that consist of two different compartments. The outer compartment includes the lysosome-associated phosphatase acid enzymes and trimetaphosphatase. No enzymatic activities associated with the inner compartment have been identified. At the time of degranulation, a limited area of the cytoplasm exhibits vacuole-like areas possessing granules and apparent granular debris. Degranulation appears to be implicated in NK cells' cytotoxic activity. Convoluted nuclei with distinctive polarity against the dense granules and pseudopodia are typical. In the cytoplasm, both Mitochondria and polysomes are observed.
