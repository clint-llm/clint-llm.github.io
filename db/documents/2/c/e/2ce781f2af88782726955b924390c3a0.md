The muscles and nerve innervation of the pharynx derive embryologically from the third and fourth brachial arches. The third branchial arch develops into the stylopharyngeus muscle. The third arch also forms the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), which is the nerve that innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle. The fourth branchial arch forms most of the pharyngeal constrictors as well as the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X). Subsequently, the vagus nerve innervates most of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles.
