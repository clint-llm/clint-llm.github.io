The majority of cases of exodeviations start shortly after birth. In a study of 472 patients with intermittent exotropia, 204 had the deviation from birth, appeared around the age of 6 months among 16 patients, and between 6 to 12 months among 72 patients.

Most studies describe a preponderance of female patients in exotropia. Another study of 10 years duration from the United States found 205 children with exotropia. An annual incidence of 64.1 of 100,000 patients was found among children lesser than 19 years of age.
