An important cause of falls in the elderly population is the presence of sarcopenia. Sarcopenia can be related to a food decline, a long hospital stay, and/or a long illness. Generally, the elderly have a decrease in mass volume and coordination, with phenotypic changes, such as selective loss of white fibers.

Another cause of falls is the presence of cognitive impairment that is often found in the elderly, especially in those with a long illness, pain, or mood changes.

Postprandial hypotension is a non-physiological reason that causes falls in elderly subjects, probably due to an autonomic system dysfunction or the declining function of the cardiovascular system.

Obesity in the elderly is another cause linked to the increase in falls, probably due to a further decline in muscle mass and neuromuscular function.

Osteoporosis can cause rupture of the femoral neck in elderly subjects, and this event can often confuse the providers, particularly when the patient is uncooperative.

Another cause that leads to motor instability and an increase in the percentage of falls is the decline in the strength of the diaphragm muscle. A decrease in strength and function of the diaphragm causes instability in the back area and leads to falls.
