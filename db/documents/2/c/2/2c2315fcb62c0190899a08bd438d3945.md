An HIV-1 virion consists of two identical strands of RNA and associated enzymes, including reverse transcriptase packaged in a cone-shaped core composed of p24 capsid protein with a surrounding p17 protein matrix, all enclosed by a phospholipid membrane envelope derived from the host cell. Glycoproteins, gp41 and gp120, are bound to the envelope. CD4+ and chemokine receptors on the host cell surface function as HIV-1 receptors.

The HIV life cycle starts with the virion binding to CD4+ and chemokine receptor. Fusion of HIV membrane with cell membrane occurs, followed by the entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Reverse transcriptase mediates the synthesis of proviral DNA leading to the integration of provirus into the cell genome. Subsequently, cytokine activation of the cell, transcription of HIV genome, transport of spliced and unspliced RNAs to cytoplasm occur. Synthesis of HIV proteins and assembly takes place and finally the expression of gp120/gp41 on the cell surface, and budding of mature virion transpires. An infected cell produces many virions that are capable of infecting CD4+ cells, macrophages, and neurons, thereby amplifying the infectious cycle.

The pathognomonic feature of HIV is the progressive reduction in the CD4+ T cells, leading to the destruction of both cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune mechanisms.
