The workup should include:

**Laboratory**

There is no specific laboratory finding. Laboratory findings of hypothyroidism- elevated TSH, low T3, and T4; Hashimoto thyroiditis - elevated antithyroglobulin or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies occur commonly.

**Imaging**

Thyroid ultrasound is the recommended initial imaging modality. Thyroid ultrasound frequently shows multiple hypoechogenic areas appearing as pseudocysts.

**Pathology**

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is the initial diagnostic procedure for thyroid tissue sampling.
