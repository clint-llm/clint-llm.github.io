**Pharmacology**

The following are the common pharmacological agents that can be used in palliative sedation.

**Drug class**

**Mechanism of action**

**Indication**

**Side effects**



**Benzodiazepines**



e.g. Lorazepam, Midazolam

GABA agonist with CNS depression.



Agitated delirium, anxiety.



Can cause worsening of confusion and agitation when administered frequently. When administered with other agents such as opiates, it can cause respiratory depression.



**Antipsychotics (first generation)**

e.g., haloperidol, chlorpromazine.







Dopamine D2 blockade in haloperidol and, additionally, 5HT, H, alpha, alpha, and a muscarinic antagonist in chlorpromazine.

Agitated delirium.







Anticholinergic effects, orthostatic hypotension (which can be severe) with rapid IV administration, akathisia, acute dystonic reactions, seizures, and cardiotoxicity associated with QT prolongation.





**Propofol**





GABA agonist and potentially by inhibition of glutamate



For agitated delirium in patients with poor response to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.

Hypotension, thrombophlebitis, propofol infusion syndrome.





**Barbiturates**





GABA agonist and inhibition of glutamate.



For agitated delirium in patients with poor response to antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.

Hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure and heart rate), nausea, vomiting. Enzyme induction and resultant decreased efficacy of other drugs.



**Opiates**

e.g., morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone



Binds to opioid receptors (e.g., mu) in the CNS and causes CNS depression.





For pain relief and respiratory distress.



It can lead to respiratory depression.

**Respite Sedation vs. Continuous Sedation**

Respite sedation refers to the temporary use of sedative agents to relieve symptoms such as pain, nausea, agitation. These symptoms may or may not be refractory. Patients are typically started on sedative agents for a brief, predetermined period (e.g., 24 to 48 hours) with frequent reassessment. The dose of the sedating agent is then decreased till the patient is fully conscious after the predetermined period, e.g., using propofol for sedation and analgesia in a patient presenting with an acutely dislocated shoulder while planning for reduction of the joint.

Most patients with a terminal illness and refractory pain who have shown poor response to conventional therapy are placed on continuous sedation. As the name suggests, with this form of sedation, no attempt is made to wean the sedative medication off, and it is typically continued till the patient's demise.
