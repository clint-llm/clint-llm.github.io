Balance is an ability we have to carry out motion and mobility throughout our daily activities effectively. It is composed of different factors, including but not limited to somatosensory, vestibular, and postural responses, among others.

Neurological conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and other studied populations as lower extremity amputees can lead to impaired balance, which can, in turn, lead to an increased risk of falls and a further decline in daily function and performance of ADLs.

Maintaining proper balance can further prevent falls, a common health issue with possible serious complications, especially in the elderly.

The Berg Balance Scale is a test that can be performed during an inpatient rehabilitation stay as part of the goals and treatment plan for the individual affected. The goals set are then further assessed during interdisciplinary team rounds that can include the occupational therapist, physical therapist, nursing staff, social worker, and physiatrist to conjunctively come up with a plan and prepare the patient for discharge. The entire team is responsible for assessing the patients' needs as they spend the most time with the patient and can further predict what the patient will need after discharge. This is why the scale is useful, as durable medical equipment (DME) and family training can be done for a safe discharge.

Furthermore, when performing this test, the nursing staff can monitor for any changes in vital signs during the testing if the patient is unable to tolerate and becomes hemodynamically unstable.

The multidisciplinary team, composed of the healthcare workers, also needs the ability to communicate with the family member and/or caregivers, that is aware of the risks of falls, and aware of expectations with test score results can further improve outcomes as even after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation the patient needs to continue treatment at home.
