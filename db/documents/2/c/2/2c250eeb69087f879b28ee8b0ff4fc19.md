IC pathophysiology

Biomarkers

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome can appear as two different entities. The interstitial cystitis aspect clearly demonstrates an inflammatory component that is mostly missing in those with bladder pain syndrome.

The underlying pathophysiology of IC/BPS is somewhat uncertain, contributing to the lack of a definitive, curative remedy.

Other findings associated with chronic bladder inflammation include decreased mucosal protection from glycosaminoglycans dysfunction, lower adhesive protein E-cadherin, decreased basal cell growth, defective umbrella cell integrity, abnormal apical cell maturation, and increased urothelial cell apoptosis.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients are much more likely than the general population to have systemic lupus erythematosus.

Chronic stress is found more than 50% of IC/BPS patients and is a factor in the development and exacerbation of symptoms.
