The primary clinical methods of monitoring myometrial activity include the use of external tocometers and intrauterine pressure catheters. Although both devices allow visualization of contractions relative to the fetal heart rate, only intrauterine pressure catheters enable precise measurement of the strength of uterine contractions. There should be 3 to 5 contractions in the 10-minute window, each lasting 30 to 40 seconds. The monitoring of uterine contractions should be continuous during labor.

**External Tocometer**

Two probes are placed on the woman’s abdomen, one over the uterine fundus, the other in proximity to the fetal heart. This approach is the standard method of monitoring uterine contractions in laboring women.

**Intrauterine Pressure Catheter**

A thin catheter is inserted into the uterus and monitors changes in pressure. The standard unit of measurement is the Montevideo unit (MVU). Adequate contractions are defined as a total of 200 MVU within 10 minutes. Internal monitoring has limited use because it requires the rupture of fetal membranes for placement. It is commonly used in combination with a fetal scalp electrode that monitors fetal heart rate.
