- Patients receiving aminophylline require monitoring for CNS effects, respiratory rate, arterial blood gasses, and serum theophylline concentrations.

- Clinicians must measure serum concentrations before initiating a loading dose in a person who has taken theophylline in the last 24 hours. A repeat serum concentration is necessary before starting the maintenance dose, as well.

- In children, the therapeutic range of aminophylline is 5 to 15 mcg/mL.

- Ensure a therapeutic range of aminophylline in adults, which is 10 to 20 mcg/mL.
