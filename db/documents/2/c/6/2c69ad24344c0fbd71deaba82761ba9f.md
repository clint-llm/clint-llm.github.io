The etiology of primary pulmonary hypoplasia is not entirely understood. It is multifactorial in origin with genetic, environmental, maternal, and nutritional factors all thought to be contributing. Examples of primary pulmonary hypoplasia include congenital acinar dysplasia and hypoplastic lung in genetic disorders like trisomy 21. Secondary causes of pulmonary hypoplasia are due to fetal lung compression secondary to underlying anomalies affecting the thoracic cavity or amniotic fluid volume.

Intrathoracic or intra-abdominal space-occupying lesions like congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations are frequently referred to in the current literature as congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) or chest wall deformities like skeletal dysplasias interfere with fetal lung development before 16 weeks of gestation. In contrast, oligohydramnios secondary to lack of functional renal parenchyma (renal agenesis, Potter syndrome), urinary outflow tract abnormalities, or prolonged premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) affect lung development after 16 weeks of gestation.

Premature rupture of membranes has also been associated with increased risk of hypoplasia secondary to oligohydramnios, with gestational age less than 25 weeks and oligohydramnios with a pocket less than 1 cm as independent risk factors for fatal pulmonary hypoplasia.
