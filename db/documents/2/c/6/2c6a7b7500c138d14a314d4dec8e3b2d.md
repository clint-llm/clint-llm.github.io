Nitrofurantoin is a relatively safe drug compared to alternatives. Comparator drugs such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin often have more reported side effects than nitrofurantoin. The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. These symptoms usually develop in the first week of therapy. Modern formulations, specifically the macrocrystalline form of the drug, have less frequency of these effects due to attempts by manufacturers to alter the crystal size, which affects gastrointestinal absorption.

More severe reactions to nitrofurantoin exist. The most well-known severe reaction is pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity caused by nitrofurantoin can be categorized into acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary reactions. Acute pulmonary reaction syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of fever, chills, cough, myalgia, and dyspnea. Sub-acute pulmonary reactions also occur and are characterized by persistent dry cough, dyspnea, and fever. This chronic pulmonary reaction is associated with the insidious onset of persistent dry cough and dyspnea. Acute, subacute, and chronic pulmonary toxicity is reversible with immediate cessation of the drug. This effect remains uncommon, with one study showing the calculated frequency for all pulmonary reactions were only present in 0.001% of nitrofurantoin courses.

The severity of the nitrofurantoin-induced liver injury ranges from mildly symptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels to cholestatic jaundice,  hepatitis, and hepatic necrosis. Nitrofurantoin can also lead to fulminant liver failure and death. The drug should be ceased immediately in these cases. Complete recovery is expected, but recovery is slow. (2 to 6 months). In rare cases, chronic liver injury persists. Because of the autoimmune features of many cases of nitrofurantoin hepatotoxicity, corticosteroids are frequently used, especially in chronic and severe cases. However, the ultimate therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroid therapy is not yet established. In addition, caution is advised with corticosteroid therapy due to the risk of relapse.

Peripheral neuropathy is another known rare adverse effect and is mainly associated with prolonged use in patients with poor renal function. Typically, nitrofurantoin-induced neuropathy is length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy. There is moderate to severe abnormal sensory and motor conduction in NCS (nerve conduction studies) and axonal degeneration on sural nerve biopsy. However, it is important to note that, non–length-dependent small-fiber neuropathy that is not dose-dependent nor associated with impaired renal function has been reported. In addition, the skin biopsy demonstrated clustered terminal nerve swellings without evidence of nerve fiber degeneration.
