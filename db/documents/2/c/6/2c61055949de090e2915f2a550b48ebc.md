Hematuria is commonly seen in clinical practice. Because of the vast number of conditions that can cause hematuria, the presentation is best managed by an interprofessional team. In most cases, initial management will involve a primary care physician or emergency medicine physician. After getting the initial workup, a referral to a nephrologist or urologist may be indicated.

Inpatient or outpatient referral decision depends on the severity of presentation, abnormal lab findings, and the presence of risk factors for serious etiology.
