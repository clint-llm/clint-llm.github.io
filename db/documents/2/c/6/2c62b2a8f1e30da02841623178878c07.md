Two different research teams simultaneously invented the direct ELISA; scientists Engvall and Perlman, and scientists Van Weemen and Schuurs. The ELISA was developed by the modification of the radioimmunoassay (RIA). This was done by conjugating tagged antigens and antibodies with enzymes rather than radioactive iodine 125. The new method was first employed in determining the levels of IgG in rabbit serum. Within the same year, scientists quantified human chorionic gonadotropin in urine using horseradish peroxidase. Since then, the ELISA method has been used in many different applications and has become a routine laboratory research and diagnostic method worldwide.

The first ELISA methodology involved chromogenic reporter molecules and substrates in generating observable color change that monitors the presence of antigen. Further advancement in the ELISA technique led to the development of fluorogenic, quantitative PCR, and electrochemiluminescent reporters to generate signals.

The latest development, in 2012, was an ultrasensitive enzyme-based ELISA that manipulates nanoparticles as chromogenic reporters. This technique can generate a color signal visible to the naked eye, with a blue color indicating positive results and red color indicating negative results. However, this method is qualitative and can determine only the presence or absence of an analyte and not its concentration.
