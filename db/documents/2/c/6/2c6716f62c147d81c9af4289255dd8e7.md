For classic paraneoplastic syndromes, the prognosis is overall poor, with the exception of young males with testicular cancer and anti-Ma-2 antibodies who are known to have a better prognosis. Children with anti-Hu encephalomyelitis are exceptionally treatment-resistant.

Factors associated with poor neurological outcomes include delay in administering immunotherapy, need for mechanical ventilation, intrathecal inflammation, and need for tracheostomy.

The main causes of death are brainstem or autonomic dysfunction, severe pneumonia, multiple organ dysfunction syndromes, and refractory status epilepticus.

Some patients may develop a second paraneoplastic syndrome after recovering stabilizing from the first, indicating cancer relapse or the presence of second cancer.

Limbic encephalitis from immune checkpoint inhibitors is secondary to cancer treatment and usually responds well to drug cessation and rapid initiation of steroids.
