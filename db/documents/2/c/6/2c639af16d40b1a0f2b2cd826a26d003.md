Sinus squeeze is the second most common complication occurring with underwater diving. The most common disorder seen among divers is ear barotrauma. During the descent, increases in ambient pressure can lead to mucosal engorgement and edema. This can cause a blockage of the sinus ostia, trapping fluid in the sinus cavity, and ultimately increasing intrasinus pressure. The frontal sinus is most commonly affected due to the relatively long and tortuous nature of its duct. Common symptoms include a headache, epistaxis, and localized sinus pain. If blockage of a sinus ostium does occur during descent, the subsequent ascent can lead to intrasinus volume expansion and a resulting pressure differential that may be sufficient to rupture the sinus. Pneumocephalus is a serious clinical diagnosis in such cases. The treatment in such cases is careful observation and prophylactic antibiotics for meningitis. Antibiotic coverage has traditionally included agents in the penicillin or cephalosporin classes.
