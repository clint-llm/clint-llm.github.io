Gastric atrophy (GA) and intestinal metaplasia of the gastric mucosa (GIM) are collectively known as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). These early conditions can progress to gastric adenocarcinoma. This review focuses on the current evidence and guidelines in the diagnosis, management, and surveillance of chronic atrophic gastritis in order to identify those individuals at risk of progression to gastric adenocarcinoma. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients suffering from atrophic gastritis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the laboratory and endoscopic findings of chronic atrophic gastritis.
- Review the pathophysiology of chronic atrophic gastritis.
- Explain the importance of monitoring and surveillance for patients with chronic atrophic gastritis.
- Outline the importance of interprofessional collaboration in the long term management of individuals with chronic atrophic gastritis.
