Histologic examination is also dependent on etiology.

- Crohnâ€™s Disease: Lymphoid aggregates, transmural inflammation, non-caseating granulomas

- Adenocarcinoma: Likely inflammatory aggregates adjacent to the tumor present

- Diverticular Disease: Hypertrophy of the muscle layers, luminal narrowing, and an excess of mast cells within the bowel wall layers
