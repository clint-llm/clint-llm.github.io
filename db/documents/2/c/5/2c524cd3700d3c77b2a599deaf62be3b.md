The differential diagnosis list is extensive, and each option has distinct presenting symptoms on physical exam or imaging. Some osseous-related pain that can mimic LT instability includes fractures of the ulnar styloid, pisiform or hamate. Injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex, extensor carpi ulnaris, and flexor carpi ulnaris are soft tissue injuries that can also mimic LT instability. Some vascular diseases that can mimic LT instability include Kienbock syndrome or hypothenar hammer syndrome. Neurological diseases that should be considered include ulnar nerve entrapment and ulnar dorsal sensory branch neuritis.
