Ectropion is an eversion or outward turning of the eyelid margin leading to loss of the natural apposition of the eyelid to the globe. Ectropion may be classified as congenital, involutional, paralytic, cicatricial, or mechanical. Patients with ectropion report symptoms of corneal exposure, irritation, or epiphora due to ocular exposure, inadequate lubrication due to disruption of the tear film, and corneal disease. Medical management of underlying pathophysiologic processes and symptom control should be optimized before attempting surgical repair of the lesion. This activity describes the relevant anatomy, etiology, presentation, and surgical treatment of ectropion while highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in optimizing patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Classify the different subtypes of ectropion with respect to underlying etiology.
- Articulate the common signs and symptoms of ectropion.
- Compare and contrast the surgical treatment of ectropion subtypes.
- Apply effective interprofessional team processes for prehospital and hospital care services to enhance clinical outcomes for patients undergoing surgical ectropion repair.
