Prochlorperazine is a medication that can produce numerous side effects and drug-drug interactions. Therefore, close interprofessional coordination amongst clinicians (Mds, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers is necessary to monitor for signs and symptoms related to the above. Working together with team members and the patient is also essential to determine if prochlorperazine is the optimal therapeutic choice and increase medication adherence. As referenced above, prescribers should investigate cytochrome P450 enzyme status. Nurses can provide patient counsel on dosing, potential adverse events to watch for and answer patient questions. Pharmacists can perform medication reconciliation, paying particular attention to CYP450 inducers and inhibitors. This interprofessional team approach will drive better patient outcomes and preclude more serious adverse events. [Level 5]
