Early clinical suspicion for the disease entity can lead to rapid diagnosis and better outcomes. Oncologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, intensivists, hospitalists, physical medicine/rehabilitation physicians, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists should be involved early in the patient's care, to speed diagnosis and therapy initiation. Patient education about the condition is important to ensure compliance with therapies provided. Palliative care should be involved in cases where the prognosis is poor.
