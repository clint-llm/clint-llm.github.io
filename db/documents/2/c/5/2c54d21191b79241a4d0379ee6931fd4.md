Globally, 1 in 11 adults has DM (90% having T2DM). The onset of T1DM gradually increases from birth and peaks at ages 4 to 6 years and then again from 10 to 14 years.

The onset of T2DM is usually later in life, though obesity in adolescents has led to an increase in T2DM in younger populations. T2DM has a prevalence of about 9% in the total population of the United States, but approximately 25% in those over 65 years. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 1 in 11 adults between 20 and 79 years had DM globally in 2015. Experts expect the prevalence of DM to increase from 415 to 642 million by 2040, with the most significant increase in populations transitioning from low to middle-income levels.
