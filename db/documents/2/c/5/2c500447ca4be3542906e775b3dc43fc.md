Error management training derives from the cognitive theory that describes work-related actions to be based on action-oriented mental models.

The two key elements of error management training based learning are 1) learners are “given only minimal guidance and otherwise, are encouraged to actively explore and experiment on their own,” and 2) “EMT creates a learning environment in which errors are likely to occur.”
