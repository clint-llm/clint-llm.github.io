**Macroanatomy**

The cornea is a transparent avascular structure that protects structures inside the eye and contributes to two-thirds of its refractive power. The cornea is convex, has a diameter of approximately 11.5 mm, and increases in thickness from the center (550-565 μm) to the periphery (610-640 μm).

**Microanatomy**

The layers anteroposteriorly include the epithelium, Bowman’s layer, stroma, Descemet’s membrane, and endothelium.

The epithelium is the main barrier to the eye, provides a smooth optical surface and performs immunological functions. It consists of 5 to 7 cell layers in the center and 7 to 10 cell layers in the periphery, with an approximate thickness of 50 μm. The limbal stem cell hypothesis suggests the proliferation of stem cells and transient amplifying cells in the periphery with central migration to replace cells lost on the surface.

Bowman’s layer is a tough tissue composed of primarily type I and V collagen and is an acellular condensate of the stroma. It contributes to the corneal shape.

The corneal stroma provides mechanical strength and refractive power and consists of regularly arranged collagen fibers, glycosaminoglycans, and interconnected keratocytes, in packed layers or lamellae.  At the corneal center, there are 200 lamellae, with a much higher packing density and interconnectivity in the anterior area compared to the posterior. In DSEK/DSAEK, when the air bubble is introduced to separate the endothelium and DM part of the posterior stroma adheres to the DM, suggesting a natural cleavage plane in the stroma ten μm above the DM.

DM is a 7-10 micrometer structure that consists of Type IV collagen and laminin and is secreted by endothelial cells continuously.
