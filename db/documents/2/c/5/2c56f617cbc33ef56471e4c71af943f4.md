Capgras syndrome (CS), or delusion of doubles, is a delusional misidentification syndrome.

Brain damage in the bifrontal, right limbic, and temporal regions can cause CS.

**Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) Classification**

CS has not been addressed within the DSM-5 because of its rare nature.Â It suits either the persecutory or unspecified delusion type.

**Historical Perspective**

CS is named after Joseph Capgras, a psychiatrist of French origin. In 1923, Joseph Capgras first defined the disorder in a paper that reported a case of a French-origin woman who complained that corresponding doubles had replaced her husband and other persons she knew. The woman also believed that there existed a double of herself. The authors referred to this syndrome as "I'illusion des sosies," which translates to mean "the illusion of look-alikes."

Initially, CS was regarded as a psychiatric disorder, similar to delusions in schizophrenia. CS was connected to hysteria as seen predominantly in females.
