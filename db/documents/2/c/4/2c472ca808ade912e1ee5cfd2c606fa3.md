The majority of patients with BE have a known history of chronic GERD. GERD is the reflux of stomach and bile acids through the lower esophageal sphincter and into the distal esophagus. The stomach lining is mucinous columnar epithelium made to withstand the acidic environment required for digestion; however, the esophagus is lined by squamous epithelium.  As a response to the acidic irritant, the squamous epithelium becomes inflamed.  Continued exposure to acids leads to persistent inflammation and a columnar metaplasia reaction with the eventual development of an intestinal-type phenotype characterized by the presence of goblet cells.

Risk factors for GERD include conditions which weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, such as a hiatal hernia or pregnancy, conditions causing increased pressure on the stomach, including obesity, pregnancy, and asthma, and conditions which affect transit of food from the stomach to the small intestine, such as diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, and connective tissue disorders.

Why BE develops in some patients with GERD and not in others remains unclear. However, research has identified a few risk factors. BE has a male predominance of 3:1, is more common in those of white ethnicity, and has a prevalence that increases with age. Obesity, more specifically, abdominal adiposity rather than BMI, is another strong risk factor for both GERD and BE.
