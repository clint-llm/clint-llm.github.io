Emtricitabine, along with the other drugs in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) category, interacts with mitochondrial DNA polymerase, causing myopathy and neuropathy. This toxic interaction also has associations with hepatic steatosis and lactic acidosis. Emtricitabine has not shown any adverse effects on the mitochondrial function of developing fetuses and is not known to be teratogenic. There has been no evidence of emtricitabine affecting the fertility rates of women taking the drug.
