For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. If necessary, laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance.

Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of a rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be taken before patient testing is performed. The criteria for acceptable performance for amylase assay by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) proficiency program is within Â± 30% of the mean value of laboratory peer groups.
