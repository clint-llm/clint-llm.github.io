A case report highlighted a trauma to the lingual artery due to traumatic intubation following cardiac surgery.

The presence of a lingual carcinoma can cause a rupture of the lingual artery and cause severe hemorrhage.

Facial trauma could cause dilation of the lingual artery (pseudoaneurysm), which could lead to hemorrhage.
