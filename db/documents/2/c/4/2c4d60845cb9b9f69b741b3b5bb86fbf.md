Tests of renal function can be used to assess overall renal function by direct measurement or estimation of the glomerular filtration rate. Estimation of the GFR is utilized to determine the presence of renal impairment. If reduced over a specified period, it can identify the presence of chronic kidney disease as well as its staging. Additionally, tests of renal function can be utilized to determine if the renal disease is acute or chronic. In the case of urine albumin, it can be used to detect incipient nephropathy in at-risk patients, for example, in patients with diabetes.

Disorders of tubular function such as Fanconi syndrome can be detected using tests of renal function, in particular, the measurement of urine amino acids, glucose, phosphate, and pH.
