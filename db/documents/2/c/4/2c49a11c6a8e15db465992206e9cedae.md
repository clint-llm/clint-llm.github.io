Tricyclic antidepressants act on approximately five different neurotransmitter pathways to achieve their effects. They block the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in presynaptic terminals, which leads to increased concentration of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. The increased concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin in the synapse likely contribute to its anti-depressive effect. Additionally, they act as competitive antagonists on post-synaptic alpha cholinergic (alpha1 and alpha2), muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors (H1).

The chemical structure of a TCA consists of a three-ringed structure with an attached secondary or tertiary amine. Secondary amines include desipramine, nortriptyline, and protriptyline, while tertiary amines consist of amitryptiline, clomipramine, doxepin, imipramine, and trimipramine. Tertiary amines tend to have greater blockage of serotonin reuptake, while secondary amines have greater blockage of norepinephrine uptake.
