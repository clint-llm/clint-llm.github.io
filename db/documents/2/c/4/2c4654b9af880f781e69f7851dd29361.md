Toxin-producing strains of V. cholerae cause the disease process. V. cholerae is a highly motile, comma-shaped gram-negative bacteria with a single polar flagellum. It has hundreds of serogroups that include pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Until recently, the disease was caused by only 2 of these serotypes, Inaba and Ogawa, and 2 biotypes, classical and El Tor, of toxigenic serogroup O1. In 1992, serogroup O139, or Bengal, emerged as another epidemic variant of V. cholerae.

Cholera is transmitted through contaminated water and/or food especially in vulnerable communities affected by natural disasters, war, and famines. Humans are the only natural host for V. cholerae, and transmission is by the fecal-oral route. However, V. cholerae is also found as a free-living organism in brackish water and can survive in fresh or saltwater, which explains the occasional infections via shellfish.
