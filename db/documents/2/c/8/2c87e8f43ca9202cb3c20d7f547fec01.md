The Seton procedure requires essentially no patient preparation though some prefer a single enema the morning ofÂ the procedure to clean stool from the rectal vault. The rest of the preparation is with positioning in the operating room and making sure the instruments are present, and the Seton material of choice is present. Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics to cover the coliforms may be considered.
