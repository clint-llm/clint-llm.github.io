Glomus jugulare tumors arise from the paraganglia cells located in the adventitia wall of the jugular bulb, within the jugular foramen. They have slow growth and are usually benign. However, due to their location, they can cause a mass effect with invasion and erosion of the temporal bone as they increase in size. Only 1% to 5% are malignant.
