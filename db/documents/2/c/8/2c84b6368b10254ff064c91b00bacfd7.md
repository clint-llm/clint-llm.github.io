Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) has many renal and extrarenal complications, such as hypertension, kidney failure, liver, and pancreatic cysts, and intracranial aneurysms, but has no cure yet. The complications can be treated, but renal insufficiency is progressive. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) antagonist as it slows the development and growth of the cysts and thus is an effective treatment of ADPKD.
