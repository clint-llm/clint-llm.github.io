Due to the cost associated with a PCSK9 inhibitor, collaboration among physicians, clinical pharmacists, and specialty pharmacies is essential to ensure patient adherence to therapy. For example, interprofessional team members may be required to complete financial assistance paperwork, submit a prior authorization, or obtain a manufacturer discount card for the patient to be able to start therapy. To successfully administer this drug safely, a specialty-trained nurse, pharmacist, and clinician must work as a team and be responsible for ensuring appropriate PCSK9 inhibitor administration techniques, monitoring laboratory values and adverse effects, and dosing and appropriate dosing education of the patient and family. The pharmacist (including board-certified cardiology specialized pharmacists) can consult with the prescriber regarding dosing and proper administration intervals. Using this type of interprofessional team paradigm, these new agents can achieve their intended therapeutic goals for patients, particularly those who are unsuccessful in using statin therapy.
