The clinician has a few options for testing for the cardiac index at his or her disposal. Given the specific circumstances, necessity, and acuity of the patient's medical picture, the provider can choose from this battery of options to best suit the patient's needs. They range from non-invasive imaging techniques to highly invasive pressure readings. It bears mentioning that although non-invasive procedures are available and can provide an accurate value, there is limited evidence that the benefits of value outweigh the risks and complications of the invasive procedures. Furthermore, given that there is no gold-standard for measuring cardiac output and, by proxy, cardiac index, caution should be taken to pick the appropriate tests after weighing the motives for testing, goals of testing, and patient condition.

**Cardiac Output
**

**Non-invasive**

- Doppler ultrasound 

- Uses an ultrasound machine with a special probe that measures the Doppler shift in the returning ultrasound waves to decipher the blood flow rate and volume, both of which lead to the cardiac index
- Benefits: relatively cheap, fast results, and non-invasive
- Drawbacks: highly operator dependent

- Echocardiogram 

- Uses two-dimensional ultrasound paired with Doppler shift measurements to elucidate blood flow rate and volume
- Benefits: non-invasive, accurate (if properly trained)
- Drawbacks: expensive, highly operator dependent

- Modified carbon dioxide Fick method

- Utilizes the Fick principle and measures changes in CO2 elimination and end-tidal CO2 (which is a measure of atrial CO2)
- Benefits: non-invasive, comparable accuracy to invasive methods
- Drawbacks: can only be utilized in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and, like the other noninvasive techniques, does not provide a measurement of preload indexes

- Other non-invasive methods: cardiac magnetic resonance

**Invasive**

- The oxygen Fick method

- This method uses the Fick equation (VO2)/(CaO2 - CvO2) to calculate the cardiac output numerically - the individual variables in the equation are measured through invasive testing, commonly pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC), and subsequently calculated
- Benefits: highly accurate
- Drawbacks: invasive (risking infection, arrhythmias, and pulmonary artery disruption), time-consuming

- Other invasive methods: lithium dilution

**Body Surface Area (BSA)**

While there are an array of methods for calculating the BSA, a commonly used method is the Mosteller formula where BSA = The square root of [bodyweight (kg) x height (cm) / (3600)]. The average BSA for an adult male is 1.9 and for the adult female 1.6. Today, a cellular phone application can be used to calculate the body surface area for a patient; however, caution must be taken to ensure the correct equation is selected for the situation and patient.
