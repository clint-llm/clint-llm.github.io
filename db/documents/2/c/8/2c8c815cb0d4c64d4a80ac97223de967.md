Levonorgestrel (LNGâ€”17alpha-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17beta-ol-3-one) is a second-generation synthetic progestogen that is the active component of the racemic mixture of norgestrel. It binds to progesterone and androgen receptors, where it can delay gonadotropin-releasing hormone from being released from the hypothalamus. This action blunts the luteinizing hormone surge that occurs during the pre-ovulation stage. Ultimately, it can delay or inhibit ovulation by preventing fertilization via inhibiting follicular rupture and releasing a viable egg from the ovaries. Optimal efficacy is achievable when it is taken in the pre-ovulation stage as well. Levonorgestrel also induces the thickening of cervical mucus, which helps by interfering with sperm motility and passage. There has been no evidence in recent studies that levonorgestrel significantly affects the endometrium to alter it to prevent pregnancy.

Studies have shown that levonorgestrel is not subject to significant first-pass metabolism. Levonorgestrel undergoes metabolism via hydroxylation, conjugation, and reduction in the liver. Its bioavailability varies from 85 to 100%.
