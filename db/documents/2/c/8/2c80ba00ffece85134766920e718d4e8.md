Internationally, cannabis is the most commonly abused illicit substance with a high incidence of usage in adolescents. Over 140 million people use cannabis worldwide. Trends in the United States to decriminalize marijuana have led to increased exposures reported to poison centers and presenting to emergency departments. Exposure characteristics are generally related to excessive use in adults and inadvertent ingestions in small children. This has been well documented throughout the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, and now other states. Synthetic cannabinoids are the most abused synthetic drug and second most abused drug among adolescents.
