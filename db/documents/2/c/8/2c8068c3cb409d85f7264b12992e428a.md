Transabdominal ultrasound is an inexpensive, safe, rapid way of assessing for multiple pathologies. It can be used toÂ effectively rule in or out specific pathologies such as cholecystitis without the need for further imaging in many cases. This can lead to expedited diagnosis, treatment, and a reduction in ionizing radiation.
