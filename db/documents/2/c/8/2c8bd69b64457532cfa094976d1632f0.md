- Acromegaly and gigantism are due to the oversecretion of growth hormone. The most common cause is a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. Rarely, ectopic GH secretion or excess secretion of GHRH may be the cause.

- Gigantism is characterized by tall stature and should be suspected in children three standard deviations above the mean. Acromegaly is characterized by large hands and feet, coarse facial features, a broad nose, acne, hyperhidrosis, underbite, and teeth separation.

- Laboratory assessment includes measurement of IGF-1 level; normal value rules out acromegaly.

- If IGF-1 is high, GH levels are assessed before and after OGTT to confirm the diagnosis.

- Surgery is the preferred initial modality of treatment. Residual or persistent findings can be treated medically or with radiotherapy.

- Medical treatment involves using somatostatin analogs, GH receptor antagonists, or dopamine receptor agonists.

- Radiotherapy involves either the use of external irradiation or stereotactic single high-dose irradiation, depending on the location and extent of residual disease.

- Mortality is increased in untreated acromegaly, with cardiovascular disease being the major contributor, but the quality of life of these patients has generally improved in recent years.

- Besides control of GH, the management of acromegaly involves the treatment of acromegalic complications, which include hypertension, cardiomyopathy, OSA, colonic polyps, hypopituitarism, and arthropathy.
