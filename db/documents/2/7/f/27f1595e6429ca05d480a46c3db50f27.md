Skin conditions affect up to seventy percent of the geriatric population. Among the commonest are those that are caused by or present as dry, itchy skin.

Asteatotic eczema is most prevalent during winter months. In the United States, the frequency increases in the northern part of the country. This increase in prevalence is believed to be caused by heating, which reduces indoor humidity and contributes to dry skin.

Typically, it is patients over 60 years old who develop asteatotic eczema. The median patient age at presentation is 69 years. However, asteatosis eczema can also occur in young people.
