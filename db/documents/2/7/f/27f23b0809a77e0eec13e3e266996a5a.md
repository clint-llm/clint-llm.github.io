Around 9 weeks gestation, the fetal epidermis gives rise to small buds of specialized cells that will form the hair follicle and its associated appendages. Mesenchymal cells that have accumulated within the dermis help drive this process by secreting substances such as epimorphin that signal the epithelial cells to proliferate and migrate in a downwards (craniocaudal) direction towards the dermis. Once this process is complete, the fetus is left with a hair follicle containing a matrix derived from ectoderm and an underlying dermal papilla-derived from mesoderm. Additionally, an arrector pili muscle and a sebaceous gland form around each follicle. In utero, maternal androgens will stimulate the activation of fetal sebaceous glands, so that the glands can secrete a lipid-rich sebum that combines with desquamated stratum corneum cells to form the vernix caseosa.

Once the hair follicle has developed in the fetus, lanugo hairs grow in utero. These hairs are thin and short. They eventually shed by about 36 to 40 weeks gestation and are replaced by vellus hairs that cover most areas of the body. Meanwhile, thicker, courser terminal hairs can be found on the head in certain areas such as the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Beard hairs will arise once puberty is reached, with androgen hormones transforming the vellus hairs in this area into terminal hairs.

After birth, no new hair follicles will be made. However, new hair can grow from the existing follicles. Also, follicle size can still be altered after birth.
