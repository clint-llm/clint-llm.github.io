The management of alcohol and drug abuse requires an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, emergency department physician, internist, addiction counselor, pharmacist, and pain specialist. Clinicians need to be proactive and identify these patients; the earlier the treatment is undertaken, the better the outcomes. In addition, healthcare workers need to curtail the liberal prescription of analgesics, hypnotics, and sedatives and offer patients alternative means of managing their pain and insomnia. Pharmacists may be well-positioned to notice patterns of drug-seeking behavior and report this to the prescribing clinicians. Interprofessional team coordination and information sharing can bring about more positive outcomes for these patients. [Level 5]

Unfortunately, the outcomes for patients addicted to alcohol and drugs are poor. Short-term recovery does occur, but relapses are common. Drug and alcohol addiction has repercussions beyond health; it can destroy the family, result in job loss and lead to financial loss.
