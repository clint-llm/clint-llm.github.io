Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a ubiquitous, microaerophilic, gram-negative, bacillus.H. pylori in the year 1983.H. pylori is variable between 19 and 88% and depends on various factors such as geographical location, patient's age, sanitation, and socioeconomic status.H. pylori infections during childhood, and if untreated, persist throughout life.

H. pylori have strong associations with many non-neoplastic (peptic ulcer disease, chronic atrophic gastritis) and neoplastic (adenocarcinoma of the stomach, gastric lymphoma arising from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue or MALT) conditions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.H. pylori as a class I (definite) carcinogen in 1994.H. pylori and successful eradication cures chronic gastritis and can reduce the progression to the long-term complications.H. pylori gastritis is also implicated in non-ulcer dyspepsia.H. pylori, but the exact pathogenic mechanisms are unclear.

Tests for H pylori include both invasive and non-invasive methods.H. pylori is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with histopathological examination of the biopsy.H. pylori..H. pylori stool antigen test (SAT), and serological tests.

Reliable non-invasive methods include UBT and SAT.H. pylori IgG serology is not recommended in places with lower prevalence rates of less than 30%.H. pylori, the pretest probability of diagnosing a true infection is lower.H. pylori persist for an indefinite period and does not differentiate past from present infections.H. pylori is useful for epidemiological studies and for screening larger populations in places with a higher prevalence rate.

UBT is useful for both the initial diagnosis of H. pylori (test-and-treat strategy) and also in the evaluation of post-treatment status.H. pylori utilize urease to breakdown urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide (CO2).H. pylori in the neutralization of gastric acidity and helps in its colonization.H. pylori are usually not present in the stomach with few exceptions such as in patients with achlorhydria.H. pylori to promptly hydrolyze urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide (CO2).H. pylori. Testing commonly uses two isotopes of carbon for UBT - 14C (a radioactive isotope) and 13C (naturally occurring, stable non-radioactive isotope). The performance of both UBTs is almost similar, with sensitivities above 95% and specificities above 93%.
