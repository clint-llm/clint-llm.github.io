Uncomplicated local reactions can be treated with supportive care (ice packs, NSAIDs/APAP for pain, H1/H2 blocker). Within the first few minutes after the sting, the stinger should be removed via scraping with a credit card rather than squeezing/tweezing to avoid further venom exposure.

Large local reactions should also be treated with supportive care along with glucocorticoids (usually a burst course of prednisone 40 to 60 mg per day for 3 to 5 days) to decrease the inflammatory response and improve symptoms.

Systemic reactions (anaphylaxis) are life-threatening and should be managed as such. ABCs first. The airway can be lost within seconds to minutes, so intubate early. As with any anaphylactic reaction, epinephrine, corticosteroids, H1 and H2 antagonists, and intravenous (IV) fluids should be given immediately. Epinephrine 0.3 to 0.5 mg should be given intramuscularly (IM) to the anterolateral thigh. This may be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes. The alpha1-mediated increase in vascular tone, beta1-mediated increase in inotropic/chronotropic cardiac activity, and B2-mediated bronchodilation all help reverse anaphylaxis. Corticosteroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone) act to decrease inflammation and immune response to the antigen. H1 and H2 antagonists block the effects of histamine decreasing pruritis, erythema, and urticaria.
