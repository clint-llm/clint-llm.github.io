Pneumocephalus, also known as pneumatocele or intracranial aerocele, is the presence of air in the intracranial space. Lecat first described this condition in 1741, but the term "pneumocephalus" was coined independently by Luckett in 1913 and Wolff in 1914. Pneumocephalus can occur following trauma, cranial surgeries, or spontaneously. It is classified as simple or tension pneumocephalus and can also be classified as acute, or less than 72 hours, delayed, or greater than 72 hours old. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pneumocephalus and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of pneumocephalus.
- Describe the evaluation of pneumocephalus.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pneumocephalus.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of pneumocephalus and improve outcomes.
