The face, in many ways, defines an individual's identity, and an attractive face promotes self-esteem, trustworthiness, approachability, and even personal success. Autologous fat grafting represents a powerful entry into the reconstructive surgeon's armamentarium for facial rejuvenation. In addition to its volumizing effects and skin quality benefits, autologous facial fat remains the filler choice for facial rejuvenation due to its longevity, cost-effectiveness, biocompatibility, minimal risk profile, and satisfaction rates compared to other materials.
