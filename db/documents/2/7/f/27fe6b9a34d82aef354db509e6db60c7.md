While any deviation from normal, reduced or increased, is clinically relevant, the most clinically significant is an increased anion gap, particularly when associated with metabolic acidosis. In terms of DKA, this is the development of acetoacetate and B-hydroxybutyrate. In terms of Lactic Acidosis, it is the increased formation of and decreased metabolism of lactate.

Overall, the clinical significance has as its basis in detecting and aiding the body in handling, metabolizing or removing the inciting factor causing derangements in ion concentrations.

Every 1 g/L decrease in albumin will decrease the anion gap by 0.25 mmol/L. A patient with hypoalbuminemia may present with a normal anion gap when in actuality, they have a high anion gap acidosis. Consider in ICU patients. Another ratio worth adding to your anion gap toolkit is every decrease in 10 g/L albumin = 2.3 mmol/L decrease in the anion gap.

Interestingly, paraproteins such as IgG also cause a reduction in anion gap due to their positive charge. Thus, patients with monoclonal proliferation such as those suffering from IgG myeloma have significant increases in cation or positive ion concentration resulting in decreased and rarely increased anion gaps. Likewise, a polyclonal proliferation of IgG would have the same effect, which can present in a patient with HIV.

Finally, patients prescribed lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder can have reduced anion gap. At therapeutic doses of 1.0 mmol/L, no change in the anion gap materializes. However, in lithium intoxication, a noticeable reduction is appreciated.

Other causes of reduced ion gap include hypoalbuminemia, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased unmeasured anions such as phosphorus, and increased unmeasured cations such as magnesium.
