There are two types of absorbable dietary iron: heme and non-heme iron.

- Heme iron, derived from hemoglobin and myoglobin of animal food sources (meat, seafood, poultry), is the most easily absorbable form (15% to 35%) and contributes 10% or more of our total absorbed iron.

- Non-heme iron is derived from plants and iron-fortified foods and is less well absorbed.

Despite its relative abundance in the environment and the relatively low daily iron requirements (10 mg ingested/1 mg absorbed) of humans, iron is often a growth-limiting nutrient in the human diet. Low intake of iron accounts for most anemia in developed countries and is responsible for nearly half of the anemias in non-industrialized nations. One reason for the lack of adequate iron absorption is that upon exposure to oxygen, iron forms highly insoluble oxides, which are unavailable for absorption in the human gastrointestinal tract. Human enterocytes contain apical membrane-bound enzymes whose activity can be regulated and which function to reduce insoluble ferric (Fe3+) to absorbable ferrous (Fe2+) ions.

Although iron deficiency is a relatively common problem, it is not the only extreme of the iron-balance spectrum that must be avoided. Iron overload can be particularly damaging to the heart, liver, and endocrine organs. Excess ferrous iron forms free hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction that cause damage to tissues through oxidative reactions with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Thus, dietary iron absorption and factors affecting bioavailability in the body are tightly regulated where possible.
