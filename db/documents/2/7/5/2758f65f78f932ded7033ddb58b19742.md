Choledocholithiasis occurs as a result of either the formation of stones in the common bile duct or the passage of gallstones that are formed in the gallbladder into the CBD. Bile stasis, bactibilia, chemical imbalances, increased bilirubin excretion, pH imbalances, and the formation of sludge are some of the factors which lead to the formation of these stones. Less commonly, stones are formed in the intrahepatic biliary tree, termed primary hepatolithiasis, and may lead to choledocholithiasis. Stones that are too large to pass through the ampulla of Vater remain in the distal common bile duct, causing obstructive jaundice that may lead to pancreatitis, hepatitis, or cholangitis. Gallstones are differentiated by their composition. Cholesterol stones are composed mainly of cholesterol, while black pigment stones are mainly made of pigment, and brown pigment stones are composed of a mix of pigment and bile lipids. Cholesterol stones make up approximately 75% of the secondary common bile duct stones in the United States, while black pigment stones comprise the remainder. Primary common bile duct stones are usually brown pigment stones. Obstruction of the CBD by gallstones leads to symptoms and complications that include pain, jaundice, and sepsis.
