Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma may appear de novo or arise within an area of chronic lymphedema or a preexisting vascular malformation such as a hemangioma or a lymphangioma circumscriptum, etc.

A lymphatic origin for this entity has been proposed due to common morphologic and immunophenotypic findings between adjacent lymphatics and lymphangioma in EPA, as well as the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and lymphatic immunohistochemical marker, D2-40.
