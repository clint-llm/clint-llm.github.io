Herpes zoster oticus (HZO) is a rare form of shingles characterized by latent herpes-zoster virus (HZV) reactivation inside the geniculate ganglion. It follows that the distribution of the herpetiform rash seen in this condition relates closely to the distribution of the geniculate ganglion fibers. For instance, vesicles are expected in places such as the central portion of the auricle and ear canal, as well as the anterior two-thirds of the tongue ipsilaterally to the affected ear. More rarely, the herpetiform rash also affects the palate.

Dr. Ramsay-Hunt first described Ramsay-Hunt syndrome (RHS) in 1907 as an inflammation of the geniculate ganglion caused by herpes zoster. Its clinical presentation, although related to HZO, also includes signs and symptoms involving the functions of other cranial nerves. For example, patients may complain of sensitivity disturbances in the area of the trigeminal nerve, impaired hearing, and impairment of the vestibular function. In addition to that, the rash can occur through the sensory distribution of other nerves besides the facial nerve, including the dermatomes C2 to C4. Moreover, although the distinction between HZO and RHS is possible, many authors apply the terms interchangeably.

Another important point is that because sometimes vesicles can be revealed only by otoscopy or even may not be present at all; many times, it can be difficult to make a clear distinction between HZO, RHS, and Bell palsy only using physical examination.

Bell palsy is an acute, unilateral facial nerve palsy of idiopathic origin. It is the most common form of atraumatic facial nerve palsy. Its pathogenesis is assumed to be edema of the facial nerve encompassing the intratemporal region. The edema creates a compartment syndrome as a result of a lack of space for nerve expansion inside the osseous canal and is followed by ischemia and loss of nerve function. The labyrinthine portion, where the geniculate ganglion is situated, is considered the narrowest segment of the canal.

Another relevant clinical entity is physical trauma to the facial nerve. This type of lesion can happen in cases of trauma to the base of the skull, especially temporal bone fractures. Approximately 7% of temporal bone fractures result in facial nerve injury.
