Richter hernias typically occur in elderly patients between 60 to 80 years old; however, they can theoretically manifest at any age, and pediatric case reports exist. There is a slightly increased incidence in the female population. This predilection may reflect that femoral hernias occur more commonly in females than males, and the femoral ring is the most common site for a Richter hernia. Estimates are that approximately 10% of all hernias are Richter type hernias though this may be under-appreciated.

The most common location for this pathology to occur is in the femoral canal (36 to 88%), followed by the inguinal canal (12 to 36%) and abdominal wall incisional hernias (4 to 25%).
