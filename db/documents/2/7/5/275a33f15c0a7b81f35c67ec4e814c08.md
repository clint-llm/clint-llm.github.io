Obesity is a chronic condition affected by complex factors and is now considered a global epidemic. Worldwide obesity prevalence has nearly tripled in 30 years (1975-2016).

The set-point theory is related to homeostasis. The theory posits that the human body has a predetermined weight or fat mass set-point range. Various compensatory physiological mechanisms maintain that set point and resist deviation from it. Feedback systems are vital in driving the body weight back toward the set point. In 1953, Kennedy proposed that body fat storage is regulated.

Notably, the rate at which one regains weight following weight loss is considerably high, with over 80% of individuals eventually regaining the weight they lost.

The set-point theory remains a theory since all the molecular mechanisms involved in set-point regulation are unclear, and some researchers may consider this theory to be oversimplistic. The theory also suggests that a person's weight set point is established early in life and remains relatively stable unless altered by specific conditions. However, factors such as childbirth, menopause, aging, obesogenic environment, and diseases can change the set points throughout one's life. Most individuals do not have one, but several, set points throughout their lives.
