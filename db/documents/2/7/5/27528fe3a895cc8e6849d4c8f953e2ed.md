Mechanoreceptors are an important receptor class for the somatosensory system. These receptors have a well-known role in tactile feedback from the skin and skeletal system, which is essential for human development and sensation. The variety of tactile mechanoreceptors within the skin allow for differential detection of touch and vibrational stimuli that permit detection of benign or harmful pressure. Disease pathologies connected to mechanoreceptors often link to dysregulation of the neuromuscular signaling, which can lead to issues related to functional instability of anterior cruciate ligament, dyspnea, or pain. There is still a need for research regarding the molecular interactions that lead to mechanotransduction.
