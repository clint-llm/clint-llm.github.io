In the clinical assessment of mandibular third molars, it is necessary to obtain a thorough pain, medical and social history. Medical problems that may affect treatment should be identified, including bleeding disorders, history of radiotherapy, bisphosphonate use, and immunocompromise. This is to establish a patient's post-operative healing capacity and avoid unnecessary complex surgical interventions in patients at risk of delayed healing, like those with a history of radiotherapy to the jaw who are at risk of osteoradionecrosis. Thorough assessment at this stage will also identify patients in which pre-operative measures need to be taken, like those with hemophilia.

A thorough examination of the lower third molar focuses on the position, accessibility, and degree of impaction to determine procedural complexity. The factors to be assessed are summarised in Table 1. These factors are assessed both clinically and radiographically.

Table 1 - Determining factors of procedural complexity of lower third molar extractions

**Factor**

**Definition**

**Classification of difficulty**

****



Low

Moderate

High

**Occlusal level**

The height of the occlusal plane of the lower third molar relative to the occlusal level of the lower second molar.

Occlusal level of third molar higher or equal to occlusal level of second molar.



Occlusal level of third molar lower than occlusal level of second molar but higher than cemento-enamel junction (CEJ).

Occlusal level of third molar lower than CEJ of second molar.

**Degree of impaction**

The angle of impaction of the third molar compared to the long axis of the second molar.

Vertical impaction.

Mesio-angular and horizontal impaction.

Disto-angular impaction.

**Depth to the application point**

The difference in depth between the point of application of the impacted lower third molar compared to the height of the distal aspect of the cemento-enamel junction of the erupted second molar.

0-3 mm

4-6 mm

More than 6 mm

**Bone level**



Horizontal bone loss more than 50%.

Horizontal bone loss less than 50%.

No bone loss or tooth encompassed in bone.

**Periodontal ligament (PDL) space visibility**



PDL space is visible around the entirety of the root(s).

PDL space is visible around some parts of the root(s).

PDL space is not visible.

**Root number**



Single root.

Two roots.

Three or more roots.

**Root curvature**



-  Incompletely formed roots.

-  Straight roots.

-  Curved roots, where root curvature is in direction of the path of delivery.

-  Roots curved in the same direction.

-  Curved roots where the curvature is against the path of delivery.

-  Roots curved in opposing directions.

**Root bulbosity**

Mesio-distal width of roots.

Low bulbosity – fine roots.



High bulbosity – wide roots.

**Relationship to Inferior Dental Canal (IDC)**



No contact with IDC, and closest root is more than 2 mm away from IDC.

No contact with IDC, and closest root is less than 2 mm away from IDC.

Contact between impacted third molar and IDC.

**Winter's Lines (WAR)**

A formal index of quantification of surgical complexity of extraction of lower third molars was suggested by Winter in 1926.

This method illustrates the extent of bone removal required to remove the tooth. Howe argues that with each 1 mm increase in the subcrestal length of the red line, surgical complexity increases three-fold.
