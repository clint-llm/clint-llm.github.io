The cause of aphthous stomatitis is idiopathic and multifactorial, but likely involves activation of the cell-mediated immune system.  Aphthous ulcers are not caused by acute infections and are therefore not contagious. Aphthous stomatitis may be triggered by local trauma, emotional or physiologic stress, allergy or sensitivity (such as to sodium lauryl sulfate present in toothpaste and oral hygiene products, foods such as cinnamon, cheese, citrus, figs or pineapple), toxin exposure (nitrates in drinking water), menstruation, or alterations in the oral microbiome. Malabsorption, enteropathy, or celiac disease may be present. As many as 20% of cases are related to hematinic deficiencies (iron, folate, vitamin B6 and B12), although other deficiencies such as vitamin D, zinc, or thiamine may also be present.  Aphthous ulcers are more prevalent in nonsmokers and smokers who quit and less common in individuals with good oral hygiene practices.
