Patients exposed to organophosphate nerve agents will exhibit signs of cholinergic crisis. The rapidity of onset and severity of symptoms is dependent on both the dose and method of exposure. Due to the dose-dependent nature of the effects and the varying rates of onset from the various absorption pathways, a good history covering potential exposures over the previous 24 to 48 hours is essential. These agents are absorbed through various mechanisms, and their immediate effects will be specific to the muscarinic and nicotinic structures at the site of absorption. When these agents contact the skin, absorption begins, and local reactions such as muscle twitching and sweating may occur. Ocular symptoms consist of miosis, related to ciliary muscle dysfunction, and lacrimation. Respiratory symptoms are comprised of wheezing and chest tightness secondary to bronchoconstriction and increased nasal and pulmonary secretions causing cough.
