To understand the pathophysiology and estimate the future prognosis of peripheral nerve injury, an appreciation of nerve injury classification is necessary. In 1943 Seddon and 1953, Sunderland proposed the following classification: (1) neurapraxia, (2) axonotmesis, and (3) neurotmesis.

In neurapraxia, myelin is damaged, but the axons remain intact. The endoneurium, perineurium, and the epineurium are intact. The conduction of nerve impulses is altered at the site of injury. This is clinically translated as sensory loss and weakness. In EMG, this reflects a prolonged latency and slow nerve conduction velocity across the compressed segment. This type of injury recovers the best.

In axonotmesis, the axon is damaged, but the epineurium and perineurium remain intact. When stimulated, these nerves show sensory and motor deficits below the location of nerve injury. Recovery is possible over a long period but may not always be complete.

Neurotmesis is the most severe type of nerve injury. Myelin, axons, and supportive connective tissue are damaged. Wallerian degeneration occurs distal to the site of injury. This is clinically reflected as sensory and motor deficits. Spontaneous recovery is not possible. Surgical intervention, which may include nerve grafting or tendon transfer, is sometimes necessary.
