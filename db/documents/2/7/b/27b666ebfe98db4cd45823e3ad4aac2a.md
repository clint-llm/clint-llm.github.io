Renal effects of dextran toxicity are due to the increased serum viscosity, especially in patients with oliguria. A low specific gravity of urine during therapy can suggest a failure of the kidneys to clear dextran, so patients require assessment for hydration during administration and signs of dehydration before the onset of acute renal failure.

Hepatic effects of dextran toxicity can include abnormal liver function test results with increased AST and ALT values, especially in patients undergoing surgery or cardiac catheterization procedures; this is because dextran accumulates in hepatocytes where it is metabolized, and excess levels of dextran can lead to hepatic oxidative stress.
