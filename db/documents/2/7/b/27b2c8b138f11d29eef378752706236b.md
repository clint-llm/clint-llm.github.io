Given the coursing nature of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, there are many injuries that can cause pathology, and damage to the nerve anywhere along its path that can cause impaired vocal function. One of the more commonly cited injuries is secondary to surgical intervention. One study reviewing over 800 patients showed that surgical intervention was the most important cause.

Another common cause of RLN injury is secondary to tumors. In fact, one study found that non-laryngeal malignancy accounted for 24.7% of all unilateral vocal cord paralysis, 80% of those being pulmonary or mediastinal.

Endotracheal intubation is also responsible for a significant number of RLN injuries. When RLN injury after intubation is suspected, it is necessary to also consider arytenoid dislocation as a possible cause.

In an article reviewing multiple studies on unilateral RLN injury, surgery is cited as the most common cause with most studies putting it as the cause of 30 to 40% of all RLN injuries. Tumors are the second leading cause accounting for approximately 17% to 32% of injuries. Idiopathic causes are cited around 10% to 27% of all RLN injuries with endotracheal intubations last at around 7% to 11% of all causes.

In another article reviewing 2,267 cases of unilateral vocal cord palsy, the top three causes were surgery, cancer, and idiopathic accounting for 36.9%, 29.7%, and 20.9% of cases, respectively.
