The classic histological finding is multifocal myelopathic spongy vacuolation. This occurs due to intra-myelin edema and interstitial edema of the white matter of the dorsal and lateral columns.

Demyelinating lesions initially appear in the center of the dorsal columns of the upper thoracic cord. The lesions then spread laterally to involve lateral corticospinal tracts and cranially involving the cervical cord and medulla. As demyelination and vacuolation progress, axons begin to undergo degeneration. In the late stages of the disease, dense gliosis occurs. Electron microscopic changes include the separation of myelin lamellae and the formation of intra-myelin vacuoles in the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord.
