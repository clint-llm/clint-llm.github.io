Nutritional status, directly impacting the ability of the postoperative site to heal, should be ascertained, including measurement of prealbumin, albumin, glycosylated hemoglobin, and total lymphocyte count. The presence and proximal extent of any neuropathy can be determined via physical exam and monofilament testing, impacting the appropriate operative level. A physical exam is also important to determine soft tissue viability; in severe trauma cases, the wound may need to demarcate for several days until it is clear at what level the limb is salvageable.

In infectious cases, osteomyelitis is most effectivelyÂ evaluated with MRI. This will also show the extent of osteomyelitis and associated soft tissue fluid collections if present. Ultrasound may likewise evaluate localized collections. Inflammatory labs, including ESR and CRP, are important in determining the presence, degree, and acuteness of infection. It may see a mild-to-moderate elevation in cases of chronic non-healing ulcers, while grossly elevated markers show an acute or abruptly worsening process.

Imaging is equally essential. Radiographic films must include an anterior-posterior and lateral view of the extremity, including the foot, ankle, tibia/fibula, and knee, to assess for concomitant fracture, subcutaneous air, intact proximal bone, etc. Similarly, an MRI may determine the adequacy of soft tissues. For instance, if a sizeable degloving injury is present proximally but poorly visualized on physical exam or other imaging, this may affect the decision for a BKA.
