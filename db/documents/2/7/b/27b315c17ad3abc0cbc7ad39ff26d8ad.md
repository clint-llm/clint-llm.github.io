**As an Antidote**

- Methanol poisoning: Methanol per se is not as toxic as its metabolized counterpart, i.e., 'formic acid.' Methanol is acted upon by alcohol dehydrogenase to convert it into 'formaldehyde.' Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH), in turn, acts on formaldehyde to convert it into formic acid, and this metabolite brings about the deleterious effects of methanol poisoning such as vision loss and Parkinsonian movements. Ethanol metabolism is also by ADH; its affinity for ADH is significantly higher than methanol; hence ethanol administration results in competitive inhibition of methanol, slowing down formic acid formation.

- Ethylene glycol poisoning: Ethylene glycol, very much like methanol, gets metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the liver to form glycoaldehyde. Glycoaldehyde subsequently converts to glycolic acid and oxalic acid. Administration of ethanol results in competitive inhibition of ethylene glycol from binding to ADH as the former will saturate the enzyme.

**As a Hand Sanitizer and Preventing Sepsis**

- Many credible surveys report the global burden of healthcare-associatedÂ infections (HCAI). Alcohols have an inherent antimicrobial property, which works by denaturing and coagulating proteins, disrupting their cell wall, and killing them. Ethanol is highly efficient against viruses and can be used in adjunct with other alcohols to obtain a powerful synergistic effect against microorganisms.

- Ethanol lock therapy (ELT) follows the ideals mentioned earlier of killing bacterias and disrupting their biofilms. This concept is mainly useful for patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. An ethanol lock created in the lumen of the IV catheter both kills and inhibits the growth of bacterias, thus significantly reducing catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).

**As an Ablative/Sclerosing/Embolic Agent**

- Ethanol works by damaging the endothelial lining and dehydrating the cells, resulting in fibrotic changes. Consequently, tumor/hyperplastic growth suffers an ischemia and size reduction.
