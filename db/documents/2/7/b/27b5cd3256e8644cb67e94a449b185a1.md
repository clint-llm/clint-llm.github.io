The diagnosis and management of hair loss are with an interprofessional team that includes a dermatologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and internist. One type of hair loss is telogen effluvium, which is a form of nonscarring alopeciaÂ characterized by diffuse, often acute hair shedding. In most cases, no cause is ever found. In any case, patients need to be educated that the condition is self-limiting. There is no need to prescribe hair growth medications or refer the patient for a hair transplant. The hair growth will return but it may take a few months or even a year. For most patients, the outcome is good.
