Infectious mononucleosis (IM), caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), is an extremely common disease process in the United States and around the world.  Nearly 90 to 95 percent of the world’s adult population has evidence of EBV infection through seroconversion.

Several laboratory tests have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of IM.  Currently, serum testing for EBV-specific antibodies is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, but rapid results are usually not obtainable.  Because of this time delay, several other testing modules have been created with the most widely used test being the mononuclear spot test or, monospot test.

The basis of the monospot test is blood agglutination, much like the Paul-Bunnell test which was developed prior to the monospot test.

Though the monospot test is considered to be a very specific test, the sensitivity falls in the range of 70 to 90% and is particularly weak among children under the age of four years old.
