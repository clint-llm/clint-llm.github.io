There are many muscles in the neck. One of the classifications of the muscles of the neck is relative to the hyoid bone. Those muscles which are above the hyoid bone are termed as supra-hyoid muscles, and those below it are called infra-hyoid muscles.Â This group of muscles participates in the processes of chewing, swallowing, and phonetics. Moreover, together with the infrahyoid muscles, they contribute to the fixation of the hyoid bone, which does not articulate with any other bone. The suprahyoid muscles participate in improving the flexion movement of the neck.

The supra-hyoid muscles are between the two bony landmarks, the base of the mandible above and the hyoid bone below. They are in pairs of four present on each side of the midline of the neck, named as follows

- Digastric

- Stylohyoid

- Mylohyoid

- Geniohyoid
