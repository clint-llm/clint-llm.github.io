The blood supply to the mylohyoid nerve is predominately from the branches of the external carotid artery. The mylohyoid nerve receives perfusion from different arteries as it descends toward the mylohyoid muscle. The inferior alveolar arteries will perfuse the mylohyoid nerve around the mandible region. Once the mylohyoid nerve reaches the mylohyoid muscle, it will receive that same perfusion as the mylohyoid muscle. The arteries that perfuse the mylohyoid muscle are the mylohyoid branch of the inferior alveolar artery and the submentalÂ branches of the facial artery.

The lymphatic drainage of the territory innervated by the mylohyoid nerve gets directed towards the submental lymph nodes and the submandibular lymph nodes. The lymph fluid will eventually drain toward the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The right lymphatic duct will drain the right side of the face and neck. The left side of the face and neck will drain toward the thoracic duct. The right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct will drain back into the central circulation.
