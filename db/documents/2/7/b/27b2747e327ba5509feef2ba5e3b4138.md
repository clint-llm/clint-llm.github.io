Elderly patients commonly have injuries or other medical conditions requiring surgery. Due to physiologic and pathologic changes that occur with age, these patients are at higher risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of geriatric patients and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing these patients while undergoing anesthesia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe physiologic changes in elderly patients and their relevance to perioperative care.
- Identify risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality in elderly patients and explain the importance of a geriatric-focused preoperative assessment.
- Review anesthetic techniques and intraoperative management of elderly patients.
- Summarize common perioperative geriatric complications and their management by an interprofessional team.
