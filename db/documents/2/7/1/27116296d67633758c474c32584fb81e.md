**Antibiotics**

Many antibiotics antivirals interfere with DNA replication in prokaryotes to prevent the replication of bacterias and viruses and the progression of disease in patients. One example includes fluoroquinolones, which bind to DNA topoisomerases and inhibit their function and preventing replication. Trimethoprim and sulfonamides prevent the formation of DNA precursors such as purines and pyrimidine, preventing DNA formation. Acyclovir acts as a guanosine analog which is monophosphorylated by HSV thymidine kinase; this phosphorylation creates a triphosphate which inhibits viral DNA polymerase by chain termination.

**Antitumor Medications**

Antitumor medications also may interfere with DNA replication. Cytarabine used to treat leukemia is a pyrimidine analog that inhibits DNA polymerase. 5-Fluorouracil, used in treating colon cancer, decreases the production of thymidine which is a nucleotide needed for DNA production. Etoposide is an antitumor medication that inhibits topoisomerase II; it is used to treat solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas. Irinotecan inhibits topoisomerase I.
