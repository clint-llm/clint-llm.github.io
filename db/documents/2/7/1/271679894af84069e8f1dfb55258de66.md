Good prognostic indicators include acute onset of symptoms, absence of underlying organic pathology, ability to eliminate the trigger (particularly if it is a life stressor), male gender, young age, and good general health status. Poor prognostic indicators include personality disorders, poor perception of the patient's own wellbeing, associated motor symptoms, and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.

To optimize outcomes, it is essential to arrive at the correct diagnosis through thorough evaluation and careful consideration. Unless the treatment is tailored to the underlying pathology, the results will not be satisfactory for either the patient or the clinician; voice therapy, for example, will not significantly help a patient with a glottic mass that requires surgical excision. A multidisciplinary approach, typically involving an otorhinolaryngologist or fellowship-trained laryngologist and an SLP, is likely to be most effective at alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life.
