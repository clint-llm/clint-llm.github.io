Laryngopharyngeal reflux causes various symptoms that may result in a patient presenting for evaluation. Hoarseness is the most prevalent of these, occurring in nearly 100% of patients with LPR, in contrast to patients with GERD, of whom essentially none report hoarseness.

Patients may also experience many other symptoms, including globus sensation, chronic throat clearing, post-nasal drip, Eustachian tube dysfunction, heartburn, other voice changes, and regurgitation.

**Reflux Symptom Index**

The RSI is a validated, patient-reported outcome measure that reliably assesses the severity of LPR. The instrument is a nine-item questionnaire given to patients to score each of their symptoms on a scale of 0 to 5 (5 being the most severe). An RSI score of greater than ten is correlated with a high likelihood of reflux pathology, although the maximum score is 45. The nine domains are:

- Hoarseness

- Throat clearing

- Mucus or postnasal drip

- Dysphagia

- Coughing after eating or lying down

- Breathing difficulties or choking episodes

- Chronic cough

- Globus sensation

- Heartburn, indigestion, or regurgitation

On physical examination, laryngoscopy and/or videostroboscopy can be very helpful for raising suspicion for LPR in patients with hoarseness and other symptoms consistent with the diagnosis. Thickening and pachydermia of the posterior laryngeal commissure and post-cricoid mucosa have been associated with laryngopharyngeal reflux.
