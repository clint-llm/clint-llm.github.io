The most widely accepted use of peak flow measurement is in the daily and/or as-needed ambulatory evaluation of asthma.

Specific instructions on how often and when anÂ individual patient should be instructed to measure peak flow depends on patient characteristics and provider preference. For those patients who demonstrate a pattern of not having pronounced symptoms despite increasing disease activity, a clinician should outline daily (or more) measurement to identify deterioration rapidly and intervene appropriately. For those patients who are relatively well controlled and can sense worsening symptoms early in the course of an exacerbation, as-needed measurement is appropriate.
