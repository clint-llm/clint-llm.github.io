Electrical injuries are when high-energy current travels through the body due to contact with an electrical source. Injuries occur due to either the flow of current through the body, arc flash, or clothing that catches fire. With the former two, the body converts electricity to heat, which results in a thermal burn. It is important to consider that the outward appearance of an electrical burn does not accurately predict the true extent of the injury, as internal tissues or organs may be much more severely burned than the skin.

It is important to note that the term “electrocution” refers only to a person who is killed as a result of exposure to electricity. Thus, someone who is exposed to electricity but survives has not been “electrocuted.”
