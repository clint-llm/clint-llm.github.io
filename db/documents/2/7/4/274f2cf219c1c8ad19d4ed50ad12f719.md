The prognosis of CDD is very poor, and the outcome is worse as compared with other subtypes of ASD. Once skills are lost, they usually do not return to normal. Only about 20% of children diagnosed with CDD can speak in sentences again. As adults, most patients with CDD remain dependent on full-time caregivers or are institutionalized. Around ten years of age, most of the skills are lost. There can be some but very restricted improvement seen in a few of the cases. Over the longitudinal course of the disease, children develop lifelong impairments of behavioral and intellectual functioning. The intellectual function, independence, and adaptive/adjusting skills are extremely affected, with most cases deteriorating to serious mental disability. Kids with this disease are dependent on caregivers for their entire life.
