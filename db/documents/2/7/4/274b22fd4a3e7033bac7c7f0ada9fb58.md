Cardiac stress imaging can assess coronary perfusion, cardiac (including valvular) function, myocardium viability, and exercise capacity.

An ischemic evaluation typically is warranted when patients present with clinical concerns for angina or new heart failure suggesting coronary artery disease. Chest pain is categorized as typical angina, atypical angina, or non-cardiac chest pain, depending on the clinical characteristics. These characteristics include 1) substernal chest discomfort, 2) worsened with exertion or stress, and 3) relieved by rest or nitroglycerine. Typical angina pain meets all three characteristics, and atypical meets only two. If the pain has none or only one of the above characteristics, it is considered non-anginal/non-cardiac chest pain.

Based on the above clinical chest pain characteristics and patient factors such as age, gender, and comorbidities, each patient can be assigned a pre-test probability, ranging from low (<10%), intermediate (10Â to 90%), to high (>90%) pretest-probability of having coronary artery disease according to the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA). Stress testing is ideal for the intermediate-risk patient, as the test outcome has the highest potential to impact CAD post-test likelihood in this group. A positive test result in the high-pretest-risk patient group would not add much to CAD's likelihood, and these patients are often referred directly to an angiography without stress testing.
