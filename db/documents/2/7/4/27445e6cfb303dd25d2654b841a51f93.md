The incidence varies with age at diagnosis, race, and modality by which diagnosis was made. DDH has a spectrum that ranges from mild hip instability, which resolves spontaneously to dislocation, which needs surgery. In a prospective study by M Kokavec & Bialik V, the sonographic incidence is about 69.5 per 1000, but most of them self resolve in about 6 to 8 weeks, leaving 4.8 per 1000, which requires some form of treatment. No additional incidence was seen at age one.

The incidence varies from 0.06 in Africans to 76.1 per 1000 in Native Americans due to the combination of genetics and swaddling.

Unilateral involvement in  63% and 64% involves the left side due to in utero most frequent fetal positioning (left occipitoanterior). The left hip of the fetus is adducted against the mother's lumbosacral spine.
