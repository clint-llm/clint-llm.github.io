Currently available modalities used to assess BMD include metacarpal morphometry, quantitative bone ultrasound (QUS), quantitative computed tomography (QCT), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) bone density. A plain skeletal radiograph detects BMD when the bone loss exceeds 40% and hence insensitive for routine clinical use. QCT measures the bone volume and accurately assesses volumetric BMD, and it can differentiate between cortical and trabecular bone.

Peripheral (PQCT) is an alternative technique with less radiation risk and is more convenient for children. DXA is the primary tool for assessing bone density. It has low radiation exposure, precise results, and lower cost than QCT. However, it does not directly measure actual volume or assessing BMD, and rarely bone biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
