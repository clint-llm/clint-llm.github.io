Patients with floating knee injuries are typically polytrauma patients. Because of this, a healthcare providerÂ should always rule out other life-threatening injuries. Also, complications can arise from such traumas. One must monitor for DVT and fat embolus formation that can occur secondary to skeletal trauma. Patients may also have ligamentous injuries (ACL, PCL, meniscal, etc.). These are non-life-threatening injuries and are manageable after stabilization of the critically ill patient and reduction of associated fractures.
