S. saprophyticus is the second most common cause of community-acquired urinary tract infections, after Escherichia coli. In females ages 16 to 25, it causes up to 42% of all infections. Over 40% of all young, sexually active women contain S. saprophyticus as part of their normal genitourinary flora.

Patients with nosocomial UTIs, the elderly, pregnant patients, and those with urinary catheterization have an increased incidence ofÂ S. saprophyticus colonization. Men have a lower incidence of S. saprophyticus infections.

General risk factors for UTIs include the history of recurrent UTIs, female sex, recent sexual intercourse, pregnancy, neurogenic bladder, indwelling catheter, and benign prostatic hypertrophy.

S. saprophyticus is also a common culprit involved in polymicrobial UTIs. Polymicrobial infections are more likely to occur in patients that are immunocompromised, elderly, those who have diabetes, have indwelling catheters, HIV, and/or malignancies. Polymicrobial infections are less common in young, healthy, sexually active females.
