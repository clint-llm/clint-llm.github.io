Although colic is a benign and self-limiting condition, a thorough history and examination are important to rule out more serious issues. After obtaining information regarding the frequency, circumstances, duration, and intensity of crying,Â the health care provider should take care to obtain information regarding fever, growth and weight gain, feeding patterns, the presence of bilious emesis, constipation or diarrhea, bloody stools, lethargy, cough, wheezing, rash, loss of willingness to move one or more extremities, or breasts not emptying with feeding. The physical exam should then focus on identifying signs of failure to thrive or serious illness. Findings such as poor weight gain or growth, abdominal distension and tenderness, scrotal or inguinal swelling, suspicious bruises or burns, and signs of dehydration should prompt further evaluation. Subtle findings such as a hair wrapped around a digit or penis should not be overlooked.
