Due to the potential high impact of extensor tendon injury to the patient, if misdiagnosed and mismanaged, the patients' journey through the healthcare system must be robust and well joined. This may include:

- Immediate management by the emergency department staff

- Further management by the hand surgery team

- Anesthetic team support for injuries requiringÂ nerve blocks or general anesthetic

- Involved hand therapy team to fit splints and implement rehab protocols

- Outpatient department to monitor patients progress and highlight the need for further input

An interdisciplinary team approach is the key to achieving good outcomes. Initial evaluation by emergency department personnel is followed by appropriate repair by surgeons, and follow up care by physical or occupational therapists. Nurses in the emergency and orthopedic nurses provide wound care, provide patient and family education, monitor patients, and collaborate with physicians. [Level 5]
