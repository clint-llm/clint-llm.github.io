Tooth development is a highly regulated complex biological process, which is dependent on multiple factors for its ultimate success. If there are any interruptions during tooth development, clinical changes or alternations will be evident. One of the major results of developmental disturbances results in a change in size, where teeth appear larger, smaller, or can be completely different in clinical appearance from what is expected. These differences in size will be addressed and discussed further throughout this article. The resultant changes in the size of teeth from developmental disturbances are as follows: microdontia, macrodontia, taurodontism, and fusion.
