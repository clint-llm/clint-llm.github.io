Proper hygiene maintenance is one of the most important measures to prevent helminth infection. For the treatment of A. lumbricoides, several drugs may be used, including albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, levamisole, and ivermectin. If patients develop intestinal obstruction, it requires proper treatment with intravenous support, anthelmintics, and antibiotic treatment. Laparotomy might be necessary in case of small bowel obstruction, intussusception, and volvulus. Hepatobiliary ascariasis can be treated with drug therapy. If conservative therapy fails, then endoscopic and surgical therapy may be required.

**Pharmacology**

- For **trichuriasis**, available drugs that might be used are albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and ivermectin. If the symptom is severe or the patient develops anemia, iron therapy is provided, and supportive therapy is needed if a patient develops dysentery.

- For **A. duodenale** and **N. americanus**, recommended treatment options include albendazole or mebendazole. Iron supplementation is provided for additional nutritional support.

- For **S. stercoralis**treatment, benzimidazoles (thiabendazole, mebendazole, and albendazole) or ivermectin gives a very good response. In Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis, hydration, nutritional support, and antibiotics are needed as indicated; ivermectin should be continued for at least seven days or until sputum or stool samples are negative for the parasite for two weeks.

- For **schistosomiasis**, the drug of choice is praziquantel. Repeated treatment is needed in severe cases or if Katayama fever develops. Steroids may also be given during Katayama fever to decrease symptoms

- **Lymphatic filariasis**can be treated by several drugs, including ivermectin, suramin, mebendazole, flubendazole, and diethylcarbamazine. Other available options are surgical, thermal, and herbal treatment.

- Four different modalities are available for the management of **cystic echinococcosis,**which includes chemotherapy, percutaneous therapy, surgery, and observation without intervention. Benzimidazoles are the cornerstone of medical therapy.

- Treatment options for **neurocysticercosis**are symptomatic therapy such as anticonvulsants, analgesics, antihelminthic therapy, and surgery, which include worm removal surgery or shunt placement.

- Praziquantel is used for the treatment of **diphyllobothriasis**. Niclosamide is also another available drug.
