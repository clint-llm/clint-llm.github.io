Parents and caregivers of children and the elderly should be counseled on the common signs and symptoms indicative of child and elder abuse and neglect.

For the child, parents and caregivers should be counseled to observe for unexplained bruises or markings, oral injuries, change in behavior (i.e. withdrawal in a young child, excessive crying in an infant), genitourinary abnormalities, behavioral change, inappropriate behavior (especially of a sexual nature).

For the elderly, the caregiver or family member should observe for unexplained injuries (including bruises, burns, fractures), pressure sores, change in behavior, weight loss, lack of food, dehydration, urinary or fecal incontinence, genitourinary injury, and poor hygiene.

If a caregiver is having difficulty providing care, they should be advised to notify a provider or nurse. The provider or nurse can counsel the caregiver, especially if they are the primary caregiver of the child or elderly person, in how they can obtain support or help so that they are not overwhelmed.
