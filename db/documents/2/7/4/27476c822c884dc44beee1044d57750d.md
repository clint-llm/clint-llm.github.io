Potential complications related to sciatic nerve blocks include infection at the injection site, bleeding, nerve injury, and local anesthetic toxicity. Fortunately, all of these are rare, but simple precautions can minimize these occurrences if followed regularly. All nerve blocks should be performed under sterile technique to minimize the chance of infection at the injection site. Direct ultrasound visualization of the needle, nerve, and any nearby vascular structures minimizes the chance of nerve injury, local anesthetic toxicity, and accidental puncture of a blood vessel. Frequent negative aspiration during injection of local anesthetic, even when ultrasound visualization is utilized, is recommended.
