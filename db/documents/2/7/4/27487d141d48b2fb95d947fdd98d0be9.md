Patients should be educated about the relevance of testing for serum amylase to rule out certain diagnoses. In its most common use, healthcare providers should explain that serum amylase will be an important data point to guide the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. They should be educated that there is no clinical value to trending amylase levels as it does not determine the severity of acute pancreatitis. Patients can be educated that imaging studies may also be conducted in conjunction with lab work to rule out high suspicion of acute pancreatitis. Hyperamylasemia, without suspicion of any other underlying pathology,Â does not need further workup or intervention.
