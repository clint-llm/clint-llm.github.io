Patients with anxiety can pose a diagnostic challenge, as somatic symptoms are more common than psychological symptoms. Most patients present with vague or nonspecific somatic complaints, including, but not limited to, shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigability, headache, dizziness, and restlessness.  Patients may also describe psychologic symptoms such as excessive, nonspecific anxiety and worry, emotional lability, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia.

Factors commonly associated with generalized anxiety include:

- Female gender

- Unmarried

- Poor health

- Low education

- Presence of stressors

The median age of presentation is 30 years.

Many scales have been developed to assess the severity and diagnosis. The GAD-7 has been validated as a diagnostic tool and severity assessment scale.
