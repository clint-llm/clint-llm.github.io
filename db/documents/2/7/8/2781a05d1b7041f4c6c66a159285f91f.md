Clinical considerations in wound management include preventing and controlling infection and contamination, maintaining adequate moisture, treating edema, and preventing further injury.

Wounds should be cleansed prior to closure. Wounds can be cleaned with either irrigation or scrubbed and irrigated with a 0.9% saline solution. Alternately, wounds can be scrubbed with pluronic polyols and irrigated with normal saline. Tap water is frequently used by patients to irrigate wounds before seeking outÂ medical attention. The advantage is that copious amounts of irrigant can be rapidly used; however, irrigation pressure may be difficult to control. A study by Mosacati found that infection rates for wounds irrigated with tap water were comparable to those irrigated by a 0.9% saline solution.
