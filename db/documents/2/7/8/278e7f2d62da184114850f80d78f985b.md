The most common complications are associated with respiratory infections and malignancies. Following complications are associated with IgA deficiency:

- Obliterative bronchiolitis; In this entity, pulmonary damage is more pronounced than in bronchiectasis. There is obstruction of the smallest airways in the lung due to inflammation.

- Bronchiectasis;  Recurrent lower respiratory infections in IgA deficient patients can result in chronic lung damage, eventually resulting in bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is the irreversible dilation of bronchial airways caused by inflammatory damage. This is particularly true with repeated sinopulmonary infections with Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.Pseudomonas aeruginosa or non-tuberculous Mycobacterium. This compounds the damage and worsens respiratory function.

- Pneumonia; Some sources have considered daily prophylactic antibiotics for patients with recurrent sinopulmonary infections.

- The most severe complications are related to the association of selective IgA deficiency and the development of malignancies, such as adenocarcinoma of the stomach and lymphoma, which arise in particularly older patients.Helicobacter pylori were decreased. This microbe is related to the development of gastrointestinal malignancies. IgA deficiency increases the risk of gastrointestinal infections due to Giardia lamblia. Patients manifest chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (NLH). Patients with symptomatic giardiasis have decreased secretory IgA from the small intestine, but serum IgA levels were not a factor. The typical antibiotic treatment is metronidazole, but patients may have refractoriness in IgA deficiency. NLH is a benign finding in the small intestine commonly seen in immunodeficient states and associated with Giardia or Helicobacter infections. NLH is a risk factor for the development of gastrointestinal lymphoma; given this, IgA deficient patients should be screened with endoscopy.

- Transfusions; Anti-IgA antibodies, according to various sources, have been found in 20 to 40% of IgA deficient patients. The increased risk of transfusion reactions is due to IgG/IgE antibodies.

- COVID; IgA deficiency is felt to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection.
