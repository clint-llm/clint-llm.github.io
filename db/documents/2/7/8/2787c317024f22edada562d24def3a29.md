It is important for patients to seek medical consultation in cases of rectal bleeding, especially in middle and older-aged individuals, as the risk of malignancy is higher in these groups.

Patients should be educated to seek medical assistance immediately if they experience vomiting or coughing up blood associated with rectal bleeding. This may indicate a potentially life-threatening upper gastrointestinal bleed or the presence of a bleeding tendency such as thrombocytopenia or anticoagulant toxicity.
