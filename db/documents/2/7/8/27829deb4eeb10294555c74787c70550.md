The exact etiology of Landau-Kleffner syndrome is not known. Structural brain injuries are very rare in patients with LKS are not related to pathophysiology. Moreover, genetic factors may be involved. For instance, the disease can correlate with GRIN2A mutations (16p13.2). This gene encodes for a protein called GluN2A (also known as NR2A), which is a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate-gated ion channel receptor. Of note, NR2A can be identified in high concentrations in brain areas crucial for speech and language, whereas NMDA receptors are involved in a wide range of functions related to memory and learning. Again, GRIN2A alterations have correlations with a considerable number of neurodevelopmental disorders that can include epilepsy among the clinical manifestations.

There were suggestions regarding possible implications of autoimmune factors in the genesis of some forms of epilepsy.
