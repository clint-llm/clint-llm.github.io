Patients who abuse cocaine risk life-threatening consequences, including tachydysrhythmia, severe hypertension, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, acute myocardial and renal failure, seizure, hyperthermia, cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis, and fetal/maternal morbidity and mortality.

The adverse effects on the heart are due to the direct actions of cocaine by inhibiting the reuptake of catecholamines into the nerve endings. The increased catecholamine levels can induce life-threatening arrhythmias, and at the same time, the local anesthetic properties of cocaine further impair impulse conduction, leading to re-entry ventricular arrhythmias.

Long-term use of cocaine can also alter cardiac histology leading to fibrosis, myocarditis, and contraction band necrosis. Cocaine significantly increases myocardial oxygen requirements, heart rate, and cardiac output. In patients with even mild coronary disease, these hemodynamic changes, plus its vasoconstriction ability, can trigger an acute coronary syndrome.

Asides from the myocardium, cocaine can also increase the risk of ischemic stroke. Cocaine can also cause seizures by lowering the threshold for seizure initiation. Chronic use of cocaine can lower the density of dopamine receptors leading to extrapyramidal symptoms, dystonia, bradykinesia, akinesia, and akathisia.

A high risk of death is the ability of cocaine to induce delirium. These patients are often at risk for sudden death. Excited delirium is often associated with aggression, hyperactivity, extreme paranoia, hyperthermia, incoherent screaming, and unusual strength. Individuals who develop excited delirium tend to be more sensitive to the elevated levels of catecholamines.

Another feature of cocaine toxicity is hyperthermia, which may be as high as 45 C. Hyperthermia is a marker for poor prognosis and is often associated with muscle breakdown, renal and liver injury, encephalopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and metabolic acidosis.
