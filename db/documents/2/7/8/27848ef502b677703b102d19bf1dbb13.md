MRI rivals angiography for establishing the diagnosis but is not readily available to most. CT and CTA are often the first investigations obtained. CT scan can demonstrate posterior fossa ischemia or subarachnoid hemorrhage. It may also identify an occluded vertebral artery or mural thrombus. CTA, however, is superior to CT scan and should be performed. CTA more easily identifies irregularity of the vascular lumen or thickening of the arterial wall. CTA is the initial test of choice. Vascular Duplex scanning demonstrates abnormal flow in 95% of patients. However, it shows evidence specific to dissection in only 20% of patients.

MRI may detect an intimal flap and luminal thrombosis. Sometimes hyperintensity of the vessel wall may be visualized on T1 weighted images and are considered pathognomonic.

A cerebral angiogram may be required if the MRI and CT scan have failed to reveal any pathology

Routine blood work including coagulation profile should be obtained.

If CT reveals the absence of hemorrhage, then anticoagulation can be initiated.
