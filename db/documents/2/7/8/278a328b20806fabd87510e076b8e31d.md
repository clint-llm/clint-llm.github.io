Only 25 to 50 of the approximately 9000 total snake bites in the US are due to coral snakes.Â Micrurus fulvius and Micrurus tener account for all clinically significant coral snake bites reported in the US. Only one death due to coral snake envenomation has been reported in North America in the recent past.
