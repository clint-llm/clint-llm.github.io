Withdrawal from drugs and alcohol is a common medical problem. Presentation may vary based on the frequency, duration, and quantity that was typically used. The body aims to maintain homeostasis, and when a chemical that was once overused is removed, counter-regulatory mechanisms may produce unopposed effects, and withdrawal symptoms may ensue. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of patients presenting with withdrawal syndromes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the patients with these conditions.
