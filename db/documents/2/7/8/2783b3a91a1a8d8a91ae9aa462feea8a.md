HDL synthesis occurs in the liver and the intestines. The first step of HDL synthesis involves the production of its main structural apolipoproteins, Apo-AI. Apo-AI is the structural protein of HDL and receives cholesterol and phospholipids from enterocytes and hepatocytes via transporter ABCA1, forming pre-beta HDL. As HDL travels in circulation, it also receives free cholesterol and phospholipids from peripheral tissues, chylomicrons, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). As mentioned, APO-AI acts as a cofactor for LCAT. LCAT converts free cholesterol at the surface of HDL to cholesterol esters, which is then incorporated into the cholesterol ester core of HDL.

Cells in peripheral tissues are exposed to and accumulate cholesterol through the circulation and de novo synthesis. However, since most cells can not catabolize cholesterol, they require a reverse transport mechanism to return cholesterol to the liver. ABCG1 transfers cholesterol in peripheral cells to HDL, like ABCA1 in the liver, and allows the transfer of cholesterol to HDL in the circulation. Subsequently, LCAT incorporates this free cholesterol into the HDL particle and eventually leads to its uptake in the liver through three distinct pathways; the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) pathway, the LDL receptor pathway, and the SR-B1 pathway.

The CETP pathway involves the transfer of lipids between HDL and other lipoproteins. For instance, CETP exchanges the cholesterol esters in the core of HDL particles to Apo-B containing particles, VLDL, and LDL, in exchange for triglycerides. The cholesterol, now contained in VLDL and LDL, can undergo uptake by the LDL receptor, resulting in the return of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver. This exchange also enriches HDL in triglycerides and depletes the cholesterol ester core. As a result, hepatic lipases can metabolize the triglyceride-rich HDL, resulting in small HDL particles. These small HDL particles release their Apo-AI. The liver can then degrade Apo-A1 through an unknown mechanism, or the kidney can clear the free Apo-A1. It is also possible that HDL particles contain Apo-E, which allows HDL particles to undergo uptake by the LDL receptors into the liver and subsequently degraded. Endothelial cell lipase also metabolizes Apo-AI, leading to its clearance from circulation. In brief, the CETP pathway results in both the transfer of cholesterol in HDL to the liver and the elimination of HDL from the circulation through the degradation of Apo-AI.

HDL can also be uptaken by the liver via its apolipoprotein Apo-E. Apo-E interacts with the LDL receptor and leads to the uptake of the entire LDL particle.

The Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) pathway is responsible for the uptake of HDL cholesterol into the liver without the internalization of the HDL particle. After the uptake of cholesterol, the smaller HDL particle gets released back into the circulation. SR-B1 deficiency results in increased HDL levels but correlates with an increased, not decreased, risk of atherosclerosis.
