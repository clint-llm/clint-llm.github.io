A liver biopsy is not required to diagnose Rotor syndrome, but if done, a liver biopsy in patients with the disease reveals normal histology. Liver biopsy may help distinguish Rotor syndrome from other, more serious liver diseases. Since Rotor syndrome is clinically similar to Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS), it is imperative to distinguish between these two conditions; the absence of dark melanin-like pigments on liver biopsy distinguishes Rotor Syndrome from Dubin-Johnson syndrome.
