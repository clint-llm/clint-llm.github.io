Indications for epilepsy are specifically for partial seizures with complex symptomatology (psychomotor, temporal lobe), generalized tonic seizures (grand mal), and mixed seizure patterns. This activity will highlight off-label uses, mechanism of action, dosing, adverse effects, contraindications, and other key factors regarding carbamazepine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify patients at increased risk for adverse dermatological effects from carbamazepine. 
- Outline the indications for carbamazepine.
- Summarize the management of carbamazepine toxicity.
- Describe the importance of coordinated activity among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes in patients treated with carbamazepine.
