Neuraxial anesthesia allows the possibility of performing surgical procedures without putting the patient under general anesthesia. As a result, neuraxial anesthesia decreases the use of intravenous opioids in the perioperative period and their effect on the patient, including respiratory depression, nausea, ileus, pruritus, etc. Also, it eliminated ventilator-associated complications and allowed to evaluate the patient's neurological status.

Epidural anesthesia is routinely offered to laboring parturients to achieve pain management during labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum period. Consequently, neuraxial analgesia can improve exhaustion and overall satisfaction in the obstetric population. An interprofessional team includes the anesthesiologist, surgeon, obstetrician, and specialty-trained nurse. Communication among the team will optimize patient care. [Level 5]
