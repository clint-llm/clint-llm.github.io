Despite the advent of new therapies, mortality remains high in patients with symptomatic HF. Roughly, 1-year mortality is 30%, while 5-year mortality is 50%. The severity of symptoms, advanced age, and HF hospitalization are significant predictors of mortality in HF.

Almost 50% of patients are dead within five years. Mortality rates of 1% to 4% have been reported in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but these numbers have greatly improved in the past two decades. Even though most patients have no symptoms, the first clinical presentation is often sudden death from malignant arrhythmias. The highest mortality is in young people.
