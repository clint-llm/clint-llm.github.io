Laser refractive surgeries such as SMILE act upon the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped layer that covers the front of the eye. The femtosecond laser forms an intrastromal lenticule through various photoablative incisions. A further incision for lenticule extraction follows on the peripheral cornea, most often along the superior or superotemporal aspect.
