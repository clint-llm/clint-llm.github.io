An umbilical vein catheterization is a unique form of intravenous access that can be considered by the healthcare team when caring for a neonate. Physicians, residents, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners may place umbilical vein catheters this the help of the nursing staff. In critically ill neonates, decisions about central venous access may require discussion between critical care providers and emergency personnel. Unique aspects of care of umbilical catheters require review between nurses, medics, and advanced providers. Neonatal ICU specialty-trained nurses should assume a significant role in the interprofessional healthcare team performing umbilical vein catheterization, preparing the patient, assisting during the procedure, and caring and monitoring the neonate afterward while administering necessary medications. This approach will lead to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
