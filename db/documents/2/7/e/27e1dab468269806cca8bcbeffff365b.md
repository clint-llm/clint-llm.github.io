The following lab tests are helpful in the evaluation of post-abortion complications:

- Complete blood count (CBC) to assess a drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit which may be indicative of ongoing hemorrhage.

- Complete metabolic panel to assess any renal, hepatic, or electrolyte abnormalities.

- Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (Beta-hCG) to establish a baseline to monitor the predicted decline in level or to compare with the pre-existing level.

- Coagulation studies, especially if a patient is expected to go to the operating room.

- Blood type/Rh with antibody screen to establish the need for Rhogam and/or for possible impending blood transfusion.

- Blood cultures if sepsis is suspected.

- If DIC is suspected, fibrinogen, fibrin-split products, and d-dimer should be obtained.

**Imaging Studies**

- Abdominal X-rays should be obtained to rule out bowel perforation.

- Pelvic ultrasound (US) should be done to rule out an ectopic pregnancy.

- Computed tomography (CT) scan should be done to assess for fluid collection in the pelvis, retained byproducts, and adnexal mass.
