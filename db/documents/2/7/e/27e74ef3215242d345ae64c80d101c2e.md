Malunion is always a possible complication of fractures. With floating knee injuries, the patient also runs the risk for limb length discrepancies whether that be due to lengthening or shortening of the affected limb.  Limb length discrepancies may also occur in skeletally immature individuals if there is disruption of the growth plate resulting in premature physeal closure. Open fractures carry an increased risk of infection.  Infection is also a complication anytime a patient undergoes a surgical procedure.

Complication rate decreases when one or both of the fractures are in the femoral and tibial diaphysis.
