Definitive diagnosis of Strongyloides stercoralis requires the detection of larvae in the stool specimen; however, this method is limited due to scanty and intermittent excretion of larvae in most cases of strongyloidiasis. Intestinal biopsy, when performed, can sometimes demonstrate parasites in the gastric crypts or duodenal glands, as well as eosinophilic infiltration of the lamina propria.

The sensitivity and specificity of these tests, however, are not high. The standard stool examination has a sensitivity of only 21%. Stool concentration methods, such as the Baermann technique (72% sensitive) or agar plate culture (89% sensitive), can still fail to yield a diagnosis despite consecutive samples.

With the above limitations in mind, the gold standard tests for S. stercoralis diagnosis are yet to be developed. In most cases, both stool and serologic evaluation is indicated. PCR and RT-PCR tests have been developed and show promising results with nearly 100% specificity and very high sensitivity, but they are not widely available.

Peripheral eosinophilia is a common finding in patients with chronic infections.

The diagnosis of chronic strongyloidiasis is especially challenging due to low parasitic load, which results in low sensitivity of stool microscopy and low specificity of serology.

As discussed above, the sensitivity of stool microscopy and serology is low, especially in patients with acute or chronic infections. It is useful to note that serologic tests have a high negative predictive value and are quite useful in excluding strongyloidiasis.

Hyperinfection can be diagnosed by studying stool, body fluids, and/or tissue with adequate sensitivity because, in this state, the host generally has a high burden of readily detectable parasites.
