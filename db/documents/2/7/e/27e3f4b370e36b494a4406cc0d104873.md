Patients with severe MR must be evaluated by a cardiac surgeon with experience in mitral valve surgery. The standard pre-operative evaluation must be undertaken to determine surgical candidacy, including assessment of coronary arteries, medical co-morbidities, and prior surgical history. Patients with aortic calcification, RV dysfunction, or severe MAC are considered relative contraindications. Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk calculation can be performed to aid with determination of surgical risk, including that of mortality and major morbidity. Severe LV dysfunction is also a relatively contraindication as repair of the mitral valve leads to a competent valve, thereby increasing afterload on the LV. Thus, the pre-operative LV function and ejection fraction usually overestimates the true left ventricular function in cases of severe MR since the regurgitant valve acts as a "pop-off" valve.Â Severe emphysema, restrictive lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension (PHT) are also commonly seen comorbidities with severe longstanding MR and pose relative contraindication to surgery.
