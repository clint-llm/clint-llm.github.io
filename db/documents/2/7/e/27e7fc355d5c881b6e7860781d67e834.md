Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also called acne inversus, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition with lesions including deep-seated nodules and abscesses, draining tracts, and fibrotic scars. These lesions most commonly occur in intertriginous areas and areas rich in apocrine glands. Among the most common are the axillary, groin, perianal, perineal, and inframammary locations. Because of the associated pain, sensitive locations, drainage, odor, and scarring, this condition may have a negative psychosocial impact. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and complications of hidradenitis suppurativa and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the triggers for hidradenitis suppurativa.
- Explain the clinical presentation of hidradenitis suppurativa. 
- Summarize the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa. 
- Outline modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hidradenitis suppurativa.
