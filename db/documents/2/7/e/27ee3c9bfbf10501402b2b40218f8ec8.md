Sarcoidosis is a disease that can simultaneously involve various parts of the eye with multiple presentations. Differential diagnoses should be considered for various ocular findings, including iris nodules, intermediate uveitis, chorioretinitis, retinitis, choroidal infiltrates, dacryoadenopathy, and peripheral retinal neovascularization.

**Iris nodules**: Iris nodules may also be seen in inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and syphilis, tumors of the iris, and infiltration by retinoblastoma.

**Intermediate uveitis**: Intermediate uveitis may also be idiopathic or seen in Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and multiple sclerosis.

**Chorioretinitis**: Chorioretinitis may also be seen in tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis.

**Choroidal infiltrates**:  Choroidal infiltrates may also be present in white dot syndromes such as acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, birdshot choroidopathy; Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, amelanotic melanoma, and metastatic infiltrates.

**Dacryoadenopathy:**Dacryoadenopathy may also be seen in tuberculosis, brucellosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and parotid gland tumors.

**Peripheral retinal neovascularization:**Peripheral retinal neovascularization may also be present in diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusions, sickle cell retinopathy, and Eales disease.
