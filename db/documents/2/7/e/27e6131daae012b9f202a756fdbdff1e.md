Cherry hemangiomas are dome-shaped, bright, ruby-colored papules with a pale halo. They are small, well-demarcated, and often separated by septa. They are usually 1 to 5 millimeters in diameter. They occur most often as multiple lesions, usually found on the trunk or proximal extremities. They are rarely seen on the face, hands, and feet. When found in the form of multiple adjoining angiomas, they are said to form a polypoid angioma. These lesions most often blanch with applied pressure, but some are fibrotic and may not blanch completely.

These lesions are the most common type of acquired vascular proliferation of the skin. They are diagnosed clinically by appearance. These lesions have noÂ malignant potential. Although they have no malignant potential, they may be confused with amelanotic melanoma, which, in contrast, is more friable.
