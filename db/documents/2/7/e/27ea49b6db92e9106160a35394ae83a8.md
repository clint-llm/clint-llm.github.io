Radon is responsible for about 21,000 deaths per year in the United States. It usually is a “silent killer,” and symptoms do not present until years later when cancer symptoms begin to manifest. For this reason, the prognosis is usually guarded. However, it is estimated that lowering radon levels below 4 pCi/L can potentially decrease the mortality of lung cancer deaths anywhere from 2 to 4 percent.
