Contraindications to digital nerve block include, but are not limited to patient refusal, overlying infection atÂ the site of injection which could result in inoculation of a deeper or intravascular infection, distortion of landmarks, or allergy to local anesthetics. Digital blocks are commonly taught to be performed without epinephrine due to the risk of vasoconstriction leading to distal necrosis. However, recent studies provide no evidence of this occurrence.
