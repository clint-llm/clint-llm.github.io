There are various treatment options for trapped Lung, and the patient's symptoms determine the choice of treatment modality. Observation is warranted in an asymptomatic patient if the effusion is not worsening.

**Implantable Pleural Catheter**

Pleurodesis is considered an effective therapeutic choice for patients with malignant, recurrent pleural effusion. However, pleurodesis is ineffective and not the management of choice in cases of trapped lungs.

**Pleuroperitoneal Shunt**

The pleuroperitoneal shunt, first proposed in 1982 by Weese and Schouten, can provide effective and safe palliation in select patients. It can transport up to 1.5 L of pleural fluid into the abdominal cavity with each compression. Complications include failure of shunt and infection and are not routinely recommended or preferred.

**Surgical Decortication**

When a more definitive approach is indicated, surgical decortication is the only curative treatment modality.

**Intrapleural Fibrinolytic Therapy**

In select cases, fibrinolytic drugs such as tPA, urokinase, and streptokinase can be introduced into the pleural space to break down fibrin strands and adhesions and promote drainage and expansion of the lung. These can be used as palliative care options in inoperable scenarios.

All of these treatment options are, in essence, palliative. Re-expansion of the lung even after the removal of this peel is difficult when the lung has been trapped for a long period of time.
