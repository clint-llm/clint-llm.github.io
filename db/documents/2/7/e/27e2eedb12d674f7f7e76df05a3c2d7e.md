Wound healing is a vast topic area, with many aspects remaining poorly understood despite the tremendous amount of progress over the past few decades. Successful wound healing requires attention to multiple factors, incorporating nutritional, microbiologic, mechanical/coverage/dressing, and circulatory considerations. Various co-morbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic steroid administration) and environmental factors (e.g., tobacco abuse) play important roles as modulators of the WHP. More recently, a better understanding of the role micronutrients play in wound healing, along with the introduction of novel wound care therapeutics (e.g., NPWT, MDT, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, growth factors), created a foundation for further progress in this critically important area of patient care.
