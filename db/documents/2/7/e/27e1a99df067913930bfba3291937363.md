Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to late, persistent clinical features of intellectual disability, skin gummas, scarring, hearing deficits and skeletal abnormalities. Initiation of treatment in some infants can lead to a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction leading to fevers, chills, hypotension, and possibly fetal death as a result of an inflammatory response to the dying spirochetes.
