**FDA Approved Indications**

- Intended for diagnostic purposes: to achieve mydriasis

The preferred practice pattern of the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends periodic dilated eye exams in different age groups.

Achieving a clinically effective pupil diameter of 6 mm is essential for viewing structures in the posterior segment. The most common indication for a comprehensive exam with pupillary dilation is screening for diabetic retinopathy. The nondilated exam gives the correct classification for the presence or stage of diabetic retinopathy in only  50% of cases.

The lower concentration of 0.5% produced less ocular discomfort with the same efficacy in dilating the pupil as the 1% solution in a study on 30 adolescents (aged 12 to 18 years) with type 1 diabetes.

- Intended for diagnostic purposes: cycloplegia

Eyecare specialists are interested in accommodation paralysis, also known as cycloplegia, when determining a patient's refractive error. Cycloplegic agents inactivate the ciliary muscle, so the patient cannot influence the refractive measurement. For example, an accurate evaluation is necessary before LASIK (laser-assisted in situ keratomileuses) surgery. In a 2017 meta-analysis, the more popular cycloplegic drug of choice, cyclopentolate, was compared to tropicamide. The research concluded that tropicamide is a viable alternative.

**FDA Non-approved, Off-label Use**

- Parkinson Disease

The properties of anticholinergics can counter the imbalanced dopaminergic to cholinergic activity in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. One randomized pilot study observed the safety and efficacy of tropicamide reduce sialorrhea in neurodegenerative diseases. Tropicamide was given orally as a dissolving film. Although the small sample size limited the power, a significant decrease in perceived symptoms on the visual analog scale and saliva volume measured with cotton balls occurred.
