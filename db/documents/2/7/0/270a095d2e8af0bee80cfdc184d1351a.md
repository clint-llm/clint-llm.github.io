In general, the presence of intellectual disability with ASD is associated with the most difficulty developing social competence. Also, ASD with language impairment further increases the risk of social difficulties. In other words, intelligence and language ability in childhood are predictive for outcomes in adulthood. Approximately 9% of children with early ASD diagnosis may no longer meet the criteria for ASD in adulthood. Higher cognitive skills and participation in early intervention services are predictive for a better outcome. Individuals who have a more significant increase in tested verbal IQ are more likely to have improved severity scores in adulthood. It is important to note that the presence of family and community supports is a more critical factor than ASD symptoms in the reported quality of life of adults with high functioning autism.
