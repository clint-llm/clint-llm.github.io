Meclizine, an FDA- approved drug, is a first-generation antihistamine used for the symptomatic management of motion sickness. These symptoms include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. It also treats vertigo symptoms caused by vestibular diseases that commonly affect the inner ear, such as Meniere’s disease.

The drug can be taken orally with or without food by tablet. Recommended dosages to control motion sickness are between 25 to 50 mg one hour before embarkation for protection against motion sickness—additional dosages are repeatable once every 24 hours. The recommended dosages for control of vertigo against vestibular diseases are between 25 to 100 mg daily, and subsequent dosages depend upon clinical response.

The drug has not received approval for children under 12 years of age because safety and efficacy have not been established. The drug is in FDA pregnancy category B. It is safe to use to treat nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It is not thought to harm an unborn baby. It is not known whether meclizine is excreted into breast milk. Extended use and hefty doses of meclizine may cause effects in breastfeeding or decrease the milk supply, especially in combination with sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine.
