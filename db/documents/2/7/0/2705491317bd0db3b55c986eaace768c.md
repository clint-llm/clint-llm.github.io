Fetal abnormalities include intracranial calcifications, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, lenticulostriate vasculopathy, occipital horn anomalies, echogenic bowel, intrauterine growth restriction, hepatomegaly, pericardial effusion, and ascites. Also noted are placental inflammation and fetal death.

Laboratory findings include elevated aspartate transferase, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CSF protein.
