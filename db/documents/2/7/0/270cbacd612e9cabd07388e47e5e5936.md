The main differential diagnosis for erectile dysfunction would be hypogonadism, loss of libido, depression with low mood, and other psychological conditions. It may be the first manifestation of diabetes or cardiovascular disease as well as depression. It is also important to differentiate between true erectile dysfunction and other sexual disorders such as premature ejaculation. This is usually easily accomplished just by obtaining a good sexual history.
