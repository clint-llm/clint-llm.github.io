This activity will outline the basic steps in a small bowel resection, characterize certain situations requiring resection, and discuss the possible outcomes and complications associated with the procedure. For surgeons, this activity serves as a review for the procedure and its indications. However, since small bowel resections are a very common procedure in general surgery, providers in numerous specialties will be exposed to both the pathologies requiring small bowel resection as well as caring for the patient post operatively. Effective interprofessional care for these patients requires knowledge of the procedure by providers by both medical and surgical teams.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common indications for small bowel resection and how the surgical approach is modified based on the pathology.
- Review techniques for small bowel resection and anastomoses.
- Review potential complications after a small bowel resection.
- Outline the special post procedure care for patients in order to improve collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team.
