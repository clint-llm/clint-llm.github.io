While an audiologist and an otolaryngologist are predominantly involved in the care of an individual with nonorganic functional hearing loss, the role of an interprofessional team approach cannot be overstated. The audiologist is ideally placed to observe clues that indicate nonorganic hearing loss during testing.

Psychiatrists and psychologists may need to be consulted in cases of great psychological distress. Their role focuses on identifying the stressor and the underlying condition, followed by appropriate counseling.

Continuous contact with the patient’s general physician is recommended. The patient is unlikely to provide an accurate psychological history, and the general physician can fulfill this role.

A child neurologist may need to be consulted in cases of serious developmental disorders in children. Finally, when children are involved, their parents and teachers are essential allies during treatment.
