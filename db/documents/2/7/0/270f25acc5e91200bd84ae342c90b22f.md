The differential diagnosis of brachial plexitis includes the following:

- Cervical disc disease with or without radiculopathy

- Cervical lesions

- Mononeuritis multiplex

- Transverse myelitis

- Acute poliomyelitis

- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

- Traumatic compressive nerve injury

- Traction injury to the brachial plexus

- Non-traumatic compressive nerve injuries

- Spinal cord tumor

- Brachial plexus tumor

- Neoplastic infiltration of the brachial plexus

- Pancoast tumor

- Thoracic outlet syndrome

- Radiation plexopathy, rotator cuff injury

- Adhesive capsulitis

- Acute calcific tendonitis

- Diaphragmatic paralysis

- Myocardial infarction

- Pulmonary embolism

Sixty percent of upper plexus lesions may recover in less than one year, while lower plexus lesions may take between one and a half to three years. Estimated rate of recovery is 36%, 75% and 89% within one, two, and three years, respectively. Idiopathic reoccurrence is estimated to be 5%, although other figures have been proposed.
