If there is an absence of eyelid tissue, trauma to the tissue should be considered on the differential and ruled out. If the defect has been present at birth, it is most likely a coloboma. The clinician must consider the following syndromes and investigate if they establish the diagnosis of an eyelid coloboma.

- Fraser syndrome

- Goldenhar syndrome

- Treacher Collins syndrome (mandibulofacial dysostosis):

- CHARGE syndrome

- Frontonasal dysplasia

- Delleman-Oorthuys (oculocerebrocutaneous) syndrome

- Nasopalpebral lipoma coloboma syndrome

- Manitoba oculotrichoanal (MOTA) syndrome
