Shared principles guide the procedure of mechanical thrombectomy; however, certain modifications are made based on the type of intervention performed. The procedure begins with the insertion of a balloon-guided catheter commonly through a groin puncture. It is advanced until it reaches the thrombus. A guidewire is then advanced through the thrombus, and a microcatheter is passed over the guidewire through the thrombus. The guidewire is withdrawn, while the stent is deployed. The retrievable stent opens up, and its projections grip the thrombus, effectively securing it to the stent. Contrast is injected through the initial balloon catheter to observe flow distal to the removed occlusion. The balloon is then inflated to temporarily restrict flow as the stent and microcatheter are removed slowly through the guide catheter, with concurrent aspiration. An angiogram is performed to check for the complete removal of the thrombus.

The ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique) is an alternate technique that uses direct aspiration with a large-bore catheter as a first pass step in removing the thrombus. This novel technique demonstrates the ongoing development and adaptations of mechanical thrombectomy. First, a large guide catheter is advanced to the thrombus' level, passing over a microwire and microcatheter. Next, aspiration is applied to the system using an aspiration pump or a syringe. Lack of flow means contact with the thrombus. The large bore catheter is advanced slightly for 1Â to 2 mm to encircle the thrombus. Aspiration is again applied. Evidence of thrombus retrieval is through cessation of flow in the system. If the thrombus is not retrieved, repeat attempts and utilization of adjuncts such as a stent retriever are quickly implemented to remove the thrombus.
