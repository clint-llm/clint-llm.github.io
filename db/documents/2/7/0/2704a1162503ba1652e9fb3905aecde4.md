There are several causes of perichondritis of the pinna. However, the most identified cause in the literature is penetrating trauma to the cartilaginous pinna.

Less common causes include untreated middle or external ear infections spreading to the pinna and cartilage, iatrogenic (post-surgery), immunosuppression, and minor trauma such as scratching the ear. There is also a significant proportion of patients who have no identifiable cause.

Perichondritis can also be caused by herpes zoster infection, perhaps from vesicles enabling a route of entry for bacteria to invade.

The commonest causative organism of perichondritis of the pinna is pseudomonas aeruginosa which seems to have a predilection for damaged cartilage. Other causative organisms include Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
