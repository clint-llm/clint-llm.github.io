Absolute contraindications to CBD are allergies to cannabidiol or sesame oil. At first signs of skin, cutaneous irritation, or anaphylactic reaction, the patient should stop using CBD.

There are some relative contraindications. In patients with a history of drug or alcohol addiction, caution is necessary when prescribing CBD. While CBD does not contain the part of marijuana that gives users a “high,” it may have addictive properties. Physicians should caution patients who have struggled with addiction about this and emphasize appropriate use. With these patients, clinicians should look at the risk vs. benefit.

Another relative contraindication is in patients with a history of mood disorders, depression, or suicidal thoughts; patients with such a history should be cautioned about using CBD. CBD use has correlated with increased suicidal thoughts and behavior. When prescribing these patients, physicians should weigh the risk vs. benefit and inform patients and their caregivers to watch for sudden changes in behavior.
