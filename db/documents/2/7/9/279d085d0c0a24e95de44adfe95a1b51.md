Tonometry is a common procedure employed by healthcare professionals to measure intraocular pressure (IOP) using a calibrated instrument. IOP is important in diagnosing, screening, and managing ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Instruments measuring intraocular pressure assume the eye is a closed globe with uniform pressure distributed throughout the anterior chamber and vitreous cavity. The normal range of intraocular pressure is 10 to 21 millimeters of mercury. This activity discusses the numerous past and present methods of tonometry available to assess intraocular pressure and identify potential diseases causing abnormalities in eye pressure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of different types of tonometry. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regard to performing tonometry. 
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications of tonometry.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the proper use of tonometry and optimize patient outcomes.
