**Presentation:**The lesions are usually pedunculated on a thin stalk. The length of stalk varies, and the lesions are about 0.5 to 2.5 mm in diameter. Skin tags often appear round and soft and are easy to diagnose simply by a visual examination. Smaller lesions may be visible with the use of a magnifying glass. The skin tag may be the same color as the skin or be hyperpigmented; in general, the latter is more common. Skin tags are most on the side of the neck, axillary region, and groin.

Acrochordons have the following general descriptions:

- Small skin tags:- furrowed papules of approximately 1 to 2 mm in width and height, most frequently appearing on the neck and the axillae

- Mid-sized skin tags:- solo or multiple filiform skin tags that are roughly 5 mm long and 2 mm wide, occurring at other sites on the body

- Large-sized skin tags: - pedunculated lesions that may demonstrate a baglike, nevoid, baglike appearance, or soft fibromas usually located on the lower part of the body (groin)

Giant skin tags attractÂ considerable attention, as they are known to produce significant discomfort for patients when located in the axillae and genital regions.
