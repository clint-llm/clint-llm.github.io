Common adverse effects associated with the initial use of topical triamcinolone involve itchiness, burning, irritation, or drying of the skin.

Patients with congestive heart failure or severe hypertension may experience a higher incidence of edema and weight gain when taking triamcinolone. Glucocorticoid drugs must be slowly tapered off with chronic use to prevent the occurrence of adrenal insufficiency (high risk if the drug is abruptly discontinued, especially in very ill patients).
