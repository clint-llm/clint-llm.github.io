The pathophysiology of LCH is unknown. Langerhans cells are dendritic antigen-presenting cells. The abnormal cells in LCH have abnormal proliferation and lower antigen-presenting capability. LCH lesion also contains inflammatory cells and cytokines such as T lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages. It is thought that the combination or interaction of these cells accounts for the continued proliferation of the abnormal Langerhans cells. Regardless, abnormal proliferation into tissue causes disease, based on location at presentation.Â For example, bone marrow infiltration may lead to decreased blood cell production.
