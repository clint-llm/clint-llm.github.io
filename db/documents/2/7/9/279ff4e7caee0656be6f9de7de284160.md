The diagnosis of MGD is straightforward based on clinical examination. A detailed assessment is needed to look for associated signs of ocular surface damage or dry eyes. A step-wise approach for evaluating patients presenting with ocular surface disorder symptoms can be planned based on initial clinical examination.

- Symptom questionnaire – A validated questionnaire is useful in quantitatively measuring symptoms resulting from MGD. Paugh et al. developed MGD specific questionnaire using psychometric approaches among noncontact lens users.

- Calculate the blink rate and note the pattern of blinks

- Measure lower tear meniscus height

- Measure tear osmolarity

- Measure tear film break-up time

- Schirmer's test

- Grading of conjunctival and corneal staining

- Mass spectrometry – To look for the presence of inflammatory cell markers, provides information regarding the overall ocular surface inflammatory status 33760148

- Interferometry – for lipid layer assessment

If the diagnosis is still not precise, the patient should be assessed for:

- Quantification of morphologic lid features

- Quantification of meibum expressibility and quality

- Meibography: quantification of dropout

**MGD Staging is Based on Symptoms, Expressibility and Secretion from the Meibomian Glands, and Corneal Staining**.
