Given the paucity of treatment options, tick education and prevention are central to avoiding infection. Specifically, counseling patients who live in or visit highly endemic areas is recommended for both primary and secondary prevention. Patients should be advised to be mindful of ticks when walking in wooded, grassy, or leaf-littered areas, even within the confines of their own property. This is especially important during the spring, summer, and fall when ticks are most active.

Also, when working or recreating outdoors, patients should be instructed to don light-colored clothing that covers their arms and legs to both prevent exposure and help more easily identify potential ticks. Tucking clothing into socks and pants can also help reduce the likelihood of ticks accessing exposed skin. Chemical repellents such as permethrin or DEET can also be applied to clothing to deter ticks. Once indoors, tick checks should be diligently performed to identify any potential exposures and are best done with the help of a second individual. Prompt tick removal is recommended, but given the short attachment time needed for transmission of the POW virus, this may not be a reliable prevention method.
