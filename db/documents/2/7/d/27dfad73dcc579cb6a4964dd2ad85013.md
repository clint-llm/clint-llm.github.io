First-generation: Cefazolin, cephalothin, and cephapirin are administered parenterally. The administration route for cefadroxil and cephalexin is oral. Cephradine administration can be parenteral or oral.

Second-generation: Cefuroxime can be administered parenterally or orally. Cefprozil administration is oral. Cefmetazole, cefotetan, and cefoxitin are administered parenterally.

Third-generation: Cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone administration is via the parenteral route. Cefdinir, cefixime, and cefpodoxime are administered orally. A single intramuscular shot of 125 or 250 mg of ceftriaxone effectively treats uncomplicated gonococcal infection or its complications, such as pelvic inflammatory diseaseÂ or epididymo-orchitis.

Fourth-generation: Cefepime is administered parenterally.

Fifth-generation: Ceftaroline is administered parenterally.

Many of the parenterally administered cephalosporins have short half-lives and need to be given more frequently in patients with normal renal function. Cefazolin and ceftriaxone have a longer half-life; thus, they do not need to be dosed as often. Ceftriaxone is the only cephalosporin that does not need to have its dose modified in the presence of renal failure. However, in patients with both renal and hepatic impairment, the recommended daily dose should not exceed 2 g.
