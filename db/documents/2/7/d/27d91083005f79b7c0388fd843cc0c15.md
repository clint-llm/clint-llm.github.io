The diagnosis and management of keratoacanthoma is with an interprofessional team that includes the nurse practitioner, pathologist, dermatologist, primary care provider, and ENT surgeon. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment may vary from excision, laser, electrodesiccation, and curettage. When these lesions occur on the face, a consult from a plastic surgeon should be sought. There are several topical medications that can be used to treat keratoacanthoma, but the treatment is often long term, associated with skin discoloration and pain.

Keratoacanthoma has an excellent prognosis following surgical excision. Generally, patients with keratoacanthoma will have a history of sun exposure and will need to be followed for the development of new primary skin cancers. Metastases are rare, but there are reports of this in addition to perineural spread in literature.
