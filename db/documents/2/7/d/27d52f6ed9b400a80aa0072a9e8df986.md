As mentioned above, two of the primary nerves of the arm run through the cubital fossa - the median and radial nerves.

The median nerve, with C6-T1 roots, innervates the majority of the muscles of the anterior forearm (barring the ulna nerve innervated flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus), the muscles of the thenar eminence of the hand, and the medial two lumbricals. As such, it plays a vital role in flexion of the wrist, pronation of the forearm, and movements of the fingers. It supplies sensory innervation to the lateral palm and volar surface of the lateral three and one-half digits.

The radial nerve, with C5-T1 roots, innervates all of the muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm, thus having a key role in wrist extension and movements of the fingers. It supplies sensory innervation to the lateral aspect of the dorsum of the hand and dorsal surface of the lateral three and one-half digits.
