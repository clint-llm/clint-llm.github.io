- Review the medical record for indications and contraindications.

- Review the current medications and history of contrast agent allergy.

- Head imaging must be performed before the procedure in all cases. A head computed tomographic (CT) scan with bone window views is obtained to exclude cervical-occipital junction and problematic skull base bone variants. CT angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the neck is performed before deciding whether the procedure is safe to perform. A preliminary CTA or MRA with 3D reconstruction including the skull base, atlantooccipital junction, and upper cervical spine will visualize the vertebral artery V3 segment to exclude arterial variants crossing in the spinal canal at the C1–C2 level at the puncture location.

- Coagulation tests performed.

- Anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications are withheld according to established guidelines.

- Determine if the patient can maintain a cervical extension position.

- Determine if the patient can maintain a sitting, supine, prone, or lateral decubitus position.

- Local sterilization of the area.
