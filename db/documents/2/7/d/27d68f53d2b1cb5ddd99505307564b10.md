EBUS is undertaken by one or two trained operators. These will generally be respiratory physicians who have undergone training in traditional and advanced bronchoscopy and regularly perform EBUS. Some countries have formal curricula and competency frameworks to assess competence levels.

Nursing staff should be present to provide conscious sedation, provide technical assistance, and facilitate patient comfort and procedure tolerance and care for the patient in a recovery area. Some centers also perform ROSE of EBUS-TBNA samples which necessitates the presence of trained pathology staff.

Where EBUS is performed under general anesthetic for greater control and ease of sampling, trained anesthetic staff are present to anesthetize the patient and provide airway support.
