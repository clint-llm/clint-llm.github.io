Homonymous superior quadrantanopia deficit can be seen in a large variety of disorders:

- Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

- Tumor causing damage to the posterior visual pathways (intra-axial primary or metastatic)

- Aneurysm

- Demyelinating disease

- Trauma

- Abscess

- Arachnoid cyst

- Temporal lobe surgery (surgery beyond 3 cm of the temporal lobe usually produces a superior quadrantanopsia, while surgery beyond 8 cm usually will produce complete homonymous hemianopia). Between 89%-91% of the patients have a deficit; those with selective amygdalohippocampectomy less pronounced than those with standard temporal lobectomy.

- Radiosurgery treatment for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (62.5%Â of the patients have a deficit at the 24-month follow-up)

- Radiation necrosis

- Chiropractic neck manipulation after embolic stroke

- Vertebrobasilar insufficiency

- Rare cases (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Alzheimer disease, Lewy body disease, global ischemia, and non-ketotic hyperglycemia have been reported)
