At the level of the area between the ureter and the posterior portion of the uterine artery, one finds the inferior hypogastric plexuses, which create a plexiform structure (similar to a folding fan) at the end of both hypogastric nerves; as another anatomical landmark, we find the plexus dorsally to the parametric vessels in the area of the uterine vein. We can find a small number of lymph nodes adjacent to the inferior hypogastric plexus.
