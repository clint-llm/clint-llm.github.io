Uremia can result from some conditions ranging from primary renal disorders, for example, IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease) to systemic disorders that can lead to renal damage. Systematic disorders can include diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, Goodpasture disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, or hemolytic uremic syndrome.

The leading cause of ESRD in the United States is diabetes accounting for 40% of new dialysis patients. Additional causes, listed in order of decreasing incidence, include hypertension, glomerulonephritis, interstitial disease, cystitis, and neoplasms. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide; however, glomerulonephritis is the more predominant underlying cause in developing countries.

Uremia may also result from acute kidney injury if the injury involves a sudden increase in urea or creatinine.
