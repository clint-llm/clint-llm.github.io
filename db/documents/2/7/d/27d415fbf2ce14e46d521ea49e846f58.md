Primary AIN mainly has seen in infants, which is self-limiting over time and does not require extensive measures, but secondary AIN is common in adults, which requires antibiotics and G-CSF. Implementation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has improved neutrophil count as well as function in certain patients with neutropenia.

Prophylactic antimicrobial agents can be used for certain congenital conditions like LAD and congenital granulomatous disease. If AIN is associated with other autoimmune diseases and severe, then treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, or immunosuppressants such as rituximab should be indicated.
