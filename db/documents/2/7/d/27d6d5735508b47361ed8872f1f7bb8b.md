Lens-induced glaucoma (LIG) was originally described by Gifford in 1900 as glaucoma associated with hyper-mature senile cataracts (HMSC). Von Ruess independently described LIG as glaucoma with spontaneous absorption of lens matter through an intact capsule.

Based on the pathogenesis, LIG is further classified as:

1. Lens protein-related: Leakage of lens protein across an intact or a breached lens capsule. This form includes:

- Phacolytic glaucoma (PLG)

- Lens-particle induced glaucoma (LPIG)

- Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma (PAG)

2. Aqueous flow obstruction: Anatomical obstruction of aqueous flow from the posterior to the anterior chamber. This type includes:

- Phacomorphic glaucoma (PMG)

- Pupillary block glaucoma (PBG)

Some causes like pseudo-exfoliation glaucoma and ciliary block glaucoma are debatable entities under LIG.
