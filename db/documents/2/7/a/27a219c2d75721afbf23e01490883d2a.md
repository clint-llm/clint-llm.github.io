Key personnel usually present at a laparotomy include the surgeon, surgeonâ€™s assistant, scrub nurse, anesthetist, operating department practitioner, and some theatre staff to act as runners in case more kit is required. The operating room nurses are required to set up the instruments and do a pre and post count of sponges, needles and other equipment used during the procedure. In general, no patient should leave the operating room with missing sponges or needles. Every hospital has protocols that both nurses and surgeons need to follow to ensure that no unintended item is ever left inside the patient.
