Evaluation of patients with suspected spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee begins with obtaining a comprehensive history and performing a physical exam. After this initial evaluation, further imaging is the next step. Anteroposterior (AP), oblique, and lateral plain films of the knee should be obtained and can demonstrate flattening of the involved condyles in later stages of the disease. It is important to note that plain radiographs are often negative early on in the course of the disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is especially useful in the early stages of the disease, given its high sensitivity to detect bone edema.

Spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee can be staged to assess the severity and to guide treatment. The Koshino classification, described in 1979, consists of four stages. Stage I is a patient with knee symptoms but normal x-ray findings. Stage II consists of patients with flattening and subchondral radiolucencies without collapse. Stage III shows an extension of these radiolucencies with subchondral collapse. Stage IV consists of further degenerative changes with osteosclerosis and osteophyte formation.
