**Flank Pain:**

Causes of flank pain that may require intervention, such as infection, stone, and tumor, should be excluded. Opioid analgesics should be reserved for the management of acute pain. Reassurance, lifestyle modification, and avoidance of aggravating activities may be helpful. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful as in other chronic pain syndromes, as they are well tolerated. Cyst aspiration, under ultrasound or CT guidance, can be done if distortion of the kidney by large cyst is considered the cause of the pain. If multiple cysts are contributing to pain, laparoscopic or surgical cyst fenestration may be of benefit.

**Cyst hemorrhage:**

Cyst hemorrhage episodes are self-limited, and patients respond well to conservative management with bed rest, analgesics, and increased fluid intake to prevent obstructing clots. Rarely, bleeding is more severe, leading to hemodynamic instability; this requires hospitalization and transfusions.

**Cyst and urinary tract infection:**

Immediate treatment of symptomatic cystitis and asymptomatic bacteriuria is indicated to prevent retrograde seeding of the renal parenchyma

**Nephrolithiasis:**

Potassium citrate is the treatment of choice in stone-forming conditions associated with it, which are uric acid stones, hypo-citraturic calcium oxalate stones

**Hypertension:**

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
