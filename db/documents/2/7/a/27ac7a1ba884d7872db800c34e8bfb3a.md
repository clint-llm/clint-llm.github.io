A female nurse or chaperone must be present with a female patient while performing SLRT by a male doctor. If the patient is wearing a sari or skirt, she may feel inhibition to raise the leg, which can lead to resistance in the movement and further misinterpretation of SLRT; this is reasonably avoidable with the presence of a chaperone.

The patient may be in severe pain, for which he or she may need proper counseling during the examination, and positioning should be done without hurting the patient further.

Proper communication between the doctor and nurse will help in eliciting SLRT properly without creating false positives.
