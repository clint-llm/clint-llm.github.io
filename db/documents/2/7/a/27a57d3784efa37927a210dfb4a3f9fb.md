The use of ECCO2R has shown the possibility of earlier extubation after invasive-mechanical ventilation (IMV) insertion, but there was no reduction in the length of hospital stay or early mortality (28-days and 90-days).

Complications encountered:

- Patient-related challenges: Bleeding related to vascular access and anticoagulation, hemolysis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

- Circuit and catheter-related challenges: Vascular injury, vascular occlusion, thrombosis, hematoma, aneurysm, bleeding from the cannula site, kinking/displacement of the cannulas, infections. These are considered life-threatening.

- Mechanical challenges: These include air embolism, the formation of clots, malfunctioning, or failure of pump, oxygenator, or heat exchange malfunctions.

AV-ECCO2R can cause complications such as distal limb ischemia, compartment syndrome, and pseudoaneurysm formations.
