Patisiran, givosiran, lumasiran, and inclisiran are FDA-approved for managing rare metabolic ailments. All four agents are small interfering RNA (siRNA) based therapies that exert their effects by RNA interference (RNAi) of their target mRNA. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in managing adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), and lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

**Objectives:**
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving small interfering RNA (siRNA) based therapies.
- Identify the mechanism of action of small interfering RNA (siRNA) based therapies.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of small interfering RNA (siRNA) based therapies.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance small interfering RNA (siRNA) based therapies in treating patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), and lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
