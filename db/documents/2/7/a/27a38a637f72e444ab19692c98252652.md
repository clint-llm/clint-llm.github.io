With the increase in research regarding alternative medical therapies, more and more physicians are embracing an integrative medical approach. Utilizing the benefits of both Eastern and Western practices for particular ailments works best. For example, alternative approaches lend themselves to the treatment of vague symptoms which Western medicine lacks definitive treatment options for such as fatigue, “cold” or flu symptoms, generalized gastrointestinal issues, etc. Other ailments necessitate the involvement of antibiotics and/or surgery such as appendicitis and certain bacterial infections. Remaining open-minded, tailoring treatment therapies to individual patients, their interests, and belief systems proves the most beneficial healing method. Finally, staying up to date on research supporting or refuting all types of medical treatment is vital to providing effective and appropriate care for your patients.
