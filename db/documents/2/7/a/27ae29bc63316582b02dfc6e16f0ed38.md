Cervical dislocations have classically been associated with traumatic spinal cord injuries. These injuries can cause spinal cord compression and dramatic neurological deficits, and the severity of the injury depends on multiple factors. To improve outcomes and decrease morbidity and mortality, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cervical dislocations and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cervical dislocations.
- Describe the evaluation, including imaging associated with cervical dislocations. 
- Review the treatment and management options available for cervical dislocations.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by cervical dislocations.
