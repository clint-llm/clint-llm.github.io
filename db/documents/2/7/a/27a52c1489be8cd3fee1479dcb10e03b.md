Secondary polycythemia is associated primarily with complications arising from hyperviscosity. Polycythemia vera is associated with complications associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and progression to malignant conditions.

Commonly encountered complications include:

- Bleeding:Â Recurrent epistaxis or GI bleeding is often seen, which may lead to iron deficiency anemia, potentially confounding clinical findings, including bone marrow appearance.

- Thrombosis: Due to hyperviscosity, there is a preponderance of both arterial and venous thrombosis. Manifestations of arterial thrombosis include digital infarcts, and cerebral ischemic infarcts, particularly in watershed territories. Venous thrombosis, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, is also seen.

Progression to leukemia, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), is seen in approximately 5% of cases and is often refractory to treatment. Studies have implicated the use of chlorambucil, pipobroman, or radioactive phosphorous as factors that increase the likelihood of progression.
