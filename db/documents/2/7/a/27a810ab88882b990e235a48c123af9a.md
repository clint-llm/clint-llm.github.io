Similar to their adult counterparts, pediatric cerebral aneurysms are associated with a variety of systemic and intracranial disorders. The most common conditions associated with increased risk of pediatric cerebral aneurysm include coarctation of the aorta, polycystic kidney disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, tuberous sclerosis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and certain familial syndromes. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of pediatric cerebral aneurysms and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe a patient presentation for which pediatric cerebral aneurysm should be on the differential diagnosis. 
- List the evaluation components for pediatric cerebral aneurysms. 
- Depict considerations that influence the management of pediatric cerebral aneurysms.
- Examine the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure children with cerebral aneurysms are recognized early and every effort is made to deliver high-quality care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.
