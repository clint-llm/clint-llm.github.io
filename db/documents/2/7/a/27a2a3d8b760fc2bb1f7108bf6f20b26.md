Glottic cancers often present early, as even small lesions of the glottis can result in significant hoarseness. Resultantly, current American and British guidelines advise urgent referral to an otolaryngologist for persistent hoarseness lasting 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. However, there have been suggestions for referrals as early as three weeks from the onset of hoarseness.

Patients require a full ear, nose, and throat examination by an experienced otolaryngologist, including palpation of the neck for cervical lymphadenopathy, as well as close inspection of the oral cavity and oropharynx to exclude an oropharyngeal malignancy and assess dentition. Flexible nasal endoscopy in the outpatient clinic is essential to evaluate the glottis with particular attention paid to the involvement of one or more cords, cord mobility, and invasion to other subsites in the supraglottis and subglottis. To assess subtle vocal cord immobility, video-stroboscopic equipment is available.
