There are no known acute toxicity syndromes associated with these vitreous substitutes. However, if high IOP is noted due to overfill, a partial removal may be needed:

**Gas**: Although anterior chamber paracentesis may provide temporary relief, partial gas removal may be needed. A half water-filled syringe with plunger removed can be inserted in the vitreous through the par plana, and a few gas bubbles can be removed.

**SO**: A single cannula can be inserted through the superior par plana, and SO can be partially removed passively.
