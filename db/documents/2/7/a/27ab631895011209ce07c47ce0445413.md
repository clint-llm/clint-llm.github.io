Uveitis can be a vision-threatening disease. A detailed history, exam, and likely laboratory evaluation are required to make an accurate diagnosis.  If there is any suspicion for uveitis, urgent ophthalmology referral/consultation is imperative.  Immediate treatment should include corticosteroids and cycloplegics for anterior uveitis.  Other types of steroids (i.e. oral, periocular, or intraocular) should never be administered until infectious etiologies have been effectively ruled out.  The patient will need to be followed for repeat ocular examinations and measurement of IOP.
