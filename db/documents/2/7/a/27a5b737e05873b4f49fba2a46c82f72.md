Acromegaly is a multisystem disorder. Patients must be aware that even with treatment and biochemical normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels, comorbidities associated with the condition may improve but not always be reversible. Long-term follow-up is essential with an endocrinologist as well as relevant specialists. The disease can relapse even after years of remission, making follow-up vital. Quality of life in these patients is often low, related to the chronicity of the disease, the burden of treatment, and the multitude of associated comorbidities. It becomes the physician's responsibility to educate patients on disease expectations and treatment options to optimize their quality of life.
