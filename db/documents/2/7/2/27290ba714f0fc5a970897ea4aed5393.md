Staging is based on the International Union Against Cancer and American Joint Committee on Cancer system using the TNM system. Angiosarcoma tendsÂ to metastasize by lymphatic or hematogenous pathways, and 20% to 45% of patients have metastatic disease at presentation. The lungs are the most common site of metastasis and can present as pleural disease, hemorrhagic pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Other common sites include the liver, bone, soft-tissue, and lymph nodes.
