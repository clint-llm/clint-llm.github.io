The medical term xanthelasma palpebrarum is composed of two words. Xanthelasma, derived from ancient Greece, where "xanthos" means yellow and "elesma" means plate. Palpebrarum is a Latin word that means "near or related to the eyelid." It is a lipid-rich deposition, mainly cholesterol. It is mostly semisolid yellowish deposits that are commonly found on the medial aspect of the eyes. It is often seen along the corners of the upper and lower eyelids. Xanthelasma palpebrarum is the commonest coetaneous presentation of xanthoma, which occurs over the eyelids, even with the absence of any other cutaneous or mucosal lesions. It is characterized by soft, yellowish papules and plaques that occur more commonly near the inner canthus of the eyelid, more often at the upper eyelid. Lesions are usually symmetrical. There might be one or multiple.

Xanthelasma palpebrarum is a benign condition that never leads to serious consequences, but it is cosmetically bothersome, and most of the patients are unhappy about their image, and they seek medical advice. The patients visit dermatology offices, reconstructive surgery clinics, and ophthalmology clinics looking for permanent solutions.
