The pathology of FSHD is a result of an intricate interaction of genetics involving the protein product of the DUX4 gene and the chromosomal location and number of repeats of the D4Z4 macrosatellite. The result of this interaction is the inappropriate expression of the DUX4 protein product.

FSHD further classifies into two subtypes, based on the route in which decreased methylation and a failure of epigenetic repression takes place. About 95% of cases of FSHD are type 1, in which D4Z4 repeats become lost. The remaining 5% of FSHD cases classify as type 2, in which methylation and epigenetics are affected in a deletion-independent manner.
