Nature and anatomy always reserve extraordinary adaptations and differences. The gastrocnemius does not escape the rule. One can find the gastrocnemius tertius, an accessory muscle district that is an integral part of the muscle, as well as an extra soleus muscle. Rarely, these accessory muscles can be found simultaneously and bilaterally, without effects on joint function and innervation by the tibial nerve. The gastrocnemius tertius could cause problems in the popliteal fossa if it should come into contact with the popliteal artery and create an arterial entrapment.

There are anatomical variants in the literature. Specifically, it is possible to find a quadriceps gastrocnemius muscle. Practitioners do not know if this variant causes dysfunctions and pathologies; the tibial nerve innervates this variant.

The gastrocnemius may present the absence of a head (in particular the lateral one) or be absent or present anomalies not in the number of heads but with respect to the area of origin.
