**Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis**

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts that ultimately progress to end-stage liver disease. It is commonly associated with IBD. Like CFLD, PSC results from prolonged cholestasis and the histological features and radiological features are similar to those seen in the liver of patients withÂ cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease which has been explained by possible interaction between bile acids receptors such as Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and G-protein coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5).

**Secondary Sclerosing Cholangitis**

Secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disorder that is morphologically similar to PSC and is caused by an identified pathological process.

**Drug-induced Liver Injury**

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a concern in these patients as they tend to be on antibiotics frequently for recurrent bacterial sinus infections. Newer treatment agents (ivacaftor and lumacaftor) that directly modulate the CFTR function can cause a mild elevation in serum transaminases.

**Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease**

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in approximately 10% to 20% of the general pediatric population incorporating a wide spectrum of chronic liver disorders ranging from hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) leading to end-stage liver disease.
