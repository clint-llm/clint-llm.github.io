- Complications of alcohol use disorders can be far-reaching and can impact a patient's socioeconomic status, mental health, interpersonal relationships, employment, and physical well-being.

- Early intervention and repeated non-malignant discussions between the patient and provider are important.

- The patient's successes should be noted and resources for continued efforts offered at each visit.

- Discussion regarding barriers to the patient seeking cessation or assistance should occur to find new ways to approach the alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the hope of improving successful cessation of the behaviors.
