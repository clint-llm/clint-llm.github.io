The prognosis depends on the size, depth, extent of the infiltrate, associated complications, the timing of treatment, and follow-up. The patients having early superficial stromal infiltrates not involving the visual axis, if treated promptly with close follow-up, have good visual outcomes. The patients having full thickness infiltrates, corneal perforation, and anterior chamber exudates need early keratoplasty to prevent posterior segment spread of the infection and irreversible sequelae like Phthisis bulbi.

The patients developing endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis, scleritis, choroidal or retinal detachment usually have a guarded prognosis. A good and timely done TPK will help to restore anatomical integrity and early corneal opacification, which can later be managed with optical penetrating keratoplasty for visual restoration.
