Approximately 10% of female breast biopsies will contain an atypical proliferative lesion, with most of these lesions found in women in their 40s.

Atypical hyperplasia can also be found in males undergoing reduction mammoplasty for gynecomastia, although it is exceedingly rare. The reported incidence in one cohort of over 5000 specimens is reported to be less than 1%.
