Some parafunctional movements of the jaw are characterized by protrusion and side-to-side movements of the mandible. Such actions are associated with large jaw-closing muscle activity, necessitating sizeable horizontal force vectors to overcome the frictional resistance between the teeth. The inferior belly of the lateral pterygoid muscle and the superior belly play a vital role in generating these horizontal forces.
