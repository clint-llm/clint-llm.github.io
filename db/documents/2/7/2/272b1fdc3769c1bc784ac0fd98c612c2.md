Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an inflammatory connective tissue disorder characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies, immune complex formation, deposition, and attributed to the loss of immune tolerance. Cutaneous features in lupus constitute one of the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Cutaneous findings in lupus encompass a broad spectrum of findings and may exist with systemic involvement as well as independent of SLE. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of subacute cutaneous lupus, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of subacute cutaneous lupus.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of subacute cutaneous lupus.
- Review the treatment and management options available for subacute cutaneous lupus.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance subacute cutaneous lupus and improve outcomes.
