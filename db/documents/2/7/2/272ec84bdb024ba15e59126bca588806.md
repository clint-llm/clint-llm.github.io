Neurons are responsible for receiving, integrating, and propagating the summation of excitatory and inhibitory electrical potentials from other cells. Neurons are composed of dendrites, bodies, and axons. Dendrites receive information from other neurons and serve a critical role in neuroplasticity. The body of neurons contains the euchromatic nucleus and organelles responsible for the production of proteins and chemicals essential for proper neurotransmission at the synapse. Polyribosomes are clustered and are visible under electron microscopy as Nissl bodies. Axons serve as the conductor and transmitter of information to other individuals or networks of neurons, glands, and muscles. The axonal fibers terminate at the synapse with the electrochemical activation of a complex and diverse quantity of ligand-gated or G-coupled receptors that can vary in accordance to the effector organ.

Let us briefly review the physiology of nerve conduction for completion. At rest, neurons have an intracellular resting membrane potential of -70 mV, which reflects a steady-state concentration of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions intracellularly and extracellularly. This state is maintained through passive and active energy (ATP) expending receptors in the cells. During depolarization, there is an influx of Na+ ions (given higher concentration extracellularly), via partial voltage-gated sodium channels that, once they reach a positive voltage potential, open and lead to a propagating stimulation. At the peak of the action potential, voltage-gated Na+ channels close, and voltage-gated potassium K+ channels open, leading to the exit of ions from inside to outside the cell through a concentration gradient, which leads to the hyperpolarization of cells. A Na+/K+ ATPase in the neurons brings the ion gradient back to baseline (to resting potential) by expending energy to expel 3 Na+ out of the cell for 2 K+ inside the cell. The nerve conduction is coordinated with directionality and propagation of depolarization throughout the entire axon, with ultimate activation or inhibition of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

Unmyelinated fibers conduct in the range of 1 to 5 meters/second. On the other hand, myelinated motor and sensory nerve axons have conduction velocities up to 150 meters/second. This process is called saltatory conduction. Myelin production occurs via Schwann cells, which concentrically wrap around axons. These myelin sheaths have gaps called nodes of Ranvier, where action potentials occur and propagate quickly until encountering the next node. Therefore, current flows passively and jumps from node to node.

During AIDP, the autoimmune target can predict the electrodiagnostic findings, prognosis, and clinical presentation. The most common target is the myelinated sheaths across the axon and within Schwann cells, leading to a decrease in conduction velocity.
