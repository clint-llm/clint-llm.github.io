Patients with pneumothorax typically present with acute onset of shortness of breath and unilateral pleuritic chest pain. The most common abnormal vital sign is tachycardia, but tachypnea and hypoxia may also be present in moderate to severe cases. Unilateral decreased breath sounds are the most common physical finding, but EMS providers may notice significant dyspnea, unilateral chest rise, and jugular venous distension in the most severe cases.

A pneumothorax may develop tension if the one-way entry of air causes enough intrathoracic positive pressure to accumulate, leading to decreased cardiac output and displacement of the heart and great vessels. The clinical features of tension pneumothorax include the previously mentioned characteristics plus signs of hypotension, hypoperfusion, neck vein distension, and tracheal deviation (in the latest stage of the disease).Â This usually occurs when the intrathoracic pressure is greater than 15 to 20 mm Hg.
