Once apremilast treatment is initiated, patients should be monitored for the development of adverse gastrointestinal manifestations (severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting). Dose reduction or treatment interruption should be prompted in the event of severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Patients with an underlying psychiatric history managed with apremilast should be monitored closely and routinely, as treatment may increase the risk of depression and suicidal behaviors. Patients receiving apremilast treatment should also routinely have their weight monitored, as significant weight reductions may occur and require dose reduction or treatment interruption.
