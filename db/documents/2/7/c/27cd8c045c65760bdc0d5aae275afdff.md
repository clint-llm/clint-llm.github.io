Colposcopy with directed biopsy is the preferred method for evaluation of an abnormal pap smear result. "Co-testing" combines cytology and HPV testing for high-risk types, but is still considered screening. The diagnosis ultimately requires tissue sampling.

There are exceptions to this rule:

For women aged 21 to 24 with LGSIL cytology because of the high rate of disease resolution, repeat cytology at 12-month intervals is the recommendation.  This same age-group of women with Pap smear results showing atypical squamous cells-cannot exclude high grade (ASC-H), atypical glandular cells, or HGSIL results on repeat cytology; colposcopy is the recommendation. For follow-up Pap smears showing ASCUS, LGSIL or negative, the recommendation is to repeat in another 12 months. For those patients with repeated ASCUS or LGSIL at 24 months, colposcopy is the next step.

Patients older than 24 years of age with ASCUS with positive high-risk HPV and LGSIL or higher should undergo colposcopy.   Regardless of age, women with HGSIL or ASCUS-H should have a colposcopy. With a diagnosis of CIN II or greater, excisional treatment is the recommendation.  With the subgroup of younger women, close observation with colposcopy may be appropriate if they are compliant with care.
