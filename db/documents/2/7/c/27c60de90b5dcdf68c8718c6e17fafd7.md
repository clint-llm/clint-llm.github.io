Erythema toxicumÂ is a benign self-limited skin disorder that is only seen in neonates. Unfortunately, many worried parents bring the child to the healthcare provider for treatment and undergo unnecessary testing and treatment. When the primary care clinician is unsure about the diagnosis, a dermatology referral is recommended.

The key to this disorder is parent education. The primary care provider, nurse practitioner, pharmacist and healthcare professionals in the emergency department need to reassure the parent that the disorder is harmless and will resolve spontaneously. Parents should be told to avoid unnecessary treatments as this may lead to more harm than good.

The prognosis for most neonates is excellent, with the rash resolving in 10-14 days.
