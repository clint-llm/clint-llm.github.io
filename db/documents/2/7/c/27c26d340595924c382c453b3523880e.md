Afferent renal nerves originate from the renal pelvic area at the highest density, but also the renal cortex. These nerves project to some brain regions, including the subfornical organs, the hypothalamus, and brainstem.

Sympathetic input to the kidney is one of 3 fundamental mechanisms responsible for the renal regulation of blood pressure, the other 2 being baroreceptor response to blood flow, and control of NaCl concentration by macula densa cells.
