Nabothian cysts require no treatment if they are asymptomatic and carry no malignant possibility. Therapy is advocated in symptomatic cases with pain, or when malignancy cannot be excluded. If required, treatment mainly consists of drainage. The main objection to surgical intervention is the risk of scar tissue, which itself may cause pain in the future.

In cases of an obstructed passage of labor, simple drainage is also used to allow normal vaginal delivery. If the diagnosis can't be reached, or in cases of deep cysts or large symptomatic cysts, excision is required to evaluate the histopathology and exclude other cervical tumors and adenoma malignum.
