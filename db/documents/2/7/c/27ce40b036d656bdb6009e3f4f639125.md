Obtaining imaging is essential since the assessment of radiographs is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PRES.

Part of the work-up for PRES also includes evaluation of potential etiologies since their identification will be crucial for management. Obtaining blood work can help evaluate electrolyte imbalances, hypoalbuminemia, protein deficiency, an underlying infection (for example, herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2, which can cause herpes simplex encephalitis), and autoimmune etiologies. Blood work can also help exclude severe hypoglycemia as a potential diagnosis. A lumbar puncture is sometimes done in immunocompromised individuals to assess for encephalitis.

Obtaining an electroencephalogram (EEG) in people with PRES can be helpful. For instance, if there is persistently altered mentation in the absence of tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic movements, an individual may have subclinical seizure activity that can be captured on EEG. EEG patterns, however, are generally non-specific.
