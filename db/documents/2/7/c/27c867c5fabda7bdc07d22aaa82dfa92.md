**Immobilization of Joint Injuries**

It is important to have a systematic process in place that can be relied upon when managing joint injuries. In the setting of dislocations, it is always ideal to have the joint reduced before splint placement; however, if an area of less tension or pain can be achieved and there is intact distal neurovascular function, the best course of action is to immobilize and transport to reduce further injury. One approach that can be used in this way is provided below:

- Take appropriate precautions for body fluid or infection exposure.

- Expose the area of injury by removing clothing and debris from the site.

- Assure the patient is stable. If the patient meets trauma alert criteria, then transport should not be delayed for splinting. Rather, the patient should have their spine immobilized with further splinting being provided en-route or once at the facility providing definitive care.

- Have another member of the treatment team manually stabilize/immobilize the joint to improve comfort during examination and splint application. The team member must hold above and below the joint to provide appropriate joint immobilization.

- Assess distal neurovascular status. Joint injuries may result in damage to the surrounding neurovascular structures; therefore, it is important to perform an exam to evaluate for baseline sensation, range of motion, pulses, strength, skin color, capillary refill, and temperature. If the site distal to the injury is pulseless or cyanotic, make one reduction attempt to improve distal perfusion and regain a distal pulse. After attempting to reduce the injury once, reassess the injury as done above and note any changes. Next, splint the extremity and promptly inform the accepting hospital about the patient's injury. If you encounter resistance to limb alignment during reduction, splint the limb immediately and avoid further manipulation.

- It is important to use an appropriate immobilization device that fits the presenting injury. To ensure appropriate immobilization, the device must be sized properly and designed to provide support above and below the injured joint.

- Next, it is important to stabilize the injured joint while positioning and securing the splint.

- After the splint is placed, always reassess the distal extremity for distal neurovascular status to ensure appropriate splint placement. Compare this exam to the initial exam. If there is a concern for distal neurovascular compromise following splint placement, loosen the splint and reassess distal function.
