After a thorough history and physical examination, imaging of the affected joint is necessary.

**Standard anteroposterior pelvic radiographs:**Several contour lines that should be continuous and smooth helps systematic interpretation. Iliopectineal and ilioischial lines represent anterior and posterior columns of the acetabulum respectively.  Careful assessment of the posterior wall of the acetabulum as posterior wall fracture is the most commonly encountered acetabular fracture pattern in hip dislocation. Shenton's line irregularity occurs in hip dislocation or in the neck of femur fractures without dislocation. Assess if the femoral head fracture is present whether it is above or below fovea capitis. The femoral head appears smaller than the contralateral side.

**Crosstable lateral view:**Identify the direction of dislocation.

**Additional Judet views**(45 degree internal and external oblique views),**inlet and outlet views**: This can be helpful in identifying acetabular fractures.

**Computed tomography CT**:  Post reduction CT is mandatory for all traumatic hip dislocation. It identifies any associated femoral head or acetabular fracture and delineates its extent. Also, it is helpful in finding out any incarcerated bony fragments or loose bodies.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI**:  It is controversial and should not be routinely employed
