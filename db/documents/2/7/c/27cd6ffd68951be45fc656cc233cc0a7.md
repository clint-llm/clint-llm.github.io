When a right aortic arch is identified, it is important to be confident of the branching pattern of the aortic arch to counsel families and patients regarding the propensity to develop symptoms. In general, patients with congenital heart defects would have symptoms as a neonate or infant that would be more concerning than the symptoms associated with a vascular ring. Feeding and swallowing difficulties in children would be more commonly associated with reflux. Respiratory symptoms, which are less common with a right aortic arch, would be common in asthma, croup, or laryngomalacia.
