Multiple factors that can interfere the INR value are listed below:

**Adherence to the VKAs**

VKAs are commonly associated with monitoring, and dose adjustments along with food and drug interactions make the adherence difficult in clinical practice.

**Drug Interactions**

Following are the drugs that cause prolongation of INR:

- Antibiotics: especially cotrimoxazole, macrolides, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones

- Antifungals: azoles (fluconazole)

- Chemotherapeutics: imatinib, Fluorouracil (5-FU)

- Amiodarone

- Allopurinol

- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, sertraline)

Several medications may decrease INR value, for example:

- Antibiotics: Dicloxacillin, nafcillin

- Azathioprine

- Antiepileptics (Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin)

- Saint John's Wort

- Vitamin K

**Comorbidities**

Chronic liver disease may interfere with warfarin dosage, INR value, and coagulation homeostasis. Acute illness such as infections and gastrointestinal illnesses may impact the INR control.
