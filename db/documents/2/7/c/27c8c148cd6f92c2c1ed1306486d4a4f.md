Bleeding is the most common adverse effect associated with prasugrel, and the drug carries a black box warning for potentially fatal bleeding. Increased risk of bleeding may occur in patients with a bodyweight of less than 60 kg, recent trauma, recent surgery, and active bleeding peptic ulcer. Increased risk of bleeding is also seen in renal impairment as it is associated with decreased excretion. There is no antidote available for bleeding caused by prasugrel. If bleeding does occur, theoretically, hemostasis is achievable by a platelet transfusion. However, platelet transfusion within 4 hours of administration of prasugrel may be less effective. If possible, bleeding management should take place without stopping prasugrel, as premature discontinuation of prasugrel is associated with stent thrombosis and increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but serious adverse effect associated with thienopyridine use and usually occurs within two weeks of starting treatment.

Indigestion is the most common gastrointestinal side effect associated with prasugrel. Other adverse effects associated with prasugrel use are headache, dizziness, epistaxis, hematoma, and bruising.

Use of prasugrel with warfarin or NSAIDS, when used chronically, increases the risk of bleeding.
