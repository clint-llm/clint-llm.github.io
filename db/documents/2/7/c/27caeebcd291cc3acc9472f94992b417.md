Although several conditions may mimic asymmetric periflexural exanthem of childhood, they do not share the same unilateral distribution.

A common misdiagnosis for the eruption is contact dermatitis which can be unilateral but more pruritic. The morbilliform form of APEC may mimic the non-specific viral exanthems, the drug-related eruptions, miliaria, atypical pityriasis rosea, Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, superficial fungal infections, scabies, and scarlet fever. Pityriasis rosea is common among schooled children and young adults. APEC is similar to pityriasis rosea in terms of seasonality, duration, and self-limited character. The infectious origin may explain the clinical resemblance between these different conditions.

Miliaria is usually symmetric and develops on the neck and the upper part of the body. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome and APEC develop in the same age group and are both manifested by papular exanthem. However, in the case of Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, the eruption is always symmetric, and accompanied by lymphadenopathy and, in many patients, hepatosplenomegaly.
