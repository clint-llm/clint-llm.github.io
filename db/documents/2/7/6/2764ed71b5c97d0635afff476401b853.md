Since ammonia gas erodes the superficial layers of pulmonary epithelium, this predisposes the patient to the development of super-added bacterial or fungal infection. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) are also common complications.

Chronic inhalation of mild to moderate levels of ammonia may lead to the development of obstructive airway disease.

Following ingestion injury, 83.7% of patients did not develop any long-term complications.
