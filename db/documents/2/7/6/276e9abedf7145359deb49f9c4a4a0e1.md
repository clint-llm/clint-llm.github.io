Patients suspected of having acute LMI should have a prompt evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and measurements of serial cardiac troponins.

**ECG Findings**

- ST-Elevated LMI: ST elevation in lead I, aVL, V5, and V6; Reciprocal ST depression in inferior lead III and aVF

- High lateral STEMI: High lateral STEMI can present as ST-elevation involving lead I and aVL. Subtle ST elevation in V5, V6 and reciprocal changes in lead III and avF may be present. This is usually caused by occlusion of the first diagonal branch of LAD and is sometimes referred to as the South African flag sign.

- 
Old LMI presents with deep and broad Q waves I leads I and aVL

- Inferolateral STEMI presents with ST-elevation involving lateral (I, aVL, V5, V6) and inferior leads (II, III, aVF): This is usually seen with occlusion of the proximal LCx artery.

- Anterolateral STEMI presents with ST-elevation involving lateral (I, aVL, V5, V6) and anterior leads (V1, V2, V3): This is highly indicative of proximal LAD occlusion.

In patients with normal troponin and non-diagnostic ECG, a quick evaluation with an echocardiogram can be done. Echocardiogram has high sensitivity and low specificity when diagnosing MI.
