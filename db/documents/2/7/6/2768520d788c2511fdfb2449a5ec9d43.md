Complications are rare when performing radionuclide cystography (RNC). However, there is always a risk of iatrogenic urinary tract infections when urethral catheterization is performed. A recent study demonstrated a 1% incidence of UTI following a retrograde RNC, which occurred in the setting of pre-existing urologic abnormalities such as VUR or hydronephrosis.
