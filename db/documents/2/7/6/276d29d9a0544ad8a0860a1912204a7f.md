Liver abscesses are not a common condition. They can arrive either from an ischemic episode or by bacteria entering through the portal vein, as mentioned.

Trauma (penetrating or nonpenetrating) can cause bacterial abscesses in both populations (adults and children). Penetration introduces bacteria directly, whereas nonpenetrating events can cause hemorrhage, necrosis, bile leakage, ultimately resulting in abscessÂ formation.

Abscesses are also caused by parasites, malignancy, foreign bodies, or complications from liver transplants.
