Though eplerenone's indications include the treatment of hypertension, its effects on blood pressure likely depend on the population studied.  For example, in the EMPHASIS-HF study, systolic blood pressure decreased by a mean of 2.2 mmHg relative to the placebo group.  In contrast, systolic blood pressure increased in the EPHESUS trial by 3 mmHg relative to the placebo group (presumably), reflecting the improved recovery of cardiac output).

Serum creatinine and potassium require monitoring for all indications, but patients with HF are most vulnerable to hyperkalemia.  To this end, the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure recommends serum potassium, and renal function check occurs on the following schedule after initiation: 3 days, one week, monthly for the first three months of therapy and every three months thereafter. If either of these parameters worsens, hold eplerenone until the potassium is less than 5 mEq/L and consider restarting with a reduced dose after confirming resolution of the metabolic abnormality for at least 72 hours.
