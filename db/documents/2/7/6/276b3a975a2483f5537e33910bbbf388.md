Contraindications to using Dakin solution include hypersensitivity to sodium hypochlorite, chlorine compounds, or any component of the formulation. Concomitant use of taurolidine (an antimicrobial used to prevent infections in catheters) may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of sodium hypochlorite. Specifically, concomitant use of taurolidine and sodium hypochlorite may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis.
