Deaths related to toxicity have increased recently, and a major proportion of the increase derives from an accidental overdose. The patient population is presumed to have a history of substance misuse problems, injecting drug use, and chronic pain. These patterns indicate that, in accidental deaths, there could be evidence of codeine used for supplementing prescribed pain medication, codeine dose escalation, and the development of dependence on codeine. Therefore, there is a need for specialist intervention for a complex patient population.

**Maximum Tolerated Dose**

- Immediate-release preparation: 360 mg per day

- Controlled-release preparation: 600 mg per day

Treatment of toxicity depends on the symptoms and degree of intoxication and involves symptomatic therapy like enema and definitive therapy with opioid antagonist naloxone. If the patient is physically dependent on opioids, administration of opioid antagonists may precipitate acute withdrawal syndrome. Consequently, clinicians should prescribe opioid antagonists with care to patients with physical dependence and smaller than usual doses of the antagonist. (according to manufacturer's labeling).
