The process of offloading iron-bound transferrin begins with transferrin binding to its cell surface transferrin receptor. It starts with the formation of clathrin-coated pits and the internalization of the vesicle into the cytoplasm. The coated vesicle loses its clathrin coat due to a reduction in pH.  The reduction of pH by hydrogen ion proton pumps (H+ ATPase) to a pH of 5.5 causes the dissociation of iron-bound transferrin vesicle to release its iron ions. Also, the binding of transferrin to transferrin receptors reduces its affinity for iron.  Two pathways can occur once endocytosed–degradation or recycling pathways
