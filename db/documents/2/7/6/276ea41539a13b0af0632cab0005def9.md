The prevalence of congenital poikiloderma is unknown, but about 300 cases have been described in the literature, and type 2 Rothmund-Thomson syndrome accounts for almost two-thirds of cases. Given the autosomal recessive inheritance, most reported cases were isolated, but some cases involving more than one person in the same family were also reported. The gender ratio is equal to 1, but a male or female predominance has been noted in some series. Finally, congenital poikiloderma has been reported in all ethnic groups.
