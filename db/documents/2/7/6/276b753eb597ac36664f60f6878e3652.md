The evaluation can include the following diagnostic testings:

**Routine Investigations**

**Electrocardiogram**

There are three key electrocardiographic features of LV aneurysm after acute myocardial infarction, including 1) Tall R wave in lead AvR known as Goldberger's sign. 2) Persistent ST-segment elevation with T wave inversion. 3) Small R waves in the leads of the distribution of the left ventricular wall. Other EKG findings can include ventricular arrhythmias that can be complications of LV aneurysm.

**Chest Radiograph**

In an anteroposterior or slightly oblique view of chest x-ray, a ventricular aneurysm forms a well-circumscribed opacity projecting beyond the regular cardiac outline. In contrast, in the lateral view, it forms a rounded or oval shadow, partially or entirely superimposed upon that of the heart.

**Computed Tomography**

CT scan is another reliable imaging modality for LV aneurysms. Cardiac CT can give a better view of the aneurysm wall and the presence of mural thrombus at the cost of risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). However, CIN can be prevented by prior hydration before giving contrast. In patients with ischemic heart disease, assessing LV segmental dysfunction in the form of wall-thinning and reduced wall motion is possible with electron-beam CT (EBCT).

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

The use of MRI as a noninvasive modality for identifying LV aneurysms and assessing resectability makes it a reliable test. For this purpose, dark-blood imaging may be employed to define the anatomy. It helps in delineating the bulging of the aneurysm. The blood pool motion in the aneurysm is characterized by dynamic bright-blood imaging.

**Echocardiography**

Two-dimensional echocardiography aids in a clear demonstration of a ventricular aneurysm. It may also help differentiate between a true and false type aneurysm by depicting a narrow neck compared to the size of the cavity. Color-flow echocardiographic imaging may identify abnormal flow within the aneurysm. This information may help identify a thrombus. A pulsed Doppler imaging can reveal an oscillatory to and fro motion of aneurysm that changes its variation with inspiration and expiration. Calculating LV systolic function and LV volume is possible with 3-D tomographic echocardiography. An echocardiogram showing a left ventricular aneurysm is seen in figure 1.

**Nuclear Imaging**

Radionuclide ventriculography may demonstrate a ventricular aneurysm.

**Angiography**

Left ventriculography has become the "gold standard" and most accurate test for diagnosing and localizing the left ventricular aneurysm site. It demonstrates a large, discrete area of dyskinesia (or akinesia), generally in the anteroseptal-apical walls. Occasionally, left ventriculography also may demonstrate mural thrombus. A quantitative definition of left ventricular aneurysms has been accomplished using a centerline analysis of left ventricular wall motion on left ventriculography in the 30-degree right anterior oblique view. It defines the aneurysm as a hypocontractile segment contracting more than two standard deviations out of the normal range. The outer portion of the aneurysm is termed dyskinetic, and the remaining portion is akinetic. The fraction of the total left ventricular circumference occurring as an aneurysm is calculated as the value percent.
