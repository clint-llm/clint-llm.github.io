Acinetobacter is a gram-negative, aerobic, non-fermentative, oxidase negative, and nonmotile organism.

In general, Acinetobacter has low virulence but is capable of causing infection in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients. Most of the infections are a result of nosocomial spread and colonization rather than de novo infections. Thus, great care is required when acinetobacter is isolated - whether it is an actual infection or just colonization. Risk factors for Acinetobacter infection include:

- Prolonged stay in the intensive care unit

- Prolonged antibiotic exposure

- Mechanical ventilation

- Use of a central venous catheter

- Hemodialysis.

Most acinetobacter infections are group outbreaks, and isolated cases are rare. Infections may complicate intravenous (IV) catheter treatment, mechanical ventilation, and even peritoneal dialysis. In most cases, the presence of Acinetobacter in respiratory secretions of ventilated patients represents colonization.
