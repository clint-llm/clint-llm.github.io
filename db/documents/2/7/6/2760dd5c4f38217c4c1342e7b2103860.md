Patients on budesonide therapy must be monitored by symptoms and signs and PFTs (pulmonary function tests) to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and titrate the dose. As the liver mainly metabolizes budesonide, impairment of hepatocyte function may cause accumulation of the budesonide in the blood. Therefore, patients with diseases of the liver need close monitoring.

Patients taking loop diuretics, thiazide, and thiazide-like diuretics while on budesonide may have an increased risk of developing hypokalemia beyond what is typical of using these medications. Patients require close monitoring and follow-up to detect other adverse events, as described in budesonide adverse reactions.
