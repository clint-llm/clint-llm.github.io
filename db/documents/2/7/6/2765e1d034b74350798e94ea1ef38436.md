In the majority of cases, fibroadenomas need no treatment. They shrink and disappear over time, but if their size is large and they are compressing other breast tissues, they should be removed.

Many females decide against the surgery because the lesions are harmless and involve no long-term risk of malignancy. Surgery also distorts the shape of a breast.

**Surgery**

Doctors might decide to remove fibroadenoma if it is massive and continues to increase in size.

Indications for surgical intervention include rapid growth, size greater than 2 cm, and patient request.

There are 2 surgical procedures used to remove a fibroadenoma:

- Lumpectomy or excisional biopsy: In this procedure, the surgeon removes the fibroadenoma and sends it to the laboratory for further evaluation.

- Cryoablation: Surgeons use a cryoprobe to freeze and destroy the cellular structure of fibroadenoma. A core needle biopsy must be performed before cryoablation to confirm the fibroadenoma.
