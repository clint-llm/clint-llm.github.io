This activity reviews the identification, evaluation, and management of congenital toxoplasmosis and explains the role of the an interprofessional team in managing and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for acquiring congenital toxoplasmosis and understand its pathophysiology.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with congenital toxoplasmosis. 
-  Summarize the risks and benefits associated with the anti-parasitic regimen and summarize key patient counseling points.

- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst an interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by congenital toxoplasmosis.
