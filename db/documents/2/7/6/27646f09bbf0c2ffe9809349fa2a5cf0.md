Hemoglobin H disease (alpha-thalassemia) can be found in patients that live in areas with a high incidence of malaria. Symptoms at presentation, such as episodic anemia, and appropriate diagnostic testing, such as hematology studies and electrophoresis, are essential to timely and proper treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hemoglobin H disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of alpha-thalassemia.
- Explain the typical history and physical examinations in patients with alpha-thalassemia.
- Outline management options for patients with alpha-thalassemia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with alpha-thalassemia.
