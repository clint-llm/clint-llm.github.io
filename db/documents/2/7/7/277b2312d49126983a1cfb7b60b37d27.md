The diagnosis of a diaphragmatic rupture is not easy, especially when the tear is small. Hence, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, general surgeon, thoracic surgeon, and a trauma surgeon.Â  Nurses who look after patients with penetrating or blunt trauma should be aware of missed diaphragmatic injuries. Difficulties in breathing, bowel sounds in the chest and an abnormal chest x-ray should be a concern and reported to the surgeon.

Once diagnosed, the only treatment for a diaphragmatic tear is surgery. The surgery may be approached via the abdomen or thorax. Nurses should ensure that these patients have DVT and pressure sore prophylaxis. If a chest tube has been left in after surgery, it should be monitored for air and fluid leaks. Open communication between the team members is vital for good outcomes.

In most cases, if there are no other injuries, the outcomes are excellent. However, if the diagnosis is missed, it can present later with herniation of bowel contents in the chest.
