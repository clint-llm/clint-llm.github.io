The pathogenesis of pituitary adenoma remains unknown. Most of the pituitary adenomas are sporadic. In a study from Iceland with 410 pituitary adenomas, 43% were non-functioning adenomas, 40% prolactin-secreting adenomas, 11 % growth hormone (GH) secreting adenomas, and 6% Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreting adenomas. Genetic mutation is rarely a feature of pituitary adenoma.[

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1): MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of function mutation in this gene leads to tumor formation in the parathyroid, pancreatic, and pituitary glands.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4): MEN 4 has a mutation in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 B gene (CDKN1B) presenting with pituitary tumors, hyperparathyroidism, testicular, and cervical neuroendocrine tumors.

Carney complex (CNC): In the Carney complex, there is a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene PRKAR1A leading to primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), testicular tumors, thyroid nodules, spotty skin hyperpigmentation, and acromegaly.

Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA): Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) mutation is reported in adolescence or early adulthood in about 15%of all FIPA. These tumors are usually aggressive and they most commonly secrete growth hormone causing acromegaly.
