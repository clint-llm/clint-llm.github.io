Enhancing healthcare outcomes for patients with cardiorenal syndrome requires close follow-up after hospital discharge and tracking of the patient’s weight, symptoms, and laboratory data. This requires an interprofessional team of clinical providers, nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists to achieve the best outcomes possible. The pharmacist is needed to ensure patient education on timely medication administration as well as avoiding medications that can adversely affect the disease. A key role of the pharmacists lies in communicating with the providers to ensure the patient is not started on any medications that will result in poor outcomes. The specialized nurse and PA are needed for frequent follow up with the patient to ensure his or her weight is adequately maintained and that the patient is adhering to the various diet and activity restrictions along with the medications prescribed. The primary clinical provider, along with the cardiac and nephrology specialist needs to work in conjunction to ensure optimal management of the disease and to achieve the best outcomes possible. Cardiorenal syndrome requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, physician assistants, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
