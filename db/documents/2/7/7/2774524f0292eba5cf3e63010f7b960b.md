Immunohistochemical staining of the urinary bladder is used to identify different cell types and malignant lesions. For instance, the umbrella-shaped cells in the apical layer of urothelium express CK20, and the cuboidal cells of basal cells are CD44+. However, in carcinoma in situ, all cell types express CK20 and p53 and show a greater Ki-67 proliferation index.
