Advanced POAG may cause optic atrophy and no perception of light, though most OAG patientsÂ will not lose vision in their lifetime. Risk factors for progression of OAG include

- Old age

- Elevated IOP

- Increased cup to disc ratio or small optic rim area

- Beta peripapillary atrophy

- Disc hemorrhage

- Thin central corneal thickness

- Reduced corneal hysteresis

- Low ocular perfusion pressure

- Poor compliance to therapy

- Pseudoexfoliation

In 10 years, the cumulative probability of end-stage glaucoma in at least one eye in untreated cases was 35% in a study.
