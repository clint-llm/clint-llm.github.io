Bed bugs are attracted by carbon dioxide and the body heat of the host.  They come in contact with the host by walking (not flying or jumping) from the crevices of material they hide in when not feeding. While humans are the preferred hosts, bed bugs can and will feed on other warm-blooded animals.  In the United States, C. lectularius can infest poultry sheds and decrease egg production. Bed bugs tend not to live on the human body. They only contact humans for a blood meal every few days if a sleeping host is available. Blood feeding typically occurs when hosts are sleeping deeply between 01:00 and 05:00 AM.  Bedbugs release aggregation pheromones, and they stay in close contact during the day while inactively sheltering in material and digesting the blood meal. The aggregation pheromones help bed bugs relocate their sanctuary after they complete a blood meal. If hosts are continually available, the female C. lectularius bed bug will lay 5 to 8 eggs per week for 18 weeks at 23°C, and at 90% relative humidity, the length of the life cycle is variable and dependent on ambient temperatures. Humans are most commonly bitten while sleeping in infested beds. Other furniture and furnishings in the same room can harbor bed bugs, and bed bugs can infest many areas that humans use.
