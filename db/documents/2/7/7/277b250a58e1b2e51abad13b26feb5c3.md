Several varieties of steroids are available for use on the market today, including methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone, betamethasone acetate with betamethasone sodium phosphate, and dexamethasone sodium phosphate, each of which offers their strengths and weakness. The most commonly used steroids in the United States include methylprednisolone, triamcinolone hexacetonide, triamcinolone acetonide, and betamethasone.

Of note, the equivalent potency of betamethasone and dexamethasone sodium phosphate is approximately five times that of the others. Solubility also varies between the steroid formulations. For example, the acetate portion of betamethasone is insoluble, while the sodium phosphate portion of betamethasone and dexamethasone sodium phosphate is freely water-soluble. Particle size varies from 0.5 micrometers dexamethasone to over 500 micrometers methylprednisolone acetate, and triamcinolone has extensive particle aggregation, which requires meticulous mixing of the solution before injection.

Dosage varies based on the chosen steroid and location treated with small joints (metacarpophalangeal, facet, acromioclavicular), medium-sized joints (elbow, wrist), and larger joints (knee, shoulder, hip, ankle) receiving respectively increased amounts of steroid. For example, while a large joint might require 40 to 80mg of methylprednisolone acetate, that same joint would only require 8 to 15 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Similarly, a small joint might require 4 to 10 mg of methylprednisolone acetate, while that same joint would only require 0.8 to 2 mg of dexamethasone sodium phosphate. Some examples of steroid mixtures used for biceps tendon sheath injection at our institution include 3.75 mg dexamethasone mixed with 2 ml 1% lidocaine or 1ml betamethasone (6 mg/ml) mixed with 2 ml 1% lidocaine.

Before injecting the steroid, a local anesthetic is provided to the skin and superficial soft tissues using 1% lidocaine. Although around 5 to 7 mL is the typical amount for local anesthesia, it bears mentioning that the maximum safe dosage for lidocaine in the United States is 300 mg, which equates to 30 mL of 1% lidocaine.
