The most common side effects of prostaglandin E2 concern its impact on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. The suppository correlates with the most severe side effects, with two-thirds of patients experiencing vomiting, two-fifths experiencing diarrhea, and one-third experiencing nausea. Other adverse effects include temperature elevation in half of the patients, headache in one-tenth, and shivering and chills in one-tenth. Anti-emetics and anti-diarrheal medications may be necessary before and during the drug administration to counteract these side effects.

The insert and gel have a less than one percent incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms. However, studies have shown that they have links to a higher chance of uterine hyperstimulation with and without fetal distress (greater than 2%) versus placebo (under1%). Additionally, they also have an increased chance of fetal distress without uterine hyperstimulation (over 2%) versus placebo (1%). There were also associated fetal heart rate changes, with and without distress. In all of these cases, removal of the product resulted in a return to normal, though one case did require treatment with tocolytics.
