A thorough history and complete physical exam are necessary when evaluating a patient with numerous seborrheic keratosis. Clinically, seborrheic keratoses have a dull, waxy, verrucous surface resulting in their characteristic “stuck on” appearance. The color of these lesions can vary from light to dark brown, yellow, and grey, and they can present as an isolated lesion to tens or even hundreds of lesions. These tumors can generally occur anywhere on the body, except for the palms, soles, and mucous membranes. Depending on the lesion location, there can be chronic inflammation, which leads to pain, pruritus, erythema, and bleeding around the site. Generally, seborrheic keratosis is benign and slow-growing lesions, however, there should be a concern if there is sudden growth or emergence of multiple seborrheic keratoses. The sign of Leser-Trelat refers to the sudden appearance of seborrheic keratosis that is suggestive of internal malignancy, commonly associated with gastrointestinal or pulmonary carcinomas.
