Our main aim is to give good vision and optimal binocular vision to the patients. For children with refractive error only, proper refractive correction is indicated. If amblyopia development is suspected, orthoptic exercises and patching of eyes are used. Good interdepartmental coordination is necessary for regular followups and proper rehabilitation.

The development of the visual system is often affected by strabismus and amblyopia, which needs cycloplegic refraction and followups. After proper preparation and counseling, it can be corrected with refractive surgery. Adult with hyperopia needs refractive support along with complication evaluation by gonioscopy and fundoscopy.
