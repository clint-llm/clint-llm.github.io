Pityriasis alba is most common in children aged three to 16 years, with 90% of cases occurring in children younger than 12 years. An estimated 5% of children in the United States may be affected. Studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence in Egypt (18%) and Mali (20%). Pityriasis alba is more common in patients with a history of atopy, and a slight male predominance has been noted. There is no clear racial predominance, although the lesions may be more noticeable in those with darker skin types. Pityriasis alba is not seasonal, although scaling may be worse in the winter (as a result of dry air in homes), and lesions may be more obvious in the spring and summer (as a result of sun exposure and darkening of the surrounding skin). Normal skin pigmentation returns spontaneously, usually within one year.
