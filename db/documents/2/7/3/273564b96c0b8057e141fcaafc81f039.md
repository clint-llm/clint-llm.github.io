The histologic hallmark of LMDF is a granulomatous infiltrate, in some cases centered around hair follicle structures. Both sarcoidal (non-caseating) and tuberculoid (with central caseation necrosis) granulomas have been observed, as have diffuse infiltrates of lymphocytes and histiocytes without well-formed granulomas. The latter may be characteristic of early lesions, and may also demonstrate a peri-adnexal pattern. Accompanying neutrophils with or without neutrophilic microabscesses have been variably observed. Fibrosis is seen in late lesions, correlating with clinical scar formation. There is significant histologic overlap with granulomatous rosacea and other granulomatous disorders affecting the face.
