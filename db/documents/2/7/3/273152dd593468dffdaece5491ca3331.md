Hair loss represents a distressing issue affecting a large portion of the population, including up to 85% of males and 40% of females, and its incidence increases with age for both sexes.Â Though many causes of hair loss exist, by far the most common etiology is androgenic alopecia (AGA), an androgen-sensitive pattern of hair loss that affects both men and women.
