Any surgical procedure involving the thoracic cavity or abdomen requires attention to the location, condition, and orientation of the inferior vena cava in relation to other structures and organs.  Anatomic variants of the IVC are not common, but awareness of their presence and associated diseases/other common co-existing anomalies is important. Unmitigated injury to the IVC, either iatrogenic or resultant of trauma, results in rapid exsanguination. The principles of repair for injury to the IVC is similar to other vessel injuries. Although there are varying techniques depending on the location of the injury and the experience of the surgeon the primary objective is proximal and distal control of the IVC followed by some type of repair. In a life-threatening situation, IVC ligation has been successfully undertaken. This is a last resort procedure and comes with significant morbidity if the patient survives.
