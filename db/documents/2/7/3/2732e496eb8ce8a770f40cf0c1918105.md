Diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is made with a skin biopsy, preferably an incisional or excisional biopsy. A full history and physical exam, including lymph node examination, should be completed. Some sources suggest obtaining chest imaging to evaluate for any metastatic disease before treatment, though this is not currently a general recommendation. A preoperative MRI, though not necessary, is sometimes performed to help define tumor extension before surgery.
