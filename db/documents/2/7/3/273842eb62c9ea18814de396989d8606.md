Serum calcium should be monitored every 4 hours during intermittent infusion or every 1 to 4 hours during continuous infusion. If administering calcium is due to hyperkalemia with EKG changes, monitor the EKG to observe changes. During the treatment of calcium channel blocker overdose and beta-blocker overdose, serum ionized calcium should be monitored every 30 minutes until hemodynamically stable and then every 2 hours. In treating CCB overdose, the recommendation is to maintain calcium levels two times the upper limit of normal.
