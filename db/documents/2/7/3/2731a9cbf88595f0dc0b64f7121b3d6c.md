Multiple tests are available to detect ciguatoxin, including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), cytotoxicity assays, and receptor binding immunoassays. These tests are not readily available at the time of patient presentation in the emergency department. Routine laboratory testing is often non-specific and rarely helpful. Treatment is based on clinical findings, including history and physical examination, as well as disease progression.
