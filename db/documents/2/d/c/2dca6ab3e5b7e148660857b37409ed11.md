**1. Post-Cardiac Surgery:**A randomized control trial of post-operative weaning of patients after planned and uncomplicated non-fast-track coronary artery bypass graft, weaning with ASV was found to take a similar time to tracheal extubation compared to that of standard weaning â€“ SIMV and PS.

**2. ASV for Weaning:**Patients with chronic respiratory illnesses requiring ventilation can be placed on ASV mode. It has shown benefits as of lesser costs and requirement of respiratory therapists and intensive care personnel.

**3. Lung Protective Strategy:**ASV provides a better patient-ventilator interaction and lowers WOB compared to SIMV.

**4. Acute Exacerbation of COPD:**Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) compared to invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) decreases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, sinusitis and hence reduces the rate of hospitalization and mortality.

**5. Pediatric Conditions:**Proper studies and literature are inadequate for advocating the use of ASV in children. However, there have been reports of positive outcomes from case reports and small observational studies.
