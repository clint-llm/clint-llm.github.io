Granulomatous hepatitis refers to the presence of granulomas in the liver. Liver granulomas are common and are the result of an inflammatory reaction to numerous noxious stimuli. Patients should be educated that they may be asymptomatic incidental findings or found to be associated with an underlying systemic process. Granulomas may regress with appropriate treatment or persist for years and may still be asymptomatic, so patients should follow up regularly.
