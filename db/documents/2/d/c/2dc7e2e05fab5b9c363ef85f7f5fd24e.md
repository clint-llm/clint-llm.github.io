The sacrum is integral in providing a foundation of support for the body and gait mechanics.

Osteopathic manipulative treatment is a useful tool in correcting somatic dysfunctions to optimize the biomechanics of the sacrum as well as improve the autonomic outflow from the sacral nerves. OMT is a safe, effective, and efficient treatment option for patients with sacral dysfunctions.

From a neurological point of view, the diaphragm muscle connects to the tongue and pelvic floor. Dysfunction of these anatomical areas could create further dysfunctions, not only at the level of the symptom. It would be more appropriate, after finishing the articulatory technique on the sacral bone, to also check the districts such as tongue and diaphragm muscle; if the most important dysfunction is the sacral area, the other districts should improve independently.

Working the sacral area has an autonomic systemic aspect, as the anatomical area is rich in sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways; balancing a somatic sacral tension, could help rebalance the vegetative neurological function.

It is possible to work on the sacral bone to resolve or relieve cranial symptoms when it is not possible to place the hands on the area of the dysfunctioning skull.
