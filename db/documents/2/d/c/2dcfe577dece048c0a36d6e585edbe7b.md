Relevant concerns surrounding the PDMA include the issue of drug affordability and the presence of loopholes seeking to circumvent the PDMA. Rising drug prices and lack of affordability for the uninsured have fueled the debate surrounding drug importation as foreign countries offer drugs at lower prices.

Seeking more affordable options, patients may resort to underusing their prescriptions to conserve medication supply. Government surveys have reflected such measures revealing cost-related underuse rates ranging from 1.6% to 5.3% among Medicare populations and 11.2% to 17.6% in Medicaid recipients.

Although the policy was initially intended for US patients with limited treatment options, citizens have relied on the policy to purchase prescription drugs at a fraction of the price.
