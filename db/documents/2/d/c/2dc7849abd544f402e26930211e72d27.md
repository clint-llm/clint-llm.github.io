Laboratory studies may show an increased level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin that is highly sensitive and nonspecific for venous thrombosis. Elevated levels of D-dimer present in malignancy, sepsis, recent surgery or trauma, pregnancy which often coexist with internal jugular vein thrombosis. Compression ultrasonography with Doppler is the test of choice for diagnosis with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 93%.
