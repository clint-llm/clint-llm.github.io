The first step in diagnosing hypercalcemia is to confirm elevated calcium levels by repeating the test. It is also essential to correct measured total serum calcium with albumin levels [conditions leading to low protein, e.g., nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, and protein-losing enteropathies, can lead to low albumin levels, and therefore low laboratory-reported total serum levels]. It is also essential to differentiate between true hypercalcemia and pseudo hypercalcemia by obtaining ionized calcium levels and corrected calcium levels [for albumin]. However, it is prudent to initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation in severe hypercalcemia cases while awaiting repeat calcium measurements.

Clinically, most cases of hypercalcemia are secondary to hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia of malignancy.

After confirming the diagnosis of hypercalcemia, the next step is to differentiate between PTH-dependent and PTH-independent hypercalcemia, which can be achieved by measuring both PTH and PTHrP levels. In the case of malignancy-related hypercalcemia, PTH levels will be low or normal. Hypercalcemia with concurrent mid-to-upper normal or high PTH levels should suggest primary hyperparathyroidism.

Further evaluation should include a thorough medication list to review, and medications implicated in raising calcium levels should be discontinued. These can be restarted later if they are confirmed not to be the etiology for hypercalcemia. Diagnosing hypercalcemia in Neonates and infants who are also found to have dysmorphic features warrants quick evaluation for Williams or Murk Jansen syndrome.

EKG features of hypercalcemia often include PR interval and QRS prolongation, ST elevation, T wave inversion, and a J wave. It is crucial to perform imaging studies to evaluate for possible malignancies. Surgical exploration of the neck should be performed in all resistant hypercalcemia cases, especially when other localizing investigations have proven futile and the etiology remains uncertain.
