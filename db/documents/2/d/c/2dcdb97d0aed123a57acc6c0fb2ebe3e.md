Back pain is a common presenting symptom in patients, and in general, conservative treatment, including physical therapy and anti-inflammatory and/or muscle relaxant medications, is enough to mitigate pain. However, the most important thing in this intervention is to reveal the etiology that causes back pain and to treat this cause.

Generalized back pain is a common presenting symptom for patients with spinal diseases. The underlying etiology of the pain most commonly is from skeletal muscle strain. It may be caused by herniation of a vertebral disc or spinal disease. The differential for back pain is vast, and lumbar disc issues, including herniation or rupture, and vertebral fractures, all merit consideration.

**Persistent pain following spine surgery**

The terminological approach, which entered the literature in the 1970s as "post-laminectomy syndrome" and "failed back surgery syndrome" (FBSS), was revised as "chronic pain after spinal surgery" (CPSS) in ICD-11 in 2019. This term describes pain that does not subside or even worsens following spine surgery.

**Spina bifida**

Spina bifida is a congenital condition seen on the back when there is incomplete closure of the vertebral column. There are three different subcategories of the condition.

- Spina bifida occulta results from the incomplete fusion of the vertebral arch. The patients are usually asymptomatic, and the only clinical index of suspicion may be a small tuft of hair overlying the defect.

- Spina bifida cystica with meningocele occurs when the bony vertebral arch fails to form and there is a herniation of the spinal meninges.

- Spina bifida cystica with meningomyelocele is the most severe and involves herniation of the meninges and the spinal cord.
