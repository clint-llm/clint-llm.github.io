Enlarged Ostium Secundum - If the ostium secundum is significantly large, the septum secundum may not be able to cover the ostium secundum completely. This morphological variant will allow a persistent opening between the right and left atrium. This abnormality is the most common form of an atrial septal defect.

Unsealed Ostium Primum - If the septum primum does not completely connect with the dorsal and ventral endocardial cushions and cover the ostium primum, holes in the ostium primum will persist. This variant will allow fluid to pass between left and right atria, which results in a different etiology of another atrial septal defect called ostium primum or endocardial cushion defect.

Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) - This is the commonest congenital defect. In certain instances, the septum primum and the septum secundum may not fuse during infantile development, causing a persistent foramen ovale. Most of the time, this opening between atria is asymptomatic as the higher left atrial pressure will push the septum primum up against the septum secundum, reproducing the effects of the heart as if a fossa ovalis were present. However, a patent foramen ovale can lead to right-to-left shunting if the right atrial pressure becomes higher than the left atria, such as during the Valsalva maneuver, which may cause a stroke via a paradoxical embolus.

Individuals who have an atrial septal defect arising from an unclosed ostium primum have increased incidences of Down syndrome.
