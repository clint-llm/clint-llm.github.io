Spironolactone has indications in both certain cardiovascular diseases and non-cardiovascular disease entities. Spironolactone is FDA approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), resistant hypertension, primary hyperaldosteronism, edema secondary to cirrhosis, edema secondary to a nephrotic syndrome that is not adequately controlled using alternative therapies, and hypokalemia. The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) was a landmark trial that used spironolactone in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV HFrEF patients with an ejection fraction less than 35%, and the trial was stopped early due to but not limited to positive findings including a 30% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality.

Off-label, non-FDA approved indications include the treatment of acne vulgaris and hirsutism.Â Spironolactone has off label use as an alternative agent used to treat acne vulgaris in adult females with persistent and/or late-onset acne.
