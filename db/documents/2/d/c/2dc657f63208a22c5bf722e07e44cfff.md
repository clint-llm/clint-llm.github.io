The main differential for an acute, life-threatening asthma attack is an anaphylactic reaction. In this case, the patient may also present with orofacial swelling, a rash, and itching. The patient will partially respond to salbutamol and steroids, but intramuscular adrenaline is the lifesaving medication needed to manage these patients.

Other differentials include vocal cord dysfunction, tracheal or bronchial obstruction due to foreign body or tumor, heart failure, gastroesophageal reflux, chronic sinusitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
