Barbiturates are a group of sedative-hypnotic medications used for treating seizure disorder, neonatal withdrawal, insomnia, preoperative anxiety, and induction of coma for increased intracranial pressure. They are also useful for inducing anesthesia. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, and toxicology of phenobarbital, methohexital, butalbital, pentobarbital, primidone, and amobarbital. It also outlines the important monitoring parameters of the broad array of physiological possibilities when using barbiturates in the clinical setting and essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients when using barbiturates.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the barbiturate class of drugs.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for barbiturates.
- Review the adverse events of barbiturates.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with barbiturates, leading to optimal patient outcomes and minimizing adverse events.
