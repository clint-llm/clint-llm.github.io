CD31 is a platelet endothelial adhesion molecule that is used in immunofluorescence to identify endothelial cells on microscopy. This process is crucial in evaluating the degree of tumor angiogenesis, which may reflect the rapidity of growth. CD31 is also used to identify angiomas and angiosarcomas, two blood vessel tumors that maintain the adhesion molecule.
