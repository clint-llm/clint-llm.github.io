Evidence-based medicine provides a framework for applying the relevant scientific evidence to the patient's condition based on the patient's values using the clinician's clinical judgment to tailor the treatment for the patient. The goal of evidence-based medicine is to improve medical outcomes based on the highest quality evidence available. After the intervention is implemented, the outcome should be re-evaluated in the context of the clinical question to see what effect occurred. It can also be applied to a population to generate recommendations for the population-based on current medical evidence. Population recommendations are typically graded based on the underlying science behind the guidelines. Various grading schemes exist. These schemes rank recommendations from strong evidence (to support the guidelines) to poor or no evidence (to support the guideline with varying support levels in between).
