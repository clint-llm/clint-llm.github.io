Many H1R antihistaminergic drugs have seen widespread use for the treatment of several allergic diseases, such as urticaria, allergic rhinitis, and hay fever. The side effects of the first generation of antihistamines have led to the development of the second generation of antihistamines that lack sedation. These drugs can block the activation of H1 receptors and stimulate sensory neurons as well as vascular permeability, which thus prevents symptoms of associated allergic conditions. The advent of H2R antihistamines has been linked with a decrease in duodenal ulcers and have been key until the discovery of proton pump inhibitors. This class of drugs blocks the actions of histamine at the H2 receptor sites in the parietal cells of the stomach, thereby decreasing the production of gastric acid. H2 antihistamines have been therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of conditions such as peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and dyspepsia. Some common H2R antihistamines include cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine.
