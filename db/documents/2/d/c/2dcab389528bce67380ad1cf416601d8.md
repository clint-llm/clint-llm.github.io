An ultrasound machine with a high-frequency linear probe is necessary to complete a USGIV.  It is essential to use the high-frequency probe to visualize the superficial vessels cannulated during the procedure adequately.

Vessels cannulated with ultrasound guidance will generally be deeper than those cannulated through landmark-based technique. Therefore, it is necessary to use a longer catheter.  Multiple different catheter gauges and lengths are appropriate for ultrasound guidance, but it is critical to use a catheter long enough. When cannulating the basilic and brachial vessels in an adult patient, it is advisable to use a catheter that is at least 2.5 inches long.

Additional equipment needed to start a USGIV include a probe cover, sterile ultrasound gel, and a towel to wipe the gel. Sterile ultrasound probe covers are available, however clear adhesive film used to secure IVs can also function as a probe cover. Other equipment needed for a basic IV will also be required for USGIVs. These may include a tourniquet, extension tubing, IV cap, and a device to secure the IV.
