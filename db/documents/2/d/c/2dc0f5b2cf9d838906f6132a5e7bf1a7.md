Dermatophytes are keratinophilic fungi that cause superficial and deep infections of the keratinized tissues. The dryness of the skinâ€™s outer layer, shedding of the outer layers of the dead skin, and the innate peptides and medium chain-fatty acids secreted on to the skin generally prevent the colonization of the microorganisms.****However, certain factors like age, immune status, steroid use, diabetes mellitus, trauma, and occupational exposures increase the likelihood of dermatophyte infections.

Dermatophytes, along with the inflammatory response by the host to the pathogen combined, are responsible for the pathology.

The infection process begins with the inoculation of the arthroconidium (spores) to the keratinized tissue. Once inoculated, the carbohydrate microfibrils present on the fungal spores anchor to the keratinocytes. Once anchored, the spores germinate and produce hyphae, which spread centrifugally into the deeper layers of the stratum corneum.

Invading fungal hyphae produce keratinases, proteases, elastases, and other pathogenic factors into the stratum corneum. These enzymes help in digestion and utilization of the keratin and other proteins needed for the survival and growth of the dermatophytes.
