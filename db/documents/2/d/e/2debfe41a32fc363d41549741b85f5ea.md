Primary omental tumors are sporadic tumors. These tumors are either asymptomatic or signs and symptoms of presentation are nonspecific, which only appears late due to the tumor's mass effect. Imaging modalities like CT scans, largely diagnose them. To treat such tumors and improve the outcomes, more research is needed to know about the etiology, progression, and best treatment options in such tumors. Although surgeons are the main caregiver in managing these patients, radiologists play a vital part in diagnosing patients with these rare tumors. Other health professional staff involved are providers dealing with patients' comorbid conditions if present, nurses, paramedics, and rehabilitation, and social workers who help patients in the post-op period.
