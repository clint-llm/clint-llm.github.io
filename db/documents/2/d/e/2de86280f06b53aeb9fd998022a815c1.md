The group of diseases referred to as the porphyrias are metabolic disorders- they are caused by an abnormality in the function of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of heme. The anomaly usually manifests as an alteration in the activity (increased or decreased) of the enzyme, and most of the porphyrias have a genetic mutation that is responsible for the dysfunction. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the lone exception, as it can develop in the absence of a gene mutation and is, in fact, most often caused by an acquired inhibitor (around 2/3 of cases).

The clinical presentation of the different porphyrias depends on the noxious metabolites that accumulate, their sites of accumulation, and the method by which those metabolites get excreted. Depending on the solubility of the compoundsÂ in different cellular components, they may accumulate in different areas of the body and be excreted by the liver (in bile and feces) or by the kidneys (in urine). This excretion is useful as levels of specific porphyrins can be measured in urine and feces to aid in the diagnosis. Also, certain symptoms such as cutaneous blistering or neurovisceral manifestations (abdominal pain, vomiting, weakness, psychiatric changes) are typically seen in certain porphyrias depending on the accumulation of porphyrins in specific areas such as the skin or nervous system. Knowledge of this can be used to help aid in forming the differential diagnosis of a patient with suspected porphyria.
