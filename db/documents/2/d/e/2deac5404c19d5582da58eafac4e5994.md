Cirrhosis is a significant step in viral carcinogenesis for hepatocellular carcinoma. Integration of the hepatitis B virus genome into the host genome is the primary pathogenesis for oncogenesis in HBV. Insertion of viral genome in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT ) promoter sites of the human genome resulting in mutation accounting for 60% of HCC cases.

Chronic inflammation in chronic hepatitis C virus infection with subsequent fibrosis, necrosis, and regeneration contributes to HCC development. Molecular markers noted in liver carcinogenesis include viral structural and non-structural proteins (NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B).

HCV-associated HCC mostly occurs in patients with cirrhosis or advanced stages of fibrosis.
