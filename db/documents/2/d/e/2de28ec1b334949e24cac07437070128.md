In the vast majority of patients, the reactions from bedbug bites form as a result of an immunologic response to the proteins found in bedbug saliva. The numerous proteins in the bedbug saliva play multiple roles, including prevention of clot formation in the host, inhibition of platelet aggregation, vasodilation, and some may act as antimicrobial agents. During feeding, bed bugs inject saliva through needle-like stylets inserted into the skin for feeding and withdrawn after feeding.  C. lectularius injects nitrophorin (a vasodilator), apyrase  (a platelet-activation and aggregation inhibitor), and a factor X inhibitor.  Patients who develop papular urticaria have been noted to have IgG antibodies to C. lectularius antigens, and nitrophorin has been shown to induce allergen-specific IgE antibodies.
