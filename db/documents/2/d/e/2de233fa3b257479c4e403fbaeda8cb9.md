The veins of the lower extremity are described based on their position relative to the fascial compartment. The superficial veins are above the deep fascia and are the drainage system of the cutaneous circulation. The deep veins are below the fascia and drain the musculature.

The superficial veins include the reticular veins and the greater and lesser saphenous veins. The reticular veins are located between the saphenous fascia and dermis, with the main function of draining the skin and subcutaneous tissue. These veins communicate with the saphenous system through perforator veins. The greater saphenous vein lies medially in the thigh, anastomosing with the common femoral vein approximately 3 to 4 cm inferior and lateral to the pubic tubercle. The greater saphenous vein is located directly on the muscular fascia in the saphenous compartment, a sub-compartment of the superficial compartment.

The major deep veins of the thigh follow the same nomenclature as the arteries of the lower leg except for the femoral vein, which is an extension of the popliteal vein. The main artery of the thigh is the femoral artery. The femoral artery is an extension of the external iliac artery and becomes the femoral artery after it crosses under the inguinal ligament. The main branches include the medial circumflex, lateral circumflex, and profunda femoris artery.
