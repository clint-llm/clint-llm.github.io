Granular parakeratosis is a rare, benign, idiopathic condition that is best categorized as a reaction pattern rather than a distinct disease. The condition presents as red-to-brown scaly-to-hyperkeratotic papules or plaques typically in intertriginous areas. The condition has been reported in patients of all ages and is more commonly seen in women than in men.
