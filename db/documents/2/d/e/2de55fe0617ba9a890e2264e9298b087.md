Acute promyelocytic leukemia is a distinguished subset of acute myeloid leukemia which is characterized by fusion gene transcript PML-RAR-alpha and high cure rates with treatment. This entity was first described in 1957 in patients with severe bleeding tendencies with fibrinolysis, rapid deterioration of the clinical condition, and the presence of promyelocytes in peripheral blood and bone marrow.

Advances in the molecular pathology of this leukemia have led to the introduction of arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid therapies, which have led to improved prognosis.
