There are many physiologic variants within the maxillary artery and its course along with lateral pterygoid muscle, relative to whether it travels lateral to the lateral pterygoid or medial to the lateral pterygoid. Some studies have shown that there is a 66% chance it travels laterally and 33% that it travels medially. Other variants include a deep auricular and anterior tympanic artery branching from a common trunk versus individually coming off the maxillary artery. Another variation consists of the middle meningeal artery and accessory meningeal artery coming from a common trunk versus independently branching off the maxillary artery. Interestingly enough one study has found that cadavers with a medially coursing maxillary artery generally have the middle meningeal and accessory meningeal coming off the maxillary as separate arteries while a laterally coursing maxillary artery has shown the middle and accessory meningeal arteries coming off as a common trunk. Another interesting finding was while the majority of people have mirror tracks of the maxillary artery, a minimal number of patients could have one side of the maxillary artery traveling laterally to the muscle and medially on the contralateral side.
