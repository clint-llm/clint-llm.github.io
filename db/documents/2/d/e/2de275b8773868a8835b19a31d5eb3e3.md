The overall risk of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is low. Electrical safety is paramount in the operating room. Patients under anesthesia cannot report discomfort or pain; so, it is vital to ensure that IONM equipment is checked before a safe operation. Monitoring equipment malfunctioning can lead to local skin burns and other serious complications. An additional reported risk is seizure activity, high frequency (50Â to 60 Hz) electrical brain stimulation can lead to seizure activity due to abnormal neuronal discharges.

Masseter muscles' stimulation and forceful jaw movement during MEP monitoring can lead to a tongue laceration, tooth fracture, or mandible fracture. These risks can be avoided by using bite blocks.
