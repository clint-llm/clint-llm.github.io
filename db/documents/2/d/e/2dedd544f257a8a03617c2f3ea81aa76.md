The entire masticatory musculature originates from the mesoderm of the first branchial arch. During the third month of intrauterine life, the muscle inserts into the mesenchyme, condensing around the mandible's developing condyle. A part of the muscle's tendon sweeps above the condyle and inserts into the portion of the Meckel's cartilage (cartilaginous bar of the mandibular arch) that forms the head of the malleus. A part of the tendon also gets inserted into the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint.

The lateral pterygoid muscle reaches its mature shape by week 14 of intrauterine life. At this stage, the muscle is divided by aponeurosis forming three defined regions: superior, inferomedial, and inferoanterior.
