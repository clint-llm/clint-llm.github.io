The diagnosis and management of agnosia are complex. Once the diagnosis is made, an interprofessional team including ophthalmology, speech pathology, neurology, audiology, speech, psychiatry, occupational therapy, and specialty care nurses may be needed for a detailed evaluation of sensory and neurobehavioral status. After the tentative diagnosis of agnosia is made, a thorough neuropsychological examination is done to test intelligence, memory function, linguistic competence, and assess sensory-perceptual processing.

Occupational therapists assist with treatment and should provide feedback to the team. Specialty care neuroscience nurses should work with the team for coordination of care and are involved in patient education and to monitor compliance. The interprofessional team can thus improve outcomes for patients with agnosia.

For most patients with agnosia, full recovery is not possible and the quality of life is diminished. Depending on which organ system is affected, some type of therapy can be recommended. Even when recovery occurs, it is almost never complete. For the most part, the prognosis is poor and these individuals need lifelong care and close supervision.
