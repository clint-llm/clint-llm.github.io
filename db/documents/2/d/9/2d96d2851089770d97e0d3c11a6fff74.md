**SPECT Imaging:**

There are multiple protocols for obtaining SPECT imaging to assess myocardial perfusion and tissue viability. No single protocol is useful for every patient, and the studies require individualization for each patient depending on the diagnostic information desired by the clinician and patient characteristics. The most common radiotracers used in SPECT imaging include technetium-99m and thallium-201. Below are two examples of protocols used in SPECT imaging

Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) one-day rest-stress imaging protocol

- Tc-99m radiotracer is injected intravenously.

- 30 to 60 minutes later, resting myocardial perfusion images are obtained.

- Depending on availability and patient characteristics, a vasodilator (pharmacologic stress) is administered (either dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg, adenosine 140 mcg/kg/min for a 6-minute infusion, or regadenoson 0.4 mg injection). A second dose of radiotracer is also administered.

- 15 to 45 minutes later stress images are obtained.

- Rest and stress images are ready for review and interpretation by a trained professional.

Thallium-201 (Tl-201) Stress-Rest Redistribution imaging protocol

- Depending on availability and patient characteristics, a vasodilator (pharmacologic stress) is administered (either dipyridamole 0.56 mg/kg, adenosine 140 mcg/kg/min for a 6-minute infusion, or regadenoson 0.4 mg IV) along with a Tl-201 radiotracer.

- After 15 minutes, stress images are obtained and reviewed.

- Depending on image interpretation an optional rest image is obtained 2.5-4 hours later, or 24 hours after initial radiotracer administration.

- Images are ready for interpretation and determination of areas of poor myocardial perfusion and/or viability (if redistribution images were obtained at a later time).

**PET Imaging:**

Procedures for PET CT scanning are similar to SPECT. One such protocol is described below

- 60 mCi of Rubidium-82 chloride is infused in 50 ml of normal saline solution over 25 seconds.

- Ninety seconds after infusion, rest images are obtained.

- A vasodilator is administered (dipyridamole at 0.57/mg/kg for 4 minutes or regadenoson 0.4 mg given over 10 seconds followed by a 5-ml saline flush).

- If using dipyridamole:

- A waiting period of 3 minutes  
- Start of rubidium 82 chloride infusion in 50 ml over 25 seconds

- If using regadenoson:

- The rubidium 82 chloride infusion in 50 ml is started immediately after the saline flush

- Images are obtained approximately 90 seconds after completion of the rubidium-82 infusion.
