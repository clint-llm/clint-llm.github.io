Sickle cell anemia is the most common monogenic disorder. Prevalence of the disease is high among the people of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. It is estimated that in the United States, the population of sickle cell disease is approximately 100,000 and likely to increase. The most common genotype is homozygous hemoglobin SS (HbSS), and common heterozygous conditions are hemoglobin sickle beta zero thalassemia, hemoglobin sickle beta plus thalassemia (hemoglobin sickle beta plus thalassemia), and hemoglobin sickle cell disease (HbSC).
