ASV is a type of closed-loop control mechanical ventilation that uses the 'inter-breath control method' – i.e., to maintain a respiratory setting between breaths, and not change it during the breath cycle. The respiratory variables are continuously obtained by the microprocessor and assessed based on positive and negative feedback. Then it is used to adjust the ventilator settings automatically to accommodate the physiological and individualized variations for ventilator support.

The ventilator allows us to set the maximum ventilator plateau pressure and desired minute ventilation, based on the ideal body weight (IBW). Gathering the user's input and the collected respiratory mechanic's data from the ventilator monitoring system (resistance, compliance, and auto-PEEP), it selects a target ventilatory pattern. ASV can be used in both acute and chronically ventilated patients, and as a strategy for the initiation, maintenance, or weaning.

**Ventilator Settings:**

- Height of the patient – Used to calculate the IBW of a patient;

- Weight - Calculation of dead space by 2.2 ml/Kg

- Gender

- Percentage of the minimum volume of V

- Normal – 100%
- Asthma – 90%
- ARDS – 120%
- Others – 110%
- If T > 101.3 F – add 20%
- Altitude – 5% per 500m above sea level

- Trigger – flow rate of 2 L/min

- Expiratory trigger sensitivity – to start with 25% to 40% in COPD

- Tube resistance compensation – to 100%

- High-pressure alarm

- PEEP

- FiO2
