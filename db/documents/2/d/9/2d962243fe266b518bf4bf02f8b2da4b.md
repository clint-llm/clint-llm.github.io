Transconjunctival blepharoplasty is undertaken to improve the appearance of lower eyelids. Specifically, it aims to reduce or efface the bulges created by the medial, central, and lateral fat pads. In its purest form, the procedure is indicated in the younger patients who have isolated prominence of these fat pads without significant lower eyelid laxity, without skin or orbicularis redundancy, and without festoons. The patient should not have significant nasojugal or malar grooves or cheek ptosis.

There is no functional improvement obtained with a transconjunctival blepharoplasty in the majority of patients. An exception is an occasional patient who has such prominent steatoblepharon that it obstructs their inferior visual fields or whose spectacles cannot sit in the correct position because of the prominent eyelid fat pads. In such cases, functional lower blepharoplasty is indicated.
