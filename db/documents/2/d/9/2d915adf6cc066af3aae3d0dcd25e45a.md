It is essential to understand that healthcare delivery involves multiple variables in a dynamic environment, with many critical decisions made in a short amount of time, especially in an emergency department or critical care setting. As such, the healthcare system cannot implement the strict operations processes used by other high-risk industries, such as the aviation industry.

**Encourage Error Reporting**

An essential first step is encouraging medical error reporting so that adverse events and "close calls" may be highlighted as often as they occur. All healthcare facilities must address any barriers to medical error reporting to optimize patient safety. The most common barrier to medical error reporting is a fear of consequences.

Another identified barrier to medical error reporting is a lack of proper understanding of what constitutes a medical error.

**Implement Legislative Measures to Promote Patient Safety**

The IOM gave the following recommendations to help reduce the incidence of medical errors at the legislative level:

- Public health agencies should set national goals for patient safety, track progress, and issue an annual report on patient safety.

- Performance standards for healthcare organizations should focus on patient safety.

- Health professional licensing bodies should periodically evaluate providers on clinical competence and knowledge of safety practices.

**Implement Strategies to Prevent Medication Errors**

According to a recent Cochrane Review, interventions can decrease the frequency of medication errors in acute hospital settings.

- Medication reconciliation at the time of hospital admission and discharge

- Computerized physician order entry (CPOE)

- Clinical decision support systems (CDSS)

- Barcode identification of patients and the medications being administered

- Reduced working hours for clinical providers and nurses

A recent study from Portugal reported that the use of electronic medical records not only reduced medication errors but also "contributed to a continuous improvement in patients' safety."

However, the single most effective method for reducing medication errors is using CPOE systems.

**Improve Communication and Patient Hand-off**

Using standardized communication tools such as SBAR (situation briefing model) can improve team collaboration and reduce medical errors, especially in hospital settings.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine of the US require a standardized approach to "hand off" communications, especially at training institutions, to avoid medical errors when continuity of care is interrupted. They also recommend that these hand-offs occur in real-time and allow the opportunity to ask and respond to questions regarding pertinent facts about patient care.

Communication with families is another essential part of medical communication that should be implemented, especially in the care of pediatric populations. According to a recent study, implementing standardized healthcare provider-family communication at the patient bedside using "family-centered rounds" with family engagement and bidirectional communication decreased the frequency of harmful medical errors and positively impacted the family experience.

**Reduce Diagnostic Errors**

Reducing diagnostic errors requires a more comprehensive approach. It requires system-based safety checks and algorithms such as "trigger tools" and clinician feedback or counseling.

According to a New England Journal of Medicine article from 2015, "trigger tools" are essential in reducing this type of medical error.

Another critical tool in reducing diagnostic errors is developing validated metrics for diagnostic errors.

Clinicians should be encouraged to employ strategies to reduce their risk of diagnostic mistakes. Fostering critical thinking and promoting a "pause and reflect" strategy can help avert diagnostic errors, especially in cases with obscure clinical findings or unexpected clinical trajectories.

Aside from encouraging critical thinking, opportunities for case discussions and second opinions should be made available for the treating providers. Healthcare facilities should also provide avenues for second opinions or interdisciplinary teams where cases can be discussed.

**Reducing Procedural Errors and Surgical Complications**

Implementing checklists, such as the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist (WHO SSC), has been shown to reduce procedural complications on a global scale.

**Prevent Patient Falls**

Patient factors contributing to falls include advanced age, mobility impairment, and surgery.

**Prevent Healthcare-associated Infections**

The most common healthcare-associated infections include:

- Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI)

- Surgical Site Infections (SSI)

- Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP)

- Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI)

- Care-related Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (SSTI)

Hand-hygiene campaigns have been shown to decrease the number of nosocomial infection rates for various infections and should be universally endorsed.

Pharmacy-driven antibiotic stewardship programs should be regularly employed in all patients admitted to a healthcare facility to decrease the risk of nosocomial Clostridioides infections and the risk of recurrent Clostridioides infections.

**Reduce Provider Burnout**

Provider burnout is directly associated with an increased risk of self-reported medical errors.

It is imperative to understand that burnout is a systems issue, not an individual disease.

Using scribes has been suggested as an effective way of decreasing "provider interaction with the EMR." However, the impact of scribes on medical error rates and physician burnout has not been directly studied. In the primary care setting, using scribes has been shown to decrease EMR documentation time and increase physician satisfaction.

A position paper by the American College of Physicians (ACP) put forth recommendations to help reduce the time spent by physicians on administrative tasks and decrease physician burnout.

- Provide financial, time, and quality-of-care impact statements for administrative tasks assigned to physicians.

- Conduct a thorough review of these statements.

- Tasks that are determined to have a negative effect on the quality of patient care, that unnecessarily question provider judgment, and that unnecessarily increase the cost of clinical care should be challenged, revised, or removed entirely.
