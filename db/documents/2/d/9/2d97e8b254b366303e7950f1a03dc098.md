Yellow skin discoloration has been reported in uncontrolled diabetes with no history of excess carotene ingestion. Often, yellow pigmentation resolves by regulating blood sugar.

Lycopenemia, a variant of carotenemia, is a yellow skin pigmentation caused by excessive tomato ingestion.

Carotenemia has also been associated with a variety of other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, hypothalamic amenorrhea, liver disease, inborn errors of metabolism, and nephritic and nephrotic syndromes.

In most of the above conditions, hypercarotenemia is probably associated with hyperlipidemia or impaired conversion of carotene to vitamin A.
