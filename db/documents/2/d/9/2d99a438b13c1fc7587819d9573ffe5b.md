When the sagittal suture prematurely ossifies, the skull's growth proceeds parallel to the future, and the growth perpendicular to the suture terminates. Thus, when the sagittal suture closes, the head keeps growing in the anteroposterior direction producing an elongated head shape. This is recognized as Virchow’s law.

Alterations in the expression of growth factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of craniosynostosis. Various mutations have been identified in craniosynostosis, including three fibroblast growth factors and other genes such as the twisted family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor TWIST 1.
