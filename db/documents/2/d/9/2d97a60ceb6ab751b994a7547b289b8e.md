Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a treatment option for patients with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression, catatonia, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric disorders, with depression being the most common reason for receiving this treatment.

First introduced in the 1930s, this procedure involves a patient undergoing general anesthesia and receiving an electrical stimulus to one or both brain hemispheres from an external device to induce a generalized seizure. Patients often see improvements in their mental health after these procedures.
