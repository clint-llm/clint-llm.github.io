Vertigo is a common complaint best evaluated and treated by an interprofessional team consisting of primary care providers, otolaryngologists, neurologists, specialty trained nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists. Most patients can be diagnosed clinically, but some patients should have imaging and referral to specialists physicians. Otolaryngology and neuroscience nurses provide patient education, arrange testing, monitor response, and report to treating physicians. Patients with BPPV can benefit from physical therapy. Pharmacists review prescriptions, check for interactions, and inform patients about potential side effects. [Level 5]
