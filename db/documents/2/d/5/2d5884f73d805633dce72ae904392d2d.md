**Fingers Stiffness and Restricted Range of Motion**

Stiffness after PFT can be a result of the infection process or secondary to the washout surgery. The inflammatory process in PFT may cause adhesions of the flexor tendons, thickened joint capsules, and damaged pulleys. Early active exercises for the affected finger are recommended to minimize the risk of stiffness. Flexor tenolysis of the affected digit may be required to restore the range of movement after complete subsidence of the inflammatory process.

**Flexor Tendon Scarring and Subsequent Rupture**

The high pressure within the flexor sheath interferes with the flexor tendon blood flow and nutrition. Unhealthy scarred flexor tendons lose their elasticity and may rupture with further activity.

**Soft Tissue Necrosis and Finger Ischemia**

Critical ischemia of the affected finger may result from the interruption of the blood flow due to the high pressure in the finger or secondary to arterial thrombosis induced by the inflammatory process.****

**Hand Horseshoe Abscess**

Horseshoe abscess formation may result from the spread of the infection from PFT of the thumb or little finger in patients who have communicated ulnar and radial bursae.

**Finger Amputation**

Finger amputation at various levels can be inevitable because of the deep infection, significant soft tissue, or functionless stiff finger.
