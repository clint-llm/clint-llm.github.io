The tear film covers the ocular surface and is essential for protecting the eye from the environment, lubricating the ocular surface, maintaining a smooth surface for light refraction, and preserving the health of the conjunctiva and the avascular cornea. The tear film is approximately 3 to 10 μL in volume, 3 μm thick, and secreted at a rate of 1 to 2 μL/min.

There are three different types of tears, each with unique biochemistries. Basal tears are typically present on the ocular surface, providing nutrients to the ocular surface, maintaining ocular comfort, and ridding the surface of debris. Reflex tears are those released in response to irritants, including chemicals and foreign bodies. Reflex tears are produced in higher quantities than basal tears and are involved in flushing the ocular surface of irritants. Closed eye tears are those lubricating the eyes during sleep. Some components of the tear film, such as lactoferrin, lipocalin-1, and lysozyme, remain relatively constant between different types of tears.
