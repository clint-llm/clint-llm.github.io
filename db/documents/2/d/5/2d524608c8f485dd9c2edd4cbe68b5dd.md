Lifestyle modifications and weight loss are the mainstays of the treatment. Treatment also involves glycemic and lipid control. For patients with significant obesity, gastric bypass or other weight loss surgical modalities should be considered. Weight loss is proven to reduce hepatic steatosis. Evidence available suggests that loss of 3% to 5% of body weight is necessary to notice an improvement in steatosis, but a greater loss (up to 10%) is necessary to improve necroinflammation.

Patients should abstain from alcohol or hepatotoxic drugs.

Pharmacological options include Metformin, Vitamin E, fish oil, Orlistat (an inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipase), and Sibutramine. It is important to notice that the evidence behind these pharmacological modalities is weak. Three Cochrane reviews found insufficient evidence to support the use of bile acids (ursodeoxycholic acid) antioxidant supplements, metformin or thiazolidinedione in the absence of diabetes in patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease.

For patients with advanced disease and cirrhosis, liver transplantation might have to be considered.
