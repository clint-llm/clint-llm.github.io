The initial synthesis of vWF, transcribed from chromosome 12, occurs in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes as a 2813 amino acid pre-pro-polypeptide of repeating domain sequences. The first 22 amino serve as a signal peptide to initiate post-translational processing.

vWF is rich in cysteine, a neutral yet polar amino acid, to facilitate multimerization and disulfide bridging necessary for its higher-order structure. Multimerization can combine different amounts of pro-vWF subunits resulting in a heterogeneous mix of multimers ranging from as few as two to as many as 60 or more pro-vWF subunits. Post-translational glycosylation, sialylation, sulfation, and folding occur in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Once assembled, the pro-peptide domains (D1-D2, 741 amino acids), essential to aligning pro-vWF dimers, are cleaved to form the mature 2050 amino acid von Willebrand factor. Once complete, vWF is transported for storage in alpha-granules of megakaryocytes and platelets and packaged into Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) within endothelial cells.
