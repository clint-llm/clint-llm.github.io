Regurgitation on pressure over the lacrimal sac area (ROPLAS) and/or sac syringing constitute important routine investigation in all corneal ulcer patients to rule out obstructed nasolacrimal duct induced keratitis. The routine protocol for any corneal ulcer is to look for the characteristic features of the ulcer, followed by corneal scraping to identify the causative organism.

The patient is started on medications based on direct microscopy findings, and subsequently, the treatment is further modified based on culture reports. Commonly used culture media are blood and chocolate agar for bacterial growth. Potato dextrose agar and Saboraud's dextrose agar are used for fungal growth and non-nutrient agar with E. coli for Acanthamoeba.

Serology forms the basis for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. However, the diagnosis of xerophthalmia is largely clinical.
