Cytochemical observation of myelinated fibers shows a variety of spatial differentiation in protein concentrations. This variation correlates with function, location, and genetic activity (epigenetic phosphorylation leading to increased tetanic stimulation). The highest concentration of voltage-gated sodium, potassium ion channels, and Na/K pumps is the axon hillock or initiating site of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). The strength and efficiency of neurons in the brain are dynamic and influenced by both long term potentiation and long term depression, causing morphological changes in wiring and size of neurons. The activity of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), glutamate receptive gated ion channels for Na and Ca respectively, is responsible for long term morphological changes. Upon a large enough glutamate initiated current of Calcium, the cellular initiating signal, kinases like CaMKII are activated and can phosphorylate proteins that stimulate transcription in the nucleus to produce scaffolding proteins, voltage-gated receptors, neurotransmitter gated receptors, and other proteins necessary to morphological dynamics of a neuron.
