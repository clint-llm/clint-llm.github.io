Tissue preparation for the capillaries requires several steps owing to the size of the capillaries. It requires several filtration steps needed to separate the capillaries, red blood cells, and cell debris. Starting with a 300 um mesh, which would filter the suspension. Capillaries pass through the mesh, while larger blood vessels can not. The mesh is then carefully washed with 50 mL of 1% BSA (Bovine serum albumin). Mesh should be discarded. Then a 30 um cell strain filter is used to separate the capillaries from the red blood cells. The filtrate from the last step should be distributed over five 30 um cell strain filters. This time the capillaries do not pass, whereas the red blood cells pass through the filter. The filters are washed with 25 mL 1% BSA. After this, pour all the filtrates over another filter. Wash each one with 50 mL of 1% BSA. The cell strain filters containing the capillaries should be kept. Finally, the filters are turned upside down and washed with 50 mL 1% BSA for each filter into 50 mL tubes. Pressure is applied gently with the pipet tip of a 5 ml pipettor and moved across the filter to wash off the capillaries. After the capillaries are collected, they are centrifuged and then seen under a microscope (100X magnification).
