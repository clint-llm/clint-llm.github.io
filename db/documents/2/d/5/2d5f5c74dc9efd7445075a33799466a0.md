Adverse effects associated with zoledronate include hypocalcemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, musculoskeletal pain, acute phase response, renal injury, atypical femur fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atrial fibrillation, and ocular inflammation.

All bisphosphonates can cause hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism; IV formulations such as zoledronate are more prone to cause these adverse effects. Normal serum calcium is largely maintained by a balance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. The mechanism behind hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism from zoledronate use relates to its actions on the osteoclasts.

Zoledronate halts bone resorption and calcium release by osteoclasts, resulting in hypocalcemia. To conserve calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels increase and antagonize the actions of zoledronate by acting at the level of the kidneys. The increase in PTH and a decrease in both serum phosphorus and calcium are dose-dependent. In the kidneys, PTH stimulates the production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, and tubular reabsorption of calcium is increased. Over time bisphosphonate-induced hypocalcemia will typically abate.

However, symptomatic hypocalcemia can occur and would be seen within days of zoledronate administration. Risk factors for symptomatic hypocalcemia include renal failure, vitamin D deficiency, and preexisting hypoparathyroidism. To reduce this risk, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D with the use of zoledronate is recommended. Supplementation should begin at least two weeks before zoledronate administration.

Musculoskeletal pain, including myalgias and arthralgia, has been reported after zoledronate therapy. This adverse effect has been said to occur at varying time points following treatment, ranging from days to years. The mechanism behind this effect is not understood.

An acute phase response (APR) with arthralgias, myalgias, pyrexia, chills, and fatigue has been described - this is described as a post-infusion influenza-like illness. This adverse effect is most common following the first infusion, with the frequency and incidence of APR decreasing with subsequent infusions. Symptoms begin approximately 24 to 72 hours following the infusion and resolve within 72 hours.

APR is often self-limiting, though symptomatic treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen is recommended. Recent data suggest that the coadministration of zoledronate with acetaminophen may reduce the risk of APR in half. The risk of APR may be influenced by the underlying indication for which treatment was initiated.

APR is thought to be mediated by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A study looking at patients receiving treatment for aromatase inhibitor-associated osteoporosis noted that APR was around 70%. A large study looking at APR after using zoledronate in women with post-menopausal osteoporosis revealed the incidence to be approximately 40%.

The most common form of renal injury following zoledronate administration is acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Risk factors for the development of ATN have been described and include rapid infusions, shorter time intervals between infusions, and higher doses.

Observational studies have demonstrated a risk between long-term zoledronate use and subtrochanteric or atypical femur fractures. These atypical fractures are located between the diaphysis and subtrochanteric region of the femur. These fractures occur with minimal to no trauma and can be bilateral. Symptoms include aching or dull pain in the thigh or groin. Certain comorbid conditions and medications have been associated with a further increase in the risk, including vitamin D deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, and corticosteroid use. This risk can be decreased with the use of zoledronate holidays.

Zoledronate-induced osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been extensively described. This relationship seems to be influenced by both the dose and indication for which the medication is prescribed. Treatment of bone metastasis and multiple myeloma with zoledronate 4 mg IV every 3 to 4 weeks carries a higher risk when compared to the treatment of osteoporosis. Other factors, including head/neck radiation, dental disease, and dental procedures with bone manipulation, are also known to increase the risk of the development of ONJ.

Atrial fibrillation has also been reported following zoledronate administration. The data regarding this complication is not as robust as other complications, but studies have shown that zoledronate may modestly increase the risk for atrial fibrillation.

Ocular manifestations have been linked to zoledronate therapy. This includes conjunctivitis, scleritis, and uveitis. Overall these reactions appear to be uncommon but warrant prompt evaluation. Thus, patients receiving zoledronate and experiencing changes in vision, eye pain, or eye redness should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.
