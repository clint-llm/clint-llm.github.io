**Laboratory Testing**

Evaluation in the emergency department aims to find the cause of priapism. A complete blood count (CBC) and a clotting profile are to assess for anemia, infection and detect any hematological abnormality. Urine and plasma toxicology is requested if suspicion of recreational narcotics use rises. If the patient has a psychological history, tests for psychoactive medication levels in the blood should also be sought. Additionally, in the acute phase, a corporal blood aspirate should be analyzed to rule out ischemic priapism. In ischemic priapism, the first aspirate will show acidity (pH <7.25), high PCO2 (>60 mmHg), and low PO2 (<30 mmHg). Also, a sickle cell screen should be done selectively to rule out SCD as a cause of stuttering priapism. Other hematologic causes should be looked for like leukemia, thalassemia, and platelet abnormalities.

**Imaging**

In the acute phase, color duplex Doppler ultrasonography can be used to measure the blood flow in the penis and perineum. Ischemic priapism will not show any blood flow in the cavernous arteries.****CT scans in the elective setting, to rule out suspected malignancy as a cause of priapism, can be done if clinically indicated. Penile arteriography is rarely needed except when high-flow priapism is suspected, and an embolization attempt is being considered. High flow priapism does not typically cause frequent recurrences.
