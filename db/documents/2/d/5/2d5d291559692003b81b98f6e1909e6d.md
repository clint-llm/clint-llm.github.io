Baclofen was originally designed in 1960 to treat epilepsy. However, the result was not satisfactory. Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 when it was found to treat muscle spasticity and has been widely used since.

**FDA-approved Indications**

- Baclofen is FDA-approved for managing reversible spasticity, particularly to relieve flexor spasms, clonus, concomitant pain, common sequelae of spinal cord lesions, and multiple sclerosis.

- Intrathecal baclofen administration is FDA-approved for managing spasticity of cerebral origins, such as traumatic brain injury or severe spasticity of spinal cord origin that is unresponsive to treatment with maximum doses of oral baclofen, tizanidine, and/or dantrolene. However, intrathecal baclofen might be considered for patients who experience intolerable adverse effects or fail to respond to oral therapy.

**Off-labeled Uses**

- Baclofen is used off-label to manage alcoholic liver disease.

- Maintain alcohol abstinence by decreasing alcohol cravings and alcohol-related anxiety.

- Trigeminal neuralgia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hiccups.

- Baclofen is also considered for short-term treatment for spasticity associated with cerebral palsy in children and adolescents.

Baclofen is not recommended for use in patients with Parkinson disease and stroke due to a lack of reassuring data. In addition, baclofen is not indicated for skeletal muscle spasms associated with rheumatologic disorders.
