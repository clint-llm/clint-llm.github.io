Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States.

According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 lifetime risk of stroke, the estimates include almost equivalent risk of stroke among women and men. GBD estimated lifetime risk of 18.3% with ischemic stroke and 8.2% risk of hemorrhagic stroke.

In a community-based study, the incidence rate of lacunar infarct in a predominantly White community was 29 per 100,000 population, while in another community-based research with a mostly Black population, the incidence rate of lacunar infarct was 52 per 100,000 people.

In a follow-up study, patients with lacunar infarcts are diagnosed with dementia 4 to 12 times more frequently than the average population.
