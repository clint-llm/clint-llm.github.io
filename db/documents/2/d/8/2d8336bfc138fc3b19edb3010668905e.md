This activity illustrates the indications, action, and contraindications for bisoprolol as a valuable agent in managing hypertension and other disorders when applicable. Further, the training will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for interprofessional team members in the treatment of patients with hypertension and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of bisoprolol.
- Describe the adverse effects of bisoprolol.
- Explain the appropriate monitoring of patients using bisoprolol.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance bisoprolol use and improve outcomes.
