Screening for dyslipidemia is through a routine test performed during health maintenance visits, most often by primary care physicians. Routine testing generally includes total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, with desirable values for adults being below 200 mg/dL, under 150 mg/dL, less than 100 mg/dL, greater than 60 mg/dL, respectively. Plasma or serum measurements of lipoprotein levels are useful. Plasma is typically collected in ethylene diamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA), so it can be rapidly cooled and prevent lipid peroxidation and inhibit bacterial enzymes. Values from plasma for cholesterol and triglycerides are about 3% lower than in the serum. At least two lipid assessments, ideally two weeks apart, are performed before a diagnosis of dyslipidemia is made. The recommendation is that lipid screening takes place in males aged 25 to 30 years and females 30 to 35 years for patients with high cardiovascular risk. Patients with lower cardiovascular risk should have lipid screening performed in males aged 35 and females aged 45 years. Screenings are generally repeated every five years. Patients typically fast for 10 to 12 hours before testing, avoid alcohol the evening before sampling, and wait for 2 to 3 weeks after a major illness, surgery, or trauma.
