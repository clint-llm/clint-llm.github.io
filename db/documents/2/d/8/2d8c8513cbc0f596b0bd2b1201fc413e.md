Because propofol administration is intravenous, injection pain is a common side effect of its administration.  Patients often complain of burning upon injection, lasting up to 20 seconds.

If propofol infusion syndrome is suspected, the patient will present with metabolic acidosis with elevated lactic acid.  Cardiac derangements may include hypotension, bradycardia, right bundle branch block, cardiac arrhythmias, and asystole.  ECG may show toxicity with a Brugada-like pattern and a convex ST-elevation in the suitable precordial leads. Musculoskeletal injury can occur in the form of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy. Other signs may reflect renal and hepatic abnormalities, such as oliguria or hepatomegaly, respectively.  Urine has also been noted to have a red or green appearance.
