Intercostal neuralgia can present as acute or chronic pain and can originate from multiple etiologies. This variability in its presentation and etiology highlights the challenge and importance of good communication and care coordination between multiple healthcare professionals. Nurses perform crucial tasks in treating patients with intercostal neuralgia.

Maximizing utilization of incentive spirometry, mobilizing patients, recognizing pain and achieving adequate pain control, educating patients, and notifying clinicians (MDs, DOs, MPs, PAs, DCs), pharmacists, and other members of the healthcare team of any issues that may arise all have a profound effect on the course of the disease. Similarly, physical and occupational therapists play a key role in both inpatient and outpatient theaters in making sure the patient is as active and adaptive as possible. Utilizing the interprofessional model will render available treatment options available, depending on the precise etiology, and drive better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Pharmacists play a critical part in ensuring the patient is on the appropriate medication regimens and dosing, especially regarding antibiotics, antivirals, and analgesia. In the acute phase of intercostal neuralgia caused by surgery, the thoracic surgeon or intensivist in the ICU setting must recognize and address the pain properly. Consulting an acute pain service early to incorporate regional or neuraxial analgesia can minimize pain, thereby improving post-operative pulmonary mechanics and reducing the likelihood of developing chronic PTPS.

In the event of acute HZ infection, the primary care provider (in the outpatient setting) or hospitalist (in the inpatient setting) must recognize the signs and symptoms and treat the condition with adequate analgesia and antivirals. Consultation of infectious disease specialists or pharmacists may provide insight into the best treatment regimen for these patients.Â  Perhaps one of the most consequential roles is that of the primary care provider in encouraging patients to receive the zoster vaccine, which has been shown to prevent the development of HZ, reduce symptoms of HZ, and the likelihood of development of PHN.
