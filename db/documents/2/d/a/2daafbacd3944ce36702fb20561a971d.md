**SRI Side Effects**- SRIs can cause long QT syndrome, SIADH, hyponatremia, suicide ideation (especially in children), seizures, increased risk of bleeding, sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), and serotonin syndrome. SRIs Should be prescribed by a professional and per guidelines.

Sexual dysfunction in the form of decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, and anorgasmia is common (25% to 73%) among women and men taking SSRIs.

SRIs should not be disconnected abruptly. This is to mitigate withdrawal symptoms.

SRIs can cause mania in patients with bipolar disorder and should not be used in patients with a history of bipolar disorder. In the case of mania, SRI should be discontinued and appropriate bipolar disease therapy initiated. Sleep quality improved in four weeks.
