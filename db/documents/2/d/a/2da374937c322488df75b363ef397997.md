While JME management is chiefly under a neurologist, the follow up is usually under the primary caregiver or nurse practitioner. The key to the prevention of seizures is patient education by the interprofessional team. Pharmacists should educate patients and their families about the importance of compliance and side effects. Neuroscience nurses monitor patients, educate, and keep the team informed as to changes in status. [Level 5]

Avoidance of precipitating factors/triggers should be a strong emphasis. These include avoiding alcohol use, fatigue, stress, sleep deprivation, flashing lights in any form, medication non-compliance, hunger, extremes of temperature, drug use. Patients should also be advised/educated with precautions regarding driving, operating heavy machinery, swimming, avoiding heights/being near fires alone. The treatment is usually life long (even after a long seizure-free interval), as the chances of relapse are high if medications are discontinued.
