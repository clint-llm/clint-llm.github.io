The diagnosis of exstrophy bladder is clinical and does not require any other additional investigations. Routine hemogram and blood chemistry are performed as a part of the preoperative work-up. Obtaining plain radiographs of the abdomen and pelvis to know the degree od pubic diastasis is crucial. Due to continuous urine leakage, it is uncommon to have upper tract damage before bladder plate closure. However, an ultrasound KUB to rule out associated anomalies of the upper urinary tract should be done.

Other radiological investigations and nuclear scintigraphy scans are reserved for follow-up purposes only. In females, it is always better to rule out the associated anomalies of the Mullerian structures by an ultrasound abdomen or perineal ultrasound. Evaluating the local microflora by taking a 'bladder swab' before surgery is performed by some surgeons; however, evidence supporting this practice is lacking.
