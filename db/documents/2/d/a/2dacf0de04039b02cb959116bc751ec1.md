The United States is one of the largest advanced economies by gross domestic product (GDP) in terms of both nominal and purchasing power parity. Especially in healthcare, the U.S. is the leading power in state-of-art medical technology, training, and research. However, healthcare spending in the U.S is remarkably highest with scanty health outcomes and poor public service compared with the ten highest-income countries (United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark). From 1960 to 2017, U.S. healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP inflated from 5.0 to 17.9 (i.e., $3.5 trillion), and average dollars spent on individuals increased from (in dollars) 146 to 10,739 respectively. Among these national healthcare expenditures, nearly 25% of spending was wasted.

**Managed Care**

**Definition**

To put in simple terms, Managed Care is defined as a group of activities or techniques intended to control costs, utilization, and maintain quality of care through health insurance plans. Many authors define Managed Care as a "Healthcare delivery system that 1) integrates fragmented four basic healthcare delivery functions, i.e., the financers, insurers, providers and payers to achieve efficiency, 2) implement control (manage) mechanisms in medical services utilization, and 3) introduces price competition in health service markets, i.e., determining the price at which services are purchased and how much the providers get paid. Managed Care and "Managed Care Organization" (MCO) terms are used interchangeably in an organizational context.

**Evolution and Growth**

The principles on which managed care were based had been existed for over a century. Before the introduction of health insurance plans, patients/ consumers paid directly out-of-pocket. Between 1910 and 1940, a blueprint for modern health insurance emerged in the form of the Baylor Plan, the first form of private health insurance based on capitation. In this capitation plan model, the Baylor Hospital gets paid a monthly fixed fee for every enrollee in the plan without the involvement of any insurance company. Baylor's plan is a classic example of a prepaid plan, where providers are risk bearers, and a combination of triad functions (insurance, delivery, and payment) of healthcare is observed. However, further evolution of this initial concept got derailed by organized medicine. Later comes evolutionary changes in medical care delivery labeled as corporate practice of medicine, referring to precursors of managed care – 1) Contract practice, 2) Pre-paid group practice.

- Contract practice followed the same path towards integrating the triad mentioned above functions and capitation plan model, but with the addition of a defined group of enrollees. For instance, an employer (financer) provides health care to a group of enrollees – the employees by contracting with one or more providers at a fixed fee per enrollee.

- Pre-paid group practice follows the same principles of contract practice (capitation, bearing risk by providers, and defined group of enrollees) but with a slight variation by adding comprehensive services. For instance, Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, is the first form of a multispecialty clinic where a group of specialists consolidated to form a group practice to provide comprehensive services by complying with principles of capitation, risk-bearing to provide care to a defined group of enrollees.

Later, the commercial insurance companies developed health insurance models that strongly influenced fragmentation of the triad functions by slackly hold on to insurance and payment functions but a stranded delivery function of healthcare. However, the fundamental American healthcare landscape changed by the flourish of Managed Care in the 1970s after the HMO act. Managed care covers a broad spectrum of activities including but not limited to greater integration of quad-function healthcare delivery (financiers, insurers, providers, and payers), cost containment by limiting unnecessary utilization, limited fee-for-service, sharing of risk with providers, financial incentives to providers, accountability for plan performance.
