Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent protease that circulates in plasma at low concentrations and serves a crucial role in the regulation of coagulation. In normal circumstances, the anticoagulant proteins keep the blood in a liquid, non-thrombotic state. In circulation, approximately 40% of protein S is free, and about 60% is in a high-affinity complex with the complement regulatory factor C4b-binding protein (C4BP).

- Protein S operates as a cofactor for activated protein C (APC) and inactivating coagulation factors 5a and 8a. This process is designed to stop clotting by switching off the cofactor proteins F5a and F8a. Protein S and APC can inactivate FVa. But for the inactivation of factor 8a, APC and protein S need factor 5.

- Protein S is also a cofactor for the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) protein, resulting in the inactivation of factor 10a and tissue factor (TF)/factor 7a.

Protein S is a complex protein with multiple structural moieties. Protein S is a single-chain glycoprotein, and it is dependent on vitamin K action for posttranslational modification of the protein to a normal functional state. The 3-dimensional structure is yet to be resolved but is expected to contribute to understanding the complex functional nature of PROS1 mutations.
