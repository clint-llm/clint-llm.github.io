Healthy People 2020 has a goal to "Reduce illness, disability, and death related to tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure."  Planning includes the use of various methods to promote cessation, prevention of tobacco use and second-hand smoke, and advocacy for legislation restricting access to tobacco products.  Nurses are in a unique position to influence tobacco use at the individual and community level; thereby decreasing the ill effects of tobacco use and healthcare costs.
