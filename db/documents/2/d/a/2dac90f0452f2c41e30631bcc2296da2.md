At initial diagnosis, the following tests are performed:

- Alkaline phosphatase

- Glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase

- Lactate dehydrogenase

- Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase

- CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

- CT chest with contrast

- CT soft tissue neck with contrast

- Brain MRI

- Liver ultrasound

- Liver MRI with contrast

When the tumor is removed, the following should be noted:

A missing copy of chromosome 3 (monosomy 3) is seen in about 50% of uveal melanoma: this is associated with a higher risk of the tumor metastasizing. Tests are now available by sending a sample of the tumor for testing. Based on the genetic results and using patient information (age, gender, size of the tumor, histology, etc.), the risk of developing metastases is calculated.
