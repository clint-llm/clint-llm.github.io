As many of the challenging arrhythmic events leading to sudden cardiac death occur in athletes; a good collaboration between interprofessional team members from sports medicine and cardiologist is necessary. However, the complex adaptations induced by exercise present a continuous challenge to the cardiologist asked to evaluate athletes. A unique discipline of sports and exercise cardiology tailoring cardiovascular care in athletes and exercising individuals would be a fabulous resort in the future, allowing safe participation in sports or enhanced physical activity.

A cardiology specialty nurse can assist with setting up the procedure and answering the patient questions, as well as helping with whatever interventions may be necessary based on the outcome of the EPS, which places nursing as a vital component of the interprofessional team, leading to better patient outcomes.
