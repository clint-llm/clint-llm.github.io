Physiological variations of the anterior white commissure are dependent on the differences between the spinothalamic and anterior corticospinal tracts. Variations among these tracts may result in more or fewer fibers from each respective tract crossing at the anterior white commissure. The anterior corticospinal tract has significant physiological variations between individuals. In a study of 50 spinal cords, 74% had variations in the size of the right and left corticospinal tracts, with most cords having more fibers on the right.
