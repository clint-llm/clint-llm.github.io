Risks of invasive urodynamic testing include ****:****

- Dysuria

- Hematuria

- Urinary tract infection

- Urinary retention

- Inability to catheterize the bladder

- Failure of diagnosis

Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of bacteriuria following urodynamic testing, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest it reduces rates of symptomatic urinary tract infections.

AUA/SUFU recommends antibiotic prophylaxis in the following patients undergoing urodynamic testing due to their higher risk of developing peri-procedural urinary tract infections

- Known neurogenic LUT dysfunction

- Elevated PVR

- Asymptomatic bacteriuria

- Immunosuppression

- Age over 70

- Patients with an indwelling catheter or external urinary collection device

- Patients who perform intermittent catheterization
