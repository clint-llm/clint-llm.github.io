Synthetic and natural hydroxyapatite have been long preferred as the material used in hard tissue repair over autografts and allografts. This is due to problems that the grafts are naturally associated with several issues including graft shortage, donor site morbidity, disease transmission, and graft rejection.

In bone tissue engineering, the bioactivity of HA, which is marked by osteoconductive and osteoinductive processes, has proved to support osseointegration. The osteoconductive property of HA provides a template to guide the new bone formation on its surface down to the pores of the implant body

The advance in the materials fabrication process leads to the development of nano-HA particles which can induce fast dentin remineralization

Atomic bonds in HA are quiteÂ strong contributes to the fact that HA does not swell or change in size under the range of PH and temperature

There are several problems regarding HA application in medicine. For instance, the use of HA as an implant has inherent defects/fine porosity that could act as a crack initiator. Following this event, the crack propagation can cause catastrophic deterioration during application. Furthermore, the application of bulk HA sometimes can cause the modulus mismatch between bone and the implant which later causing the disproportionate load sharing

Another issue that occurs by using HA in medical applications is how to fine-tune the degradation rate. Poor mechanical properties of the HA-based implant can induce not only fast degradation but also implant failure and chronic inflammatory reaction
