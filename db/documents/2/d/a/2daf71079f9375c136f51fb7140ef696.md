There has been a recent discussion on controlled substance policy, with the current state of the opioid epidemic in the United States. One implication to combat the overuse of opioids has been by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which uses an Over-utilization Monitoring System (OMS) which is part of Medicare Part D, to help identify patients at risk for substance use disorder. Another initiative has been to implement national registries that would indicate controlled substance allocation by a patient search.
