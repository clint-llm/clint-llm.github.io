The history should focus on the usual investigation for an acute coronary syndrome. Symptoms include chest pain, heaviness or pressure and shortness of breath, and diaphoresis with radiation to the jaw or arms. There are often other symptoms such as fatigue, lightheadedness, or nausea. On physical exam, particular attention should be given to the heart rate since bradycardia and heart block may occur. Likewise, hypotension and evidence of poor perfusion should be assessed, especially if there is concomitant right ventricular infarction.
