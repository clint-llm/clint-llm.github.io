With the rise in the burden of non-communicable diseases, i.e., cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, healthcare providers must refine all their non-surgical options. Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic that counteracts the increase in PTH, is gaining center stage. When instituting a multi-modality approach for calciphylaxis, chronic kidney disease, and hyperparathyroidism, this medication is one of the 'essentials' in the medical armamentarium.

Cinacalcet therapy is best when provided through an interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, all working together and having access to all patient information so they can drive the best possible patient outcomes.

Nephrologists most commonly prescribe it for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis. Endocrinologists may prescribe it in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in patients in whom surgical intervention is not an option or who would otherwise be too high risk for surgery. Patients need to be aware of side effects, including nausea and vomiting. They also should be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcemia. Calcium levels should be monitored closely in these patients. The interprofessional healthcare team should also engage the consult of a clinical pharmacist to optimize therapeutic results and minimize adverse events.
