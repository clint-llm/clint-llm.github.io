Unfortunately, bladder tumors within the bladder diverticulum are accountable for 2 to 10% of all tumors that arise in the bladder. Low-grade Ta/T1 tumors can be managed with transurethral resection. If carcinoma in situ (CIS) presents, adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or bacillus Calmette-Guérin immunotherapy should be added.[24] Another more aggressive approach includes either diverticulectomy or partial cystectomy.

Patients with locally progressed tumors, high-grade tumors in the diverticulum, simultaneous intravesical multifocal ulcerated tumors or widespread CIS, or multifocal disease coupled with impaired bladder function will benefit from radical cystectomy. Radical cystectomy is carried on open, laparoscopically, or robotically, with urine diversion determined by the needs and preferences of each patient. On the other hand, Radical cystectomy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and the requirement for urine diversion can significantly influence a patient's quality of life.
