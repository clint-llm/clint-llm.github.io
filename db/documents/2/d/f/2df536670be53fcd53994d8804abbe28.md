Electron microscopy allows for the visualization of the heart's ultrastructure that is not visible through light microscopy. Fabry disease, cardiac myxoma, cardiomyopathy, and amyloidosis are a few examples of diseases diagnosed with the assistance of electron microscopy.

Individual sarcomeres of the myofibrils are clearly viewable with the help of transmission electron microscopy. Critical areas of the sarcomere include the Z-lines at the ends, the central H-zone, myosin-rich A-band, and the actin-rich I-band.

Two unusual characteristics that can be present within the cardiac myocytes are lipofuscin granules and atrial dense-core bodies. Lipofuscin granules are a result of lysosomal digestion. The number of lipofuscin granules increases with age. On the other hand, atrial dense-core bodies are found in the atrium and are visually opaquer than lipofuscin granules.
