Viremia from Saint Louis encephalitis virus infection occurs after replication in the region of the mosquito bite and local lymph nodes. In most cases, the virus will clear within 7 days.Â  In cases where the virus crosses the blood-brain barrier, it causes lymphocytic meningitis, predominantly affecting gray matter. The most severely affected areas include the hypothalamus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinal cord. The virus may rarely involve white matter causing acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis.
