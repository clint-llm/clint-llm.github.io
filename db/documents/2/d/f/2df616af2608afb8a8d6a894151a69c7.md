Patients with VIPoma most commonly present with watery diarrhea, which is secretory (it persists after a 48 hour fast). Diarrhea may be present for several years before diagnosis. Typically, stool amount exceeds 700 ml per day despite fasting and can exceed over 3000 ml per day in 70% of patients

Other symptoms include lethargy, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, and cramps, which occur due to dehydration and hypokalemia. Flushing has been reported in about 8% to 20% of the patients. Tetany has been reported and is due to hypomagnesemia. If severe, the loss of fluid and electrolytes can result in cardiac arrhythmias, myopathy, tetany, and hypovolemic shock.

Children with VIPoma may present with failure to thrive in addition to chronic diarrhea.
