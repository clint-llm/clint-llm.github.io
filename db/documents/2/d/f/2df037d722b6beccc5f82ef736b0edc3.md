Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 20 mmHg measured during right heart catheterization. The term pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) describes a subset of patients who also have the presence of pre-capillary hypertension, including an end-expiratory pulmonary artery wedge pressure (less than 15 mmHg) and a pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 3 Woods units. This activity will focus on idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (IPAH), which corresponds to sporadic disease, in the absence of family history, and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with pulmonary hypertension.
- Review the presentation of a patient with pulmonary hypertension.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pulmonary hypertension.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
