Lipoid pneumonia is a rare form of lung disease due to aspiration or inhalation of exogenous or endogenous lipid-containing products. In the past, this disease has usually been an incidental postmortem finding associated with severe respiratory compromise. Currently, there are no specific evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of this lung disease. This activity reviews the evaluation of a patient with lipoid pneumonia and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide early identification of this disease process as well as education to patients of the risk factors for this rare form of pneumonia.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing exogenous and endogenous lipoid pneumonia.
- Describe the characteristic imaging findings associated with lipoid pneumonia.
- Identify the common physical exam findings associated with lipoid pneumonia.
- Explain the importance of educating the interprofessional team on lipoid pneumonia to prevent as well as expedite the diagnosis of this deleterious respiratory disease and the detrimental effects it has on patients.
