Axon density, the degree of myelination, and regional size distribution are of fundamental importance for neural functioning. Structural and functional axonal alterations underlie neurological symptoms in a wide range of disorders such as stroke, traumatic brain, and SCI, peripheral neuropathies (e.g., diabetic neuropathy, CIPN), and chronic neurodegenerative (and neuroinflammatory) diseases such as PD, MS, ALS, and Alzheimer disease. For example, in PD and ALS, the axon and the presynaptic terminals are the first neuronal compartments to be involved. Yet, the TAI is the most common and severe expression of brain injury following a head injury.

One of the most studied diseases expressing axonal damage is the MS, although primary pathological immune response concerns glia cells and myelin sheath, and then axon. MS is an autoimmune disease associated with demyelination of CNS nerve cells. The disease results in areas of demyelination or lesions that, in turn, produce axonal loss with varying inflammation. Histologically these lesions may be classified as inactive, active, and remyelinated. The inactive form indicates a patient with a progressive form of the disease. In particular, MS correlates with more pervasive demyelination, loss of oligodendrocytes, axonal depletion, and generally lacks active inflammation.
