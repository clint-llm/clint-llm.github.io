interprofessional management of Pellegrini-Stieda disease is essential to diagnosis and treatment. While a patient may not present with symptoms of a Pellegrini-Stieda lesion, a radiographic examination may reveal the finding prior to the onset of symptoms beckoning Pellegrini-Stieda Disease. As such, communication between radiologists and orthopedic specialists is imperative. Similarly, many patients with knee pain may present initially to their primary care provider. Without a proper history and imaging, this condition may be mistaken for a medial collateral ligament sprain, knee osteoarthritis, medial meniscal tear or overuse injury of the semimembranosus/semitendinosus tendons. Once correctly diagnosed, the involvement of a physiatrist and rehabilitative team of physical therapists and orthopedic specialty nurses is crucial to improved prognosis, as conservative management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, corticosteroid injections, and range-of-motion exercises can limit the disease course to five-to-six months, with nursing serving as the bridge between PT and the clinicians. [Level V] Input from orthopedic surgeons for severe refractory cases is vital for determining surgical viability and managing patient expectations. The interprofessional approach as outlined above will yield optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
