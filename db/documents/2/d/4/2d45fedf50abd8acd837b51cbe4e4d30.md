**Pathogenesis of IRIS in HIV patients:**

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has been extensively studied in HIV patients receiving HAART. The terms "unmasking," "unregulated," and "paradoxical" are often used to describe the state of hyper-inflammatory response seen with the IRIS. Patients who are HIV positive and have low CD4 positive cell count usually start seeing a decrease in viral load within the first 1 to 2 weeks after initiation of HAART. An improvement in CD4 counts usually occurs in the first three to six months of initiation of HAART.

As mentioned above, having a low CD4 count, and disseminated latent infection prior to initiation of HAART, rapid improvements in CD4 count, suppression of infection after HAART initiation are all risk factors for IRIS. The underlying mechanism of IRIS is complex and is thought to be due to an imbalance between anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines that occurs rapidly after the recovery of immune function in HIV patients initiated on HAART.

After initiation of HAART, there is an increase in CD4 count. This includes an initial rapid increase in memory CD4 positive T cell counts due to decreased apoptosis and lymphocyte redistribution from peripheral lymphoid tissues. A slower increase follows this in counts of naive CD4 positive T cells. Later during the course of the treatment, there is a clonal proliferation of these CD4 positive cells causing a further increase in cell counts. Along with CD4 positive T cells, there is also improvement in CD8 positive T cells.

This dramatic improvement in CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cell counts leads to an improvement in cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immunity. And it can lead to the following:

- An excess pathogen-specific cellular immune response.

- Decrease in the capacity of regulatory T cells to regulate and suppress inflammation.

- Uncoupling of both innate and acquired immunity.

All of this culminates in a state of hyperinflammatory response against underlying pathogens, culminating in IRIS symptoms.
