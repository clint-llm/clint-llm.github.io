While there is no true cure for age-related fertility decline, patients who are promptly evaluated and referred to a reproductive endocrinologist have multiple options open to them for treatment, thanks to the technological advances in the field of assisted reproductive technology. This is important as patients with infertility can be strongly emotionally affected by their diagnosis. Prompt evaluation and referral to a specialist is the best thing that an OBGYN Generalist can do for their patients of advancing age who are seeking fertility. Another factor to consider is that artificial reproductive technology can be prohibitively expensive for patients as insurance often does not cover IVF.
