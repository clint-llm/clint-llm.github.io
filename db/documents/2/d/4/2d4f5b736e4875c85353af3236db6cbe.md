Life expectancy has improved over the last few decades due to advancements in medical science. Due to this, the population of older patients has also increased significantly. United States Census Bureau estimates around 49 million people in the US are 65 years or over in 2016. Impairment in multiple domains in the aging population inversely affects health outcomes and quality of life. Hence, a comprehensive assessment in this population is imperative for early diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of issues in the older population.

Due to the multitude of comorbidities, geriatric assessment and care require coordination between all members of the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians of different specialties like primary care, hospitalist, geriatrician, psychiatrist, podiatrist, dentist, to name a few, as well as nurse, social worker, and other allied health care workers such as a physical therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist, pharmacist, psychologist, audiologist and optician. A systematic review of 29 randomized controlled trials has shown that hospitalized older patients who receive this kind of assessment have more chances of surviving and living at home than in nursing homes.
