If any known hypersensitivity reaction to magnesium sulfate has occurred in the past, it should not be administered. If a patient is in a known heart block, magnesium sulfate should not be given as it can exacerbate the already slowed cardiac conduction. Many manufacturing labels recommend withholding magnesium sulfate infusions in patients with preeclampsia/eclampsia two hours before fetal delivery due to possible interaction with neuromuscular blocking agents given intraoperatively; however, the medication should not be stopped due to the possibility of precipitating seizure activity.
