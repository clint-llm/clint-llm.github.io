Many vascular complications can arise during surgical procedures of the spine. Besides the complex vasculature providing blood flow to the nervous structures in the spinal cord, the vertebral column is near vital vascular structures, including the aorta, iliac vessels, and carotid and vertebral arteries. Anterior cervical exposures come close to the carotid sheath, and injuries to the carotid artery—especially during revision surgery—have been documented.

Potential vascular complications in the thoracic and thoracolumbar spine are injuries to the major vessels and their branches and the sequelae of compromising the blood supply to the thoracic and/or lumbar spinal cord. Paraplegia due to a unilateral vascular injury of a thoracic segmental vessel is uncommon. However, bilateral disruption of the segmental blood supply, such as in the case of aortic surgery or aortic dissection, presents a higher risk of paraplegia.

The transthoracic approach to the anterior thoracic spine typically requires the mobilization of segmental arteries over several vertebral levels. A right-sided approach is recommended to avoid the pericardial structures since the artery of Adamkiewicz has been reported to originate on the left side of the aorta between T8 and L1 in 75% of patients.
