Studies have shown that these aberrant coronary arteries, which form the malformation, have thicker tunica intima. They also have thicker tunica media with tightly packed smooth muscle cells. The anomalous arteries stained positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA), calponin, and desmin. The endothelium was found to be CD34 positive. Oftentimes, the anomalies would be accompanied by aneurysmal dilations at the neck of the aberrant coronary artery.
