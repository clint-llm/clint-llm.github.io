Overdose of terazosin may lead to hypotension, and standard life-support protocols should be in place for instances of hemodynamic instability. There are no antidotes for terazosin toxicity specifically. Vasopressors may be used to support physiologic blood pressure parameters in the event of terazosin overdose. Terazosin is long-acting, with an elimination half-life of approximately 12 hours, and is highly protein-bound. Elimination is via renal excretion (40%) and via excretion of feces (60%).
