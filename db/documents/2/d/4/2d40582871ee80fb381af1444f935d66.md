Accurate estimates of the prevalence and distribution of HLH within the population are difficult to obtain due to various factors, the most apparent of which is imprecise diagnostic criteria and the presence of multiple confounding medical illnesses at the time of diagnosis. The most comprehensive data with regards to primary HLH comes from a Swedish national registry that collected data from 1987-2006 and demonstrated a yearly incidence of roughly 1.5 per million.

In adults with secondary HLH, accurate estimates are even more difficult. Not only is the presentation often indistinguishable from the underlying trigger (sepsis, uncontrolled malignancy, autoimmune flare), but laboratory investigations to confirm HLH are infrequently undertaken. That being said, some estimates place it at 1 in 2000 for adult critical care admissions.

No clear racial or ethnic predilection has been observed in the literature; rather, these categories tend to distribute in a fashion that approximates the surrounding geographic location of the study.
