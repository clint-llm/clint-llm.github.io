ADEM has been associated with some infectious organisms and immunizations. Most commonly associated organisms include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpes-virus-6, influenza virus, hepatitis A, human immunodeficiency virus, and mycoplasma pneumonia – though, in the majority of cases, the causative pathogen is not identified. Additional associated bacterial infections include Leptospira, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Borrelia burgdorferi.

Rabies vaccine has been the earliest reported vaccine associated with ADEM. It is seen in both adults and children approximately eight to 21 days following immunization. Other less commonly associated vaccines include those for measles, pertussis, tetanus, influenza, hepatitis B, diphtheria, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, smallpox, human papillomavirus, and poliomyelitis.
