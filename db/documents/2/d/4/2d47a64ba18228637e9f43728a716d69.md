Symptomatic patients with chronic cholecystitis usually present with dull right upper abdominal pain that radiates around the waist to the mid back or right scapular tip. The pain may be exacerbated by fatty food intake but the classical post-prandial pain of acute cholecystitis is less common. Nausea and occasional vomiting also accompany complaints of increased bloating and flatulence. Often the symptoms occur in the evening or at night. Symptoms are usually present over weeks to months as opposed to the abrupt, severe presentation of acute cholecystitis. There might be a gradual worsening of symptoms or an increase in the frequency of episodes. Fever and tachycardia are rare. Elderly patients with cholecystitis may present with vague symptoms and they are at risk of progression to complicated disease. Hence a high index of clinical suspicion is required in the diagnosis of this condition.
