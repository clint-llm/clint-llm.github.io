There is no known clear etiology of amniotic band syndrome. But it is thought that rupture of amnion early in pregnancy results in the development of multiple loose strands (amniotic bands) that adhere to and/or entangle the fetus.

The above mentioned etiological reasoning does not explain all ABS findings, as in some cases, the affected anatomic structures are internal visceral organs and have a histologically intact amniotic lining. In these cases, disruption of fetal blood flow unrelated to bands is thought to be the primary cause. This vascular insult could result from misoprostol exposure in the first trimester and or chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks of gestation.

For a few cases, neither the amniotic band nor vascular disruption is thought to result from a genetic mutation. As almost all ABS cases in twins have been seen in monozygotic twins, suggesting a genetic correlation.
