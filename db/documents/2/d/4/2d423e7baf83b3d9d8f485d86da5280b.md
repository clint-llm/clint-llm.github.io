Treatment for childhood disintegrative disorder is similar to the treatment of autism. The stress falls on early and excessive educational interventions. Most of the treatment plan is behavior-based and highly structured. Family counseling, including educating the parents so that they can follow the child treatments at home, is usually part of the overall treatment plan. Therapies in the areas of language, speech, social skills development, occupational, and sensory integration may all be used according to the needs of the individual child. Loss of language, skills related to social interaction, and self-care are delirious, and the affected children face ongoing problems in certain areas and require long-term care. Treatment of childhood disintegrative disorder requires behavior therapy, environmental therapy, and medications.

**Behavior Therapy**

The applied behavioral analysis mainly focuses on methodically training the patient to re-learn self-care, language, and social skills. These treatment programs are designed in such a way that they use a reward system to reinforce acceptable behaviors and discourage trouble behavior. These programs are usually devised by certified professionals in behavior analysis, which is then can be used by other healthcare personnel. People from different domains like speech therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, and occupational therapists with differing levels of competence can benefit from this. Teachers, parents, and caretakers are advised to use these behavior models at all times.

**Environmental Therapy**

In the form of sensory enrichment applies augmentation of the sensory experience to improve symptoms in autism, many of which are also present in childhood disintegrative disorder.

**Medications**

Medications are used to treat the symptoms as they develop during the disease as there is no drug available to cure this disease directly. Antipsychotic medications are used for repetitive behavior patterns and aggression. To control problematic behavior, particularly aggression, experts use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), stimulants, and other antipsychotics. There is a significant risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome with the use of neuroleptic medication. If seizures develop, anticonvulsants are used.
