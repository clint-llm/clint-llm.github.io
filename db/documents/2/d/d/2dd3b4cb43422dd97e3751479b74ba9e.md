The proximal ICA has its origin from the third aortic arch, and the distal portions come from the dorsal aorta. At roughly 28 to 30 days, the ICA has fully divided into cranial and caudal segments. The cranial segment includes the primitive olfactory artery (POA) that eventually forms the anterior choroidal and MCA. Together with the median artery of the corpus callosum (MACC), the POA involutes as part of the normal development of the ACA. Failure of the MACC to regress can lead to a variant called azygos ACA, described below. The MCA develops later, beginning around 32Â to 40 days, and develops together with the cerebral hemispheres. There are initially numerous anastomoses between the carotid and vertebrobasilar systems, most of which regress. Occasionally, the hypoglossal artery or the trigeminal artery may persist into adulthood. The PCA develops from the caudal segments of the ICA; it is initially a continuation of the posterior communicating artery, which regresses in most individuals.
