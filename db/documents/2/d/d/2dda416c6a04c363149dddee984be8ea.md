Primary otalgia is most commonly due to infection, which is routinely addressable in the primary care office. A referral is rarely needed, but a pharmacist can have involvement with antimicrobial therapy, checking for interactions, and verifying dosages. Secondary otalgia, however, will often require an inter-disciplinary care team. Temporomandibular joint disease may require coordination between the primary care physician, pain clinic, and a dentist. Dental pathology will require referral to a dentist. Chronic musculoskeletal conditions, such as cervical disc degeneration or trigger points, will require coordination of care with physical therapy and pain management. Malignancy will require consultation with an oncologist.
