Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is the separation of the posterior vitreous cortex and the internal limiting membrane of the retina and is the most common cause of floaters. Anomalous PVD can lead to various deleterious effects on the retina as well as vitreous as a result of abnormal traction at the vitreoretinal interface. This activity explains the consequences of an anomalous PVD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in proper evaluation and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
- Outline the evaluation process for posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
- Explain the management of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
- Review the complications and the role of interprofessional teamwork to improve the outcomes of patients with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
