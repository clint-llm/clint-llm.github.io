The blood supply for the VL is primarily the lateral circumflex femoral artery, as stated above. This main arterial supply enters the muscle anteriorly. The three branches of this vessel are anatomic landmarks in many orthopedic approaches to the hip. The ascending branch requires ligation during the anterior approach. The descending branch is in the plane between the VI and the VL and is often encountered during the anterolateral approach to the thigh.

Due to its extensive origin on the femur, the VL plays a key role as a landmark in many operative procedures involving both the femur and the hip joint. For any repair of the femoral shaft or proximal femoral replacement, the VL must be reflected to provide visualization of the femur.

In the lateral approach (Hardinge) to the hip, an internervous interval is created between the gluteus medius innervated by the superior gluteal nerve and the VL innervated by the femoral nerve. This interval is achieved by splitting the VL during the dissection. The VL is identified once the dissection has been carried through the fascia lata. In this approach, the lateral circumflex artery is at risk for damage.

The VLO is also a landmark used in the placement of portals during knee arthroscopy. If a superolateral inflow portal is to be used during an arthroscopic knee procedure, the portal is placed lateral to the body of the VLO.
