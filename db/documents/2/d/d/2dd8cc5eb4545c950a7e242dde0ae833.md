LVAD may be used in patients with a cardiogenic shock, aÂ patient awaiting a heart transplant or following myocarditis. LVAD implantation is usually done by a cardiac surgeon but its care requires monitoring by an interprofessional team. LVADs are associated with numerous complications and 24/7 monitoring is mandatory.
