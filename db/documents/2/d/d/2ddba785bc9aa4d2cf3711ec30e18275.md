The infectious dose of E.coli O157: H7 is, however low. One study shows that as few as ten viable bacteria can cause disease in humans. The pathogenesis of E. coli O157: H7 results from its production of Shiga toxin that injures the intestine by sloughing off of intestinal mucosa cells and results in hemorrhagic diarrhea. The Shiga toxin has systemic effects on vascular endothelial cells, resulting in vasculitis, and manifests in hemolytic uremic syndrome, abdominal pain, and rarely, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. E. coli 0157:H7 Shiga toxin initiates the inflammatory cascade that causes leukocyte aggregation, apoptosis of the affected cells, platelet aggregation, microthrombi formation, hemolysis, and renal dysfunction, as the renal glomeruli have a particular vulnerability to a microthrombi formation. E. coli 0157: H7 Shiga toxin effect manifests not only in the kidney but in its most severe manifestations, it can result in a diffuse vasculitic injury that affects multiple organ systems and multiple organ failures.
