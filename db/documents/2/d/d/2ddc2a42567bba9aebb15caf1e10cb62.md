A widely accepted and standardized set of criteria outlining presentation severity does not exist for SVC syndrome.

The Kishi Scoring System for Signs and Symptoms of SVC syndrome grades severity based on the patient’s clinical presentation.

Included in this scoring system are the patient’s neurologic symptoms, laryngopharyngeal or thoracic symptoms, nasal and facial signs or symptoms, as well as the presence of venous dilatation.
