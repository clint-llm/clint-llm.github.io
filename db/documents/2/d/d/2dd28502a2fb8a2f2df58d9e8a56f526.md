There are no treatment protocols or guidelines for medical or surgical management in cases of PTX associated keratoconjunctivitis due to limited case reports in the literature. However, due to the inflammatory changes and good response to corticosteroids observed in most cases, some recommendations have been made.

Initial therapy should include the removal of the toxin from the eye by rinsing or instillation of artificial tears.

After initial eye washing to remove as much toxin as possible, Farooq et al. recommend early aggressive corticosteroid treatment (e.g., 1% prednisolone acetate at least six times daily) and prophylactic antibiotic therapy for mild cases

For severe exposure, other recommendations on management are made on a case-by-case basis with patients often receiving some surgical intervention in addition to medical management. Amniotic membrane transplant, tarsorrhaphy, or epithelialization stimulating eyedrops may be helpful in cases with persistent epithelial defects; corneal transplant may be a consideration in cases of corneal ulceration that result in perforation.Â In instances with residual scarring, ridged/scleral contact lenses, or a corneal transplant may be a possibility.
