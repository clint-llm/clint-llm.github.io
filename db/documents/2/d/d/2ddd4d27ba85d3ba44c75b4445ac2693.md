Overall, explicit memory continues to develop throughout the years, including rapid changes during the first two years of life, until the person reaches 60, which then the explicit memory begins to diminish progressively.The difference in explicit memory between the different age groups, adults, childhood, and infants is due to several reasons. The first reason, the medial temporal lobe is formed and matured before birth, except for the hippocampus, more specifically except for the dentate gyrus, which continues to develop until 11 months of age. The second reason is the rapid myelination, which happens during the first year of life. The final reason is that the connections between the medial temporal lobe and the cortex areas such as the prefrontal cortex are well established between the age of 10 to 18 years.
