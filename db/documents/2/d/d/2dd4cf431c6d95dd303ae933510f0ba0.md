Patients are grouped into symptomatic versus cryptogenic versus idiopathic IS, butÂ clinicians must be able first to identify the clinical features that prompt further investigation of IS as a diagnosis. As stated above infantile spasms "are characterized by epileptic spasms with onset in infancy or early childhood that are usually associated with the EEG pattern of hypsarrhythmia, and also developmental regression."

Spasms range from a few to more than a hundred, occurring in clusters that range from less than one minute up to ten minutes.

All the above typically occurs through several stages:

- The first stage is noted to be relatively mild with infrequent and isolated spasms. This is associated with developmental regression.

- The mild stage then progresses to a more severe stage with an increase in frequency and clustering of spasms. The developmental regression noted in stage one becomes more pronounced.

- The last stage is characterized by a progressive decrease in spasm frequency and severity. Spasms may completely resolve and be replaced by other types of seizures.

Clinicians must be able to identify and begin early diagnostic testing for IS because time is important to prognosis.
