The prevalence of dyslipidemia increases with age. In 2005-2008 an estimated 33.5% of U.S. adults older than 20 years of age had high LDL-C levels. Of these individuals with elevated LDL-C levels, only 48.1% received treatment, and 33.2% had their LDL-C controlled. The prevalence of LDL-C control seemed to be the lowest amongst individuals that were uninsured, Mexican American, or having income below the poverty level.
