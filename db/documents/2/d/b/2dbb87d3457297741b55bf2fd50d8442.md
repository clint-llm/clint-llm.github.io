Screening for osteoporosis is recommended for women beginning at age 65 years of age and for men at 70 years of age. Patients with risk factors for osteoporosis should be screened at earlier ages. Bone density testing is commonly used to diagnose osteoporosis. Evaluating the patient's fracture risk is also important.
