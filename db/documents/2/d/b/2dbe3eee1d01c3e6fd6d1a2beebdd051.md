Timolol is a nonselective beta-blocker available for both topical and systemic administration. Topical timolol is primarily used to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.

**FDA-Labeled Uses of Topical Timolol**

- Open-angle glaucoma

- Ocular hypertension

**Off-Label Uses of Topical Timolol**

- Infantile hemangioma

**FDA-Labeled Uses of Systemic Timolol**

- Hypertension (not first-line)

- Myocardial infarction

- Migraine prophylaxis

**Off-Label Uses of Systemic Timolol**

- Atrial fibrillation (adult)

**Open-angle glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension**

Open-angle glaucoma characteristically presents with resistance to aqueous humor outflow via the trabecular meshwork.

Beta-blockers such as timolol were once the first-line treatment for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, but the recommendation now is that patients first be treated with a topical prostaglandin, such as latanoprost. Topical prostaglandins have demonstrated effectiveness in lowering intraocular pressure and carry a lower risk for systemic side effects when compared to beta-blockers.

**Infantile Hemangiomas**

Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that occur in 4 to 10% of infants. These tumors characteristically have a proliferative phase, followed by involution. The resolution of infantile hemangiomas generally occurs before the age of 4.

**Hypertension**

Although previously thought of as first-line therapy for the treatment of hypertension, recent reports have rejected beta-blockers, such as timolol, as a first-line treatment for hypertension in favor of more effective medications, including diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.

**Myocardial Infarction**

Myocardial infarction is defined as an ischemic infarction to the heart due to a blockage of one or more of the coronary arteries. Beta-blockers, such as timolol, have been shown to increase survival and improve long-term outcomes after myocardial infarction.

**Migraine Prophylaxis**

Migraines characteristically present as recurrent moderate to severe headachesÂ potentially accompanied by phonophobia, photophobia, and nausea. Migraines can cause severe, unilateral throbbing pain, and physical activity can be an aggravating factor. Timolol has been an effective method for migraine prophylaxis.

**Atrial Fibrillation**

Atrial fibrillation is a common rhythm abnormality of the heart. Atrial fibrillation patients are at an increased risk for many cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, thromboembolism, and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations.
