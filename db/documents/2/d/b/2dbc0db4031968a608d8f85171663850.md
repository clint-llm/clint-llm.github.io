The prognosis for posterior polymorphous dystrophy (PPCD) is dependent on the extent of the disease.

- In most cases, PPCD is a static or very slowly progressive disease.

- The frequency of follow-up required is dependantÂ on the severity of the disease.

- Patients with mild disease that are identified in adulthood have a good prognosis and are not likely to require treatment.

- If significant refractive disparity is present in childhood anisometropic amblyopia may develop.

- Infants with corneal edema require timely intervention to reduce the potential for developing deprivation amblyopia.

- Those with iridocorneal adhesions should be monitored for glaucoma.

- Those with elevated intraocular pressure, visual field defects or glaucomatous optic nerve appearance should be treated for glaucoma.

- Penetrating keratoplasty should be considered if corneal opacities limit visual potential.

- If iridocorneal adhesions are present corneal grafting procedures are at risk for failure.
