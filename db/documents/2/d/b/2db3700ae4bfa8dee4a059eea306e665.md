The sphenopalatine ganglion is an extracranial parasympathetic ganglion found within the pterygopalatine fossa of the skull. Since it was first described in the early 1900s, clinical studies have since further characterized the role of sphenopalatine ganglion blockade in the treatment of a number of chronic, painful conditions. This activity discusses the indications and techniques for performing sphenopalatine ganglion blockade as well as reviews the anatomy of the sphenopalatine ganglion.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the sphenopalatine ganglion.
- Summarize the indications for performing a sphenopalatine ganglion block.
- Outline the techniques commonly utilized to perform a sphenopalatine ganglion block. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for sphenopalatine ganglion block and to enhance patient outcomes.
