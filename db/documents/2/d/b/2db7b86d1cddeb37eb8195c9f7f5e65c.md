Early detection of hearing impairment is critical to improved prognosis. Newborn hearing screening programs are available in all 50 states, and these programs recommend universal newborn hearing screening be performed within the first 3 months of life. The American Academy of Pediatrics program called Early Hearing Detection and Interventions has goals of screening by 1 month, diagnosis of hearing loss by 3 months and entry into early intervention services by 6 months. The initial screening test may be auditory brainstem response (ABR) or otoacoustic emissions (OAE) testing. If an infant fails their newborn hearing screening, further diagnostic testing is recommended to confirm the presence of hearing loss, which may be followed by MRI or CT scan of the temporal bones and internal auditory canal. Historically CT of the temporal bones was the initial choice of imaging, but more recently MRI has been found to offer some advantages in comparison to CT. The timing of imaging as well as which patients should undergo imaging remains controversial.

In the case of syndromic hearing loss, further workup may depend on other associated findings. A genetics consultationÂ is typically recommended. An integral part of the work up in bilateral severe to profound SNHL has become genetic testing for mutations in the gap junction beta-2 gene (GJB2) which encodes connexin 26. Further investigation regarding syndromic hearing loss includes obtaining hearing testing of family members. Routine laboratory testing in children with bilateral SNHL has had limited literature to support its utility and has a low diagnostic yield. Serology can be considered to look for signs of infection, past or present. Particular history or physical exam findings may yield further work up. In cases of a family history of syncope, an EKG may be warranted. In patients with additional symptoms concerning for hypothyroidism, thyroid function studies may be indicated.

A recently published study showed that 57% of children with syndromic hearing loss had significant ophthalmologic findings, and therefore, it is recommended for children with severe-profound SNHL to be referred for ophthalmologic examination.
