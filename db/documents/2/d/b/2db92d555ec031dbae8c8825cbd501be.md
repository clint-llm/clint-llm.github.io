Corneal abrasions are a common injury typically seen in urgent care centers and emergency departments. Most of the time, they will heal on their own with the assistance of topical antibiotics to prevent infection. It is important to identify signs of more serious injury that would necessitate urgent ophthalmologic follow-up. The most dangerous injury would be an open globe. It is also important to get follow-up within 24 hours for large abrasion or a decrease in visual acuity. Regions of the country that do not have ophthalmology coverage available to them will need to establish follow-up or have a low threshold for transferring to a tertiary care center. Daily follow-up by an ophthalmic nurse or an ophthalmologist is required for large abrasions, abrasions from the contact lens, abrasions associated with decreased vision, and abrasions in young children. The majority of small corneal abrasions heal within a few days and full recovery is the norm. Large corneal lesions may take some time to heal but visual recovery is not always guaranteed.
