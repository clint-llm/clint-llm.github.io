The specific muscle subtype of the superior tarsal muscle is different from the other extraocular muscles. The superior tarsal muscle is made up of smooth muscles, specifically thin fibers of smooth muscular tissue. This muscle originates at the underside of the levator palpebrae superioris and attaches to the superior tarsal plate.

Specific differences which are seen in this muscle compared to other smooth muscles exist. One such difference is the fact that the superior tarsal muscle is made up not solely of smooth muscle but instead is mixed tissues. These tissues include connective tissue, blood vessels, and fat. Also, one key difference between the superior tarsal muscle and others is that the smooth muscle cells of this muscle are distributed sporadically and are not attached to each other. Lastly, another difference shows that the origin of the superior tarsal muscle may contain fibers of striated muscle connected with fibers of the smooth muscle.
