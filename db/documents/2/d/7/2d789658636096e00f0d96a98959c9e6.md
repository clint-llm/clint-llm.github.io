To prevent irreversible damage, the patient should have frequent bloodwork and constant monitoring for renal impairment, electrolyte derangement, and/or seizures in overdose situations.

Renal toxicity is one of the major concerns around administering foscarnet. The risk is reducible by concurrent administration of 0.9% normal saline (about 0.5 L to 1.0 L) or dextrose 5% water solution. While a history of chronic renal disease can increase the risk of foscarnet toxicity, it is also important to withhold the administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers amphotericin B, vancomycin, or aminoglycosides to reduce the risk of additional renal damage.
