As most patients with egg allergies are infants or small children, education should be aimed towards the parents or other primary caregivers.  It is essential to instruct parents on the importance of avoiding eggs and to evaluate any food item for the presence of egg product.

Patients with a high risk for anaphylaxis should be prescribed epinephrine and educated on administration.  Epinephrine is the most effective treatment for anaphylaxis as it directly counteracts the effects of histamine by promoting smooth muscle relaxation and by decreasing vascular permeability.  Parents and caregivers should be educated that Benadryl or other anti-histamines are NOT appropriate alternatives to epinephrine.
