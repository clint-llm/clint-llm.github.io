Any conditions that affect the mandible has the potential to compromise the mandibular foramen and its contents. The mandible may become affected by osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis of the jaw includes necrosis of the mandible. This condition typically affects individuals taking bisphosphonates prophylactically to prevent bone loss. Bisphosphonates have a side effect that results in osteonecrosis of the mandible.

The inferior alveolar nerve and artery can be compressed within the mandibular foramen if the lumen of the foramen becomes narrowed. Compression of the inferior alveolar nerve leads to sensory deficits. While the compression of the inferior alveolar artery can lead to ischemia. The narrowing can be due to neoplasms, hematomas, and other pathologies infiltrating within the lumen of the mandibular foramen.
