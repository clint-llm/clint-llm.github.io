Patients with sialadenitis should receive education about oral hygiene regimens (e.g., brushing teeth) and hydration. When the acute symptoms and tenderness have subsided, repeated massage of the submandibular gland can be an ongoing therapy. Avoid anticholinergic medications and diuretics. Treatment of underlying cause (e.g., Sjogren syndrome) is essential. Patients with submandibular sialadenosis should focus on control of underlying factors(e.g., hypothyroidism, diabetes, cirrhosis).
