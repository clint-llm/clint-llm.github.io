Traumatic brain injury may cause multiple neurological deficits, some of which might be permanent. The exact type of deficit is dependent on the area of the brain affected by the contrecoup injury. If the contrecoup injury is not managed promptly and properly, the patient can have devastating complications, eventually leading to coma or death.
