Lower energy injuries, younger patients, and acute nerve lacerations undergoing primary repair have a better prognosis for recovery. On the other hand, high energy injuries, older patients, and chronic ulnar compressive neuropathy associated with muscle atrophy have a poorer prognosis. Flexible claw hand has a better prognosisÂ if a procedure aimed at preventing MCP hyperextension is performed.

Most of the treatments for these conditions are palliative, and significant improvement in hand function may take up to 5 years after the surgery.
