The estimated prevalence of the disease is 10.7 to 14 per million adults worldwide. The mean age of onset, as reported, is between 38 to 54 years, with a median of 40. However, it has been reported in extremes of age as well, from as low as 4 to as high as 74. There is no gender difference in incidence.

In contrast to certain small vessel vasculitis with a preponderance in childhood (Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Kawasaki disease), ANCA-associated vasculitis is rare in children. Regardless of age, adult and childhood EGPA both present with highly elevated IgE and eosinophil levels. About 40% of adults have a positive ANCA, while 25% of children are seropositive.

Clinically, however, childhood EGPA has a higher incidence of cardiomyopathy, pneumonic infiltrates with a rarer occurrence of mononeuritis multiplex. A higher prevalence of cardiac disease increases the mortality in childhood EGPA, just as in adult disease.
