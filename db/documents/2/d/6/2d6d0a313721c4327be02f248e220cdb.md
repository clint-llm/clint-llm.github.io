Alveolar macrophages play an important role in infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium tuberculosis’ bacteria evolved mechanisms that resist phagocytosis of macrophages. Alveolar macrophages gather around the M. Tuberculosis and join to form a multinucleated giant cell (also known as Langerhans giant cell), surrounded by T-cells. TNF-alpha and IFN- gamma are particularly important in the formation of granuloma

Alveolar macrophages also engulf harmful environmental particles such as carbon, specifically reported in coal mine workers and termed as pneumoconiosis. Similarly, crystalline silica particles can deactivate alveolar macrophages immunologic response, mimicking TB. For this reason, patients with a history of silica exposure should have periodic TB testing.
