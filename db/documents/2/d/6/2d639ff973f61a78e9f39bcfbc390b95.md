Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by extensive exfoliation of the epidermis and mucous membrane, which may result in sepsis and death. It was initially described by Alan Lyell in 1956 as “an eruption resembling scalding of the skin."

In most cases, TEN occurs as a consequence of an immune reaction to certain drugs. Nevertheless, infection, tumors, and vaccination have been reported as potential causes. Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) shows the same disease process and is considered to be in the same spectrum of drug-induced epidermolysis. The main difference is the extent of skin detachment. TEN usually involves more than 30% of the total body surface area, while SJS affects less than 10%.
