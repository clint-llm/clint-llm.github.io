Actinic cheilitis is a precancerous lesion that forms most commonly on the lower lip. Similar to actinic keratosis, actinic cheilitis can undergo malignant transformation leading to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC on the lips is 11 times as likely to metastasize compared to SCC found on other parts of the body. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of actinic cheilitis, a premalignant lesion found on the lips and highlights the role of the healthcare providers in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of actinic cheilitis.
- Review the evaluation of actinic cheilitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for actinic cheilitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients with actinic cheilitis.
