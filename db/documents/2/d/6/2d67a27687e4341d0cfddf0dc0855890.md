A urine specimen is not always necessary or indicated but can aid in the diagnostic evaluation, especially if there is a concern for infection as the etiology of the elevated residual volume.

Urinary catheterization after voiding can provide both a post-void residual and a urine specimen. It is particularly useful when a urine specimen is needed and not otherwise obtainable, as well as in cases of obvious urinary retention.

Urinary catheterization should be performed sterilely to prevent infection and to obtain an uncontaminated urine specimen.
