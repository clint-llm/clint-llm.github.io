Splenic rupture is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, radiologist, intensivist and the ICU nurses. Unlike the past, in many patients, conservative treatment is recommended as long as the patient is hemodynamically stable and there is no evidence of further bleeding. Patients need to be monitored in an ICU setting and have frequent abdominal exams. The outcomes for patients managed non-surgically are excellent.
