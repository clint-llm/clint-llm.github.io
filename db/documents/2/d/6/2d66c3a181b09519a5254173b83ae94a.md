Endometriosis, in general, has been found to affect approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. However, only about 3% of reproductive-aged women have clinically significant disease.

There is limited data when looking specifically at the prevalence of endometriomas. However, it is estimated that 17 to 44% of women with endometriosis experience an endometrioma,

There is also limited data to suggest specific risk factors for endometriomas alone.

These include:

- Nulliparity

- Early menarche (typically before 11 to 13 years old)

- Late menopause, short menstrual cycles (less than 27 days)

- Heavy menstrual bleeding

- Mullerian anomalies

- Height greater than 68 inches

- Low body mass index (BMI)

- Consumption of high amounts of trans unsaturated fat

- Exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero

In addition to risk factors for endometriosis, endometriosis also increases other patient risks. Many of these have been previously discussed, such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, dyschezia, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea. However, it has also been found that women with endometriosis have an increased risk for certain types of ovarian cancer. The overall risk of ovarian cancer remains low. However, multiple studies have demonstrated women with endometriosis have a higher incidence of clear cell and endometrioid ovarian cancer.
