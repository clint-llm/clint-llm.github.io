The anatomic function of the thumb is complex and beyond the scope of this article; however, it is important to recognize that the ulnar collateral ligament assists in stabilizing the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint. To adequately grasp and hold onto objects, the thumb acts in a coordinated fashion with hand muscles, finger muscles, and ligamentous structures, including the ulnar collateral ligament. By understanding this mechanism of thumb function, one can see how hyperextension (or extreme abduction) may result in a tear to the ulnar collateral ligament.  These can be classified as partial, complete, or chronic. As observed in other acute joint injuries, the patient may have swelling and tenderness at the first metacarpophalangeal joint. Also, there may be instability or laxity noted at that joint.
