Mechanical ventilation is an established supportive treatment for patients with various forms of respiratory failure. Despite the widespread use and clear benefits of mechanical ventilation, it is not a risk-free intervention. Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of pneumonia, barotrauma, tracheal injuries, and musculoskeletal deconditioning. At the same time, delayed weaning is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and risk of long-term care facility discharge. The weaning process comprises almost 42% of the total duration of the ventilation. This activity describes the methods used to wean from the mechanical ventilator and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of respiratory failure that lead to the need for ventilation.
- Outline the assessment of a patient being weaned from the ventilator.
- Summarize the approaches to weaning a patient from a ventilator.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients being weaned from the ventilator.
