The highly reactive superoxide radicals forms when dioxides interact with air, a process that can be achieved in all living organisms and can then be further purposed depending on its context and the process through which it is metabolized.

Even though it is known that these diseases thrive under the overproduction of free radicals, superoxides also have a pivotal role in maintaining physiological states. These include defense functions like antibacterial properties and phagocytosis, as well as their ability to act as signaling molecules.

Given its active part in many of the body’s reactions, intricate regulation is achieved by the enzyme superoxide dismutases (SODs), which catalyzes the deactivation of superoxide and maintains the physiological concentration of superoxides.
