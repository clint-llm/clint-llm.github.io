Initial evaluation of lower back pain initiates by obtaining a history from the patient. This history should pertain to the timeline of pain, radiation of pain, and inciting events. The clinician should pay careful attention to prior episodes of trauma. Low-grade slips and stenotic spinal canals may decompress and relieve pain with leaning forward or sitting. It is crucial to note patient comments such as decreased pain with pushing a grocery cart or walking upstairs as both common actions have the spinal column in forwarding flexion.

Classically patients may complain of pain radiating down both buttocks and lower extremities. An evaluation of the patient's walking is also critical to better assess the daily impact that pain or neurological deficits cause. All physical examinations will include assessing the neurologic function of the arms, legs, bladder, and bowels. The keys to a thorough exam are organization and patience. One should evaluate not only strength but also sensation and reflexes. It is also essential to inspect the skin along the back and document the presence of tenderness to compression or palpable step-off.

Performing a straight leg test in a patient positioned supine may also reveal a stenotic canal.

Documentation is paramount as these initial findings will likely serve as a baseline for all future evaluations.
