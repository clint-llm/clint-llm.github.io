Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication for the renal scan so as to prevent radiation exposure to the fetus.

Tc-99m labeled radiopharmaceuticals are used for renal scanning which can be excreted in breast milk. According to the  Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM), nuclear scintigraphy agents do not require breastfeeding interruption since their effective dose to the infant falls below 1 millisievert (mSvt).
