Patients with SON of the knee classically present with gradual onset, mild symptoms focused over either the medial or lateral femoral condyle, or both.Â  Typically, these patients are younger than 45 years of age, the symptoms are bilateral, and patients often have co-existing osteonecrosis of other large joints.

On examination, pain both at rest and with load-bearing exercise is common. The most common clinical finding is localized pain on palpation of areas overlying necrotic foci. Range of motion tends to be preserved with mild disease and is only limited by pain.
