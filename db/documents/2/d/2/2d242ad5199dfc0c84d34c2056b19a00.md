Radiographic imaging of the affected upper arm with a minimum of two views should be obtained if the humeral fracture is suspected. Also, one should have a high suspicion of forearm, wrist, or clavicle fracture when a patient has a humeral fracture due to the mechanism of injury; thus, imaging of these areas should be considered as well.  If the patient has evidence of vascular injury or a large hematoma, hemoglobin should be obtained to ensure there is no significant blood loss due to the injury. Of note, there can be significant blood loss associated with any long bone injury. Also, if urgent or emergent surgery is anticipated, basic screening labs, such as complete blood count (CBC) and complete metabolic panel or basic metabolic panel (CMP/BMP) may be obtained in the preparation of the patient going to the operating room and undergoing anesthesia. A prothrombin time or INR should be obtained on patients who are anticoagulated on warfarin.

Vascular imaging is rarely indicated. Treatment for vascular compromise is a definitive reduction of the joint. Angiography only delays definitive management and does not add any additional information nor alter management.

With radial nerve injury, electromyography (EMG) may be used in the subacute or long-term phase to assess the extent of nerve damage.
