**Assistive Reproductive Technology**

Assistive reproductive technology, mainly in the form of in vitro fertilization (IVF), has become the mainstay of management for SIN, due to its immediacy and minimally invasive nature. The success rates have also improved dramatically over the past decade with Wade et al.Â demonstrating that by the 5th cycle of IVF, the chance of live birth is 80.1%.

**Surgery**

Reconstructive proximal surgery, originally described in the 1890s, was the standard treatment for decades and has been shown to yield relatively high pregnancy rates of 34%.

**Gonadotrophin-releasing Hormone Analogues**

Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRH-a) have been used as a medical treatment for SIN. It is believed that these cause tubular patency by creating a hypoestrogenic environment which shrinks the underlying pathology, similar to the management of adenomyosis.
