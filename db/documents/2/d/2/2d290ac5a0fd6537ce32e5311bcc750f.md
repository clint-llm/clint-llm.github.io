Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the world. It can be classified into two categories: primary osteoarthritis and secondary osteoarthritis. Classically, OA presents with joint pain and loss of function; however, the disease is clinically very variable and can present merely as an asymptomatic incidental finding to a devastating and permanently disabling disorder. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of osteoarthritis and reviews the interprofessional team's role in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe in detail the pathophysiology of primary and secondary osteoarthritis.
- Review the components of a proper evaluation of a patient presenting with osteoarthritis, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Discuss the various treatment options available for osteoarthritis.
- Evaluate possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of osteoarthritis and improve outcomes.
