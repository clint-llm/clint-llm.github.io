**Submandibular Gland Anatomy**

The paired submandibular glands lie within level IB of the neck (sometimes referred to as the submandibular triangle). This space is bound superiorly by the inferior border of the mandible, inferiorly by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, anteriorly by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle, and posteriorly by the posterior border of the submandibular gland. The deep aspect (floor) of this space is defined by the mylohyoid muscle and the superficial border defined by the platysma muscle.

In addition to the submandibular gland, several other important structures lie within level IB of the neck. Therefore, understanding this anatomy is crucial in order to perform surgery in this space safely. When operating in the submandibular space, particular care must be taken to avoid injury to the marginal branch of the facial nerve. This nerve branches from the facial nerve within the parotid gland parenchyma before coursing inferiorly and passing superficial to the mandible into the submandibular space within the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia. This fascial layer invests the submandibular gland with the marginal mandibular nerve closely associated with the superficial aspect of the submandibular gland as it courses anteriorly and superiorly toward the ipsilateral corner of the mouth where it innervates the depressor labii inferioris.

The hypoglossal nerve also courses through the submandibular space deep to the digastric tendon medial to the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia before coursing anteriorly and innervating the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue (except for palatoglossus-which is innervated by the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve). Traveling closely to the hypoglossal nerve is the lingual nerve, which provides sensory innervation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. General sensation fibers for touch, pain, and temperature travel within the mandibular division of cranial nerve five as the lingual nerve courses just medial to the inferior alveolar nerve. Special sensation fibers for taste travel with the facial nerve through the internal acoustic meatus before branching into the chorda tympani nerve, which travels through the middle ear and exits the skull via the petrotympanic fissure into the infratemporal fossa where it joins with the lingual nerve.

The facial artery branches from the external carotid artery and courses through the submandibular space. After branching from the external carotid artery, the facial artery courses medial and posterior to the digastric muscle and later courses around the muscle and through the submandibular gland and exits into the facial notch of the mandible. Each submandibular gland has an associated duct (Wharton’s duct) which extends superiorly and medially from the submandibular gland into the floor of the mouth just lateral to the lingual frenulum.

**Submandibular Gland Physiology**

Salivary production by the submandibular gland is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic innervation originates from the superior salivatory nucleus of the pons. Pre-synaptic fibers travel with the facial nerve via the chorda tympani which later joins with the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve. Fibers synapse at the submandibular ganglion. Post-synaptic fibers act directly on the submandibular gland to induce secretion and vasodilation.

Sympathetic innervation originates from the superior cervical ganglion where fibers synapse.  Post-synaptic fibers travel as a plexus within the carotid sheath. Fibers following the facial branch of the external artery and subsequently submental arteries then enter the gland, where they decrease blood flow to the submandibular gland and decrease salivary production.

**Pathology Affecting the Submandibular Gland**

Pathologic processes of the submandibular glands may be classified as acute or chronic processes. Acute processes include obstructive processes and of the salivary ductal system,  including salivary calculi or stricture or infectious processes. Unilateral submandibular infectious processes are often bacterial, with S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. viridans, and H. influenzae commonly isolated.

Chronic processes affecting the submandibular glands include neoplasm of either benign or malignant origin, autoimmune disease, infiltrative processes - such as amyloid, granulomatous disease, or idiopathic enlargement.
