Pulmonary emphysema, a progressive lung disease, is a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines it as "a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases." This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of emphysema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of emphysema.
- Describe the pathophysiology of emphysema.
- Summarize the treatment of emphysema.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by emphysema.
