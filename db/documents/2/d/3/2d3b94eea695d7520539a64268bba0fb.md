Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) is a common and serious histological form of renal injury seen commonly in those suffering from autoimmune diseases. It advances into rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescents at an accelerated rate and hence if not timely, diagnosed and treated can end up as end-stage-renal disease. It is vital to carry out a renal biopsy to understand the underlying etiology better and know the severity and chronicity of the disease. This activity will review the care provided by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
-  Outline the etiology, possible related auto-immune diseases, and identify the prevalence of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis.
- Describe the appropriate presentation, signs, and symptoms of a patient with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis.
- Summarize the most commonly used treatment regimens and the follow-up tests involved in showing the efficacy of the treatment of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to diagnose diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis earlier and prevent long-term complications thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality.
