Before treatment, the practitioner should discuss with the patient all of the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as any alternative treatments. The practitioner should also obtain the patient's consent.

Once the procedure is explained, and the patient has given consent, then proceed to evaluate the lumbar spine. A thorough evaluation will consist of establishing a pain scale, a visual assessment, muscle strength testing, as well as a range of motion testing for the lumbar spine. These will be critical to be able to compare the progress made after treatment. An osteopathic evaluation should be completed to find any somatic dysfunctions and or tender points.
