Obstruction of normal spinal CSF flow dynamics is felt to be important in the generation of a spinal cord syrinx. This can occur due to vertebral fractures, scar tissue, arachnoid adhesions,Â penetrating injury, posttraumatic kyphotic deformity, and arachnoid scarring without obvious recognized trauma. The presence of spinal canal stenosis and bony deformity such as kyphosis is known to increase the likelihood of syrinx formation. Blood products may be a contributing factor.
