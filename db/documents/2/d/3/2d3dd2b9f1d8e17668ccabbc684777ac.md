The etiology of aniridic fibrosis syndrome is still unknown. This progressive fibrosis appears to occur only in patients with congenital aniridia that have undergone intraocular surgery, especially with some implanted device. However, a history of such is not entirely necessary.

Risk factors have not been fully identified because of limited reported cases of aniridic fibrosis syndrome. However, of the seventeen cases published in the literature, 88% have been female.
