Folate is a generic term that typically refers to a group of water-soluble compounds that play an essential role in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biosynthesis.

One of the most important indications for folate use is considering the development of the central nervous system. Women planning on getting pregnant should take folic acid supplements to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida, in the developing fetus. Some have proposed that the mechanism by which NTDs form in the absence of folate involves the increased ubiquitination of neural tube closureâ€“related genes, thereby affecting their expression.

Many other therapeutic uses of folic acid exist, though these uses are less impactful than those already mentioned. Folic acid can help protect against neoplasia in ulcerative colitis, prevent cervical dysplasia, treat vitiligo, restore hematopoiesis in macrocytic anemia due to a folate deficiency, and increase gingival resistance to local irritants, thereby reducing inflammation.
