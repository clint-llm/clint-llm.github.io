Patients may present with complaints of feeling short of breath. They also may say that they do not feel as if they can get in enough air. On physical exam, patients may have blue-tinged fingers or lips and/or use of accessory muscles or chest muscles to breathe. On the other hand, patients can present without any obvious symptoms.

In newborns, tachypnea can be due to fluid retention in the lungs within the first 24 hours of birth. Infants can present with a blue color in the perioral area, grunting or signs of difficulty breathing, retraction of the chest while breathing, bobbing of the head, and/or flared nostrils.
