Preoperatively, the surgeon will mark the abdomen as if doing an abdominoplasty procedure. For the unipedicle transverse rectus abdominis (TRAM) flap, a contralaterally or ipsilaterally based flap can be designed. This is preferred when less than 60% to 70% of the lower abdominal ellipse is needed, or the patient has no history of impaired microvascular circulation. First, a superior line is drawn from the superior border of the umbilicus to each anterior superior iliac spine. This line is based on the size of the abdominal pannus. Then an inferior skin line is drawn from the suprapubic crease laterally upward to meet the upper line at the iliac spine creating an ellipse. This is the margins of your flap. Next, the midline from the suprasternal notch to the pubis is marked. The inframammary fold of the remaining breast is marked and transferred as a mirror image to the reconstructed side 1 cm to 2 cm above. Lastly, the remaining breast is measured to determine how much abdominal issue is needed to obtain symmetry between the breasts. These measurements are marked on the flap.
