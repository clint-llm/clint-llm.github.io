Several tremors disorders are included in the differential diagnosis.

- Essential tremor (most common action tremor, usually bilateral with a frequency of 4 Hz to 12 Hz, the onset is typically 60–70 years)

- Intention tremor

- Parkinson's disease tremor (most common resting tremor)

- Orthostatic tremor (middle-aged or older adults, unsteadiness on standing, 16 Hz tremor in the lower extremities)

- Physiological tremor (does not interfere with activities of daily living, 8 to 12 Hz)

- Cerebellar tremor (typically of low frequency below 5 Hz, rest tremor is usually absent)

- Functional tremor (no underlying physical cause can be found, and can have different manifestations, unresponsive to medication, frequency variability, suppression during attention distraction)
