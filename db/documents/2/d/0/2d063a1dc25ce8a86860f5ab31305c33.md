Omphalitis is an infection of the umbilicus and/or surrounding tissues, occurring primarily in the neonatal period. It is a true medical emergency that can rapidly progress to systemic infection and death, with an estimated mortality rate between 7 and 15 percent. Early recognition and treatment are essential to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with omphalitis. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of omphalitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify examination findings consistent with omphalitis. 
- Describe how to evaluate omphalitis and differentiate it with other diseases
- Outline the role of interprofessional team members in decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with omphalitis. 
- Review how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with omphalitis.
