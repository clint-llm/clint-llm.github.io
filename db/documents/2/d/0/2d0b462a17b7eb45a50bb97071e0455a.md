Blunt eye trauma can result in various intrinsic eye injuries.

The mode of injury can be a direct blow to the eyeball or accidental blunt trauma. The traumatic lesions of blunt eye trauma are classified as closed globe injury, globe rupture, and extraocular lesions. All the anatomical structures of the eyeball can be affected, as discussed below. The diagnosis is clinical, and rarely laboratory and imaging are warranted. Laboratory investigations are needed in critical patients and patients requiring surgical intervention.

Imaging modalities like X-rays, CT, and MRI is usually required post-operatively. In the case of an impacted foreign body, pre-operatively imaging is required to assess the extent and depth of IOFB. The management depends on the type of injury and the need for surgical intervention. The final visual outcome is governed by mode of trauma, time of presentation, the extent of ocular damage, time of surgical intervention, and post-operative care of the patient.
