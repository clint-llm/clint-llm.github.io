The determination of the exact prevalence of post-intubation laryngeal edema is challenging because of wide variations in definition, diagnostic criteria, and the methods employed for the detection. This variation is further compounded by differences in the study population, and also due to differences like endotracheal tube material with the latter pertaining especially to the older studies.

Grossly, the incidence of post-intubation (extubation) laryngeal edema varies between 5% to 54 % in different studies, whereas the reported incidence of post-extubation stridor ranges from 1.5% to 26.3%.

The literature offers other epidemiological data. Concerning gender differences, for instance, the incidence of edema is higher in females. A prospective French study on 136 intubated patients with post-extubation fibreoptic bronchoscopy evaluation observed laryngeal injury in 73% of patients, and laryngeal edema was the most common injury noted in 54.4% of the patients.

Post extubation stridor was present in 13% of the patients. Laryngeal edema with decreased vocal cod mobility was present in almost two-thirds of the patients with stridor. Only half of the patients with post-extubation stridor got reintubated, and only half of the patients who got reintubated had post-extubation stridor. Previous studies had also noted a significant number of intubated patients having varying degrees of edema and ulceration of larynx.
