The temporoparietal fascia flap (TPFF) is a versatile flap well-recognized for reconstructing craniofacial defects. Most commonly, the TPFF is utilized in a pedicled fashion for the reconstruction of the scalp, auricle, facial soft tissue, orbit, oral cavity, and nasopharynx, as well as for skull base defects. This procedure is most commonly used in the reconstruction of head and neck defects but has found utility with free tissue transfer for hand and lower extremity reconstruction as well. The activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in this procedure. This activity reviews temporoparietal fascia flap transfer and discusses the background, indications, and technique of this operation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for temporoparietal fascia flap transfer. 
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique required to perform a temporoparietal fascia flap transfer.
- Outline the potential complications of reconstructive surgery using the temporoparietal fascia flap. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients undergoing temporoparietal fascia flap transfer.
