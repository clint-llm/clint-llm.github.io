Immediate postoperative complications are uncommon but include feed intolerance and persistence of airway symptoms such as cough, difficulty breathing, stridor, and wheeze. Rarely, intra-operative injury to the phrenic nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, or thoracic duct may result in paralysis of the diaphragm, vocal cord paralysis, and chylothorax respectively. Postoperative formation of aorto-oesophageal fistula and oesophageal erosion are very rare.
