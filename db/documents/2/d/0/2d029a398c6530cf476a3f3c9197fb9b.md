Many of the studies that have been performed analyzing the potential benefit of medicinal cannabis in treating chronic pain have small sample sizes. Marijuana's status as a Schedule 1 substance certainly contributes to the lack of ample data. However, as more states pass legislation legalizing marijuana, more studies with larger sample sizes will ensue in the future. Cannabis use continues to be a politically charged topic.

Regulations among states vary, contributing to the difficulty in prescribing medicinal cannabis to patients suffering from chronic pain. Although preliminary data has supported the use of medicinal cannabis in the treatment of chronic pain, it is quite evident that further research needs to be performed to fully determine its true role in the world of pain management. The interest in exploring alternative treatments for chronic pain spurred by the opioid epidemic has created an opportunity to find treatments outside of the norm, from cannabis to even psychedelics.
