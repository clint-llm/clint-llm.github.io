Unfortunately, throughout a clinician's career, they may be subjected to a report that was submitted by a reporting entity such as a malpractice judgment or settlement. This report would follow the clinician for the remainder of the career unless the information submitted were not factually correct. After receiving a report, the NPDB will notify the subject of the report, and advise the clinician on how to obtain the record. Additionally, the NPDB will explain to the clinician named in a record the process to add a statement or the process of disputing the report.

Additionally, clinicians need to be aware that there are many definitions of reportable events to the NPDB. Since hospitals are required to report a physician resigning while an investigation is undergoing to the NPDB, clinicians should receive in writing that that are not subject to any inquiry before resigning to ensure that they maintain their rights and have a chance to defend their reputation if they are subject to any investigations. Furthermore, clinicians should stay informed about changes to the NDPB throughout there career since the adverse reports can make getting granted or renewing hospital privileges challenging.
