- Bone: complex bone fractures, eroded joints, knee, tumors, osteomyelitis

- Gyn: cyst, fibromas, tumors

- CT colonography/colonoscopy is used to diagnose colon disease and early-stage cancer with good sensitivity and specificity.

- Biopsy: CT guided to different organs for adequate tissue extraction

- CT Angiography: brain, heart, lung, kidney, extremities

- Intraoperative: CT scan can be used for neuronavigation procedures during brain biopsy or tumor resection.
