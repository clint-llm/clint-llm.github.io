Ruxolitinib is a janus-activated kinase inhibitor (JAK) that selectively inhibits the JAK1 and JAK2 protein kinases.

In 2019 the FDA approved ruxolitinib for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease for patients older than 12 years old based on the results from STUDY INCB 18424-271, which was a trial involving forty-nine patients. This approval made ruxolitinib the first-ever FDA-approved drug for patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.

In September of 2021, the FDA approved a ruxolitinib cream formulation to treat mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, making this the first topical janus kinase inhibitor approved for use on the US market.

Other therapeutic indications for which ruxolitinib is being researched include alopecia areata, plaque psoriasis, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and relapsed diffuse large T-cell lymphoma.
