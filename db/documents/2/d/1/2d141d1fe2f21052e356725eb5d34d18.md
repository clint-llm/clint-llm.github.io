Each muscle comprises multiple tissues, including blood vessels, lymphatics, contractile muscle fibers, and connective tissue sheaths. The outermost sheath of connective tissue covering each muscle is called epimysium. Each muscle is made up of groups of muscle fibers called fascicles surrounded by a connective tissue layer called perimysium. Multiple units of individual muscle fibers within each fascicle are surrounded by endomysium, a connective tissue sheath. The two most essential myofilaments that make up the contractile elements of the muscle fiber are actin and myosin. They are arranged distinctively in a striated pattern to form the dark A band, the light I band, and the fundamental unit of contraction, also referred to as a sarcomere.

The sarcomere consists of a central M line, and attached to it on either side are the thick myofilaments of myosin. This forms the dark A band. The sarcomere is bordered by the Z-line, which serves as the site of origin of the thin myofilaments of actin that project towards each other as they partially overlap the myosin filaments.
