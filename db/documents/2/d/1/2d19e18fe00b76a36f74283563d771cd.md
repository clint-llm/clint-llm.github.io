**Transabdominal Sonography**

In a transabdominal scan, patients are comfortably positioned in a supine position and examined with a full bladder.

**Transvaginal Sonography**

In transvaginal sonography, the empty bladder allows better visualization of the uterus. The examination should be relatively painless. The patient is supine in the lithotomy position. Pillow under the buttocks or feet rested in stirrups of the bed allows better positioning and visualization of pelvic organs.

In the women of reproductive age group, knowledge of the last menstrual period and serum beta-hCG levels may be useful. It is good practice to perform TAS with a full bladder in every patient to avoid missing any abdominopelvic mass or adnexal mass, followed by emptying the bladder and performing TVS which allows a more detailed evaluation of pelvic structures.
