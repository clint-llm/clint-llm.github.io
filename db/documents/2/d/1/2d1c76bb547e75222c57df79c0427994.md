Mycoplasma pneumonia is a bacteria that can infect humans. It usually causes upper respiratory tract infections but can also cause pneumonia, and it is one of the most common causes of atypical pneumonia in the United States. Many extrapulmonary infections have been attributed to Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections. However, a causal link is yet to be established.

Reimann first described mycoplasmal pneumonia after observing a series of seven patients with marked constitutional symptoms and termed it 'primary atypical pneumonia.'
