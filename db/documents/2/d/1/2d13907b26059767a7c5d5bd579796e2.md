Exposure commonly occurs in close quarter areas such as military camps, schools, and hospitals. Hand hygiene is vital to prevent the spread of infection.  Because mycoplasmal infection is spread by via aerosolization, droplet precautions are essential to prevent spread among hospitalized patients.

Regarding individuals affected by Ureaplasma species, M. genitalium, and M. hominis are recommended to use condoms to prevent the spread of the STI. Sexual partners should also receive treatment to prevent reinfection.
