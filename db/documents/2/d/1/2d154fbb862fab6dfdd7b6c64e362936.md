Although serious gastrointestinal adverse events are infrequent, patients should receive instruction to look for alarming signs and symptoms to avoid complications. Alosetron therapy should be discontinued immediately in any patient who develops constipation or there is a concern of ischemic colitis. If a patient develops ischemic colitis, the medication should not be resumed. Patients who develop constipation, which does not resolve after discontinuation of alosetron, need to notify their provider immediately.
