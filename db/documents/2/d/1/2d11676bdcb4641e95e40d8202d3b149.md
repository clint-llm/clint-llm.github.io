14C-UBT: The commercial brand available for 14C-UBT in the U.S is PYtest. Current testing dose exposes patients to a small dose of 1 microcurie, which is equivalent to natural environmental background radiation received in about 24 hours.H. pylori, there will be no hydrolysis of 14C-urea. The unhydrolyzed 14C-urea is absorbed in the stomach, enters the bloodstream and excreted by the kidneys. Appropriate safety precautions are necessary for the storage, handling, and disposal of the radioactive test ingredients.

13C-UBT: Even though 14C-UBT is safe, the current preference is for 13C isotope as it is non-radioactive, especially in children, women of childbearing age and during pregnancy.H. pylori. A post-urea ratio of 13CO2/12CO2 is noted. The difference in the ratios between the post-urea and the baseline is referred to as delta over baseline (DOB). There is no agreed consensus on the cut-off value for DOB to differentiate between H. pylori positive and negative results.
