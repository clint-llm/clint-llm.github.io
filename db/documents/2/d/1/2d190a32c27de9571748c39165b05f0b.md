Muscle energy is a well-established osteopathic technique used to address a variety of somatic dysfunctions. Somatic dysfunctions are defined as changes to the structure and function of the somatic system, composed of muscle, fascia, nerves, and vasculature. In the cervical region, this typically presents as "increased muscle tension, sensitivity changes, asymmetry, and restriction of range of motion."

To alleviate dysfunction in a joint, muscle energy may be employed by utilizing intermittent patient force in opposition with a constant force applied by an osteopathic physician. Muscle energy has proven to effectively reduce many cervical dysfunctions, including pain, lordosis, decreased range of motion, and decreased muscle strength.
