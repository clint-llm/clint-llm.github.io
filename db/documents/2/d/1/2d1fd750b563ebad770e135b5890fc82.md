The differential diagnosis of sleep enactment behaviors can include RBD, obstructive sleep apnea, seizures, nocturnal panic attacks, nightmares, and non-REM parasomnias such as night terrors, somnambulism, or confusional arousals. The differences of these disorders can usually be identified with detailed history taking, but a video-monitoredÂ polysomnographic study is often warranted.
