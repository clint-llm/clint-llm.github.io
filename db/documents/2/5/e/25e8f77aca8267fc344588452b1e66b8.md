When treating a patient with cholinesterase poisoning, the differential diagnosis includes three broad categories of cholinergic toxicity: (1) cholinesterase inhibitors, (2) cholinomimetics, and (3) nicotine alkaloids. Included among cholinesterase inhibitors are insecticidal cholinesterase inhibitors such as carbamates and organophosphates and noninsecticidal cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine physostigmine, neostigmine, and echothiophate. Of the noninsecticidal cholinesterase inhibitors, the most common etiology of toxicity is the ingestion of additional doses of pyridostigmine for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Toxicity from cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer dementia (i.e., donepezil) is rare.

Cholinomimetic compounds either stimulate nicotinic or muscarinic receptors directly, without inhibition of AChE. Laboratory tests of BuChE and RBC AChE activity in these cases will be normal. Exposures can occur from cholinomimetic medications such as carbachol, methacholine, and pilocarpine or nonpharmacologic agents such as muscarine-containing mushrooms. Nicotinic alkaloids such as nicotine and coniine cause similar symptoms to carbamate toxicity with CNS excitation, autonomic activation, and skeletal muscle stimulation via ganglionic autonomic stimulation of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems as well as the nicotinic receptors on skeletal muscle.
