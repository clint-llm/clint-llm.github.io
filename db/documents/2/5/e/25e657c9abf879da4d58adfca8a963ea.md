Open surgical bypass and endovascular stent placement are both options in treating popliteal artery aneurysms, and there is an open-ended debate regarding which is preferred. A meta-analysis revealed that endovascular repair had lower wound complication rates and shorter length of stay than open repair; however, there was decreased primary patency at three years.

**Open Repair**

As with any arterial reconstruction, case planning is paramount in achieving an optimal patient outcome. Preoperative imaging must be reviewed carefully to decide on proximal and distal anastomotic sites as well as the conduit. The anatomy and presentation are used to decide on the type of open approach used for repair. Most commonly used is the medial approach, which is best for small or fusiform aneurysms. Large or saccular aneurysms, especially if they cause compressive symptomatology, are best approached from a posterior approach.

With regards to positioning, when using a medial approach, the patient is positioned supine. The patient is placed prone if using a posterior approach.

**Endovascular Repair**

The anatomy of the target vessel must be evaluated carefully. A landing zone of a minimum of 1.5 cm should be used proximal and distal to the aneurysm.

About positioning, the patient is placed supine on a radiolucent angiography table.
