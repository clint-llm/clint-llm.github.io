Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis (TRC) is likely the most common cause of infectious retinochoroiditis worldwide. One-quarter of patients with a history of Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis report worse than 20/200 vision in at least one eye. Patients may become infected in utero or via ingestion of the parasite. This activity describes the evaluation and management of Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the transmission of Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis.
- Explain how to evaluate for Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis.
- Describe treatment modalities for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with primary or recurrent Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis.
- Explain how careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis will improve outcomes.
