Acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by coagulopathy, elevated liver biochemistry, and hepatic encephalopathy without underlying chronic liver disease. It is divided into hyperacute liver failure (within 7 days), acute (1 to 4 weeks ) and subacute (5 to 12 weeks). This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of hepatic failure and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hepatic failure.
- Review the signs and symptoms in patients with acute hepatic failure.
- Summarize the evaluation of hepatic failure.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to provide aggressive supportive measures to avoid multiorgan failure and improve outcomes in patients with hepatic failure.
