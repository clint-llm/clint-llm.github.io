Patient education is paramount in the management of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). The parents of affected children will need detailed explanations for their child's illness and extensive counseling to help them adapt and cope with a child suffering from a lifelong chronic condition. They should be encouraged to utilize appropriate resources like support groups and foundations dedicated to a particular disease condition. They will need to know that newer treatments are available and will need guidance to referral centers that undertake those treatments. Education on the inheritance pattern in future generations will allay fears and help plan and manage complications.
