**Possible reasons for insufficient decompression include:**

- Complex regional osseous anatomy

- Severe obliquity of C1-C2 facets

- Abnormal osseous fusion

The presence of oilisthesis, extreme facet arthropathy, and the contraction of the tissues can hinder the realignment process.

**The main limiting variables in reducing AAD in BI are:**

- Anterior atlantoaxial tension band and

- Lateral articular process deformity noose.

**Complications of the transoral approach:**

- Damage to the eustachian tube and hypoglossal nerve.

- Bleeding

- Severe tongue swelling

- Palatal and pharyngeal dehiscence

- Retropharyngeal abscess

- Neurological worsening

- Aspiration

- CSF leak

- Meningitis

- Delayed pharyngeal bleeding, and

- Craniovertebral junction instability.

**Complications of craniovertebral junction fusion surgery:**

- Neurological worsening

- Vertebral artery injury

- Bleeding from vertebral venous plexus

- Craniovertebral junction instability

- Cord edema

- CSF leak

- Meningitis

- Nonunion

- Hardware failure, and

- Sudden death.

A few of the common complications of posterior fusion surgery can be:

- **Mechanical failure**includes nonunion, instrument failure, and adjacent segment degeneration**.**The C1–2 facet joint is the most critical area for assuring good fusion and undertaking kyphotic correction.

- **Subaxial kyphotic deformity**has been observed following laminoplasty and wider detachment of deep extensor muscle. Therefore, it is imperative to avoid occipital fixation to minimize such risk and to ensure the preservation of C0–1 motion.

- **Occipital neuralgia**can occur following C2 root resection but has not been observed to affect patient-reported outcomes and quality of life significantly.

- **Neurological worsening**is most commonly observed during vertical reduction. The risk increases among patients with T2 signal changes in MRI and reduced canal diameter. This can be prevented with the adjunct use of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM).

- **Dysphagia –**especially following the “military tuck” positioning that can lead to glossoptosis. This is also increased among patients with OC fixation in retraction posture.
