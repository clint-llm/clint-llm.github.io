The mylohyoid nerve is a nerve with many different variations. The length of the mylohyoid may vary depending on the origin of its branch point and the path of the nerve. The mylohyoid nerve is classically a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, but in some instances, the mylohyoid nerve is a direct branch from the mandibular nerve. The path of the mylohyoid nerve usually occurs in the mylohyoid groove, but the nerve can descend toward the mylohyoid muscle outside of the mylohyoid groove. Once the mylohyoid nerve reaches the mylohyoid muscle, it branches into several smaller branches to innervate the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior muscle belly of the digastric muscle. The number of branches the mylohyoid nerve forms is highly variable.

In some rare cases, the mylohyoid nerve was found to have a communicating nerve branch connecting it to the lingual nerve.
