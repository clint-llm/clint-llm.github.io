Clinical history and an electrocardiographic recording during a spontaneous episode are major elements in the clinical diagnosis of vasospastic angina.

The international study group of coronary vasomotion disorders known as COVADIS, created a diagnostic criterion to determine the presence of Prinzmetal angina. These include:

- Clinical response to nitrates during a spontaneous anginal episode.

- Transient electrocardiographic changes with concern for ischemia during a spontaneous anginal episode. These include ST-segment elevation or depression = 0.1 mV or new U waves.

- Evidence of coronary vasospasm during angiography.

Because of the lack of electrocardiographic evidence, further studies might be considered. The initial workup should be to evaluate the possibility of fixed obstructive coronary artery disease.

If appropriated, a noninvasive stress test can be performed. Most of these patients will have a normal stress test or negative for ischemia. However, a subgroup of patients (10% to 30%) can have exercise-induced spasms with electrocardiographic changes for ischemia that are not specific for vasospastic angina versus fixed coronary obstruction. This group of patients should undergo coronary catheterization to determine obstructive coronary disease. Also, a negative stress test with suspicion for coronary obstruction should be evaluated with cardiac catheterization.

During cardiac catheterization, coronary spasms can be visualized spontaneously or under drug induction.

Ergonovine, acetylcholine, and hyperventilation, can be used in the catheterization laboratory in an attempt to confirm the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm. These tests are warranted only when the diagnosis of vasospastic angina is suspected but not firmly established. At present, provocative pharmacologic testing is not frequently performed.

An ambulatory electrocardiogram also can be used to record transient electrocardiographic changes during acute spontaneous events.

It is important to remember that when a patient has acute chest pain or angina, the focus is to evaluate for possible fixed coronary obstruction.
