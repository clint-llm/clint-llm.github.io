Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a narrowing or blockage of the portal vein by a blood clot. Thrombosis can develop in the main body of the portal vein or its intrahepatic branches and may even extend to the splenic or superior mesenteric veins. PVT frequently occurs with cirrhosis of the liver. It may also occur with malignancy, abdominal sepsis, pancreatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or other conditions, particularly conditions involving hypercoagulable states. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of portal vein thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiologies of portal vein thrombosis. 
- Review the typical presenting features of portal vein thrombosis. 
- Describe the evaluation that should be done in a patient that is diagnosed with portal vein thrombosis. 
- Employ a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients with portal vein thrombosis.
