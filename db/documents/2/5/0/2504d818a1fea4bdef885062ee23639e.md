Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with acute tubular necrosis, leading to 3 possible mechanisms of injury to the renal tubular epithelial cells:

- Afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction in response to tubuloglomerular feedback

- Backleak of glomerular filtrate

- Tubular obstruction

**Clinical Phases**

These injury patterns lead to the following 4 phases clinically:

**Initiation
**

The initiation phase is characterized by an acute decrease in GFR and a sudden increase in serum creatinine and BUN concentrations.

**Extension**

The extension phase consists of 2 major events:

- Ongoing hypoxia following the ischemic event

- An inflammatory response

These events are more pronounced in the corticomedullary junction of the kidney. In this phase, damage to the renal vascular endothelial cell is responsible for the ischemia of the renal tubular epithelial cell. The cells in the outer medulla continue to undergo injury and death with the combination of both necrosis and apoptosis. While in the outer cortex, the blood flow returns to near normal, leading to cellular repair. As the injury worsens in the cortico-medullary junction (CMJ), the GFR falls due to the continuous release of cytokines and chemokines enhancing the inflammatory cascade.

**Maintenance**

The maintenance phase is established by cellular repair, apoptosis, migration, and proliferation to maintain cellular and tubule integrity. The cellular function improves slowly as the cells repair and reorganize. The blood flow returns to the normal range, and the cells establish intracellular homeostasis.

**Recovery**

The recovery phase is the continuation of the maintenance phase in which cellular differentiation continues, and epithelial polarity is reestablished, improving the renal function.
