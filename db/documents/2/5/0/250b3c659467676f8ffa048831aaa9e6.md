When metabolized and eliminated, most nNMBs undergo either an ester hydrolysis process performed by non-specific esterases at the synaptic cleft or by the Hoffman elimination, which is a spontaneous non-enzymatic breakdown that occurs at physiologic pH. For atracurium and cisatracurium, their Hoffman elimination produces the metabolite laudanosine. If allowed to build up like in cases of hepatic failure, this metabolite can cause central nervous system (CNS) excitation to the point of seizure activity.

**In the Event of Overdose or Perioperative Reversal of nNMB Activity**

Initially, all neuromuscular blockers were reversed via acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (neostigmine, edrophonium, pyridostigmine).

Now sugammadex, a steroidal nNMB binder, is implemented in the algorithm since it has been shown to reverse the effects of nNMBs with less incidence of laryngeal collapse. Sugammadex works to bind nNMB molecules in a 1:1 ratio, the binding producing a concentration gradient in the synaptic cleft, increasing the diffusion of these molecules away from the postsynaptic membrane.
