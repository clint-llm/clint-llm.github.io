Most of these disorders are inherited and linked to specific genes. These affect the synthesis of various proteins at the plasma membrane extracellular matrix interface. The most common mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive. Duchenne is X linked and is, therefore, is seen only in boys. The majority of the females are carriers, but some can have mild to moderate muscle weakness. Both Duchenne and Becker dystrophy result from a mutation in the dystrophin gene, the locus of which is Xp21.2. Duchenne dystrophy results when the protein is abnormally truncated, whereas Becker dystrophy is from partially functional dystrophin.

Other congenital dystrophies include walker Warburg, muscle eye brain, and Fukuyama disease are together called a- dystroglycanopathies (because of mutation seen in a common protein a-dystroglycan). Myotonic dystrophy is usually transmitted as autosomal dominant and results from trinucleotide (CTG) repeat expansion on the of the DMPK gene at locus 19q13.3.
