**Poor Prognostic Factors**

- If a complicating illness like congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is not present, then status asthmaticus has a good prognosis provided treatment has ensued timely. A delay in initiating the treatment is a bad prognostic factor.

- Leatherman et al. found an incidence of muscle weakness in asthmatic patients treated with neuromuscular blockers and steroids of 29%.

- Adnet et al. evaluated complications and morbidities associated with a prolonged neuromuscular blockade in status asthmaticus patients. The incidence of post-intubation myopathy, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and duration of ICU stay was higher in the neuromuscular blockade group in the population involving five centers.

-  A study by Afessa et al. also reported a higher incidence of acidemia and carbon dioxide retention in nonsurvivors than survivors with acute asthmatics.

- The need for mechanical ventilation has also been reported as a poor prognostic factor.
