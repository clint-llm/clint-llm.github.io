Spinal cord injuries are categorized into six syndromes.

**1. Brown-Sequard Syndrome**

This accounts for 1 to 4 % of the traumatic spinal cord injuries. There are two types of presentations called the pure Brown-Sequard syndrome and the Brown-Sequard syndrome plus. The prognosis is the same.

**Etiology**- Commonly penetrating stab injuries, other causes are blunt injuries, neoplasia, vascular, cord herniation.

**Clinical Presentation**

At the level of lesion: Ipsilateral flaccid paralysis due to anterior horn injury and a complete loss of sensation at that dermatome due to the posterior horn injury.

Below the level of lesion: Ipsilateral upper motor neuron lesion leading to spastic paraparesis due to lateral corticospinal tract injury, and loss of vibration and proprioceptive sensations due to posterior column lesion.

Contralateral to the side of injury: loss of pain and temperature sensations due to the spinothalamic tract injury that begins a few segments below the lesion.

**2. Central Cord Syndrome**

This is the most common of all the spinal cord injury syndromes and accounts for 9%.

**Etiology;**Commonly occurs in older patients who experience hyperextension injury with comorbid cervical spondylosis. The cord is compressed between the bone spur and inward budging of the ligamentum flavum. Other causes include falls, motor vehicle accidents.

**Clinical Presentation**

The patients have more upper limb involvement relative to the extent of the lower limb involvement. Bladder involvement and loss of sensation below the level of the lesion can be seen.

**3. Posterior Cord Syndrome**

This is the least common and accounts for less than 1%.

**Etiology**- Trauma, vitamin B12 deficiency leading to subacute combined degeneration of the cord, multiple sclerosis caused by demyelination, tabes dorsalis, vascular occlusions.

**Clinical Presentation**

There is sensory impairment leading to loss of touch, proprioceptive, and vibratory sensation below the level of the lesion as the dorsal column is involved. Pain, temperature sensation, and motor functions are spared. They will have a positive Romberg test with sensory ataxia.

**4. Anterior Cord Syndrome**

This has the worst prognosis compared to the other injuries.

**Etiology**- The anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord is a watershed zone, thus inadequate vascular supply due to occlusion of the anterior spinal artery. Emboli, post-surgery complications, or hypotension can cause this. Contrary to the posterior cord syndrome, flexion injuries can also cause this syndrome.

**Clinical Presentation**

Motor function is affected due to the corticospinal tract and anterior horn involvement. Pain and temperature sensation is impaired at or below the lesion due to spinothalamic tract involvement. Autonomic presentation such as sexual dysfunction; bladder, and bowel dysfunction is due to intermediate gray zone injury.

**5. Cauda Equina Syndrome**

This is rare, with an incidence of 1 to 5 % of all the spinal pathologies. There is a compression of the spinal nerves and spinal nerve roots of the cauda equina, especially the lumbar segments. The cord is spared.

**Etiology**- Lumbar disc herniation, trauma, abscess, tumors.

**Clinical Presentation**

They will present as a lower motor neuron lesion causing flaccid paralysis with lower limb weakness, numbness, tingling, bladder, and bowel dysfunction. On examination, there may be areflexia, variable perineal anesthesia, decreased sphincter tone, and absent anal reflex.It is strongly recommended to decompress within 24 hours from the time of presentation to avoid residual dysfunction.

This syndrome is commonly misunderstood with conus medullaris syndrome as they have overlapping clinical presentations. However, cauda equina syndrome is a lower motor neuron lesion as the cord is spared, as opposed to conus medullaris syndrome, where upper motor neuron signs such as spasticity and hyperreflexia are present.

**6. Conus Medullaris Syndrome**

It is characterized by damage to the sacral cord called the conus medullaris and lumbar roots within the vertebral canal.

**Etiology:**Trauma and tumors

**Clinical Presentation**

Lower extremity spastic paresis, hyperreflexia, saddle anesthesia. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be present. The presentation can include both upper and lower motor neuron signs. Early decompression surgery must be done to avoid poor outcomes during recovery.
