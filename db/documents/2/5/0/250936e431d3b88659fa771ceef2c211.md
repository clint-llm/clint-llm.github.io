Macroscopically salpingitis isthmica nodosa causes nodular thickening of the tunica muscularis. However, diagnosis can only be confirmed histologically by the presence of diverticula within a hypertrophic, irregular myosalpin.

There is often surrounding fibrous tissue or hypertrophy of smooth muscle, and there may be endometrial type stroma around the glands. The stromal response is typically minimal, and there is usually no significant atypia. These changes commonly occur in the proximal two-thirds of the fallopian tube. Majmudar suggested a histological classification system grade 1-3, based upon the depth of the lumen within the myosalpinx.
