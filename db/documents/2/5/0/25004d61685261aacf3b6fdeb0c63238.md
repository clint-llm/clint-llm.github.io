Complement deficiency can lead to life-threatening infections as well as long-term autoimmune conditions and organ injuries. The interprofessional team of the primary care clinician and emergency medicineÂ clinician must be aware of the clinical features of patients with complement deficiency or immunodeficiency in general. Relying on acute treatment when the patient is acutely ill may not be adequate to improve the patient's quality of life and clinical outcome. A high index of suspicion is important, and early referral to allergist/immunologists may be important when the diagnosis of immunodeficiency is not clear.
