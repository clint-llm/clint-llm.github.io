Prior to surgery, it is critical to discuss with the patient what results to expect from surgery, what to expect during the postoperative period, and what the risks of the procedure are. Appropriate expectation management will potentially improve the patient's perception of the surgical outcomes and decrease the frequency of postoperative phone calls to the surgeon's office. Additionally, these discussions strengthen the rapport between doctor and patient, which may be protective from litigation in the event of adverse surgical outcomes.

When patients undergo brow lifting and/or blepharoplasty for functional reasons, it is important to document visual field deficits for third-party payers.

Lastly, standard preoperative photography is essential. Images should include a frontal view in repose and with brow elevation, at a minimum. If blepharoplasty is planned, profile views of the eyes in neutral gaze, closed, and upward gaze may also be helpful. Preoperative photographs not only aid with surgical planning and provide medicolegal documentation when combined with postoperative images but should also be posted in the operating room during the procedure for reference.
