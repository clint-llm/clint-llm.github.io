Biologic response modifiers (BRMs), also known as immunomodulators, are the class of medications that target the disease-causing mechanism. They are used in autoimmune diseases as first-line medications or after the failure of conventional agents. Serious infections are the most feared complications and require screening before initiation, and monitoring while patients are taking the medications. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of various autoimmune conditions with the use of BRMs and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these medications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for biologic response modifiers.
- Identify the adverse events associated with biologic response modifiers.
- Review the importance of monitoring patients taking biologic response modifiers.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving biologic response modifiers.
