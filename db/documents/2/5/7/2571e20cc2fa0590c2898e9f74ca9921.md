In patients at high risk for thrombotic events such as advanced age, cancer, and orthopedic surgery, multiple doses of Von Willebrand factor should be given with caution due to the increased risk of arterial thrombosis. Venous thromboembolic complications have been noted in a few patients with vWD, which can be attributed to sustained high levels of FVIII due to multiple closely spaced infusions of FVIII/vWF concentrates. Low molecular weight heparin can be used prophylactically in such patients, and von Willebrand factor should be used with caution in patients with a high risk of venous thrombosis.

Some patients with vWD- type 3 can develop alloantibodies after multiple transfusions; in such patients, infusion of vWF concentrates is ineffective and can also cause life-threatening post-infusion anaphylaxis due to the formation of immune complexes.
