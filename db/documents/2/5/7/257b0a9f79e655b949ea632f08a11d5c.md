A common complication that arises during regular spontaneous vaginal deliveries is shoulder dystocia.  Shoulder dystocia occurs when the anterior shoulder of the fetus becomes lodged behind the maternal pubic symphysis or the posterior shoulder lodged behind the maternal sacral promontory.  The impaction of either shoulder impedes descent and expulsion of the fetus.  There are many documented and practiced maneuvers primarily aimed to resolve shoulder dystocia.  The most common of these maneuvers is the well-known McRobert’s maneuver.  Current American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines recommend the use of McRobert’s Maneuver as the initial maneuver to resolve the shoulder dystocia. The reason being is that McRobert’s maneuver is “simple, logical, effective.”
