The tracheal bronchus is a rare congenital anomaly described as a collection of bronchial variations arising from the trachea directed towards the upper lung lobe.Â Usually, they arise within 2 cm of the carina but can arise anywhere from the cricoid cartilage to the carina. Some authors opine that if this abnormal bronchus supplies the entire upper lung lobe, then it is called bronchus suis or pig bronchus.
