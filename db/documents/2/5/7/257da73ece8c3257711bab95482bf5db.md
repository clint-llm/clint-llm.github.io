Hereditary bleeding disorders are due to the absence or deficiency of specific clotting proteins which act as procoagulants through precise interactions in the clotting cascade.  The three most common are hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) and von Willebrand disease.   Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting 1 in 5000 males making it the most common congenital coagulopathy.  Hemophilia B is an X-linked genetic coagulopathy affecting 1 in 30000 male births.  Hemophilia B is also known as Christmas disease. The origin of its namesake is from Steven Christmas, the first patient diagnosed with Hemophilia B in 1952.  Since hemophilia is genetic, its prevalence increases in populations in which higher levels of consanguinity exists.  Females may be asymptomatic carriers of the hemophilia gene or may be found to have a partial deficiency of the specific factors involved. Von Willebrand disease is an autosomal dominant trait with no predilection for sex; however, women are more likely to exhibit symptoms as a result of increased bleeding during menstruation.
