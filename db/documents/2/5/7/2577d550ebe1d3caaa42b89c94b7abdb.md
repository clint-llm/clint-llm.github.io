Surgical management should be planned considering the specific hereditary colorectal cancer. Accordingly, the treatment of choice for patients with attenuated and familial adenomatous polyposis, with a significantly large number of rectal adenomas, is proctocolectomy with ileostomy or ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). However, the timing of treatment should be individualized. On the other hand, if all of the rectal adenomas greater than 5 mm in size can be removed endoscopically, rectal sparing alternatives with total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TAC-IRA) is the preferred management. Moreover, in patients with greater than 20-lifetime adenomas, MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) should be considered. Accordingly, patients with biallelic MYH mutations are recommended for annual colonoscopy and polypectomy for polyps that can be removed endoscopically.
