We have previously detailed the approach to hypercholesterolemia in this series and will be brief.

FH is a monogenic disorder with a very high LDL-C, such as 200 mg/dl in heterozygous FH and 600 mg/dl in the homozygous FH, and promotes premature ASCVD. In these patients, the excess cholesterol from LDL permeates the intima and accumulates as fatty streak lesions, an early step in atherosclerosis. It is demonstrated that native LDL does not cause lipid accumulation; whereas, the modified forms of LDL, such as oxidized, acetylated, and glycated, possess pro-atherogenic properties. While it remains yet to be proven, the best hypothesis is that the oxidatively modified LDL promotes fatty streak formation (foam cells). The oxidized LDL can bind to SRA, CD36, and TLR-4 and elicit several inflammatory pathways.

The preferred drug for these patients is the use of statins, which are shown to decrease LDL-C by 22% to 50% and reduce ASCVD events and mortality. If adequate control is not achieved, additional drugs, such as ezetimibe (cholesterol absorption inhibitor) and/or bile acid sequestrants, along with statins, could be used. Recently research has shown that the use of PCSK9 inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies) along with statins could lower LDL-C up to 60% in these patients. Hence, LDL-C can be lowered by both lifestyle modifications and medication.
