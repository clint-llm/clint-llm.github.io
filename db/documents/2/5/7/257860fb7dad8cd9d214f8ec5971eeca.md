# Continuing Education Activity

Vertigo is a common presenting complaint in primary care and emergency departments. It is a symptom of vestibular dysfunction and has been described as a sensation of motion, most commonly rotational motion. It is important to differentiate vertiginous symptoms from other forms of dizziness, such as lightheadedness, which is most often associated with presyncope. This activity describes the evaluation and management of vertigo and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of vertigo.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with vertigo.
- Explain the common physical exam findings differentiating central vertigo from peripheral vertigo.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by vertigo.

# Introduction

Vertigo is a common presenting complaint in primary care offices and emergency departments. It is a symptom of vestibular dysfunction and has been described as a sensation of motion, most commonly rotational motion. It is important to differentiate vertiginous symptoms from other forms of dizziness, such as lightheadedness, which is most often associated with presyncope.

# Etiology

Vertigo is most often caused by a dysfunction in the vestibular system from a peripheral or central lesion.

Peripheral etiologies include the more common causes of vertigo, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and Ménière disease.

Central etiologies of vertigo should always be considered in the differential. Ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes, particularly involving the cerebellum or vertebrobasilar system, are life-threatening and must be ruled out by history, physical and other diagnostic tests if warranted.

Other causes can lead to vertigo. These include medication-induced vertigo and psychologic disorders, including mood, anxiety, and somatization. Medications that have been associated with vertigo include anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and salicylates.

# Epidemiology

Vertigo affects both men and women but is about two to three times more common in women than men.

# Pathophysiology

Asymmetry in the vestibular system accounts for the symptom of vertigo. Asymmetry may result from damage or dysfunction in the peripheral system, such as the vestibular labyrinth or vestibular nerve or a central disturbance in the brainstem or cerebellum.Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Acute cerebellitis is encephalitis that is restricted to the cerebellum. It is most common in children. Varicella-zoster virus is the leading cause. Cholesteatoma can be acquired or congenital, occurring in the pars flaccida or pars tensa. It is the proliferation of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

# History and Physical

The initial goal in diagnosis is determining whether or not the patient is truly experiencing vertigo, as most patients will report dizziness as a chief complaint. To elicit true vertigo symptoms, a provider may ask, "Does it feel like the room is spinning around you?".

Once a time course has been established, it is important to assess for associated symptoms as this can further help differentiate a central from a peripheral etiology. Nausea and vomiting are typical with acute episodes of vertigo and are not specific for any particular etiology. Since it is important to rule out central causes that may be progressive or life-threatening, such as a vertebrobasilar stroke or multiple sclerosis, providers must ask about any focal neurologic deficits such as diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and numbness or weakness.

When combined with a complete history, a focused physical exam can help further elicit a peripheral from a central cause of vertigo. Assessing for nystagmus is a key portion of the physical exam when a patient presents with vertiginous symptoms.

Other physical exam techniques may be used to diagnose and treat vertigo including the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.

Gait and balance testing can further aid in localization. Patients with unilateral peripheral disorders often lean or fall toward the side of the lesion; whereas, patients with cerebellar lesions are often unable to walk without assistance, and the direction of falling with Romberg testing is variable.

A significant percentage of primary care and specialist physicians neglect the basics of history and physical leading to unnecessary imaging and medications.

The otoscopic exam should be completed to rule out an obvious infection such as acute otitis media, and bedside tests of hearing can be useful in differentiating other causes of vertigo. Weber and Rinne tests are performed at the bedside to detect conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.

# Evaluation

The acronym STANDING describes a four-step algorithm based on nystagmus observation and well-known diagnostic maneuvers. It includes the discrimination between **S**pon**TA**neous and positional nystagmus, evaluation of the**N**ystagmus**D**irection, the head**I**mpulse test, and the evaluation of equilibrium (sta**N**din**G**).

# Treatment / Management

Treatment of vertigo is dependent upon the etiology, and often, treating the underlying etiology will improve the symptoms of vertigo.

Medications may be useful to suppress vestibular symptoms in acute episodes that may last a few hours to days. The most common medications used for symptomatic relief include antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and antiemetics. The most common antihistamine used is meclizine, which is safe during pregnancy.

Additional non-pharmacologic treatments for patients with permanent unilateral or bilateral vestibular dysfunction include physical therapy with vestibular rehabilitation.

In some patients, particularly those diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy is recommended. In vestibular neuritis, corticosteroids are recommended in the acute setting in addition to vestibular rehabilitation. In patients with Ménière disease, lifestyle adjustments in addition to medication and vestibular rehabilitation have shown to be effective.

Patients with Ménière disease may be particularly sensitive to a high salt diet, caffeine, and alcohol. Avoiding known triggers can help to alleviate symptoms. Diuretics may also be prescribed when diet modification alone is not sufficient in controlling symptoms. Acute episodes can be symptomatically treated with vestibular suppressants like meclizine.

Patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo benefit from non-pharmacologic agents. The primary treatment for BPPV is focused on head rotation maneuvers that displace calcium deposits back to the vestibule through canalith repositioning or the Epley maneuver.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of vertigo is extensive as it can arise from a central or peripheral lesion in the vestibular system. Therefore, it is important to differentiate vertigo from symptoms of disequilibrium and pre-syncope, such as imbalance and lightheadedness. An extensive list of metabolic, vascular, inflammatory, iatrogenic, and endocrine causes can lead to these symptoms.

- Acute anemia

- Anxiety disorders

- Benign positional vertigo

- Brain neoplasms

- Chronic anemia

- Giant cell arteritis

- Herpes simplex encephalitis

- Labyrinthitis

- Mastoiditis

- Ménière disease

- Meningitis

- Migraine headache

- Multiple sclerosis

- Stroke

- Stroke

- Vertebrobasilar atherothrombotic disease

- Vestibular neuronitis

- Wernicke encephalopathy

# Prognosis

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence rates are 50% at 5 years. There is the persistence of dizziness related to anxiety in almost a third of patients 1 year after vestibular neuritis.

According to Perrez-Garrigues et al., the number of episodes of vertigo is higher in the first years of the disease and decreases in later years regardless of whether patients receive treatment; most patients reach a "steady-state phase free of vertigo."

As with vertigo, loss of hearing is highest in the early years of the disease and stabilizes in later years. Usually, there is no recovery from hearing loss.

The acute vertigo of labyrinthitis should resolve within a couple of days; however, milder symptoms may persist for a number of weeks. Provided the patient had no serious neurological sequelae, the prognosis is usually good. However, patients with neurological complications may require further interventions. For example, ventriculoperitoneal shunts may be required in patients with hydrocephalus secondary to bacterial meningitis.

# Complications

The key to arriving at the diagnosis is to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness or imbalance and distinguish central from peripheral causes of vertigo. An accurate diagnosis is essential in life-threatening causes. These include neoplasms, infection, and cerebrovascular accidents.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Labyrinthitis is often secondary to another infection, such as otitis media or meningitis. Therefore early diagnosis and effective management of these should prevent the development of labyrinthitis or at least minimize the risk of long-term complications. It is also key that populations are up to date with their vaccinations to reduce the risk of contracting measles, mumps, or rubella. Patients with vertigo should be encouraged to attempt mobilizing as soon as possible, as this is believed to help with vestibular compensation and prognosis.

Ménière disease is suspected if the patient experiences loss of hearing in one ear with attacks of vertigo which last from several minutes to several hours, and tinnitus. Patients who experience these symptoms must seek consultation with their general practitioner or the emergency department.

In the cases of BPPV, it is best to explain that it is a non-life-threatening condition. Its favorable prognosis reassures patients that it is not a severe condition. Patients should also be warned that recurrences are very common even after successful management with repositioning maneuvers so that further treatment may be necessary.

# Pearls and Other Issues

Recent group consensus recommendations were against radiographic imaging for patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for BPPV if there are no additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV. There is no need for vestibular testing for patients who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms. The routine treatment of BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines should be avoided.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Vertigo is a common complaint best evaluated and treated by an interprofessional team consisting of primary care providers, otolaryngologists, neurologists, specialty trained nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists. Most patients can be diagnosed clinically, but some patients should have imaging and referral to specialists physicians. Otolaryngology and neuroscience nurses provide patient education, arrange testing, monitor response, and report to treating physicians. Patients with BPPV can benefit from physical therapy. Pharmacists review prescriptions, check for interactions, and inform patients about potential side effects. [Level 5]
