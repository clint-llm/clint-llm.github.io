**Neurologic Disease**

Numerous diseases affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems, which ultimately affect gait. Due to the intricacies in the communications between these two systems, even subtle changes can lead to gait disturbances. Disease states, including Parkinson's, Huntington's, normal pressure hydrocephalus, can alter the neurocognitive functions to the point that walking can become a difficult task. The weakness of the hip and lower extremity muscles commonly cause gait disturbances. Cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, Charcot Marie Tooth disease, ataxia-telangiectasia, spinal muscular atrophy, peroneal neuropathy, andÂ microvascular white-matter disease all cause significant gait disabilities.

**Electrolyte Imbalance**

Electrolyte disorders include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia can cause gait disorders. Hyponatremia, being one of the most common, can lead to severe neurological symptoms that affect gait.

**Vitamin Deficiency**

Common vitamin deficiencies contributing to gait imbalances include folate, vitamin B12, vitamin E, and copper deficiency.

**Other**

Pain, vascular, traumatic, autoimmune, inflammatory (vasculitis), metabolic, neoplastic, paraneoplastic, and tabes dorsalis may be involved.

**Psychiatric**

Anxiety, depression, and malingering have to be excluded.
