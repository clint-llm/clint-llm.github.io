Toxic doses of this medication are possible if the dosage exceeds 60 mg/day; the lethal dose is 75 mg/kg. There have been 20 acute overdoses and ten fatalities from tranylcypromine. If the patient takes this drug at toxic doses, you will see dizziness, sedation, insomnia, restlessness, headache, ataxia, cardiovascular effects, respiratory depression, or coma in your patient. A case report from January 2017 revealed that amphetamine and methamphetamine appeared in a patient's urine who had suffered from a fatal tranylcypromine overdose. This finding brings into question and prompts further research investigating the breakdown of tranylcypromine into amphetamine and methamphetamine and the dangers that can impose.
