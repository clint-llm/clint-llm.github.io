Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory condition of the colon which results in diffuse friability and superficial erosions on the colonic wall and associated bleeding. It is the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease worldwide. Characteristically, it involves inflammation restricted to the mucosa and submucosa of the colon. Typically, the disease starts in the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous manner. In the United States, the disease accounts for a quarter-million provider visits annually. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ulcerative colitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.
