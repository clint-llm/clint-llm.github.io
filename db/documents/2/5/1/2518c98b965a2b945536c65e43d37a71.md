The prognosis of PPC depends on the stage of PPC, surgical decision-making, surgical expertise, timing, and meticulous clinical evaluation. In type 3 and 4 PPC and cases with pre-existing posterior capsular thinning or dehiscence, the prognosis might be guarded due to posterior capsular breach, vitreous prolapse in the anterior chamber, nucleus drop, and failure to implant IOL due to lack of capsular support. Cases with spontaneous rupture of PC may also have a guarded prognosis. PPC cases in skilled expert surgical hands usually have excellent visual outcomes.
