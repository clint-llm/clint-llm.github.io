Here are some important points to take note of:

- The first clinical symptoms to appear in MPS II are somatic symptoms. The parents of the patients first notice coarseness of facial features, delayed development of motor and cognitive milestones, short stature, and abdominal distention.

- The two approved treatment ERT and HSCT are both maximally effective in relieving somatic symptoms when administered to patients earlier in their clinical course. Both treatments are ineffective in improving musculoskeletal symptoms if they are given after the appearance of skeletal symptoms.

- HSCT is more effective than ERT for the treatment of neurological symptoms as it can cross the blood-brain barrier. The HSCT is minimally effective in the treatment of cognitive decline if the treatment is initiated after the onset of symptoms.

- It is important to initiate treatment early in the disease course, as both ERT and HSCT become less effective at later stages of the disease. There is a need to make more effort in the early diagnosis of the disease. There is a need to provide cost-effective and easily available diagnostic facilities for newborn screening of MPS II.
