EEG is the only test that can identify the IIC in the clinical setting. The study is typically set up in accordance with the 10-20 international system by a trained EEG technologist and interpreted by an epileptologist, clinical neurophysiologist, or general neurologist. Continuous video monitoring is required to ensure no clinical correlation, which would otherwise render the pattern meeting the criteria for an electroclinical seizure.    In addition to not meeting accepted criteria for electrographic or electroclinical seizures, a pattern on the IIC must meet one of the three following criteria:

- Epileptiform discharges that average ≥1.0 Hz and ≤2.5 Hz for at least 10 seconds (10 to 25 discharges in 10 sec)

- Epileptiform discharges that average ≥0.5Hz and ≤1.0 Hz for at least 10 seconds with a plus modifier or fluctuation

- Lateralized rhythmic delta activity >1.0Hz for at least 10 seconds with a plus modifier or fluctuation

Plus modifiers include additional features that render a pattern more ictal-appearing and can include embedded fast frequencies (+F) superimposed on either periodic discharges or rhythmic delta activity, embedded rhythmic frequencies (+R) superimposed on periodic discharges, embedded sharp discharges (+S) superimposed on rhythmic delta activity, a combination of fast frequencies and rhythmic delta activity (+FR) superimposed on periodic discharges, or a combination of fast frequencies and sharp discharges (+FS) superimposed on rhythmic delta activity. Fluctuation refers to ≥ 3 changes, not more than one minute apart, in frequency (by at least .5/s), ≥ 3 changes in morphology, or ≥ 3 changes in location by at least 1 standard inter-electrode distance, with these changes not qualifying as evolving.
