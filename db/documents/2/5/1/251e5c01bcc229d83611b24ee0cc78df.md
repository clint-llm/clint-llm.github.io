Hepatitis D causes the same histological changes in the liver parenchyma as other viral infections. It results in necrosis and inflammation of the hepatic cells. In acute disease, there is intralobular infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, macrophages) and cytoplasmic eosinophilia. Chronic hepatitis is characterized by periportal necrosis and often accompanied by nodular changes.
