Retinal detachments constitute a serious ocular condition and can lead to permanent vision loss. When the retina, the neurosensory layer, detaches from the back of the eye, it loses its oxygen and nutrient supply leading to the death of the tissue. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to avoid significant morbidity associated with this condition. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of retinal detachments and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors that may predispose a patient to have a retinal detachment.
- Identify the common presentation of a patient with a retinal detachment.
- Outline the different types of treatments for retinal detachments.
- Review the importance of interprofessional care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by retinal detachments.
