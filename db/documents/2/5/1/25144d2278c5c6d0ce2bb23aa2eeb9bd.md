Preoperative modification of the risk factors is the most effective way to prevent postoperative morbidity and mortality. Appropriate postoperative care can also diminish operative risk if contemplated before surgical treatment. After surgery, admission to a critical care unit may prevent postoperative complications more effectively than escalating postoperative care once complications develop.

An expert opinion is of the lowest value in evidence-based medicine. Hence, a surgeon’s experience and expertise cannot be used solely to guide risk management. Elaboration of the modern risk prediction models aims to establish a standardized and convenient tool for surgical risk calculation that may be used by any physician regardless of specialty and experience. Creating a comprehensive statistical model that would include all possible risk factors, quantitatively measure them, consider all possible interactions between them, and be suitable for any patient and the surgical condition seems to be a difficult task for future generations of physicians and scientists.

For all elective cases, it is important to get the patient assessed in a preoperative clinic, which is usually run by the anesthesiologists, nurses, and internists. All patients with risk factors should be thoroughly evaluated before being cleared for surgery. To minimize risk, an interprofessional team approach will result in the best outcomes. Initial screening is typically performed by the nurse providing initial management of the case. The nurse should access vitals, screen for food or fluid intake before the procedure, and identify co-morbidities that may place the patient at high risk. If potential drug-drug interactions are present, a pharmacist should be consulted to make recommendations on managing concerning medication issues. The nurse anesthetist usually performs a more detailed preoperative assessment. If any concerns develop, the preoperative team should involve an interprofessional decision involving nursing, anesthesia, and the surgeons to develop a safe plan to continue the operation or, if possible, delay the procedure until appropriate precautions are taken. Working together as a team, educating the patient and family, and minimizing risks will result in the best outcomes. [Level 5]
