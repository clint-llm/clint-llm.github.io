Complications from the treatment of vaginal cancer depend on many factors and can be divided into treatment-based and patient-based. Treatment-based factors include radiation intensity, type of surgery, and type of chemotherapy. Patient-based factors include age, hormonal status, and personal hygiene. The complications from radiation include edema, erythema, and mucositis with or without ulceration. Usually, these effects resolve within a few months after treatment.
