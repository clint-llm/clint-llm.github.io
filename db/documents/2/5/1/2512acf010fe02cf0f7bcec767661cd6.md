**Mammography**

The mammographic abnormality reported in the majority of patients with tubular carcinomas is a mass lesion with central density, occasionally with microcalcifications.

**Ultrasonography**

Ultrasonography is particularly helpful in detecting some of the mammographically occult tumors.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

On magnetic resonance imaging, some authors observed enhancement patterns that could help to differentiate tubular carcinoma from other histological subtypes.
