MAC is often clinically indistinguishable from other flesh-colored tumors on the head and neck. In contrast to many other tumors, MAC can be profoundly infiltrative and has a predilection for significant perineural spread. Therefore, early and definitive diagnosis is key to allowing for early and complete treatment and prevention of morbidity.

Definitive early diagnosis is best established by providing the dermatopathologist with a biopsy sample of adequate tissue depth since a large part of the correct diagnosis depends upon visualization of tumor extension into the deeper dermis and possible observation of perineural invasion as well. A superficial biopsy can lead to an incorrect diagnosis, so an incisional or deep punch biopsy is greatly preferred if MAC is suspected.

**Skin Examination**

- If a biopsy diagnosis reveals a MAC, a full-body-skin examination should be performed.

**Lymph Nodes**

- Although regional metastases are rare, a lymph node exam should be performed.

- A Sentinal lymph node biopsy can be performed if lymph nodes are detected on examination.

**Imaging**

Imaging is not necessary in most cases of MAC. CT, MRI, or a fat-suppression MRI protocol could be considered if there is a concern for possible perineural spread or local invasion.

**Dermoscopy**

Dermoscopic findings have been reported in a limited number of case reports, with one of the most characteristic findings being the presence of whitish "clods" of varying sizes. These white clods likely represent keratinous cysts.
