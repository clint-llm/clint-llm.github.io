Each medication used in PPS comes with specific possible adverse effects, as detailed above. The goal of PPS is to choose the correct agent for the specific patient that is best suited for the indicated procedure. The ideal application of PPS is to have the patient sedated for a minimal amount of time to perform the procedure safely. The provider must always be aware of possible adverse events associated with the medications given and the patient's risk factors.Â The most feared complication in PPS is airway compromise, often as a result of oversedation. The provider must be able to identify signs of airway compromise and perform advanced airway skills if needed.
