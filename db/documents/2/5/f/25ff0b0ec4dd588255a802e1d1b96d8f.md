Elevated TPP is a risk factor for ventilator-induced lung injury. For that reason, TPP measurements sometimes guide positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration in mechanically ventilated patients, often in those suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there are no data to suggest that routine use of esophageal manometry is required to optimize ventilator settings and decrease ventilator-associated lung injury in patients with ARDS, although it can be useful in complex situations to differentiate between lung and chest wall mechanics.

An esophageal catheter with an esophageal balloon can measure esophageal pressure, which is a surrogate for intrapleural pressure due to its location. Since TPP is the alveolar pressure minus the intrapleural pressure, TPP can be calculated relatively easily on mechanically ventilated patients.
