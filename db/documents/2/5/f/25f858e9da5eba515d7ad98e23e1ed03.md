As the level of the IC contains many important structures, IC lesions can result in several clinical syndromes. Lesions of the IC include tumors, hemorrhages, and other derangements. Damage in one IC has resulted in many auditory issues, such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, audiogenic seizures, auditory agnosia, deficits in contralateral hemispace sound localization, and difficulty recognizing speech among other concurrent noises on the ipsilateral side.

In animal models, deep brain stimulation of the external cortex of the IC results in reduced tinnitus, and the central nucleus has been implicated in the generation of tinnitus.

The IC may have some involvement in audiogenic seizures, as studies of genetically epilepsy-prone rats have revealed IC excitatory and inhibitory balance derangements, which may play a role in seizure initiation.

Auditory evoked potentials are useful for diagnosing pathologies in the auditory pathway as well as monitoring the auditory system during surgery. The waveform of the auditory evoked potentials corresponds to different portions of the pathway, with wave V (and the negative potential that follows) attributed to the activity of the lateral lemniscus and IC.
