In situ thrombosis most commonly affects the femoral or popliteal arteries, while emboli most widely lodge in aortic, iliac, femoral, and popliteal bifurcations. Once arterial blood flow is impeded, under-perfused tissues switch to anaerobic metabolism, producing lactate, causing acidosis, and leading to increased free radicals. Prolonged and untreated, this state will cause the hypoxic muscle to run out of its ATP stores. This is followed by impaired functioning of the calcium/sodium pump and sodium/potassium-ATPase leading to intracellular calcium leakage into the myocytes. Increasing free calcium negatively interacts with the muscle's myosin, actin, and proteases and eventually causes muscle fiber necrosis. In addition, intracellular potassium, phosphate, creatine kinase, and myoglobin are released into the systemic circulation due to the necrotic muscle.

Under resting circumstances, normal blood flow to peripheral muscle groups averages around 300Â to 400 mL/min.

An atherosclerotic blood vessel leads to stenosis, which can cause occlusion at some point. In atherosclerosis, each stenotic segment reduces the pressure head experienced by peripheral muscle groups. Subsequently, at rest, the blood pressure at the ankle is lower than that measured in a healthy individual. This reduction in blood pressure becomes more significant once physical activity starts leading to a greatly diminished distal blood pressure.

Homocysteine is also an underlying factor that causes atherosclerosis which leads to occlusion and ischemia.
