The important anatomy to focus on is the vascularÂ supply to the abdomen and the flap. The abdominal vascular supply can be divided into three zones based upon the regional anatomy. Zone I is the central abdomen. The branches of the deep and superficial superior epigastric arteries supply this zone. In zone II, the four main arteries supply the inferior abdomen. These include the deep inferior epigastric artery, deep circumflex iliac artery, the superficial circumflex iliac artery, and the superficial external pudendal artery. Zone III is the lateral or peripheral abdomen. The intercostal arteries, subcostal arteries, and lumbar arteries supply this zone.

Vascular supply of the abdominal flap is based upon Hartrampf perfusion zones. There are four different but equal sized zones, each with a different perfusion. The idea is that the zones immediately adjacent to the vascular pedicle have better perfusion compared to the lateral zones. The medial zones are I and II, while the lateral zones are III and IV. Therefore, surgeons resect the higher zones first and leave the lower zones for reconstruction.
