The incidence in the United States is 1.34 per 100,000 person-years, although the actual prevalence rate is higher due to clinically silent disease, as only 12% of AVMs are estimated to become symptomatic. The mortality rate is 10-15% of patients who have a hemorrhage, and morbidity varies from approximately 30-50%. There is no sex predilection. Despite the considered congenital origin of AVMs, the clinical presentation most commonly occurs in young adults.
