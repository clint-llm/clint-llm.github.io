Overall mortality and prognosis are influenced by whether the surgery was emergent or elective. For elective surgical repair of a groin hernia, the risk of mortality is low at 0.1%. Mortality is increased to up to 3% with emergency surgery for strangulated bowel, notably when bowel resection is performed.
