The Presentation of PDB is much less common as compared to the other presentations of breast malignancy like palpable mass or mammographic findings, accounting for about 1-4 percent of overall presentations.

Although this is an uncommon presentation, any patient with a chronic persistent skin rash of the nipple should be evaluated for PDB. There is some epidemiological data that suggests that the incidence of PDB is decreasing over time. Although the overall incidence was high in the data between 1988-2002, according to one estimation provided by the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database, the incidence is decreased by 45% after that due to unknown reasons. This decreasing incidence was greatest for PDB associated with invasive cancer or DCIS.
