Differential diagnosis of a lung lesion is vast. They can be separated by malignant vs. benign etiologies. Malignant differential diagnoses include adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous cell carcinoma, and large and small cell carcinoma.

Benign lesions of the lung can also be differentiated by category. Infectious granulomatous lesions such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis. Benign neoplasms such as bronchial hamartomas, lipomas, fibroma, neurofibroma, leiomyoma, and angiomas. Vascular etiologies such as arteriovenous malformation, pulmonary varix, hematoma, and pulmonary infarct. Inflammatory origins such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, rheumatoid nodule, or sarcoidosis. Other etiologies such as amyloidoma, round atelectasis, intrapulmonary lymph nodes, loculated fluid, and mucoid impaction should all be included in the differential.

Disorders with similar clinical manifestations of bronchial carcinoid tumors include obstructing bronchial carcinoma, endobronchial metastasis, asthma/reactive airway disease, as well as an aspirated foreign body.
