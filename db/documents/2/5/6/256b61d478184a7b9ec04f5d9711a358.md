- Known hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol

- Not approved for use for patients less than 18 years of age

**Warnings/Precautions**

- Rarely anaphylactoid (hypersensitivity) reactions are reported.

- Chest pain may precipitate as an immediate post-injection reaction and is usually transient pain, resolving in a few minutes. Episodes usually begin more than one month after starting treatment.

- Hepatic toxicity (cases of hepatitis and liver failure) has been reported, so advise the patient to watch for the signs/symptoms of liver dysfunction and consider discontinuation of glatiramer if warranted.

- Glatiramer administration might interfere with the patientâ€™s immune function. Therefore, AAN recommends screening for infections/latent infections before initiating immunosuppressive/immunomodulating(ISIM) in a population with a high risk of infections. A specialist should treat patients who test positive for latent infections.

- AAN recommends against the administration of live-attenuated vaccines in patients with MS who receive ISIM treatment. It is recommended to delay vaccination of people with MS who are experiencing a relapse.
