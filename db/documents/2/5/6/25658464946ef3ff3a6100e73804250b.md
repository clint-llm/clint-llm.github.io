The cause of urinary obstruction can be broadly classified as intrinsic and extrinsic compression. Causes of intrinsic obstruction include renal stones, malignancy, ureteropelvic junction stenosis, ureteral strictures from prior inflammation, renal cysts, posterior urethral valves, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and neurogenic bladder, etc. Causes of extrinsic compression include pregnancy, peripelvic cysts, retrocaval ureter, malignancy, trauma, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and prostate abscess, etc.

Anatomic abnormalities account for the majority of cases in children. These includeÂ urethral valves or stricture, and stenosis at the ureterovesical or ureteropelvic junction.
