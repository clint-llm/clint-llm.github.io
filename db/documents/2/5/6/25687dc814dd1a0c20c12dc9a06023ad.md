Simulation-based education is a broad term that encompasses interactions with mannequins and standardized patients, along with practicing procedural skills. Â Simulation represents an important facet of undergraduate and graduate medical education and provides an opportunity to practice skills before performing them on patients. The simulation environment represents a perfect opportunity for the deliberate practice of complex skills until a level of mastery is achieved for both routine and low frequency/high stakes procedures alike.
