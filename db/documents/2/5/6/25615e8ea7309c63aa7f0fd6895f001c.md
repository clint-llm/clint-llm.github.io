The vast majority of gallbladder polyps are asymptomatic and carry a low risk of malignant degeneration. However, a small number of true gallbladder polyps will progress to malignancy. Patients with symptomatic gallbladder polyps or with enlarging polyps should be treated with cholecystectomy. The risks of performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy are far less than missing a potential adenomatous polyp. It is recommended that if there is any indication of a gallbladder polyp being anything other than a pseudopolyp or cholesterol polyp, that cholecystectomy should be performed.
