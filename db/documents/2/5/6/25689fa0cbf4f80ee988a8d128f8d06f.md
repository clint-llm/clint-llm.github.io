The treatment regimen for a myopic choroidal neovascular membrane typically consists of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.   Often, one or two treatments spaced approximately four weeks apart are given, followed by monitoring and further treatment as needed if signs of choroidal neovascular activity such as subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, or leakage.

Typical Anti-VEGF agents and dosing:

- Bevacuzimab 1.25mg/0.05ml

- Aflibercept 2mg/0.05ml

- Ranibizumab 0.5mg/0.05ml
