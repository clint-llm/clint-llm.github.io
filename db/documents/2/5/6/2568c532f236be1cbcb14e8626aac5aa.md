In relapsed or refractory MM patients, the clonal evolution of MM cells and changes in the bone marrow microenvironment are major contributing factors in drug resistance.

In some cases, the balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic genes is disrupted, causing abnormal expression of pro-angiogenic and suppressing anti-angiogenic genes. Upregulation of angiogenesis-promoting factor epidermal growth factors like protein-7 (EGFL7) mediates MM cell proliferation and drug resistance.

Cancer cells develop compensatory protein clearance mechanisms like autophagosomes and aggresomes, resulting in resistance to protease inhibitors, ultimately leading to therapeutic failure and disease relapse.

Another possible mechanism of drug resistance is the clonal evolution of multiple myeloma cells. For example, increased expression of the PSMD4 gene is thought to be associated with bortezomib resistance. Patients with chromosomal abnormalities involving del(13) and t(4;14), who relapsed or developed the refractory disease and received lenalidomide and dexamethasone, had lower response rates with shorter median progression-free survival.
