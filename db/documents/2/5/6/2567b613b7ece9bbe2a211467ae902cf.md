Chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis, is a complex multisystem disease commonly characterized by severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep problems, autonomic dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise, which can severely impair patients' ability to conduct the activities of daily living. Therefore, early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical to prevent high morbidity and its overwhelming effect on the quality of life. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
