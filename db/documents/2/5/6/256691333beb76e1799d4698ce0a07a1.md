Capillary hemangiomas are common benign lesions, and parents can present to either pediatricians, ophthalmologists, oculoplastic surgeons, or dermatologists with complaints of reddish discoloration of the skin or as an eyelid mass. Health care physicians should be aware of this common clinical entity and its features which enable one to distinguish it from other more soft severe tissue lesions presenting during childhood. Early treatment with oral propranolol in coordination with a pediatrician shows excellent results. Careful attention should be paid to the assessment of refraction and vision to detect astigmatism, refractive error, or amblyopia. In the presence of proptosis due to an intraorbital hemangioma, sequential imaging may be necessary. The cornea should be carefully examined for any evidence of exposure keratopathy.
