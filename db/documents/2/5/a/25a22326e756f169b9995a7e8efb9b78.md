An understanding of the fascial planes is critical to performing safe and effective face surgery. From superficial to deep in the lateral cheek, these layers are skin, subcutaneous fat, SMAS, parotid masseteric fascia, and parotid gland.

Similarly, the primary buccal branch that controls the zygomatic muscles can be found reliably at Zuker's point, midway along a line between the root of the helix and the oral commissure.

Effective surgery not only requires avoidance of complications but also the achievement of the patient's goals; in the case of a mid-face lift, the goals are typically effacement of the NLFs and restoration of youthful malar volume. The NLFs are caused by close approximation of the mimetic muscles to the dermis without intervening fat, in a similar anatomic configuration to the dermal attachments of the levator aponeurosis of the upper eyelid. Because the malar fat pads are situated superiorly to the dermal attachments of the perioral mimetic muscles, when they descend, they reach those attachments and stop, producing NLFs. Because of this phenomenon and the facial fat atrophy that attends advancing age, anatomical rejuvenation of the mid-face may be more effectively achieved with repositioning and restoring volume to the malar fat pads rather than filling the NLFs directly with hyaluronic acid or calcium hydroxyapatite. Superior to the malar fat pads lie the medial and lateral sub-orbicularis oculi fat pads, which, when separated from a descending malar fat pad, contribute to the tear trough deformity seen in the aging face.

Restoring fat compartments to their youthful positions frequently requires identification and division of subdermal retaining ligaments, particularly the zygomatic retaining ligaments, also known as McGregor patch, and the mandibular retaining ligaments, which form the pre-jowl sulcus overlying the medial mandibular body as the buccal fat pad descends with age.
