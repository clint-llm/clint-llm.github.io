Ocular syphilis is difficult to diagnose due to varied presentations of the disease, and misdiagnosis is common. It is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an ophthalmologist, neurologist, cardiologist, dermatologist, infectious disease expert, internist, gynecologist, and specialty-trained ophthalmology nurse. Every member of the team should communicate regularly with each other on the patient’s health issues concerning their department.
