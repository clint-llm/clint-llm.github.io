The existence of cell division implies that there is a mechanism that replicates DNA and supplies identical copies for the daughter cells while still maintaining an accurate representation of the genome. This mechanism, known as DNA replication, occurs in all organisms and allows for genetic inheritance. It can occur in a short period, copying up to approximately ten to the 11th power (10^11) units of information in some cases. The process of replication is semi-conservative, meaning that each of the two DNA molecules formed from the process is made up of one, old, template strand and one newly formed strand. It also forms the basis of the expression of genetic information through protein synthesis. Considering DNA replication occurs rapidly, there are also various mechanisms to ensure correct replication and minimize errors. Cancers can arise from errors or mutations in DNA replication.
