The common carotid artery is located in zoneÂ I of the neck, where other structures at risk include the aortic arch, subclavian vessels, esophagus, trachea, spinal cord, and cervical nerves.

Zone I (the base of the neck) is demarcated by the thoracic inlet, inferiorly, and the cricoid cartilage, superiorly. Injuries in this zone are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality.

Zone II encloses the mid portion of the neck and the region extending from the cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible. Most carotid injuries are associated with zone II injuries, and these have the best prognosis secondary to easy accessibility of the vessel or operative repair.

Zone III represents the superior aspect of the neck, bounded by the angle of the mandible and base of the skull. Injuries in this zone are difficult to access surgically.

When a non-penetrating trauma injures the carotid artery, it may be due to excessive hyperextension of the cervical spine or extreme rotation of the neck. These maneuvers result in stretching of the carotid artery that can lead to shearing forces which can ultimately result in dissection and thrombosis. Blunt trauma to the neck typically results from motor vehicle crashes, sports-related injuries, strangulation, direct blows to the neck, and excessive cervical spine manipulation.
