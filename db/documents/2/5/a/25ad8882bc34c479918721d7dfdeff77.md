The skull can be divided into the calvarium and the skull base. The calvarium is made up of the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal bones. The skull base is composed of the sphenoid, palatine, and maxillary bones along with portions of the temporal and occipital bones.

**Types of Skull Fracture**

**Linear**

This is the most common simple type. It is typically in the temporal or parietal area.

**Depressed**

This is usually caused by a direct blow to the head and requires a neurosurgical opinion. A depressed skull fracture can sometimes be referred to as a ping-pong fracture.

**Open**

An open fracture carries a high risk of infection.

**Basal**

Basal fractures involve any of the bones of the base of the skull. Basal fractures are more complicated due to underlying structures such as cranial nerves and sinuses which can lead to hearing loss, facial paralysis, or decreased sense of smell. They also can pose a risk for meningitis, with the most common causative organism being Streptococcus pneumoniae.

**Diastatic**

Diastatic fractures occur when there is a separation of the cranial sutures, most commonly with the lambdoid suture.

**Growing**

A growing fracture describes herniation of the brain through the broken dura following a skull fracture (often diastatic). It usually presents later and grows as the brain herniates through the gap, as a persistent swelling or pulsatile mass. It is uncommon.
