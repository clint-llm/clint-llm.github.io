The pancreas is a gland that appears like a thin pear lying on its side behind the stomach and in front of the spine. It has four parts: the head (wider part of the gland), neck, body (middle section), and tail (narrow end). Physiologically, the pancreas has endocrine and exocrine cells. The endocrine cells release hormones like insulin and glucagon to regulate blood glucose. Clusters of these endocrine cells in the pancreas are also known as islets.

The exocrine cells release hormones into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of the food. These cells line the end of the ducts, which are present throughout the pancreas.

Tumors of neuroendocrine origin emerging in the pancreas or in proximity to the pancreas are described as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or islet cell tumors of the pancreas.
