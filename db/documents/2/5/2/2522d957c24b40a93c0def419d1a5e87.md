**Erenumab**: The adverse effects reported during the clinical studies of erenumab were injection site reactions such as injection site pain, erythema, and pruritus. There were also reports of constipation, cramps, and muscle spasms. Renal or hepatic impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of erenumab. However, sufficient studies have to not been conducted to establish the same.

**Eptinezumab**: The adverse effects reported during the clinical studies include nasopharyngitis angioedema, urticaria, facial flushing, and rash. Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur days after administration and may be prolonged. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue the administration of eptinezumab and initiate appropriate therapy.

**Galcanezumab, fremanezumab:**The adverse effects reported during the clinical studies of these drugs were injection site reactions such as injection site pain, erythema, and pruritus. Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur days after administration and may be prolonged. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue the administration of these drugs and initiate appropriate therapy.

**Rimegepant**: The adverse effects reported during the clinical studies of rimegepant include nausea and rarely hypersensitivity reactions (less than 1%). Severe hypersensitivity reactions may also occur with symptoms such as dyspnea and rash. In such cases, the drug should be discontinued, and appropriate therapy is given. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur even days after administration.

**Ubrogepant**: The adverse effects reported during the clinical studies of ubrogepant were sedation, somnolence, and dryness of the mouth. There was an increased incidence of these adverse effects when the dosage increased from 50 mg to 100 mg.

Dose adjustment is not recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment, the recommendation is for dose adjustment. Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment.

However, the data provided for all these drugs may not correspond accurately to the clinical incidence of these adverse effects. Therefore, further studies and proper clinical evaluation are necessary to predict the incidence of adverse effects properly.

There is no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of these drugs in pregnant women, as well as their presence in human milk, the effects on milk production, or its effects on the breastfed infant. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have also not been established.

Clinical studies of the drugs mentioned above did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether this cohort responds differently from younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range. Extra caution is necessary for those patients with decreased cardiac, hepatic, or renal function.
