Long bones can be divided into three sections:

- Epiphysis: The end of a bone, covered in articular cartilage if it is part of a joint.

- Diaphysis: The midsection or shaft of the bone.

- Metaphysis: The section between the epiphysis and diaphysis; this section contains the growth plate (physis) during childhood.

Ossification centers are parts of the bone involved in osteogenesis and can be divided into primary and secondary. The primary ossification center is where the bone first forms, for example, the diaphysis in long bones. Secondary ossification centers are usually found in the epiphysis, and there may be multiple centers present. There are six ossification centers around the elbow joint, which may be remembered using the mnemonic ‘CRITOE.’ The location and years of age at which these ossification centers appear around the elbow are:

- Capitellum (1 year)

- Radial head (3 years)

- Internal or medial epicondyle (5 years)

- Trochlea (7 years)

- Olecranon (9 years)

- External or lateral epicondyle (11 years)

The radial head fuses with the shaft between 16 to 18 years of age. Fractures of the radial neck usually involve the proximal radial physis; hence can be usually classified as Salter-Harris type-2 injury.
