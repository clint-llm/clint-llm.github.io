# Introduction

A detailed history and physical examination are cornerstones of diagnosing and managing congestive heart failure (CHF) for years. The evolution of non-invasive imaging over the past few decades has brought the accuracy of physical examination into question.

# Etiology

Studies have correlated a positive hepatojugular reflux to multiple cardiac conditions. Some showed that hepatojugular reflux correlated best with left-sided heart failure,

# Epidemiology

More than 25 million patients are affected by congestive heart failure (CHF) worldwide.

# Pathophysiology

Deep inspiration generates negative intrathoracic pressure, leading to an increased venous return to the right atrium and, subsequently, the right ventricle. This phenomenon, in the healthy adult, enhances blood flow in the right heart chambers and causes decreased jugular venous pressure (JVP). It is by this mechanism that Carvallo noted that deep inspiration caused augmentation of right-sided heart murmurs, such as that of tricuspid regurgitation.

As noted by Pasteur, sustained abdominal pressure, similar to the mechanism described above, also causes an increased venous return. This forms the basis of the hepatojugular reflux, in which a sustained elevation of JVP on applying abdominal pressure is used as a marker of right ventricular failure.

# History and Physical

The patient should be positioned in a manner that the jugular venous pressure can be easily seen. Classically, the patient is placed in a semi-recumbent position with an elevation of the head of the bed to 30 to 45 degrees. There should be at least a 3 cm margin from the upper margin of the baseline JVP to the angle of the mandible. A steady abdominal pressure of around 20 to 35 mmHg is then applied. Historically, the pressure was applied for 15 seconds.

# Evaluation

A study evaluating data from the ESCAPE trial showed the importance of evaluating the hepatojugular reflux in patients admitted with heart failure.

Prior studies have shown the hepatojugular reflux to be very useful in dyspnea patients for predicting heart failure if the PCWP greater than or equal to 15 mmHg. Some studies have also noted a high specificity of about 96% for the hepatojugular reflux in diagnosing heart failure.

The 6-month mortality of patients who had persistent hepatojugular reflux on discharge was significantly higher compared to those who had a resolution of hepatojugular reflux (univariate OR: 2.167; 95% CI: 1.189–3.949; ?? = 0.012). This study also assessed the role of combined assessment of positive hepatojugular reflux and jugular venous distention (defined as jugular venous pressure greater than 8 mmHg) in outcomes after discharge. Patients with positive hepatojugular reflux and jugular venous distention on discharge had a higher 6-month mortality compared with those with positive hepatojugular reflux and no jugular venous distention (33.8% versus 16.7%, resp.; univariate OR: 2.558; 95% CI: 1.023 to 6.397; ?? = 0.045).

# Differential Diagnosis

- Arterial flutter

- Arterial fibrillation

- Atrioventricular dissociation

- Cardiac tamponade

- Constructive pericarditis

- First-degree atrioventricular stroke

- Pulmonary hypertensmyxom

- Right atrial myxoma

- Tricuspid stenosis

- Tricuspid regurgitation

# Pearls and Other Issues

With the rapid advancements being made in diagnostic tools, including imaging or invasive tests, for detection of heart failure, there has been reduced emphasis on physical examination skills. The hepatojugular reflux is a very simple and useful bedside test that can diagnose right heart failure. Performance of the test has been described earlier in the manuscript. We encourage residents and physicians to routinely perform a detailed physical examination including hepatojugular reflux, which can help diagnose or rule out right heart failure.
