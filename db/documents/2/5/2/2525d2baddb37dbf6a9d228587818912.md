Primary peritoneal cancer is a rare malignancy, and dissemination from the primary organ site represents the late stage of cancer. Both manifest a poor prognosis. The bewildering presentation, intricate diagnostic methods, composite management, adverse treatment effects, and despair related to the news of this stage IV are the hurdles associated with it. It demands a competitive and cooperative team consisting of nurses, radiologists, surgeons, oncologists, and psychiatrists to manage the disease physically and psychologically. The continuous uplifting of the spirits of patients during the advanced surgery and perilous chemotherapy is critical. The advancement in technology and the development of HIPEC has increased the survival rate and improved the quality of life.

Further, new non-invasive detection methods should be developed for peritoneal cancer such as liquid biopsy (serum and ascitic fluid) containing biomarkers consisting of ‘exosomes,’ that protect cancer cells from degradation.
