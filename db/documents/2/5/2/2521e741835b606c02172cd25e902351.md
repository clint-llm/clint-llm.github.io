The cervical sympathetic trunk and ganglia are at risk during surgery involving the carotid sheath and parapharyngeal space as well as during anterolateral approaches to the cervical spine.

As referenced in the "muscles" section above, transverse dissection of the longus colli muscle can lead to sympathetic chain injury since the medial edge of the longus colli approaches closer to the sympathetic structures and further from the midline of the spine as they traverse down the cervical spine.
