The evolution of imaging techniques has revolutionized the clinician’s ability to diagnose specific glenolabral pathology, including GLAD lesions. Consequently, several different glenolabral pathologies have been identified, each of which may be associated with persistent post-traumatic shoulder pain.

Gleno-labral injuries often have a similar clinical presentation, and the differences between some of the recognized sub-types can be subtle. Imaging also has some limitations and does not guarantee the identification of all such lesions. Even for shoulder experts, the diagnosis and management of persistent post-traumatic shoulder pain can pose clinical challenges.

An interprofessional team of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, or PAs), specialists (primarily orthopedists and radiologists), nursing staff, and physical therapists best serves optimum patient management. If the patient initially reports to their family clinician, prompt orthopedic referral and consultation by a shoulder specialist is paramount and should be encouraged with undiagnosed significant shoulder pain has persisted after injury. Nursing staff, particularly specialized orthopedic nurses, can assist in patient evaluation and referral. Nurses can also assist during surgery, post-operative care, and follow-up in cases where surgery is necessary. If a GLAD lesion or one of the alternative traumatic sub-type of injury patterns is suspected, the involvement of a musculoskeletal radiologist to facilitate an appropriate imaging modality, likely MR arthrography, is equally important.

Once diagnosed and treated, a specialist physiotherapist should supervise the recovery period, whether or not a surgical approach is adopted. This interprofessional paradigm, with open communication between the various team members, will yield the best chances for patients to recover as much shoulder function as can be expected. [Level 5]
