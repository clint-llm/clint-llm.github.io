Sinus squeeze is a relatively common problem in scuba divers. This problem is entirely preventable. Clinicians including the pharmacist and nurse should educate the diver on preventive methods. Preventative actions include avoiding diving with concurrent upper respiratory infection and/or active allergic rhinitis. Prophylactic oral decongestants such as oxymetazoline spray, pseudoephedrine, and topical intranasal glucocorticoids can also be used.
