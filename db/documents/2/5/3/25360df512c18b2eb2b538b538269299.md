Several congenital and acquired brain pathologies can be seen in infants. Ultrasound is an excellent initial imaging modality used for the assessment of an infant's brain. It is portable, radiation-free, and easily performed without sedation. This activity will review the technique for the performance of head ultrasound in infants, outline and illustrate the normal intracranial anatomy, and describe sonographic findings in various pathologies that can be seen in this age group.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the technique for performance of head ultrasound in infants using anterior fontanelle and mastoid fontanelle.
- Outline and illustrate normal intracranial anatomy in premature and term infants.
- Describe various congenital abnormalities that can be seen in infants.
- Review sonographic findings in various acquired pathologies that can be seen in infants.
