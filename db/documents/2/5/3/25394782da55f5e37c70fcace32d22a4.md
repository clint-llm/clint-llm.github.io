Fogging refers to using plus powers to bring the optical point of focus in front of the retina (into the vitreous) to ensure that accommodation is adequately relaxed. Accommodation is the ability of the eye to change its total dioptric power to bring objects at different distances into focus.

This has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro.

The principle of fogging involves using spherical powers to create artificial myopia, thereby moving the entire area of focus in the eye in front of the retina to create a situation where an attempt at accommodating will blur the vision, which further causes the patient to relax accommodation. Fogging is effective irrespective of the inherent refractive state of the eye.

Proper accommodation control is probably the most important factor in the refraction process. Without proper control of accommodation, the refraction endpoint will fluctuate, leading to wrong spectacle prescriptions.

This chapter details the principles of the fogging process and a step-by-step explanation of how to execute it properly.
