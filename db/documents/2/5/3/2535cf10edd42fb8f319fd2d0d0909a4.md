Serial neurological examinations allow for early identification of patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and subsequent implementation of primary bedside interventions to improve venous outflow and reduce metabolic demands.

Non-contrast cranial computed tomography (CT) of the head is the imaging modality of choice for patients with TBI and an abnormal GCS. Several clinical decision guidelines

**Children <2**

- GCS ≤ 14 or palpable skull fracture or other signs of altered mental status: CT head recommended

- History of loss of consciousness for ≥5 seconds or severe mechanism of injury or occipital, parietal, or temporal scalp hematoma, or "not acting normally" per the parent or guardian: CT head vs. observation based on parental preference, age ≤ 3 months, worsening signs/symptoms in the emergency department, multiple vs. isolated findings, and physician experience.

- All others: CT head is not recommended

**Children ≥ 2**

- GCS ≤ 14 or signs of basilar skull fracture or other signs of altered mental status: CT head recommended

- History of loss of consciousness or severe headache or history or vomiting or history of a severe mechanism of injury: CT vs. observation (similar to above)

- All others: CT head not recommended

Despite CT's utility in initial TBI evaluation, there is little supporting evidence for routine repeat imaging in children.

Fundoscopy is necessary to look for the presence of retinal hemorrhages in cases suspected of NAT.
