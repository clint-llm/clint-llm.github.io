Following are some essential items needed to carry out the surgical drainage successfully:

- Catheter selection is usually based on the size and shape needed to complete the drainage.

- For simple serous contents, small-caliber catheters (8 to 10 F) can be efficiently used.

- Larger diameter catheters (more than 12 F) are used for complex cavities, such as bloody fluid, for optimal drainage.

- Drainage bag

- Sterile field, including betadine and fenestrated drape

- Scalpel

- Ultrasound or a CT scan depending upon the type of procedure, physician choice, and expertise.

- Cardiac monitor to track blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation.
