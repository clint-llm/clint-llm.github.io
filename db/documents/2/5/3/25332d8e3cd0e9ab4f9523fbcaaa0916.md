The diagnosis and treatment of craniosynostosis can produce a significant impact on families.

In non-syndromic cases of sagittal craniosynostosis, it is recommended to perform screening for  SMAD6 mutations, and if present, genetic counseling is given to the parents.

Patients who have increased intracranial pressure due to craniosynostosis may not present with typical hydrocephalus symptoms but may develop signs such as papilledema, skull deformities, developmental delay, and developmental milestones underachievement.
