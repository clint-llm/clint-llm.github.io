The pathophysiology depends on the type of substance involved: either an alkali or an acid. Alkalis are substances that have a pH above 7.0, and the threshold is usually above 11.5 to cause direct injury to tissue through liquefaction necrosis. Liquefaction necrosis involves the dissolution of the tissue comparatively quickly to coagulation necrosis. As the cells are lysed, digestive enzymes are released and begin to dissolve the architecture of the surrounding stroma. Alkalis cause an early breakdown of the mucosa exposed and allow for deeper penetration and injury. As with all exposures, the contact time and strength of the alkali determine the extent of the injury. However, even weak concentrations of alkali substances can cause severe damage to tissue if left in contact long enough.

Acids are more apt to cause injury if the pH is less than 2 through coagulation necrosis. Coagulative necrosis is the default mode of necrosis for most of the body when tissue is hypoxic or ischemic. It is theorized that injury tends to be less severe in acidic ingestions due to the intact stroma of the tissue performing as a barrier to further injury. The mucosa of the esophagus has a mild alkali surface, and this may help to neutralize acidic substances, further preventing injury.
