The histology usually is non-specific and reveals heterogeneous zones of the normal and affected lung. Interstitial inflammation, honeycomb change, and fibrosis are common, though these changes can be seen with other forms of advanced lung disease.

To make the diagnosis histologically, the following should be present:

- Presence of foci of fibroblasts

- Evidence of honeycombing and or disruption of lung architecture

- Patchy involvement of the lung by fibrosis

- Absence of other features suggests an alternative diagnosis
