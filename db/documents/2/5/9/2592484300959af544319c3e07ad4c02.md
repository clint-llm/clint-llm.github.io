There are three main tests involved in initial cervical cancer screening: cytology, HPV testing, and VIA ( Visual Inspection with Acetic acid). Abnormal results are followed by colposcopic evaluation and collection of specimens for biopsy testing, confirming the abnormal results and based on which further treatment would be planned.

**Cervical Cytology (PAP Smear)**

PAP test is done by opening the vaginal canal by a speculum and getting cells from the squamocolumnar junction or the transformation zone. The obtained cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. Any abnormality will warrant further evaluation. The collected specimen can be prepared for cytology by two methods, the conventional pap smear and the liquid-based-thin layer preparation.

It will be performed in:

1. In all women from 21 to 65 years of age as a part of routine screening.

Current recommendations regarding screening for cervical cancer: (2012 ASCCP guidelines)

The following recommendations are valid for the general population, regardless of the age of sexual initiation or other risk factors. It does not concern those with a history of cervical cancer, high-grade cervical precancerous lesions, immunocompromised states like HIV infection, or those with DES exposure in utero.

- For women 21-30 years of age, pap testing is done every three years.

- For women 30-65 years of age, cervical cancer co-testing (PAP testing and HPV test) is done every five years or only PAP testing every three years. The screening will be stopped at age 65, provided there is adequate prior negative screening result (three consecutive negative cytology results or two consecutive negative co-testing results) in the last ten years, with the most recent test result being in the previous five years and no history of CIN 2 or higher in the previous twenty years. Screening should not be resumed even if the woman has a new sexual partner.

- Women with a post-hysterectomy status (done for benign conditions with the removal of the cervix) do not have a history of CIN 2 or higher in the past twenty years. Evidence of adequate prior negative screening is not required.

2. Symptomatic women suspected of having cervical cancer (e.g., those with post-coital bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, etc.)

Various cytologic findings are described as

- Normal Cytology

- Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance(ASC-US): Cells that do not display SIL but have abnormalities more than simple reactive changes

- Atypical Squamous Cells High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (ASC-H): Cells are raising concern for the presence of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion(HSIL). Still, they are not sufficient to call them high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.

- Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL)

- High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL)

- Atypical Glandular Cell (AGC)

- Squamous Cell Carcinoma

- Adenocarcinoma

**HPV Testing**

This test detects cellular changes or infections with high-risk HPV. Specimens for HPV testing can be obtained similarly to PAP smears. The sample is usually collected from the endocervix using a cervical spatula or a brush, and then the specimen is placed in the HPV transport medium. There are some liquid-based cytology sampling systems where the same sample can be used for both cytology and HPV testing. Urine testing for HPV can also be an alternative in situations where routine cervicovaginal testing is not possible due to economic or cultural barriers. Commercial assays only test for high-risk HPV infections that are known to cause cervical cancer. In a limited resource setting, the self-collection of an HPV sample can be used. Self-sampling can be done using a tampon, cotton, or dacron swab, or a cytobrush. Self-sampling is cost-effective and is one of the proposed strategies in increasing the number of women screened.

The HPV test is recommended in women 30 years and older as a part of routine screening, as mentioned above. It can be used as a primary testing method or along with cytology (co-testing). HPV test has higher sensitivity as compared to cytology testing, but there are concerns about specificity, especially in younger women.

- HPV testing has found to be more efficient than cytology in earlier detection of persistent high-grade lesions, thus providing a more extended low-risk period. However, it can lead to overdiagnosis of regressive CIN 2, especially in younger women.

- Primary HPV DNA screening was able to detect more cervical lesions as compared to primary cytology in one screening round of five years.

- The incorporation of HPV testing along with pap tests in the screening program in women in their mid 30's has led to decreased incidence of CIN 2, CIN 3, and invasive carcinoma in subsequent screening exams.

Though studies have shown increased detection rates with HPV testing, it has also been implicated in a higher rate of false-positive results and colposcopy, which could lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

**Visual Inspection With Acetic Acid (VIA)**

In this test, 5% acetic acid is applied to the cervix. Acetic acid dehydrates the abnormal areas which contain increased nuclear material and protein. These abnormal areas turn acetowhite, whereas healthy cells containing glycogen remain normal. Schiller's iodine can also be employed (VILI-visual inspection with Lugol's iodine). In VILI, healthy cells containing glycogen take up iodine and turn mahogany brown, whereas abnormal areas remain unstained. These abnormal areas can then be biopsied. Dull white plaques with ill-defined borders are considered LSIL, and those with sharp plaques and thick edges are considered HSIL. Though it has low specificity, its false-negative rate is quite low. Hence VIA can prove to be a good alternative in a low-resource setting where pap screening does not exist.

**Colposcopy**

Colposcopy is the magnified visualization of the cervix where abnormal areas if identified, are biopsied. Colposcope is a binocular instrument with a magnification power of 10-20 times. Colpomicroscope, on the other hand, magnifies 100-300 times. In a colposcopic examination, the patient is put in a lithotomy position, and the cervix is exposed with a bivalve speculum. The colposcope is then focused on the external os at a distance of about 20cm. The cervix is then swabbed and cleaned with normal saline gently to remove mucus but not provoke any bleeding. The squamocolumnar junction is then visualized before and after the application of acetic acid. Acetic acid precipitates proteins, and abnormal areas appear acetowhite. Using a green light filter facilitates a better assessment of the vascular architecture. The cervix is then painted with schiller's iodine, which differentiates darker glycogen-laden cells from the paler glycogen-free cells, which are abnormal. In postmenopausal women, a 1-2 week daily estrogen therapy can be given, which will allow the squamocolumnar junction to pout out and hence improve visualization. In the context of cervical cancer, abnormal cells on a pap smear or follow-up of a treated cervical cancer lesion are the most common indications for colposcopy.

Colposcopic reporting is as follows:

- Satisfactory Colposcopic Examination: columnar epithelium, squamous epithelium, and squamocolumnar junction visualized.

- Unsatisfactory: squamocolumnar junction not adequately visualized. In such a case, a specimen for biopsy can be collected by endocervical curettage.

- Abnormal Findings: Mosaics, punctuations, acetowhite areas, keratosis, atypical vessels, negative iodine area, raised area, etc

**Risk Assessment:**The next step in evaluation is risk assessment**.**Based on history, cytology, and HPV results, the immediate and 5-year risk of developing CIN 3+ is calculated for every individual. Based on this risk percentage, further evaluation is decided.

If the immediate CIN 3+ risk is more than 4%, then further evaluation is carried out based on this percentage

- 4-24%- Colposcopy

- 25-59%- Treatment or colposcopy

- 60-100%- Treatment preferred

If the immediate CIN 3+ risk is less than 4%, then we look at the 5-year CIN 3+ risk, and further evaluation will be carried out based on this 5-year CIN 3+ risk:

- Less than 0.15%- Return in 5 years

- 0.15- 0.54%- Return in 3 years

- 0.55% or greater- Return in 1 year

Hence, there are six clinical actions that the provider can use while managing a patient with abnormal cervical cancer screening results 1-year surveillance, 2-year surveillance, 5-year regular screening, colposcopy, optional colposcopy or treatment, and treatment.

Immediate And  Five Year Risk Assessment For CIN 3+

At Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a prospective longitudinal cohort study was performed (from 2003-2017), where 1.5 million patients were followed up for more than a decade. Tables of risk estimates have been generated from this study. These risk-assessment tables are based on the patient's history, current and previous screening results.

8. Follow-up of HPV positive NILM and 2/3 negative co-test: 3-year follow-up is recommended

**Scenario 3: Receipt of Colposcopy/Biopsy Result**

1. If the colposcopic biopsy diagnosis is****normal or CIN 1, the recommended management is a 1-year follow-up, regardless of the results of preceding colposcopic results. However, patients with high-grade cytologic findings but low-grade histologic findings represent a high-risk group (e.g., CIN 1 preceded by HSIL or ASC-H). They are managed as follows:

Management of histologic LSIL (CIN 1) preceded by HSIL cytology:

Three options can be opted for in such a case

I. Review of cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings and management of the revised diagnosis as per ASCCP guidelines

II. Observation with colposcopy and cytology at one year in women <25 years and observation with Colposcopy and HPV testing at one year in women 25 years and above. An observation will only be recommended if the entire squamocolumnar junction and upper limit of the lesions are visualized and endocervical sampling is <CIN 2

III. Immediate diagnostic excision (except in pregnant women)

Management Of Histologic LSIL (CIN 1) Preceded By ASC-H Cytology:

I. Review of cytologic, histologic, and colposcopic findings and management of the revised diagnosis as per ASCCP guidelines

II. Observation with cytology (for women less than25 years) and an HPV test (in women 25 years or older) at 1 and 2 years. The observation will only be recommended if the entire squamocolumnar junction and upper limit of the lesions are visualized and endocervical sampling is negative.

For both HSIL and ASC-H, if an observation has opted and at one year, all tests are negative, then age-appropriate re-testing (i.e., colposcopy and cytology in women less than 25 years and colposcopy and HPV testing in women more than 25 years) is done in 1 year. If all tests are again negative at one and 2-year follow-up periods, HPV-based testing is recommended in 3 years. Then the patient can proceed with long-term surveillance (HPV-based testing for three years for at least 25 years even if it continues beyond 65 years of age, discontinuation of screening is recommended if a patient has limited life expectancy). If there is an abnormal result at any point in time during surveillance, repeat colposcopy and management based on biopsy result is recommended. An excisional biopsy is recommended for HSIL cytology at the 1-year visit if it persists (except in women less than 25 years where observation is preferred for one more year, and if it continues at the next 1-year follow-up, diagnostic excision is performed). For ACS-H cytology, which persists at the 2-year visit, an excisional biopsy is recommended.

2. If the colposcopic biopsy result is CIN 2, CIN 3, AIS (adenocarcinoma in situ), or cancer, the patient is referred for treatment.

**Scenario 4: Surveillance For Results Less Than CIN 2 (No Treatment)**

1. In patients with a previous colposcopy result of <CIN2+ (after referral for low-grade cytology (ASC-US or LSIL, regardless of HPV status, or HPV positive NILM)) and a current HPV negative status, the following are the management recommendations as per the current cytology results:

- NILM: 3-year follow up

- ASC-US/LSIL: 1-year follow-up

- ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+: Colposcopy

- ALL: 3-year follow-up

2. In patients with a previous colposcopy result of <CIN2+ ( after referral for low-grade cytology) and a current HPV positive status, the following are the management recommendations as per current cytology results:

- NILM, ASC-US, LSIL: 1-year follow-up

- ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+: Colposcopy

3. In patients with a previous colposcopy result of <CIN2+ (after referral for high-grade results- ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+) and a current HPV negative status, the following are the management recommendations as per current cytology results:

- NILM, ASC-US, LSIL: 1-year follow-up

- ASC-H, AGC: Colposcopy

- HSIL+: Treatment preferred

4. In patients with a previous colposcopy result of <CIN2+ (after referral for high-grade results- ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+) and a current HPV positive status, the following are the management recommendations as per current cytology results:

- NILM,ASC-US/LSIL: Colposcopy

- ASC-H, AGC: Colposcopy

- HSIL+: Treatment preferred

**Scenario 5: Follow-up After Treatment For CIN 2/3**

1. In patients with HPV negative status at follow-up, cytology triage is used for guiding management as follows:

- NILM, ASC-US, LSIL: 1-year follow-up

- High grade ( ASC-H, AGC, HSIL+): Colposcopy

- ALL: 1-year follow-up

2. In patients with HPV positive status at follow-up, cytology triage is used for guiding management as follows:

- NILM, ASC-US, LSIL: Colposcopy

- High grade: Colposcopy/Treatment

3. In CIN, 2/3 treated patients with 2-3 negative follow-up results and current negative test results (either a negative co-test or negative HPV test), recommended management is as per previous testing results.

- Previous 1 X negative HPV /co-testing result: 1-year follow-up

- Previous 2 X negative HPV/co-testing result: 3-year follow-up

- The guidelines mentioned above may not be feasible everywhere, especially in LMICs, where cytology-based programs are challenging to implement. Based on the available evidence, WHO recommends a screen and treat approach using Visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and treatment with cryotherapy or, when feasible, HPV testing followed by treatment.
