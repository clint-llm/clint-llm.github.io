This disease has the following histological characteristics:

- Diffuse non-nodular enlargement of the gland with a smooth capsule and increased vascularity.

- Hyperplasia of both follicular and papillary cells with lymphocytic infiltration into the stroma of the thyroid gland

- Follicular cells can also be enlarged and, in extreme cases, have enlarged nuclei mimicking that of papillary thyroid carcinoma. In Graves disease, however, they tend to maintain their rounded shape and have minimal clearing.

Due to the last point above, there have been controversies regarding the association between Graves disease and papillary thyroid carcinoma, and whether the coexistence of the two affects the prognosis. On systematic review of various studies, it has been seen that if a papillary carcinoma is discovered after surgical removal of the gland the prognosis is excellent, whereas when discovering a tumor in a patient with Graves disease, the local characteristics of the tumor (like the size, extent, margins, functionality, etc.) will most probably decide the final prognosis.
