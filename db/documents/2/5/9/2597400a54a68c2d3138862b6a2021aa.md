Cortical blindness is an important cause of blindness due to damage to the occipital cortex. It is commonly associated with posterior circulation stroke. Hence recognizing it can lead to proper management and improved outcome. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of cortical blindness and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing this situation for a better outcome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of cortical blindness.
- Review the pathophysiology of cortical blindness.
- Explain the presentation of cortical blindness.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by cortical blindness.
