Noninvasive imaging plays a pivotal role in assessing epicardial coronary artery anatomy, myocardial perfusion, and ventricular function in patients with known or suspected cardiovascular diseases. The increasing global burden of cardiovascular diseases has led to the introduction of highly sensitive and specific imaging modalities.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a prime example of molecular imaging, which has contributed immensely to understanding cardiac anatomy and pathophysiology over the last two decades.

The introduction of hybrid positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging by utilizing 3-dimensional acquisitions has been demonstrated as an important milestone in the field of myocardial perfusion imaging. It has significantly shortened the imaging protocol and reduced radiation exposure.
