The TTMPB is indicated in any surgical procedure where the sternum will be incised. This means that it has great utility in open heart procedures where a median sternotomy is typically performed. It was first described in 2015 by Ueshima et al.; since then, multiple studies reporting its benefit in cardiac surgeries have emerged.

While it is arguably of best use for perioperative pain management for a sternotomy, any procedure where analgesia is needed in the anterior T2-T6 dermatomes would benefit from a TTMPB. This would include various thoracic surgeries, breast surgeries (when combined with a pectoralis (PECS) nerve block(s)), as well as other minor procedures such as subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) placement.
