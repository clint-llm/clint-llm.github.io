The etiology of AEN remains unclear. The main developing theory is the two-hit hypothesis, the combination of a hemodynamic compromise in conjunction with an increase in metabolic requirement from local insult leading to necrosis.

The majority of AEN occurs in the distal esophagus (approximately 60% to 90% of cases).

Significantly increased volumes of gastric acid, for example, as a result of gastric outlet obstruction, have been shown to cause AEN.
