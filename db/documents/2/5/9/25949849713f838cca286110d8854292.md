As it is not systemically absorbed, colestipol does not cause severe side effects; therefore, it is very safe to prescribe to patients. No reports of toxicity associated with colestipol therapy have been reported other than the adverse events described above.

Patients often report poor tolerability to colestipol due to its many gastrointestinal adverse effects and decreased palatability. Therefore, healthcare providers should consider this and modify treatment accordingly, such as offering a different formulation of the drug.
