Missed dosing of chemoprophylaxis: Typically, travelers who have missed a dose of once-weekly prophylaxis should take the medication as soon as remembered and then resume treatment on the regularly scheduled day of the week. If the patient forgets the dose for more than two days, blood levels may not be adequate. The medication should still be taken as soon as remembered, with the next dose seven days later and then weekly after that.Â  For daily dosing regimens, the drug should be taken at the same time each day. If the dose is 1 to 2 days late, blood levels are less likely to be maintained. The patient should take any late dose as soon as they remember it, and subsequent doses should be daily at the same time of day.
