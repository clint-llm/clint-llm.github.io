The Quincke sign is an infrequently encountered physical examination finding. When this sign appears in a patient, the healthcare provider must complete a thorough physical examination with detailed attentionÂ paid to the cardiovascular exam.

Proper documentation is necessary for interprofessional communication when describing physical exam findings in an electronic medical record. Any signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease should be further evaluated by a transthoracic echocardiogram. Coordinated patient-centered care is required between the primary physician, nursing staff, cardiologist, and cardiothoracic surgeon to provide the best possible patient care.
