The ubiquitin-proteasome is a well-studied pathway known to play a significant role in regulating protein homeostasis and trafficking. Ubiquitination regulates various cellular processes, including immune response, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair.

- Any given protein could be ubiquitinated at multiple sites with a different effect on the target protein. Targeting a specific ubiquitination site is proven to be challenging.

- Although various drugs (e.g., bortezomib) have been developed to inhibit the proteasome pathway, however,Â  due to their non-specific activities, their therapeutic applications are limited.

- E3 ligases often have multiple substrates with diverse functions. Inhibiting an E3 ligase may prevent the ubiquitination of other proteins that are not of point of interest, resulting in an unintended or off-target effect.

Although targeting protein ubiquitination has proven to be challenging, as we learn more about the ubiquitination pathway, new therapeutic strategies are expected to emerge .
