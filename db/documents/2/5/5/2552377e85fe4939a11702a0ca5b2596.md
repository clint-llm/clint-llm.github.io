Typically, CMV endotheliitis occurs in immunocompetent patients. The most common symptoms described by patients include photophobia and visual disturbances, usually in one eye. According to Japan Endotheliitis Study, almost half the patients had a previous history of anterior uveitis, Posner-Schlossman syndrome, or secondary glaucoma/ ocular hypertension. Also, more than half of patients had a prior history of corneal transplantation, glaucoma surgery, or cataract surgery.

Physical findings include the presence of KP with overlying corneal edema, mild AC inflammation, ocular hypertension, limbal injection, peripheral anterior synechia, or pigmentation changes in the trabecular meshwork. Disc-shaped or Coin-shaped KPs are most common, observed in 70.6% of eyes in the Japan Endotheliitis study; the linear pattern was noted in 8.3% of eyes.
