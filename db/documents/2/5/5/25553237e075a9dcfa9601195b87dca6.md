Early recognition and treatment of omphalitis are essential to prevent the serious complications of this disease. Sepsis is the most common complication and can progress to septic shock and death. Other rare complications include peritonitis, intestinal gangrene, small bowel evisceration, liver abscess, septic umbilical arteritis, and portal vein thrombosis. Although uncommon, necrotizing fasciitis can occur and should be suspected if there is a rapid progression of infection and signs of systemic toxicity. It should also be suspected if there is no clinical improvement with intravenous antibiotics in 24 to 48 hours. Mortality rates as high as 60% to 85% have been reported in patients with omphalitis complicated by necrotizing fasciitis.
