CCSST is associated with an overall poor prognosis. A study with 75 patients showed a 69% and 21% metastatic disease and local recurrence rate, respectively. The overall 5-year survival rate was 47% and 36% for 10-years. Furthermore, forÂ patients who presented localized disease, the overall survival was 55% and 41% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.

Significant prognostic factors include tumor size, depth, and TNM classification. However, after multivariate analysis, only tumor size has remained a significant prognostic factor.

Another study showed 10% to 14% of patients developing regional lymph node metastasis. A majority of all patients with CCSST eventually developed distant metastasis, most commonly to lung and bone tissue, in addition to regional lymph nodes.

Overall, the course of CCSST is regarded as relentless and progressive, usually terminating in widespread metastatic disease.
