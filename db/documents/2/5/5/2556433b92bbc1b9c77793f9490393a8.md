Prognosis greatly varies in this syndrome. Patients generally have good relief with proper treatment, but it is also possible to have chronic symptoms, or for symptoms to recur. It is necessary to find the underlying cause of the problem so that focused treatment can be delivered. Early interventions seem to lead to better outcomes.
