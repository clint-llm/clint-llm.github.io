Regarding delivery of oxygen, the modalities can be classified as inspired or topical and intermittent or continuous. An example of intermittent, inspired oxygen is hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy: the oxygen is applied by breathing concentrated oxygen in a high-pressure chamber (>1.4 atm) for about 90 minutes a day, 3 to 5 days a week. Topically applied oxygen is applied either intermittently, following a treatment regimen similar to HBO (90 minutes a day, 3 to 5 days a week), or continuously (24 hours a day, 7 days a week).

All of these technologies are similar in that they use oxygen as an aid to wound healing. However, several primary differentiating factors determine the amount of oxygen delivered to the wound: pressure, concentration, therapy time, and route of entry. These differences are shown in Table 1. A graphical representation of oxygen therapy time combined with concentration and pressure, which determines the potential amount of oxygen delivered to the wound, is perhaps best portrayed graphically in a typical week-long regimen of oxygen therapy, shown in Figure 1. In this figure, the potential concentration of oxygen reaching the wound is shown for each therapy over time. The area under each curve is representative of the potential amount of oxygen that the wound receives.

Inspired - dependent on blood supply and local microvasculature

Direct topical application diffuses directly into tissue

Direct topical application diffuses directly into tissue

All three modalities rely on oxygen diffusion to deliver oxygen to the affected tissues at the cellular level.  HBO relies primarily on inspired oxygen: the oxygen diffuses into and through the alveolar tissue before being picked up by the bloodstream for delivery throughout the body (again by diffusion from the blood/plasma through capillaries and to the target tissue). Once the hemoglobin is saturated, the elevated levels of oxygen are in the plasma itself. A limitation of HBO in wound care is the need for adequate local blood supply to deliver the oxygen to the affected tissues (hence the requirement for minimum TCOM levels in the periphery of the wound). Topically applied oxygen directly diffuses oxygen into the affected tissues, bypassing reliance on local micro-vascularization to deliver oxygen to the wound tissue. This allows oxygen to rapidly penetrate wounds affected by local ischemia.

**Classification of Topically Applied Oxygen Therapy**

Topically applied oxygen comes in various forms, ranging from large systems consisting of high flow oxygen concentrators bundled with hard-walled chambers to small, wearable oxygen generators with oxygen delivery systems. One of the advantages of all these systems is that they all can be placed/used in most environments, including at home.  These systems apply oxygen directly to the wound and can be used adjunctively to many other therapies, including but not limited to moist wound therapy dressings and grafting materials. There are basically three different classes of gaseous topical oxygen delivery (we do not explore liquid, gel, or spray forms here). We will describe them by their most commonly known acronyms: TO, TCOT and CDO. An overview of the similarities and differences between these classes is shown in Table 2.  Statements made in the discussions below come from publicly available information in publications or by the manufacturers online.

The first class is the oldest and what is traditionally known as topical oxygen (TO). These systems use a high flow oxygen concentrator connected via oxygen tubing to either a reusable hard-walled chamber or a disposable bag to surround the affected wound. As mentioned above, TO uses the same treatment regimen as HBO to treat wounds: oxygen is applied to the wound for 90-minute sessions, 3 to 5 days per week. The patient is immobile during the treatment, yet TO does allow for treatment in a wide variety of settings, including home care. To enable optimal diffusion of oxygen into the wound, the wound dressing is removed during treatment, and the wound should be kept moist. Unfortunately, the oxygen concentrators used to generate purified oxygen (87 to 93%) are high flow, heavy, and can generate significant noise and heat levels during operation.

The first continuous system, a class is known as transcutaneous oxygen therapy (TCOT), was introduced in the mid-2000s. These devices use tape-based electrochemical oxygen generators to continuously generate pure oxygen from ambient air and provide oxygen to a wound using open-ended tubing that could be placed within a moist wound dressing. The entire system is disposable and intended to be used for up to 15 days before being thrown away and replaced with a new system.  The systems are small, lightweight, wearable, and completely silent. This has the advantage that the systems can be worn at all times and carried discreetly.

The latest continuous systems, known as continuous diffusion of oxygen (CDO), appeared within a few years of the first systems. These systems are similar in that they are also small, lightweight, wearable, and completely silent, allowing them to be worn at all times and carried discreetly. However, these systems have several improvements over the early disposable systems, including using robust, compression stacked electrochemical oxygen generators that are reusable and oxygen distribution systems to distribute and diffuse oxygen into the wound bed evenly. These distribution systems are available as fully integrated oxygen diffusion dressings or oxygen distribution wheels, both of which ensure that oxygen is distributed relatively evenly across the entire wound—more on these points later. CDO can be thought of as essentially moist wound therapy plus oxygen. This allows the wounds to “breathe,” similar to how we breathe, continuously.

Within the various classes of topically applied oxygen, there are differences in the systems available commercially.  These differences can affect not only patient satisfaction, yet also therapy outcomes. Refer to Table 3 for comparisons of features of the various systems.

For TO systems, there are two primary commercial systems available. Both are similar in that they use standard high-flow respiratory oxygen concentrators to supply oxygen to a bag or boot.  However, one system does not control the pressure within the bag/boot, and it is therefore relatively constant during the 90-minute therapy session.  The other system employs a cyclic pressure controller to vary the pressure at the wound bed from 0 to 50 mm Hg.  This cyclic pressure can improve the diffusion of oxygen into the wound.  This system also has an option for a solid-walled chamber for placement of the extremity (typically, a lower leg is displayed within the chamber).  Both systems have the ability to humidify the oxygen, which is an important feature since dry oxygen would rapidly desiccate the wound surface and impair the delivery of oxygen.

There is only one TCOT system available.  While it is the smallest system available, it also has several potential drawbacks compared to other continuous systems.  These include the construction of the oxygen generator, lack of flow at low humidity, and lack of alarms to warn the user of malfunction.  One item that all continuous systems have in common is that a minimum relative humidity level (typically 30 to 40% r.h.) is required for nominal operation. This disposable device can cease to generate measurable oxygen at low relative humidity levels, for example, in arid or cold environments, such as desert climates or most places in the winter, respectively.  The oxygen generator uses a tape membrane that can rupture under excessive pressure with improper offloading and cease functioning. Additionally, the system lacks alarms to notify the patient that the device is not functioning properly.

Two primary CDO systems are commercially available. Both of these systems overcome the shortfalls of the disposable system discussed above. However, low humidity levels can still impact their performance, yet they will continue to produce oxygen at lower levels. One system (CDO with ODD) has a display to warn of low flow and a humidification system to restore nominal operation.

Both systems are similar in that they use robust compression-plate oxygen generators (immune to backpressure from improper offloading), are similar in size and weight, and have oxygen distribution systems for even distribution of oxygen across the wound bed. One of the systems uses a fixed flow of oxygen delivered through an oxygen distribution system (ODS) that consists of tubing connected to a diffusive membrane in the shape of a wheel.  The ODS is placed above the wound bed and underneath a moist wound therapy dressing chosen by the wound care provider.  The other system uses an integrated oxygen distribution system within an oxygen diffusion dressing (ODD) available in multiple sizes, with or without an adhesive border. This system does not require using other dressings yet can be used with any non-occlusive dressing. The ODD system also has the ability to vary the oxygen flow rate, which can aid in the management of exudate and pain levels and monitor the pressure in the wound bed.  The ODD system monitors wound bed pressure and do not allow the pressure in the wound bed to exceed 20 mm Hg, which is at the lowest reported levels of capillary collapse in skin tissue.
