Hearing loss in the elderly is an increasingly common condition, affecting millions worldwide. This condition has far-ranging impacts on individual health and wellbeing. The etiology of hearing loss in the elderly is broad and proper diagnosis is key in preventing morbidity. To properly diagnose and manage this condition, providers must understand the common causes of hearing loss in the elderly (including sensorineural, conductive, and mixed losses) and the appropriate workup for each. Adequate management involves thorough communication with the interprofessional healthcare team.
