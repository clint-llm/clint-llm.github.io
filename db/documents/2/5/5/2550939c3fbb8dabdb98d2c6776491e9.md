A standard anteroposterior clavicle radiograph should be obtained in all patients who present with an injury to the clavicle. A second 45-degree cephalic tilt view radiograph improves the assessment of the degree of clavicle displacement. This additional view also minimizes the overlap of the first rib and scapula. While most clavicle fractures are visible using these views, a CT scan may be necessary to guide treatment in the less frequent proximal or distal fractures to evaluate intra-articular involvement.

Evaluation of the proximal clavicular stress fractures begins with plain radiographic views and a CT scan when necessary. Further imaging may be required to rule out inflammation and neoplasia in patients with radiographic and clinical evidence of swelling around this area.
