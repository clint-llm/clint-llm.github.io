Patients and their families who receive this diagnosis should receive adequate counseling from medical providers regarding this condition. An interprofessional team should be organized to assist in answering questions and providing anticipatory counseling. A gastroenterologist, preferably a hepatologist should be involved in the care, as should a pediatrician, interventional radiologist, transplant surgeon as well as a pharmacist. Patients should be given referrals to counseling for therapy as this condition can result in significant mental stress and financial burden on families.
