Two novel methods recently added to the diagnostic armamentarium of prosthetic joint infection include:

- Sonification: This employs the use of sound energy to agitate particles in a tissue sample with the goal of increasing the yield of culture from the explanted prosthetic material.

- Synovial fluid Alpha Defensin and leukocyte esterase: These are two markers that can be easily assessed from synovial fluid, and both correlate with the presence of prosthetic joint infection.
