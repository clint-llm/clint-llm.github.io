Most of the epidermal nevi have some characteristic histologic findings.

- A keratinocytic epidermal nevus will show broad hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and acanthosis.

- Biopsy of a nevus sebaceous will show sebaceous gland development in association with acanthosis. These findings may vary based on the age of the patient due to the effects of hormonal stimulation.

- Beckerâ€™s nevi will show variable papillomatosis, hyperkeratosis, pigmentation of the basal layer, and augmentation of the smooth muscle fibers.

- A nevus comedonicus will show dilated follicular ostia, which are variably filled with keratin.

- Connective tissue nevi of proteus syndrome typically show hamartomas of connective tissue, fat, and blood vessels.

- Acanthosis, papillomatosis, elongation of the rete ridges, and foamy, lipid-filled histiocytes in the dermal papillae are observed in CHILD syndrome.
