Most patients with low-concentration cutaneous exposure will survive the injuries but may go on to have extensive scarring, as the median lethal dose (LD50) for cutaneous exposure is 100 mg/kg. Sequelae include hypopigmented areas and scars that can be disfiguring depending on location and extent of the injury. Long-term sequelae include the development of malignancies later in life, particularly in long-term, chronic, low-concentration respiratory exposures (such as in Japanese sulfur mustard factory workers).
