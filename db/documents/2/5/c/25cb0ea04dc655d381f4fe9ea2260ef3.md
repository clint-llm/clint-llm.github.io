There is no longer any doubt that hand hygiene can lower transmission rates of pathogens. Hand washing is often not practical, and hence the alternate use of alcohol sanitizers may overcome this restraint. Alcohol sanitizers may be used both outside and inside healthcare facilities as they effectively kill most microorganisms better than just soap and water. There are several formulas of alcohol sanitizers that are available in gel, foam, or liquid preparations. All healthcare workers should not only use alcohol sanitizers regularly but also educate the public about its benefits. Within a few seconds, alcohol can kill most non-spore-forming bacteria and decrease rates of infections. Data show that alcohol sanitizers definitely improve hand hygiene and reduce the transmission of microorganisms in hospital settings. The major problem with using alcohol sanitizers is the lack of awareness; thus, education and constant reinforcement about its benefits are needed.
