The medial pterygoid muscle is innervated by the medial pterygoid nerve, which is a branch of the main trunk of the mandibular branch of cranial nerve V (trigeminal nerve). The nerve to the medial pterygoid enters from the upper region of the posterior border or the medial area of the superoposterior border of the muscle.

The accessory medial pterygoid muscle gets independent innervation from the branch of the mandibular nerve that branches 1 cm below the foramen ovale.
