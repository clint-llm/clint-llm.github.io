Pathergy phenomenon has been well known to dermatologists since it was first described in 1937 by Blobner as a state of altered tissue reactivity in response to minor trauma.

Hulusi Behcet, a Turkish dermatologist, first characterized the clinical entity now known as BD by a triad of recurrent aphthous stomatitis, relapsing uveitis, and genital ulceration.

Along with BD, pathergy is also widely reported in various other disorders, including neutrophilic dermatoses such as pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) and Sweet syndrome.
