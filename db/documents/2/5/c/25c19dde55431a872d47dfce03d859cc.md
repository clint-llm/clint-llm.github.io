There are three other types of incontinence to consider along with SUI

- Overflow incontinence – continuous urinary leakage or dribbling from incomplete emptying of the bladder

- Urge incontinence – involuntary loss of urine associated with urgency or a sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer

- Mixed incontinence – involuntary loss of urine with components of urge and stress

A thorough history and physical is the most crucial step to differentiate the type of incontinence and to exclude other differentials. If the diagnosis is unclear or complicated, urodynamic testing can be the next step.
