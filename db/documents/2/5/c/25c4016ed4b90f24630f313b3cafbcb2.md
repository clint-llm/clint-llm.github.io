Osteochondral lesions represent a challenging entity with a high progression to osteoarthritis if left untreated. The most widespread cartilage preserving techniques are not suitable for large defects (> 3 cmÂ²). Osteochondral allograft transplantation is a viable option for young active patients with large osteochondral defects, in which native cartilage is preferred over arthroplasty. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of large osteochondral lesions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo osteochondral allograft transplantation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for osteochondral allograft transplantation.
- Explain the preoperative workup, osteochondral allograft preparations, equipment, and techniques to perform osteochondral allograft transplantation.
- Review the postoperative management to avoid potential complications and enhance outcomes.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving osteochondral allograft transplantation.
