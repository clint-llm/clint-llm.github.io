Antiepileptic drug-level monitoring has been a common clinical practice since the advent of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Maintaining AEDs within laboratory-defined therapeutic ranges is a myth, with professionals overestimating values in most clinical settings. Epilepsy, in general, is a clinical diagnosis, with diagnostic modalities such as EEG and MRI considered complementary investigations. The assessment of AED efficacy should also be clinical, and the AED level should be utilized as a complementary tool in selected situations. This activity reviews antiepileptic drug monitoring and the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring patients taking antiepileptic drugs.

**Objectives:**
- Explain why the practice of maintaining AEDs within laboratory-defined therapeutic ranges is a myth.
- Describe the efficacy, variability, and utility of monitoring anti-epileptic drug levels in various settings.
- Review the clinical assessment of AED efficacy.
- Outline antiepileptic drug monitoring and the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring patients taking antiepileptic drugs.
