The management of renal cysts is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a urologist, nephrologist, geneticist, and a primary clinician with the assistance of a nurse practitioner or physician assistant. Hereditary cysts are progressive and may eventually affect renal function, thus these patients have to be monitored for life. For those without symptoms, the management is supportive. When renal function declines, end-stage renal disease is a possibility and the nephrologist should be involved early in the care of these patients. The nurse should educate the patient on options for dialysis and renal transplant. Unfortunately, patients with genetic disorders also have other organ involvement and their prognosis is guarded.
