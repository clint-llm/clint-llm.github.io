Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has essential biochemical and mechanical functions. CSF is produced at a rate of around 500 ml/day; there are estimates that there is approximately 125 mL to 150 mL of CSF in the body at any given time. Depending on the rate of production and absorption (which varies individually), the supply of CSF can be replaced about every 7.5 hours. Most of this fluid is produced in the ventricles of the brain by the choroid plexus—however, the ependymal cells, which line the ventricles, produce a smaller portion. The choroid plexus arises from the walls of the lateral ventricles and the roofs of the third and fourth ventricles.

After production, CSF circulates through the ventricles, subarachnoid space, and parenchyma and is then ultimately reabsorbed into the venous circulation. It is reabsorbed into the blood through structures in the arachnoid mater called arachnoid villi (arachnoid granulations). Importantly, this fluid can be examined clinically through a lumbar puncture. With a lumbar puncture, physicians can look for abnormalities in the CSF, which can help create a differential diagnosis.
