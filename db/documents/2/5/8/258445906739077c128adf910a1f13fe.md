The dominant function of the dorsal nerve of the penis is primarily somatosensory with a small motor component. The dorsal nerve of the penis has a direct connection to sexual function and micturition as its afferent transmit signals to the central nervous system.****Its small muscular branches supplies to the deep transverse perinei and the urethral sphincter.

The dorsal nerve of the penis has branching fibers that course laterally and transect the corpus spongiosum to the sinusoidal erectile tissue containing the urethra. The fibers of the dorsal nerve of the penis penetrate the corpus spongiosum to innervate the urethral lumen as afferents. These fibers receive input and relay the information during micturition and ejaculation. Semen is primarily expelled from the bulbous urethra via contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscle.

Neural pathways are arranged in reflex arcs that provide the reflex for ejaculation and bulbospongiosus contraction. The sensory axons of the afferent perineal nerve and the dorsal and ventrolateral branches of the dorsal nerve of the penis merge at the pudendal motor neurons in the conus medullaris portion of the central nervous system. The motor portion of the arc branches from the spinal cord as the perineal nerve to terminate in muscle fibers of the bulbospongiosus muscle for the contraction of these muscles leading to ejaculation.
