Patients with acute vertigo, nausea or vomiting, and new neurological deficits should be evaluated promptly by stroke trained staff, including a neurologist, radiologist, or emergency department physician. Treatment with IV alteplase before 4.5 hours since the onset of symptoms is recommended—those who are treated with alteplase show favorable outcomes over those who went untreated. If imaging can localize a vessel occlusion, thrombectomy should be performed.

Vertebrobasilar stroke patients require the coordination of an interprofessional team, especially inasmuch as the differentials are not always clear and could delay much-needed intervention. This team will consist of clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners (PAs and NPs), pharmacists, and nursing staff, operating as a unit and communicating across disciplinary boundaries to render timely and optimal care that can significantly improve patient outcomes.
