The IC lies near many important areas controlling vital functions, and caution is necessary during any surgical manipulations of the area. Most of the midbrain tracts and nuclear groups are located at the level of the IC, and thus lesions in this area can have widespread effects. One of the most frequent complications of tumors in the midbrain is hydrocephalus due to blockage of the cerebral aqueduct. Nothnagel syndrome, characterized by ipsilateral or bilateral oculomotor nerve paralysis and ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia, is another pathology associated with tumors of the midbrain.

Surgery to the tectum may be considered as a treatment for tectal glioma, especially for those with neurofibromatosis-1, because these patientsâ€™ tumors tend to grow more often and at a faster rate.

Another surgery in this area is the placement of an IC implant, which works similarly to a cochlear implant but is utilized in those with cochlear nerve damage. These implants may be used especially for those with neurofibromatosis-2 whose cochlear nerves suffer damage upon removal of schwannomas of CN VIII. A trans-labyrinthine or retrosigmoid approach with possible endoscopic aid may be the best approach to the area surgically, and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (discussed below) can be monitored during surgery to avoid damage to auditory pathways.
