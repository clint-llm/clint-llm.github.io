Radionuclide production is a crucial component in nuclear imaging and therapeutic modalities. More than 90% of its production is used for diagnostic purposes. The majority of the radionuclides are produced in a nuclear reactor and a cyclotron. However, it is impractical to set up an imaging laboratory near a nuclear reactor or a cyclotron; therefore, a generator serves as a convenient system for on-site production and extraction of commonly used radionuclides such as 99m-Tc (6 hours) from its parent nuclide molybdenum 99 (66 hours). Other less widely used generator systems include 132-Te (3.2 days)/132-I (2.3 hours), 68-Ge (271 days)/ 68-Ga (68 minutes).
