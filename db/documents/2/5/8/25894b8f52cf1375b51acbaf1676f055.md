A Minnesota study of the disease's frequency in US population in 1991 reported the annual average case of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)  in situ to be 14.9 cases per 100,000 whites. In 1994, it was recorded that the frequency had multiplied by a geometric factor of 10. The disease is usually frequent and most reported in whites and rarely in people who have a dark-pigmented skin. The disease has an equal ratio of distribution across both genders and often can occur in middle-aged and elderly patients.
