The genetic cause of BPES was discovered in 2001 following genetic sequencing of 7 families affected by BPES.FOXL2 in chromosome position 3q23 are responsible for BPES. The FOXL2 gene encodes a forkhead transcription factor of 376 amino acids, which contain a tract of 14 alanine amino acids. Over 100 unique FOXL2 mutations have been identified in BPES families.

The exact function of the protein is unknown. Still, expression studies have shown that the FOXL2 protein is expressed in the mesenchyme of developing eyelids in the fetus and in the granuloma cells of fetal and adult ovaries.

The two types of BPES are phenotypically indistinguishable but can be determined through genetic testing. Mutations that truncate the FOXL2 protein before the polyalanine tract result in BPES type I. Mutations that expand the polyalanine tract develop BPES type II.
