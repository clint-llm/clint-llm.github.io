Transport times are faster in both rural and urban environments with the use of lights and sirens. Studies vary widely in documented time savings, from an average of fewer than two minutes to a 30% decrease in transport times.

In one retrospective study, although transport times were significantly decreased with the use of lights and sirens, only five percent of patients benefitted in a clinically significant manner from the time saved.
