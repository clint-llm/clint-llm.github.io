Patients should be evaluated by Endocrinology to rule out endocrine causes of secondary osteoporosis if warranted per history and physical signs.

Orthopedics should be consulted if acute fracture or history of compression fractures to consider vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. They also should be consulted if non-vertebral fractures happen.
