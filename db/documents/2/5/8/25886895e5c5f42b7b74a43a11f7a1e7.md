The occurrence of Chronic bronchitis in the general population has been documented to vary between 3% to 7% of healthy adults. However, it is estimated to be as high as 74% among those diagnosed to have COPD. Many among those in the general population experiencing symptoms of chronic bronchitis may not have a definitive respiratory diagnosis. It has been documented that subjects under the age of 50 years who are otherwise healthy and have chronic bronchitis are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality when compared to healthy subjects. The increasing prevalence of chronic bronchitis is thought to be associated with increasing age, tobacco smoking, occupational exposure, and socioeconomic status.
