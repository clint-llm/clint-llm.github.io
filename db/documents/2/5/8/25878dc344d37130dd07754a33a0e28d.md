Caloric testing is a valuable tool in the evaluation of dizziness. It helps differentiate central and peripheral etiologies of dizziness. Ideally, a warm testing medium is used to test vestibular function in a patient with a low pretest probability of a peripheral process; monothermic testing has a reportedly wide range of sensitivity (0.54-1.00) for a unilateral vestibulopathy and therefore has limited use when the pretest probability is intermediate.

Although warm water is a more commonly used testing medium, caloric testing with warm air has also been reported to be 87% sensitive with a negative predictive value of 90% when assessing for unilateral vestibular weakness when a cutoff of 25% inter-ear difference is utilized.
