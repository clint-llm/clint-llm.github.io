Epiretinal membrane (ERM) is asymptomatic in its early stage with a good prognosis. Blue Mountains study reveals 39% of the membranes to be non-progressive. Progressive ERM reduces vision and causes annoying metamorphopsia. For worsening ERM, pars plana vitrectomy with membrane and ILM peeling has an excellent prognosis both by improving visual acuity and reducing metamorphopsia. The recurrence of ERM ranges from 1%

The recurrence and incomplete recovery of final visual acuity are due to incomplete removal of the membrane. Additional peeling of ILM removes the platform for cellular proliferation. One study has suggested that photoreceptor disruption detected by OCT and P1 implicit time delay on multifocal electroretinogram as significant predictors for poor visual recovery after ERM surgery.
