The first step in evaluating for CBS is assessing for neurocognitive disorders, neurological deficits, and neurocognitive impairment through a comprehensive neurological examination. Workup can include brain imaging, electroencephalography (EEG), laboratory exams, and genetic testing depending on suspected neurological conditions.

A medication reconciliation assessment for hallucinations induced by medications should also be completed. Some common non-psychotropic medicines that have been found to cause hallucinations include beta-blockers, glucocorticoids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, cimetidine, ranitidine, sildenafil, digoxin, carbapenems, penicillins, macrolides, cephalosporins, linezolid, and doxycycline.

Lastly, psychotropic medications and drugs of abuse must also be ruled out as the cause of hallucinations.

Brain imaging may also be used to assess for impaired or loss of vision in individuals whose eye exam is unremarkable.
