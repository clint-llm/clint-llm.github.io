Addison disease usually manifests as an insidious and gradual onset of non-specific symptoms, often resulting in a delayed diagnosis. The symptoms may worsen over a period of time, which makes early recognition difficult. A high clinical suspicion should be maintained to avoid misdiagnosis.

Addison disease can occur at any age but most often presents during the second or third decades of life. The initial presentation includes fatigue, generalized weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, tachycardia, and/or postural hypotension. Hyperpigmentation is characteristic and occurs in almost all patients. It is usually generalized and most prominent in sun-exposed and pressure areas. Elevated ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone are causative factors. It is believed that ACTH binds to the melanocyte receptors, which are responsible for pigmentation. Hyperpigmentation is more pronounced over palmar creases, gingival mucosa, lips (particularly vermilion border), elbows, knuckles, posterior neck, breast areola, nipples, and nail beds.  Hyperpigmentation is not seen in secondary insufficiency because ACTH and MSH levels are low. Multiple new nevi may develop. Decreased or sparse axillary and pubic hair may occur in female patients.

Due to its variable presentation, a high index of suspicion for Addison disease is necessary when evaluating a conglomeration of non-specific symptoms. These may include unexplained fatigue, poor appetite, chronic abdominal pain, or weight loss. Hyponatremia with or without hyperkalemia and/or hypotension can often be seen in Addison disease. Addisonian crisis is often manifested by severe dehydration, confusion, refractory hypotension, and shock. It is more likely to occur in primary adrenal insufficiency than secondary adrenal insufficiency.
