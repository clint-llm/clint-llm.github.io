Development of the lower respiratory tract begins on day 22 and continues to form the trachea, lungs, bronchi, and alveoli. The process divides into five stages: embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular, and alveolar stage. Although the process begins early on in fetal development, complete maturation does not take place until the child is approximately 8 years of age. This developmental delay is vital in premature babies where their survival is intricately linked to which developmental stage their respiratory tract has reached at the time of birth.
