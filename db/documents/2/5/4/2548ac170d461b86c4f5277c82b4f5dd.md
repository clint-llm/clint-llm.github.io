Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a progressive disease, but only a small subset of patients develop severe symptoms. Supportive management is recommended with a patient with mild symptoms, while the patient with severe symptoms can be managed surgically, with liver transplantation being the only curative option. This activity reports on the diagnosis and management of PLD and explains the interprofessional team's role in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of polycystic liver disease.
- Review the risk factors associated with polycystic liver disease.
- Identify the indications for liver transplantation in patients with polycystic liver disease.
- Summarize elements of a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by polycystic liver disease.
