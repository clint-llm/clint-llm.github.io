Complications of adenoid hypertrophy are often seen as complications of persistent middle ear effusion and/or sleep-disordered breathing which can occur as a result of untreated adenoid hypertrophy. Children with adenoid hypertrophy are at risk for developing speech, language, and/or learning difficulties as a result of conductive hearing loss which can occur with persistent secondary middle ear effusion.
