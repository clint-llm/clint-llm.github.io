Differential diagnosis of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy includes:

- X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia: recurrent bacterial infections affect boys, and genetic studies may reveal the presence of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) mutations).

- Common variable immunodeficiency: recurrent bacterial infections usually later in life (second-fourth decade).  Diagnosis is verified once all causes of immunodeficiency have been ruled out.
