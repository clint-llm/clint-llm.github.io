DIPG belongs to the fibrillary astrocytoma family. Most lesions are WHO grade III or IV.

Microscopically, DIPG infiltrates grey and white matter structures. The tumor cells are generally small and monomorphic, but sometimes can be large and pleomorphic. They typically have an astrocytic morphology, although oligodendroglial morphology is also a recognized pattern. The majority of the tumors have mitotic figures, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis. About 10% of DIPGs lack mitotic figures and microvascular proliferation; thus, they are histologically consistent with WHO grade II.
