The superficial peroneal nerve is the only nerve that can be visualized in the human body without dissection by simplyÂ plantar flexing, inverting the ankle, and examining the dorsum of the foot.

It is important to consider the anatomic variations of the superficial peroneal nerve and its branches as the branch most commonly at risk for iatrogenic injury is the intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve when it courses near the distal fibula and both the medial and intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerves at the level of the ankle.
