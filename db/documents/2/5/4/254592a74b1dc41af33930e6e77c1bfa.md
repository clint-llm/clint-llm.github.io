The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society have proposed that all patients with COPD, nonresponsive asthmatic adults, and adolescents, cryptogenic cirrhosis or liver disease without obvious etiology should be screened for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency using quantitative testing. Initial testing is through determining alpha one antitrypsin serum levels. If serum levels are low, genotyping may be pursued. If the genotype and serum level are discordant than phenotyping or genetic analysis can confirm the diagnosis. Chest radiographs and chest CT scan demonstrate emphysematous lung changes. Pulmonary function tests are necessary as well to detect the expected decline in FEV1.
