HZO follows the typical pathogenic process of herpes zoster. VZV is a double-stranded DNA virus that initially invades the upper respiratory tract via virus-laden respiratory droplets, where it replicates and invades adjacent lymph nodes. After about a week, the virus disseminates and progresses to a secondary cutaneous infection, with vesicle eruption occurring several days later. Following the primary infection, the virus follows a retrograde pathway along axons toward sensory nerve ganglia, where it enters the latent phase. In the reactivation phase, the virus moves in an anterograde fashion toward superficial tissue, where it reemerges as herpes zoster.
