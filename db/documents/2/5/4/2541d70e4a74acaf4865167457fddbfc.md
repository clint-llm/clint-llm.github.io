Most intraoperative complications associated with SMILE are related to the steep learning curve and relative complexity of the procedure.

Intraoperative complications may be broadly categorized as related to

- Lenticule creation

- Lenticule dissection

- Lenticule extraction.

**Lenticule Creation**: complications from lenticule creation include suction loss, the formation of an opaque bubble layer (OBL), subconjunctival hemorrhage, incisional bleeding, and black spots. Loss of suction occurs in approximately 6% of cases and is typically due to patient eye contraction or sudden patient movement.

**Lenticule Dissection or**lenticule**Extraction:**common complications that occur secondary to lenticule dissection or extraction include lenticule remnant, corneal abrasion, lenticule adhesions, and incisional tears. Lenticule remnant and lenticule adhesions may be addressed intraoperatively or postoperatively, as described above. Peripheral corneal abrasions occur in 5.5% of cases and are typically due to excessive manipulation.

Primary complications experienced after SMILE include

- Dry eye

- Corneal abrasion

- Infectious keratitis.

Postoperative dry eye occurs in approximately 3% of patients and is likely multifactorial, attributable to decreased trophic influence in the corneal epithelium, inflammation, damage to limbal goblet cells during suction, and impaired corneal sensation to blink.
