Polyhydramnios is a condition that carries aÂ  higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes that implies the need for intensive monitoring of pregnant women during antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum care.

As there are numerous potential etiologies, the initial workup can be quite extensive. Additionally, these patients may exhibit no specific signs and symptoms or may demonstrate significant dyspnea and discomfort in pregnancy, as well as signs of peripheral edema. Polyhydramnios is often an incidental finding in the third trimester during the sonographic evaluation of another pregnancy-associated concern. Evaluating and managing pregnant women with polyhydramnios may be a challenging endeavor.

The severity of polyhydramnios is dependent on the extent of amniotic fluid volume. The initial evaluation may be performed in various settings, including the obstetric clinic, family practice clinic, or obstetric triage. Obstetricians, midwives, family medicine physicians, and residents may be involved in caring for pregnant women affected by polyhydramnios. In severe polyhydramnios, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team, including specialists in maternal-fetal medicine, neonatology, and fetal surgery. The nurses are also vital members of the multidisciplinary team as they will monitor the maternal observations and provide education to the woman and her family. The radiologist also plays a crucial role in determining the cause by interpreting the fetal anatomy ultrasound. The laboratory also provides diagnostic support for evaluating diagnostic laboratory screening for maternal diabetes, congenital abnormalities, and trisomies.

Effective communication is vital in assuring safe, current, and evidence-based practice to ensure the best outcomes for pregnant women with polyhydramnios and their families. Coordinated care and effective communication among the interprofessional team members is key to the successful diagnosis and management of polyhydramnios. The nurses and midwives play a crucial role in managing women with polyhydramnios. They should report promptly to other interprofessional team members if any worsening symptoms or signs develop. Women should be encouraged to discuss their attitudes, concerns, and preferences regarding their care. The interprofessional team members should respect pregnant women's wishes, preferences, and views and their families regarding their care. [Level 5]
