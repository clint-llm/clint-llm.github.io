Hashimoto thyroiditis, also known as chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease in which thyroid cells are destroyed via cell and antibody-mediated immune processes. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries. In contrast, the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide is an inadequate dietary intake of iodine. The pathophysiology of Hashimoto thyroiditis involves the formation of antithyroid antibodies that attack the thyroid tissue, causing progressive fibrosis. The diagnosis can be challenging, and consequently, the condition is sometimes not diagnosed until late in the disease process. The most common laboratory findings demonstrate elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low thyroxine (T4) levels, coupled with increased antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of Hashimoto thyroiditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Hashimoto thyroiditis.
- List the treatment and management options available for Hashimoto thyroiditis.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and care delivery to advance treatment for patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis.
