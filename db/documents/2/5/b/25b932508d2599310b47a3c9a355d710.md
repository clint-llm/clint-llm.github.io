Many benign orbital tumors have similar clinical presentations. Although patient history and exam findings may help distinguish between certain types of orbital masses, imaging is often necessary for diagnosis.

**Computed tomography**(CT) or**magnetic resonance imaging**(MRI) can provide important diagnostic information and guide surgical management. Initial imaging with CT is often recommended to assess orbital/bony anatomical landmarks. Using contrast and arterial phase imaging is especially helpful for characterizing masses and developing a differential diagnosis. When a more detailed anatomic definition is required, MRI, with and without contrast, is often obtained. Ultrasound imaging is less commonly used but can provide fast diagnostic information for masses located in the anterior orbit.
