Initial laboratory workup for the swollen joints included a complete blood count which revealed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14000/microliter with neutrophil predominance, ESR of 118 mm per hour, and CRP of 8 mg/dL. A comprehensive metabolic panel was within normal limits. Infectious workup, which included blood and urine cultures, was negative. Immunological workup revealed elevated ANA titer (1:320), positive lupus anticoagulant, and high dsDNA antibodies. Ultrasound of the right elbow and left ankle joints revealed effusion in the joints and the surrounding soft tissue swelling. MRI of the right wrist revealed heterogeneous signal and enhancement of multiple carpal bones involving the second through fifth metacarpals, subcutaneous and deep soft tissue of the wrist and proximal hand. Based on the clinical and laboratory evidence, the patient was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by the rheumatologist and was started on steroids, Plaquenil, and methotrexate. The patient’s clinical condition initially improved with the regimen, but his symptoms relapsed when weaning the steroids. He was discharged on a slow tapering dose of prednisone.
