Pressure symptoms are not usually complications but are a known effect once the nodule reaches a size where it can compress on adjacent structures.

- A dull dragging sensation owing to the mass and size of the lesion is almost always the complaint of the patient

- Dyspnea, due to compression of the trachea

- Dysphagia, due to oesophageal compression

- Hoarseness of voice if the lesions press on the recurrent laryngeal nerve

- Pain over the nodule: this is more concerning to the patient. It could mean that spontaneous hemorrhage or cystic degeneration has occurred within the nodule.

- A toxic nodule could, in the worst-case scenario, precipitate thyroid storm requiring additional patient care.

Surgical complications:

- Bleeding
- Infection
- Scarring: hypertrophic or keloid formation
- Thyroid crises
- Temporary hypocalcemia or permanent if the parathyroids entirely removed
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve transection could lead to a loss of voice and, in worse cases, even respiratory failure necessitating invasive ventilation
