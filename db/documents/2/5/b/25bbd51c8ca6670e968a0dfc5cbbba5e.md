The treatment of OSA is a multi-pronged approach and should be individualized to each patient. While treatment of moderate to severe OSA has been shown to improve clinical outcomes

**Lifestyle Changes and Treating Underlying Medical Conditions**

The importance of weight loss should be emphasized in OSA patients with overweight and obesity.

**Positional Therapy**

OSA that is more prominent in the supine position can be treated with a positioning device to keep a patient on their side can be an option.

**Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) Therapy**

Continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) is the most effective treatment for adults.

Several studies have reported conflicting findings when assessing the effect of PAP therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with OSA.

**Oral Appliance**

For patients unable or unwilling to use CPAP or those who will be unable to access electricity reliably, custom-fitted and titrated oral appliances or mandibular advancements devices (MAD) can be used to bring the lower jaw forward and relieve airway obstruction (See picture). This typically works best for candidates with appropriate dentition and mild to moderate sleep apnea. In a randomized clinical trial on 126 patients with moderate-severe OSA,

- Oral appliances can be considered rather than no treatment for adult patients with snoring (without OSA) or those with OSA who do not tolerate CPAP therapy or prefer alternate treatment.

- When a sleep physician prescribes oral appliance therapy for an adult patient with obstructive sleep apnea.

- A qualified dentist should use a custom, titratable appliance.

- A follow-up with a qualified dentist after oral appliance therapy is initiated in adult patients with OSA to assess for dental-related side effects.

- A follow-up with sleep testing to confirm treatment efficacy.

**Surgical Treatments**

Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) surgically removes the uvula and tissue from the soft palate to create more space in the oropharynx.

Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) requires both the upper and lower jaws to be detached and surgically advanced anteriorly to increase space in the oropharynx.

A newer option is the implantable hypoglossal nerve stimulator (HNS), usually unilateral, although bilateral implantation has been recently reported.

The eligibility criteria for HNS adopted from the original randomized trial include the following characteristics:

- Adults >18 years of age

- Moderate to severe OSA (AHI between 20 to 50 with less than 25% central or mixed apneas)

- Inability to tolerate CPAP

- No complete concentric collapse at the palate on drug-induced sleep endoscopy

Exclusion criteria for HNS include the following:

- BMI > 32.0 kg/m2.

- Neuromuscular disease.

- Hypoglossal-nerve palsy.

- Severe restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease.

- Moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

- Severe valvular heart disease.

- Heart failure, New York Heart Association class III or IV.

- Recent myocardial infarction or severe cardiac arrhythmias (within the past 6 months).

- Persistent uncontrolled hypertension despite medication use.

- Active psychiatric disease and coexisting nonrespiratory sleep disorders.

In extreme cases, OSA can also be treated with a tracheostomy to bypass the oropharyngeal obstruction. This management option is also best addressed at academic or specialty sleep centers that are experienced in treating patients with tracheostomy. Such patients will encounter numerous challenges with home care, durable medical equipment, and family/partner education on tracheostomy management. Many patients with severe OSA requiring tracheostomy have comorbidities.
