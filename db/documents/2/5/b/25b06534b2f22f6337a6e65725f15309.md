If, after the history and physical, it is unclear what the etiology of tendinosis is, labs can be done to evaluate for tendinitis. C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESR are not very specific tests, but they can help the physician determine if an inflammatory process occurs, like that seen in spondyloarthritis. X-rays should be performed if there is a question of potential bone injury, given the history and physical exam findings. Ultrasound machines are being used more frequently, given the dynamic nature of the study. Several interventions used to treat tendinosis are also done under sonographic guidance. Specificity and sensitivity vary between sonographic operators as well as when examining different tendons in the body. Depending on which part of the body the examiner is investigating, different frequencies are recommended for optimal visualization. Common ultrasound findings in tendinosis include increased spacing of the hyperechoic fibrillar lines, reduced echogenicity, thickening of the tendon, and neovascularization (via color Doppler). The MRI is also a valuable tool that can be used when evaluating tendinosis.
