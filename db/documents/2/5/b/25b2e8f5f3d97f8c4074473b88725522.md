The complexity of bowel formation allows for many areas in which there can be errors in development. These errors manifest as the following diseases

- Malrotation - the midgut does not undergo proper rotation which predisposes to midgut volvulus.

- Volvulus - bowel twists around its mesentery, causing bowel obstruction.

- Persistent Vitelline Duct - the vitelline duct connection to the umbilicus remains patent resulting in enteric drainage.

- Meckel Diverticulum - this condition is a remnant of the vitelline duct attached by a fibrous stalk to the umbilicus, which can cause bowel obstruction or bleeding if ectopic gastric tissue is present in the diverticulum.

- Omphalocele - This represents a failure of the herniated midgut to return to the abdominal cavity.

- Hirschsprung DiseaseÂ  - this is the failure of neural crest cell migration, which impairs relaxation of the bowel, creating an obstruction.

- Imperforate Anus - the cloaca fails to perforate, and thus the rectum leads into a blind pouch.

- Intestinal Atresia - discontinuous bowel thought to be due to disruptions in a segment of bowel blood flow

- Gastrointestinal duplications are very rare pathologies, with a response in the population of 4 to 18% regarding the colon. It is not always readily identifiable in the pediatric period, with symptoms such as colic and constipation.
