In a multiethnic international study, it was found that patients who were suffering from lupus nephritis were more frequently men, relatively younger, and of African, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicity.

In a large Spanish study, lupus nephritis was confirmed histologically in 30.5% of patients with SLE. The mean age of diagnosis for lupus nephritis was observed to be 28.4 years. The risk for the development of lupus nephritis was significantly higher in younger individuals, men, and Hispanics. Interestingly, patients receiving antimalarial drugs had a significantly reduced risk of developing lupus nephritis.

**Age-related**

Most patients with SLE end up developing lupus nephritis earlier in the disease course. SLE is more commonly seen in women in the third decade, and lupus nephritis essentially occurs in patients 20 to 40 years old. Children with SLE appear to be at a higher risk of having renal involvement than adults.

**Sex-related**

Generally, the prevalence of SLE is higher in women (female-to-male ratio of 9:1). Likewise, lupus nephritis is also more common in women; however, clinically evident renal disease with a worse prognosis is more common in men with SLE.

**Race-related**

SLE is more prevalent in African Americans and Asians than in Whites, with the highest prevalence seen in Caribbean people. Although lupus nephritis is more common in Asians than in Whites, the 10-year outcome and survival rate are observed to be better in Asians.
