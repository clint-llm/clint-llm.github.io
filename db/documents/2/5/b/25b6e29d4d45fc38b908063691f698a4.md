Variations in the arteries of the upper limb are often observed, with most variations occurring in the radial and ulnar arteries,

Multiple studies have shown the occasional persistence of the superficial brachial artery, showing its persistence in both the right and left upper limb.

Yoshinaga et al. examined a physiological variant in which the brachial artery bifurcated into multiple large superficial and small deep arterial branches at its origin along the inferior margin of the teres major muscle.

Reports in the literature also exist regarding variations in the origin and termination of the profunda brachii artery. Multiple studies have analyzed the prevalence of the profunda brachii artery originating from the axillary artery rather than the brachial artery, with prevalences ranging from 2% to 16.6%.

Another 2006 study reported a lateral inferior superior brachial artery, a complete absence of the radial artery on the left side, and a trifurcation of the brachial artery on the right side in a female cadaver.

Understanding these variations in the arterial structure of the upper limb is crucial for surgeons, radiologists, and other physicians requiring the use of angiography and vascular access.
