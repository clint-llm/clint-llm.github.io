The principal differential diagnosis in plagiocephaly determines if it is deformational (positional) or synostotic due to a suture's premature closure. Anterior plagiocephaly is due to coronal synostosis. Posterior plagiocephaly should be differentiated as synostotic or deformational.

Facts noted in history are the presence at birth, preferred sleep position, and improvement with time.

The child with unilateral lambdoid synostosis has a thick ridge over the fused suture, with compensatory contralateral parietal and frontal bossing.
