The pathophysiology of atrial tachycardia can vary depending on the origin of the arrhythmia, which can be determined through electrophysiology mapping to elucidate the source of the sickness. Reentrant atrial tachycardias can manifest due to an anatomical provenance or an iatrogenic origin, commonly by postsurgical scar tissue or post ablation gaps.

Patients with structurally normal hearts typically display atrial tachycardia thanks to increased tissue automaticity. P wave location can provide insight into the anatomical area of the enhanced tissue, but electrophysiologic mapping is crucial for the exact position.

Atrial tachycardia, with trigger origins, result from an electrolyte disturbance after an action potential. The error occurs by a calcium influx, originating from the other action potential, which causes depolarization. If the depolarization is significant enough, to reach the threshold, an action potential is generated. If this event is isolated, it may only result in an atrial ectopic beat, but if this electrolyte disturbance continues, it will produce a tachycardic arrhythmia. Catecholamine imbalance and digitalis toxicity are common trigger sources. Triggered atrial tachycardia can originate in one location in the atria or from multiple sites, which can result in a regular or irregular rhythm.
