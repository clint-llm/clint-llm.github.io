Blood clotting within the splanchnic veinous systems leads to splanchnic vein thrombosis. It includes thrombosis in the splenic vein, mesenteric vein, portal vein, or hepatic vein (Budd-Chiari syndrome). The most common site of venous thrombosis is a portal and mesenteric vein, with the least common being hepatic vein. Splanchnic venous thrombosis can lead to different symptoms depending on the site of the thrombosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of splanchnic venous thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of splanchnic venous thrombosis.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of splanchnic venous thrombosis.
- Outline the management options available for splanchnic venous thrombosis.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in splanchnic venous thrombosis to improve outcomes.
