The term 'mucolipidosis' covers diseases belonging to both mucopolysaccharidoses and sphingolipidoses.

Of the two genes encoding the functional components of G1cNAc-1-phosphotransferase, GNPTAB has been connected with the mutations causing ICD. Mutations like frameshift, nonsense, splicing defects, missense, and deletions/duplications/insertions lead to the production of a stop codon 80% of the time. The stop codon forms an incomplete and dysfunctional enzyme or may lead to truncated enzyme subunits.

Although the mutation variants are evenly spread throughout GNPTAB, approximately 25% of the mutations are in the 1112-bp exon 13. Clinical severity correlates with the level of enzyme activity. Absent or severely reduced GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity due to strong alterations of GNPTAB leads to the severe ICD phenotype. Having residual enzyme activity (approximately 10%) due to at least one GNPTAB allele being active is associated with the less severe ML III alpha/beta disease.

Patients with ML III can survive into their adulthood, whereas patients with ML II often die within the first decade of life. ML III is divided into ML IIIA (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) and ML IIIC (variant pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy). In ML IIIA, the G1cNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity is reduced. In ML IIIC, G1cNAc-1-phosphate transfer to alpha-methylmannoside is normal, but the transfer to lysosomal substrates is reduced.

The lysosomal enzymes, lacking the M6P signal, cannot be sensed by the receptors in the TGN, so further targeting of the endosome/lysosome system cannot be carried out.

Braulke et al. found that I-cell fibroblasts have twice as many MPRs and a higher affinity for M6P and IGF II than normal fibroblasts. The increase in receptors is due to increased mRNA expression of MPRs in I-cells. The receptor count in I-cells remained relatively stable under the influence of substances that increased the surface receptor count.

In ICD, lysosomal enzymes like glycosidases and sulfatases, among several others, are improperly sorted and targeted, leading to their extracellular accumulation. Lysosomes become dysfunctional and enlarged due to nondegradable macromolecules such as cholesterol, phospholipids, and glycosaminoglycans. This disrupts cellular functioning and homeostasis.

The inclusions of ICD have been described extensively from microscopic studies of cultured fibroblasts.

Both types of inclusions are often found within the same cell. In the study by Aula et al., fibroblasts, primitive mesenchymal cells like macrophages, and endothelial and perithelial cells contained the inclusions, whereas epithelial and glandular cells did not. A peculiarity was found by identifying numerous type 1 inclusions and some type 2 inclusions in the glomerular podocytes of the kidney, which are differentiated epithelial cells.

**Apoptosis**

Apoptosis is programmed cell death that can occur via two different pathways (mitochondrial and death receptor pathways). Lysosomes play a role in the progression of apoptosis, particularly with the release of proteases such as cathepsin D.****As a result of the misdirection of various lysosomal enzymes in ICD, apoptosis still occurs but is delayed. This is related to the lower activities of cathepsins D, B, and L in I-cells compared to normal fibroblasts, as found by Terman et al. The same group performed a series of experiments that assessed I-cells' ability to undergo apoptosis compared to normal fibroblasts. Their group found that apoptotic inducers such as MSDH, staurosporine, and naphthazarin had a decreased effect on I-cells. The self-destruction process was reduced when using apoptotic inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin A on staurosporine-treated normal fibroblasts. No significant change was noted when the same experiment was performed on I-cells.
