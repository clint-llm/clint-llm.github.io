Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a Gram-positive, coagulase-negative, non-hemolytic coccus that is a common cause of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), particularly in young sexually active females. Less commonly, it is responsible for complications including acute pyelonephritis, urethritis, epididymitis, and prostatitis.

An acute uncomplicated UTI is characterized by dysuria and frequency in an immunocompetent, non-pregnant adult female and is the most common bacterial infection in women. A complicated infection typically involves a patient that is immunocompromised, elderly, male, pregnant, diabetic, and/or with urologic abnormalities such as indwelling catheters or kidney disease.

S. saprophyticus can be differentiated from another coagulase-negative staphylococcus by its resistance to Novobiocin. Like other uropathogens, S. saprophyticus utilizes urease to produce ammonia. However, unlike many of these organisms, it cannot reduce nitrate.

S. saprophyticus is part of the normal human flora that colonizes the perineum, rectum, urethra, cervix, and gastrointestinal tract. It has also been found that S. saprophyticus is a common gastrointestinal flora in pigs and cows and thus may be transferred to humans through eating these respective foods.
