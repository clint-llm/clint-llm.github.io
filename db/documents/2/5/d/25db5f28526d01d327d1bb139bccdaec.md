Valproate-induced hepatotoxicity is due to the inhibition of beta-oxidation of fatty acids resulting in mitochondrial injury. Further, valproateÂ decreases tissue carnitine levels, which also results in mitochondrial dysfunction in the hepatocytes resulting in microvesicular steatosis of the liver. Mutation of the gamma polymerase enzyme, which is the primary DNA polymerase inside the mitochondria, makes patients more vulnerable to valproate hepatotoxicity.

Patients with valproate toxicity present with hyperammonemia, anion gap acidosis, metabolic encephalopathy, and hepatotoxicity.
