Early identification of hyperesthesia and other neuropathic pain symptoms is essential to start the patient on a proper treatment plan. The education of the patient early on during the treatment is necessary to establish realistic pain goals. Always treat with a multidisciplinary team approach.Â While the general practitioner is almost always involved in the care of patients with hyperesthesia, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that includes pain medicine specialists, sleep medicine professionals, physical therapists, and occupational therapists. A psychiatrist and psychologist evaluations are recommended as many patients suffer from mood disorders.
