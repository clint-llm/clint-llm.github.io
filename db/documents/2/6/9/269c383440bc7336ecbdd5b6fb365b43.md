Due to the surgical complexity of third molar surgery, post-operative pain, swelling, and trismus often occur as a result. These effects are transient and typically well-managed with simple analgesia. Other complications include alveolar osteitis, also known as dry socket, which is managed with careful irrigation of the extraction socket with chlorhexidine gluconate or saline and dressing the socket with an obtundent, resorbable material.

Furthermore, patients on anti-coagulation medication or with bleeding disorders may present with prolonged post-operative bleeding, which will need to be managed through debridement of the socket, placement of hemostatic agents in the socket, and closure of the bleeding socket with sutures. While these complications can be seen following any dental extraction, mandibular third molars risk damage to the IAN and the lingual nerve and subsequent temporary or permanent altered sensation of the cheek, chin, lip, tongue, and teeth. Typically, paraesthesia is transient and resolves spontaneously in days, weeks, or months. If the paraesthesia is persistent after six months, it is considered permanent.
