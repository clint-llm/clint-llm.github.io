In the modern era, a prostate abscess cannot just be assumed to be a consequence of untreated prostatitis. Men with prostatic abscesses generally have significant medical problems and are often severely debilitated or immunologically compromised. A prostatic abscess can be the initial presentation of a previously undiagnosed immune compromising condition in the younger population. It is becoming more common in older men as a complication of benign prostatic hyperplasia or a prostate biopsy.

Male patients with lower urinary tract infections and prostate infections should be educated to monitor for warning signs and symptoms of abscess formation. In particular, patients who develop febrile urinary tract infections following a prostate biopsy should be considered high risk for developing a prostatic abscess and should be educated accordingly. With the blossoming of more resistant bacterial strains and the relatively frequent presentation of this condition in diabetic and immunosuppressed patients, real-life scenarios present increasing challenges in the diagnosis and management of these patients.
