The adverse effects of pramipexole are attributed to both peripheral and central dopaminergic stimulation. A severe adverse effect is the sudden onset of sleep, leading to road traffic accidents. Consequently, manufacturers issued a warning concerning the use of pramipexole in patients involved in driving or activities demanding vigilance. Compulsive behaviors like punding and impulse control disorders like gambling, excessive shopping, and hypersexuality are known serious adverse effects of treatment with pramipexole.
