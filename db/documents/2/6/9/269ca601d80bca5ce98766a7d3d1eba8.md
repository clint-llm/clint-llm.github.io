Patients should be educated about the dismal prognosis and the possible adverse side effects from the intensive chemotherapeutic regimes before beginning treatment. They should be provided with the options of less intensive chemotherapy options such as CHOP versus more intensive, and the higher side effect profile of options such as EPOCH or CODOX-M or hyper-CVAD and a combined decision between the physician and the patient should be made weighing all risks and benefits.
