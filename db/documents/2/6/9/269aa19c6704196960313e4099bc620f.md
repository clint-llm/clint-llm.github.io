Clinical manifestations of candidemia are nonspecific. It presents like any other bloodstream infection with a clinical spectrum that goes from chills, shivering, and fever to severe sepsis and septic shock with signs of end-organ damage. Physical findings can vary from a normal exam to findings specific to localizedÂ deep-seated tissue infections, for example, endophthalmitis skin lesions, candiduria, and central nervous system findings.
