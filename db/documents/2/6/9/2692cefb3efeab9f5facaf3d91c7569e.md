Rotor syndrome is a benign disease with no effect on life expectancy. No adverse drug effects have been documented in people with Rotor syndrome, but the absence of the hepatic proteins OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 may lead to serious issues with liver uptake. OATP1B1 plays a role in drug detoxification, and with reduced activity of this protein, certain drugs such as anticancer agents, methotrexate, and statins can accumulate and result in drug toxicity.
