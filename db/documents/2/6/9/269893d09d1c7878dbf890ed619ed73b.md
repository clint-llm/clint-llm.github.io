Presbyopia is a progressive age-related loss of the ability to focus near objects.

Symptoms such as headache, tearing, ocular discomfort, diplopia, asthenopia, and loss of concentration are usually associated with uncorrected presbyopia.

Refractive errors can affect the age of onset of presbyopic symptoms, prompting intervention and correction. The degree of age-related accommodative deficit varies greatly with the type and degree of refractive error. An uncorrected hyperope of a moderate degree may present with symptoms earlier than an individual with uncorrected myopia of the same degree and age. Consequently, early presbyopia, which refers to the onset of presbyopic symptoms before 40 years of age, tends to be most likely associated with uncorrected hyperopia. Thus, adequate correction of the underlying refractive error is fundamental in the management of presbyopia.
