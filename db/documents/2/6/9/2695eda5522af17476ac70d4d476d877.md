Prior to the exam, the child could be asked to hold parental oral intake for 6Â to 8 hours, as light sedation is required at times for younger children. The patient will be asked to lay supine on the exam table or bed, with the head of the bed at roughly a 30-degree angle. If possible, the lateral decubitus position can provide optimal images given the gravitational pull of the heart towards the surface. In infants, the parent may wish to hold the patient for simplicity. Distractors are provided when needed. A few electrodes will be placed on the child to allow ECG gated images. The gown will be lowered to expose the patient's left breast. A towel is provided to adolescents for privacy purposes. US jelly will then be placed on the tip of the probe, and the exam will start.
