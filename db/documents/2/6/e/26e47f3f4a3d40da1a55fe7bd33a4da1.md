The retina is located in the posterior portion of the eye and is the sensory component of the organ. The retina consists of specialized nerve cells that receive and process light energy and relay generated action potentials via the optic nerve to the brain. The retina consists of two photoreceptor types: rods and cones. Rods are more abundant, contain greater photopigment, have high sensitivity with lower visual acuity, and are achromatic, referring to the use of a singular photopigment, rhodopsin. The human retina consists of approximately 90 million rod cells, located in the highest density 15 to 20 degrees from the fovea. The fovea's location is in the center of the macula, which resides in line with the pupil and lateral to the optic nerve. Cones are more densely present in the fovea, exhibit higher visual acuity, confer color vision using trichromatic photopigments, and are present in numbers of approximately 6 million in the retina.
