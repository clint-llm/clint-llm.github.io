Tangier disease exhibits an autosomal recessive pattern for its clinical features while exhibits an autosomal codominant trait for its biochemical findings. Therefore, if the patient received both the recessive genes from their parents, they will have an extremely low level of HDL, and If the patient inherited only one gene from their parents, they would have a relatively low level of HDL (about half the normal level in normal individuals) but no overt clinical manifestation of the disease. Heterogeneous parents for the pathology will have a 25% chance of having an affected sibling or homozygous sibling, 50% of having a carrier sibling or heterozygous sibling, and 25% of having a normal sibling, while homozygous parent married to a normal individual will have 100% carrier siblings.

Mutations have been found in chromosome 9q31, which encodes for the ATP-Binding cassette transporter (ABCA-1) gene. These transporters normally transmit cholesterol and phospholipids from inside the cells into the liver. Thus cholesterol will be accumulated within the cells, which eventually impairs cell functions and lead to their death.
