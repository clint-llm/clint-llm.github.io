Omori, et al., performed a case series of patients with glottic insufficiency dysphonia that studied the influence of glottal gap size and etiology on vocal functioning.

The vocal function has been shown to improve with both medialization thyroplasty and injection augmentation techniques.

Success with vocal fold fat injections tends to be variable due to the unpredictability of reabsorption of the fat in the first few weeks. Over-injection by 30% is required to allow for this implant loss, and patients should understand they will be dysphonic for approximately 3 weeks.

Medialization thyroplasty has shown good outcomes while short-term vocal function results of augmentation may be good, for larger glottic gaps, medialization thyroplasty may provide superior longer-term results.
