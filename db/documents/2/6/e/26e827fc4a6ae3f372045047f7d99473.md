Sugammadex contains eight identical hydroxyl chains bound together to create a ring with a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic outer surface.

The sugammadex-rocuronium inclusion complex has a very high association constant (1.79 x 10 mol/L).

Sugammadex reverses neuromuscular blockade by encapsulating free NMBD in plasma. This decreases the plasma concentration of free NMBD, which creates a concentration gradient between the muscle tissue compartment and plasma. Consequently, free NMBD moves from the muscle tissue compartment to plasma; these NMBD are encapsulated by plasma sugammadex, which maintains the lower concentration of free NMBD in plasma and fuels the cycle. Consequently, there is a rapid decrease in the concentration of NMBD at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor within the neuromuscular junction. This allows neuromuscular activity to resume.
