The procedure involves the collection of the blood sample from the patient in the tube or the vial and sending it for analysis. There are two methods of conducting the analysis in the lab.

**Slide Method:**A small amount of the serum sample from the patient is placed on the slide, after which the preferred antigen drop is added to it. The next step is to rotate the consequential postponement for a minute. If this results in visible agglutination, then a positive result is indicated.

**Tube Method:**In this method, a twofold dilution of the serum sample is added to the tubes along with diluents; 0.25% phenol saline. The tube’s final volume has to be made up to 1 ml. Antigen deferment is then added and incubated for four to six hours at 50 to 55 degrees C. Positive results are indicated if there is granulation or visible flocculation.
