- Evans syndrome is an autoimmune condition that presents with two or more cytopenias, which commonly includes autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with or without immune neutropenia.

- It can be primary (or idiopathic) or secondary (i.e., associated with an underlying disorder). When secondary, it has been associated with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in younger patients, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in patients older than 50 years, and chronic lymphocytosis leukemia (CLL).

- Because it is an idiopathic condition, other common diagnoses should be ruled out before diagnosing the condition.

- Corticosteroids and IVIG are the first-line treatment options for Evans syndrome. Rituximab is the preferred second-line treatment. Other treatment options include splenectomy, danazol, and immunosuppressants.

- Even with treatment, responses can be variable, and relapses are common, commonly requiring multimodal management.
