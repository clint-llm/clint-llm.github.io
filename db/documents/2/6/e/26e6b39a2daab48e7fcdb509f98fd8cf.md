# Continuing Education Activity

Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is an inherited primary immunodeficiency disorder that presents by six months of age with opportunistic infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. It is one of the most serious primary immunodeficiency disorders with early death due to disturbed or absent T and B cell functions. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of severe combined immunodeficiency disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for those with the disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of severe combined immunodeficiency disease.
- Outline the history and physical exam of a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for severe combined immunodeficiency disease.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in counseling the parents of those with severe combined immunodeficiency disease.

# Introduction

Patients with combined immunodeficiency disorder (T and B lymphocyte deficiency) present with recurrent infections usually early in life. These patients are susceptible to infection by many organisms. Immunotherapy sometimes is not available to treat these recurrent infections. Severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is the most severe expression among the combined immunodeficiency disorders. The onset of the clinical manifestations occurs by 6 months of age or before, with bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoal infections. Also, these infections may lead to early death in severe combined immunodeficiency disease, differentiating this condition from other forms or combined immunodeficiency.

Both T and B cell functions are disturbed or absent entirely in severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Autosomal, sporadic, or the X-linked form may affect the neonate, and without treatment, patients rarely survive beyond one year of age before succumbing to opportunistic infections.

# Etiology

Some causes and examples of SCID

- T-B-NK- SCID can be seen in reticular dysgenesis caused by a lack of stem cells. A similar phenotype (T-B-NK-) occurs in adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, and defective ADA genes cause it leads to toxic metabolites in T, B, and NK cells.

- T-B-NK+ SCID (RAG1/2 defect) can cause SCID due to RAG1/2 enzymes to snip DNA for VDJ rearrangement for TCR and BCR. A similar phenotype is Artemis deficiency characterized by a failure to repair DNA after RAG1/2 snips.

- T-B+NK- SCID can be X linked and due to absent IL receptor for a range of cytokines due to lack of common gamma chain. A similar phenotype named Jak 3 kinase deficiency is caused by a lack of Jak 3 kinase to follow signal via IL-R binding.

- T-B+NK+ SCID is the phenotype of IL-7 deficiency when there are no IL-7 alpha chains that lead to the failure of T cell differentiation. A similar phenotype is present in CD3 activation failure, characterized by defective signal transduction, e.g., ZAP-70 deficiency.

- T+B+NK+ MHC failure is a phenotype that has two conditions: MHC class I deficiency (bare lymphocyte syndrome) and MHC class II deficiency. The first condition is caused by failure to express MHC class I caused by a defect in TAP-2 transcription. The second condition is due to a defect in transcription of MHC class II proteins.

# Epidemiology

The Jeffrey Modell Foundation implemented public awareness and physician education about primary immunodeficiencies, including severe combined immunodeficiency disease beginning in 2003. The network has implemented population-based newborn screening for SCID and T cell lymphopenia, covering 96% of the total newborns in the US.

The majority of the patients (89%) presented with the first symptoms within six months of age. The clinical manifestations observed were recurrent pneumonia (66%), followed by failure to thrive (60%) and chronic diarrhea (35%).

One US study reported the incidence of SCID as 1 in 58,000 live births.

# Pathophysiology

Genetic mutation is the root cause of SCID.  Specifically, the genes which are responsible for the function of T and B cells are affected in SCID.  Profound T-cell abnormalities can prevent B cells from functioning normally because the B cells require signals from T cells to produce appropriate antibodies.  Therefore, in some instances, SCID may be present with only T cell dysfunction.  Natural killer (NK) cells develop separately from T and B cells and can provide a degree of protection in individuals with T and B cell dysfunction.  Assessing for the presence of NK cells helps determine the severity and prognosis of the SCID.

# Histopathology

In SCID, microscopic examination of the thymic stroma reveals an absence of lymphoid cells, as well as the absence of Hassall's corpuscles.  In essence, the thymus gland has a fetal appearance.

Additionally, numerable Giardia lamblia can present in the gastrointestinal tract, specifically over the mucosa of the jejunum. The lack of protective immunity results in an inability to fight against these intestinal parasites.

Biopsy of lymph nodes (if detectable) shows severe depletion, without cortico-medullary differentiation or follicle formation. Biopsy of the intestinal tract may demonstrate a complete absence of plasma cells.

# Differential Diagnosis

At the top of the differential for SCID are other forms of combined immunodeficiency.  These patients have several characteristics that overlap in their clinical presentation.  Patients with agenesis of the thymus or T cell deficiency (such as in DiGeorge syndrome or CHARGE syndrome) may present with opportunistic infections similar to SCID.

Additional immunodeficiencies that merit consideration in the differential include the following:

- Calcium channel deficiencies

- Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome

- NF-kappa-B essential modifier (NEMO) deficiency

- Zeta-chain-associated protein 70 deficiency

- HIV/AIDS

Malabsorption syndromes that cause extreme malnutrition may also have similar presentations to SCID.

# Prognosis

SCID has the poorest prognosis among combined immunodeficiencies unless bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy (experimental) is successfully performed. In general, for improving the quality of life of patients with primary immunodeficiencies, long-term management with antimicrobials is needed. Most primary immunodeficiencies require personalized management, e.g., genetic testing for various enzyme impairments.

# Complications

- Life-threatening overwhelming infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites

- Multiorgan failure

- Endocrinopathy

- Opportunistic malignancy

- Septic shock

- Congenital disabilities

- Respiratory insufficiency

- Anaphylactic shock

- Bleeding disorders

- Cardiac failure

- Acute and chronic renal failure

- Premature death

- Metabolic disturbances (e.g., acidosis and alkalosis)

- Neurological complications including seizures and coma

# Pearls and Other Issues

- SCID is the most severe expression of all combined immunodeficiencies

- NK cells may or may not be present, and establishing the presence or absence of these cells can be helpful in prognostication

- Treatment is limited, and the disease is invariably fatal within the first year of life

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

SCID should be managed by an interprofessional team that likely includes a pediatrician, geneticist, clinical immunologist, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, and an infectious disease specialist. The treatment team may also provide counseling to the parents, given the poor prognosis associated with the disease. Because of the high morbidity of the disorder, a palliative team consisting of a nurse, a social worker, and a pain specialist should also have involvement in the care. Pediatric hematology nurses assist in the care of these patients and report changes to the team. Pharmacists review medications, check for interactions and educate patient's families about side effects and compliance. [Level 5]
