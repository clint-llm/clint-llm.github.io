Torticollis is a common diagnosis, and estimates are that 90 percent of individuals will exhibit at least one episode of torticollis throughout their lifetime. Typically, torticollis presents with abnormal rotation and flexion. However, there are several other positional presentations, which may include flexion, extension, and right or left tilt. Torticollis may be benign, as in cases of congenital torticollis, or malignant or due to serious causes such as brain injury. Most commonly, torticollis occurs due to dysfunctional local neuromuscular mechanisms, termed focal dystonia. Cervical dystonia is among the most common focal dystonias in adults. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of torticollis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common presentations of torticollis. 
- Explain the pathophysiology of torticollis. 
- Review the management of torticollis. 
- Outline the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by torticollis.
