Dysfunction of the anterolateral abdominal nerves can potentially result in abdominal weakness, hernia, chronic pain, movement impairment, sensory loss, and sexual dysfunction. Each of these factors can implicate and reduce the quality of life of an individual.

Compression of the thoracoabdominal nerves most commonly occurs at the point where the nerves pierce the posterior rectus sheath, given that they turn 90 degrees to travel anteriorly through the linea semilunaris.
