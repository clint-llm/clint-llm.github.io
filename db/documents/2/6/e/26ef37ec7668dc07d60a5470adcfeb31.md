Isosorbide is a medication used to treat and prevent angina pectoris in patients with coronary heart disease. It is in the nitrate class of drugs. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for isosorbide as a valuable agent in treating angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and achalasia. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and relevant interactions pertinent to the health care team members in managing patients with angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of isosorbide.
- Describe the potential adverse effects patients may experience when using isosorbide.
- Review the appropriate monitoring necessary with isosorbide.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery and improve outcomes for patients with angina pectoris receiving isosorbide.
