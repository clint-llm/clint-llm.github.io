In the United States, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in adults 18 years and older is continuing to be significant. Data shows that the prevalence of this disease process increased from the 1980s to 2012 by 35%. In the 1980s, the incidence was noted to be 25.3% and increased to 34.2% in 2012. However, the most recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) shows the prevalence is on a decline with 24% in men and 22% in women.
