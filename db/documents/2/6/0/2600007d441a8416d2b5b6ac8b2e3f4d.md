The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to objectively describe the extent of impaired consciousness in all types of acute medical and trauma patients. The scale assesses patients according to three aspects of responsiveness: eye-opening, motor, and verbal responses. Reporting each of these separately provides a clear, communicable picture of a patient. The findings in each component of the scale can aggregate into a total Glasgow Coma Score which gives a less detailed description but can provide a useful summary of the overall severity. The Glasgow Coma Scale and its total score have since been incorporated in numerous clinical guidelines and scoring systems for victims of trauma or critical illness. This activity describes the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale and reviews the role of using the scale for the interprofessional team to successfully communicate a patients condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the value of the Glasgow Coma Scale for patient care.
- Outline the three areas the Glascow Coma Scales assesses.
- Summarize the severity findings for each range of the Glascow Coma Scale.
- Review how the interprofessional team can use the Glasgow Coma Scale to communicate regarding a patients condition.
