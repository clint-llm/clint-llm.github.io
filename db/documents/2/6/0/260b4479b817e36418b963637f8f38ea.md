**Life Cycle ofStrongyloides stercoralis**

The distinctive nature of the life cycle of this human parasite is attributed to its ability to cause autoinfection. Its life cycle comprises a free-living phase and a parasitic phase.

**Parasitic Phase**

Infection occurs through skin contact with soil containing filariform (infective) larvae. After penetrating the skin, larvae travel to the lungs, where they mature. It then travels up the trachea and is eventually swallowed. In the alimentary canal, the larvae invade the mucosa of the proximal small intestine. Here they mature and lay eggs.

**Autoinfection**

Some rhabditiform larvae mature inside the intestinal lumen into filariform larvae. These newly hatched larvae can then penetrate the intestinal mucosa or the perianal skin and complete an autoinfection cycle. This allows the organism to perpetuate the infection inside the host.

**Hyperinfection**

Hyperinfection syndrome is the most severe manifestation of the disease, with high mortality rates. This occurs in chronically infected individuals that become immunosuppressed or in acutely infected immunosuppressed patients.
