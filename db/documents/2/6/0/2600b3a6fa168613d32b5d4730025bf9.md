Pars planitis is chronic intermediate uveitis for which no systemic disease or associated infection could be found. The term intermediate uveitis describes an intraocular inflammatory process with vitreous as the primary site of inflammation. Inflammation may be present in the anterior vitreous, the vitreous base overlying the peripheral retina-pars plana region. It is characterized by vitreal inflammatory aggregates (snowballs), and whitish exudates on the inferior pars plana (snowbanking). Intermediate uveitis includes posterior cyclitis, pars planitis, and hyalitis.

Pars planitis refers to the subset of intermediate uveitis, characterized by the presence of snowball or snowbank formation, without an underlying infectious or systemic disease.
