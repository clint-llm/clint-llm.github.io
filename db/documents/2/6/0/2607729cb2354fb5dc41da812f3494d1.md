Rickets, skeletal dysplasia due to secondary causes such as osteoarthritis, and asymmetric growth are common differential diagnoses. Persistent physiological varus, metaphyseal dysostosis, focal fibrocartilaginous defects, thrombocytopenia, absent radius, and proximal tibia physeal injury (resulting from previous radiation, infection, trauma) may present with similar clinical findings.
