Vascular complications, either arterial or venous, are complications related to the flaps surgery, and it should be minimized by a proper preoperative planning and a careful surgical technique. Any technical mistake in flap design, harvest, or insetting can yield to either partial or complete flap necrosis. Infections can also occur, either superficial or deep. Donor site morbidity related to aesthetics can be significant, especially with larger flaps.
