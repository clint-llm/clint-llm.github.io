Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by the deficiency of one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal glands. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (more than 90% of the cases). Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement are the mainstays of treatment.

Prenatal diagnosis and treatment of affected females are very important, to minimize genital virilization. Because 21-hydroxylase deficiency is often undiagnosed in affected males until they have severe adrenal insufficiency, all US states and many other countries have instituted newborn screening programs that measure 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration). Newborn screening can detect almost all infants with classic CAH and some infants with nonclassic CAH. Although false-negative results are uncommon, false-positive results are usually seen in premature infants; therefore, serial measurements of 17-hydroxyprogesterone are advised for premature infants. A positive newborn screening test for CAH must be confirmed by a second plasma sample (17-hydroxyprogesterone), and serum electrolytes should be measured**.**

This activity highlights the diagnosis and treatment of 21 hydroxylase deficiency.
