Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is a relatively rare condition that is characterized by a chronic inflammatory and fibrosis in the retroperitoneum that can lead to compression of structures within the retroperitoneum. This fibrotic process can often lead to encasement of the ureters and other abdominal organs including the inferior vena cava. The process can be idiopathic or secondary to other causes. Treatment may involve medical therapy and/or surgical management. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of retroperitoneal fibrosis and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when retroperitoneal fibrosis should be considered on differential diagnosis. 
- Describe the evaluation of retroperitoneal fibrosis. 
- Explain how retroperitoneal fibrosis is treated. 
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid detection of retroperitoneal fibrosis and subsequently enhance management and patient outcomes.
