Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance benefit greatly from the early diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Raising awareness about this potentially life-threatening condition can lead to early recognition. While a pediatrician will always be involved in caring for patients with this condition, it is important to involve an interprofessional team of a hepatologist, nephrologist, clinical geneticist, and genetic counselor. Nutritionists must periodically counsel patients about the importance of compliance with dietary restrictions. Nurses are vital in educating the family about the condition. Pharmacists play a vital role in ensuring that medications are free of fructose or substances that can be broken down into fructose. Involving an interprofessional team is essential for the successful management of patients with this disorder. [Level 5]
