Acquired flatfoot is a common disease that when recognized early, is highly treatable with excellent outcomes. All members of the healthcare team can play a role in the identification, treatment, and follow-up of care for patients with acquired flatfoot. This team may consist of family practitioners, specialty-trained nurses, orthopedic and foot and ankle surgeons, physical therapists, and radiologists. As with all orthopedic surgeries, a physical therapist must work closely with surgeons to assure adequate recovery and slow progression to full activity. Family practitioners may be the first physicians to see the patient and diagnose the disorder. They should be aware of the basic diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols so that patients can be referred to surgeons when non-operative management is futile.
