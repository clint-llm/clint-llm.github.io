Soft tissue swelling and irritability in a child can raise concern for non-accidental trauma. Evaluation of other traumatic injuries or sentinel injuries is essential. Requesting workup by a child abuse pediatrician can help prevent misdiagnosis. ICH can mimic child abuse but can be differentiated by the age of onset, site of involvement, lack of fracture, and limitation to the diaphysis. In ICH, new bone formation areas are usually thick and rounded versus tapering of the bone seen in child abuse. Periosteal reaction extending into the epiphysis is more indicative of physical abuse. Clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion of the conditions that can mimic child abuse, such as ICH, to correct diagnosis.
