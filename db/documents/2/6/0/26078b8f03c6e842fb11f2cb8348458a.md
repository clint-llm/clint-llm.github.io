Subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy demonstrates a wide array of laboratory, molecular, and radiographic findings. While there are no established diagnostic criteria, affected individuals often share key features. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that the lactate levels in the blood and CSF of affected patients are elevated in up to 72% of patients. On a molecular level, 80% of SNE casesÂ lack a complete mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complex with DNA mutations of the mitochondria (32%) and cell nucleus (38%).
