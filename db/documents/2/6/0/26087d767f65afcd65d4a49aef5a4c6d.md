There are no contraindications to visual acuity testing.

However, there are many clinical parameters that can complicate testing and negatively affect testing results. Some of these parameters include:

- Ocular diseases

- Illumination of the chart

- Contrast

- Pupil size

- Type of optotype used

- Refractive error

- Retinal eccentricity

- Duration of exposure

- Crowding due to interaction from adjacent contours

- Light exposure before the vision testing

- Patient cooperation or functional disease
