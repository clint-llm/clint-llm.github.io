A thorough history and physical exam are crucial for evaluating and diagnosing pernio. In general, asking questions regarding the timing of lesions, recent exposures to cold, and improvement of symptoms with removal of cold exposure help narrow the differential to pernio or at least one of the other vasospastic disease processes.

As mentioned earlier, skin biopsies are often not helpful in the diagnosis of pernio as the histologic findings are commonly non-specific. However, histologic findings of lymphocytic infiltrate, dermal edema, and necrotic keratinocytes can support a diagnosis of pernio.

Some basic lab work can help in the initial evaluation of pernio, including a complete blood count, antinuclear antibody, and serum protein electrophoresis. Depending on the presentation and precipitating factors, serum cryoglobulins are also an option if deemed appropriate. Because cryoglobulins are only rarely associated with pernio, they are often excluded from initial testing and only included after performing an initial workup.
