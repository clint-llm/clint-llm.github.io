Heart valves are metabolically active, as is the aortic valve; the cusps contain blood vessels for oxygen supply and removal of metabolic waste. The vessels exist in a higher percentage in the basal third of the cusps; these vessels continue from the commissures to the portion of the free edge. This microcirculation of the valve is essential for any intrinsic repairs of the cusps tissue. The distribution of oxygen in the cusps depends on the relationship between the thickness of the valves and the tension of the ventricle/aorta.
