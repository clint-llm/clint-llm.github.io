Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is currently hypothesized to be a manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disease, which may arise as a primary aortitis that elicits a periaortic fibro-inflammatory response. The condition is frequently associated with increased concentrations of acute phase reactants, autoantibodies, and known autoimmune diseases. The disease also affects other vascular segments such as the thoracic aorta and mesenteric arteries, which supports the concept that it is a primary systemic inflammatory disease of large arteries. Ceroid, a complex polymer of oxidized lipids and protein found in atherosclerotic plaques, is hypothesized as being the antigen that initiates the inflammatory response. Histologically, there is the presence of macrophages, plasma cells, B and T lymphocytes. Most plasma cells are positive for immunoglobulin 4 (IgG4). The presence of IgG4-producing plasma cells suggests that RPF could also be a manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). This is a multisystem disease characterized by tumor-like swelling of involved organs; lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4 positive plasma cells and variable degrees of fibrosis. The exact pathophysiology of drug-induced RPF remains unclear
