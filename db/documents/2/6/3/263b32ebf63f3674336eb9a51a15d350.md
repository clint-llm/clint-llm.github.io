Pityriasis lichenoides encompasses a group of inflammatory cutaneous disorders known as pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC), pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA), and febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease (a subtype of PLEVA). PLEVA is a relatively benign cutaneous disorder of unclear origin that affects children and young adults. Patients present with a spontaneous eruption of erythematous macules that evolve into papules, rapidly undergoing hemorrhagic necrosis and ulceration. The disease tends to wax and wane with complete resolution, varying in weeks to years. This activity describes the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of PLEVA and the importance of the interprofessional team in recognizing and managing patients with this condition.
