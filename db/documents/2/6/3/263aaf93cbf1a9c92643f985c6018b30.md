Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery lowers IOP by altering various aspects of aqueous humor dynamics. MIGS can bypass the trabecular meshwork. The resistance to aqueous outflow is bypassed by using a stent. The stent allows the aqueous to flow directly from the anterior chamber to Schlemm's canal and, in turn, reduces IOP.

The second approach to bypass the trabecular meshwork resistance is goniotomy or trabeculectomy. The surgical alteration of tissue by excision or incision allows improved aqueous drainage through Schlemm's canal. Another approach is by dilating the Schlemm canal using viscoelastic, which enhances the normal physiological aqueous outflow.

The next approach of MIGS is to increase uveoscleral outflow. A microstent can be placed in the suprachoroidal space. If this is not possible, then aqueous can be bypassed into the subconjunctival space by a small incisional ab interno approach.

The last approach reduces the aqueous production through ciliary processes by ciliary body ablation. This is done by endocyclophotocoagulation, in which an endoscopic laser is inserted through a clear corneal incision, and the ciliary body is ablated.
