**Laboratory findings**in renal infarction include leukocytosis, macroscopic or microscopic hematuria, elevated C reactive protein (CRP), and very high Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH).

In a study by Gasparini et al., out of 20 patients whose urinalysis results were available, hematuria was present in 65%, and proteinuria was present in 70% of patients with renal infarctions.

LDH is a marker of cell necrosis and a sensitive indicator of renal infarction, which can rise to 4 or 5 times the normal value with no similar rise in serum aminotransferases.

A marked increase in LDH, especially with normal aminotransferase, is considered strongly suggestive of renal infarction as this is not associated with either urolithiasis, acute renal colic, or pyelonephritis.

Other possible lab findings in renal infarctions are abnormally elevated creatinine and creatine kinase values and a decline in GFR. The rise in creatinine is more evident in patients with a particularly large renal infarct or bilateral involvement of both kidneys.

**Atherosclerotic emboli**causing a renal infarction would be associated with eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and low serum complement in the acute phase. However, these findings disappear after about one week from the time of the injury.

Atheroembolic renal emboli also tend to produce a slow and often subacute decrease in renal function, which typically plateaus at three to eight weeks.

**Imaging**

The initial investigation in patients presenting with acute flank pain, vomiting, and hematuria is usually a non-contrast CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out urolithiasis and pyelonephritis, which are the most common reasons for such a clinical presentation.

The only findings of renal infarction in a non-contrast CT abdomen may be some perinephric stranding and mild renal swelling, but these can easily be misinterpreted as signs of a recently passed kidney stone. The standard test for a suspected renal infarction is a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen which should be done in cases of possible renal infarction with negative non-contrast studies, especially in patients with elevated LDH, atrial fibrillation, increased risk, or history of thrombosis, or elevated age (>70).

In an intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen, a clear hypodensity or wedge-shaped perfusion defect can be appreciated, mostly in the arterial phase. In a segmental infarct, there may be a thin rim of the renal cortex paralleling the wedge-shaped area of the infarct, presenting with normal enhancement. This is called the cortical rim sign, which is seen in about half of the cases of renal infarction.

**Renal CT arteriography is the gold standard investigation for renal infarction.**

A color doppler scan may also be beneficial in demonstrating decreased or absent blood flow to the infarcted area. Contrast agents like gadolinium in MRI must be used after considering the patient's renal function as it poses a risk for developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) in a renal infarction demonstrates non-visualization of the infarcted renal parenchyma. A DMSA radioisotope scan will demonstrate decreased or no tracer uptake in the affected area.

No further radiological investigation may be necessary if the initial non-contrast CT depicts an atrophic and scarred kidney as would present in an old chronic renal infarction because interventions are unlikely to salvage the kidney at that point.

An EKG should be done to look for atrial fibrillation in all patients diagnosed with renal infarction. A transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiogram can evaluate the possibility of cardiac thromboembolic disease and thrombi. A careful assessment of coagulation disorders should be performed if cardiac and renal arterial pathology have been eliminated as causative factors of renal infarction or if surgical revascularization is being considered.

There are clinical factors that might help distinguish renal infarction from renal colic.

- Age >70 years with no previous history of nephrolithiasis

- Atrial fibrillation

- C-reactive protein >0.23 mg/dL

- Serum LDH >500 IU/L (especially with normal serum aminotransferases)

- More likely to be diabetic and hypertensive

- Negative urinalysis for RBCs

- Negative non-contrast CT scan
