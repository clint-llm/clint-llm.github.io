Families of patients with CHARGE syndrome need education about the disease manifestations and possible complications. Genetic counseling should be accessible for individuals at increased risk for potentially affected offspring to describe options in future pregnancies, including preimplantation and prenatal genetic diagnosis. Children with CHARGE syndrome can be assessed on a case by case basis. Some may require full-time support and individualized programs, and some may need little assistance. An essential step in dealing with abnormal behavior is understanding why it is occurring and helping the child learn more suitable methods of interaction. Before a child reaches the age of eighteen, care must be transitioned to adult clinicians and specialists that will manage the individual in later years.
