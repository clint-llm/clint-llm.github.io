Baseline complete blood counts, renal function, urinalysis, urine microscopy, and urine protein evaluation (urine protein by creatinine ratio, or 24-hour urine protein) should be performed in all patients with a suspicion of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Markers of inflammation, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, may be elevated.

**Cryoglobulin Detection**

Accurate detection of cryoglobulins can be difficult, and false-positive and false-negative values are not uncommon. The blood shall be drawn into preheated tubes at 37°C until coagulated followed by centrifugation after which, it should be stored at 4°C for 7 days. A white precipitate indicates the presence of cryoglobulins at the bottom of the tube, which dissolves when the tube is rewarmed to 37°C. Quantification of cryoglobulins shall be determined by measuring the percentage of cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins shall be then characterized by immunologic methods, including immunofixation and immunodiffusion, which help identify the type of immunoglobulin involved. As noted above, false-positive and false-negative test results are common and repeated testing increases accuracy.

**Serologic Testing**

Rheumatoid factor testing shall be pursued in all patients with a suspicion of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Complement levels shall be tested as well and will usually indicate low serum C4 and normal C3. Serological workup including ANA, Anti-SSA, Anti-SSB, Anti-Ds-DNA, Anti-Smith, and other autoantibodies to detect underlying autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjogren syndrome shall be considered based on the patient's clinical presentation.

**Infection Workup**

Viral hepatitis screening, including anti-hepatitis C viral antibody, hepatitis C viral RNA PCR, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody, shall be performed to detect underlying viral hepatitis. Workup for other potential infectious etiology can be considered on an individual basis.

**Malignancy Workup**

Complete blood count with differential, peripheral smear, flow cytometry for evaluation of underlying leukemia or lymphoma should be considered. Serum protein electrophoresis and quantitative immunoglobulins shall be considered to rule out multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Bone marrow or lymph node biopsy may be needed in some cases.

**Pathological Workup**

Skin biopsy of cutaneous lesions can be done (and is recommended if initial presentation). Skin biopsy shall be sent for histopathology and for immunofluorescence to identify immune-complexes. In cases of suspicion of renal involvement, renal biopsy shall be considered.
