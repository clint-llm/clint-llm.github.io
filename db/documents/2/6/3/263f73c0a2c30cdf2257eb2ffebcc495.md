Administering medroxyprogesterone acetate requires communication between interprofessional staff. Communication includes providing detailed instruction on different ways of administering IM and SubQ injections and avoiding IV administration altogether. Additionally, physicians and pharmacists need to work together to determine appropriate forms of medroxyprogesterone, given the patient's symptoms and diagnosis. This level of collaboration can assist in avoiding adverse effects in patients and the potential development of invasive cancers and involves clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists.

Also, nurses and health care teams need training in treating contraceptive overdose and the symptoms that could point in the direction of overdose. Nurses and clinicians in the ED must work together to obtain drug levels in the blood and treat to prevent any immediate adverse side effects resulting from the overdose. To treat any long-term symptoms of the overdose, the healthcare team in the ED should consult with a toxicologist and pharmacist to provide comprehensive care that holistically addresses the concerns based on their expertise.

Medical staff should be prepared to inform patients about the risk and adverse effects of long-term usage. It is of paramount importance that the healthcare team works together to inform women with accurate information and, in the process, take down the inaccurate information spread through magazines and other patient-friendly platforms.
