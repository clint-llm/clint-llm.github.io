As seen from the pathophysiology of urethral strictures, once a stricture is established, it follows a closed circle pattern of increasing fibrosis and worsening stricture. If definitive treatment is not offered, stricture severity will increase gradually, eventually causing complications. However, especially when non-operative management is offered, strictures have high recurrence rates. Surgical management is the treatment option with the best outcomes, with success rates of more than 85%.
