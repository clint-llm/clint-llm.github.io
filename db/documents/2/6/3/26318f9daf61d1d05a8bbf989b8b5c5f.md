As rates for hypoglycemia can be higher with glyburide than other oral antidiabetic agents, close monitoring for signs and symptoms of declining blood glucose levels is required. Hypoglycemia can be life-threatening, and it is crucial to ensure taking proper measures if it occurs in any patient. It is also necessary to monitor glyburide patients even further if they are in circumstances that provoke the onset of hypoglycemia: this includes exercise, lack of eating, and accidental overdosages.

Glyburide and other sulfonylureas may also cause liver dysfunction, potentially resulting in cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, and liver failure, although this is rare.
