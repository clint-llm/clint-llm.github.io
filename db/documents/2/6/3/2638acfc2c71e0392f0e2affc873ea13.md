Hypothyroidism is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of hypothyroid myopathy and is diagnosed by measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 levels in the blood. Most common laboratory finding in the patients' hypothyroid myopathy is the elevation of creatine kinase (CK) in the serum. This is not specific for myopathy and patients may have an elevation of CK for many years prior to developing the myopathy.

Electromyography (EMG) can demonstrate low/small amplitude potentials which could help with diagnosis. However, it is normal in half of the patients and does not preclude the diagnosis. Myoedema is electrically silent as well and helps distinguish myotonia on an EMG. When compared with myositis, there is a lack of fibrillation potentials on EMG with relatively normal motor units.

Muscle biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis but if done, will show swollen and pale muscle tissue with loss of striations and increased separation between the muscle fibers due to mucinous depositions. Type I muscle fiber hypertrophy, type 2 muscle fiber atrophy or focal necrosis and degeneration of muscle fibers may also be noted. Increased numbers of internal nuclei, mitochondrial inclusions, glycogen accumulation, autophagic vacuoles and myofibrillar disorganization are some other non-specific histopathological features that could be seen on the muscle biopsy.
