Lentigo maligna (LM) is a slow-growing subtype of melanoma that often occurs on chronically sun-damaged skin, particularly the head and neck, in the elderly. Due to its clinical and histopathologic mimicry of benign lesions, it is often misdiagnosed for years or even decades, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. This activity summarizes the key findings of LM and discusses the unique diagnostic and treatment challenges of this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe a clear definition of lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma.
- Review the clinical presentation of LM/LMM, along with tools to aid in diagnosis including dermoscopy and reflectance confocal microscopy.
- Outline various treatment options including wide local excision and Mohs micrographic surgery.
- Explain how an interprofessional team can provide the best care for a patient with lentigo maligna.
