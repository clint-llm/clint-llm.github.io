Although there is no clear contraindication, relying on an EEG is the most important diagnostic tool for the confirmation of epilepsy, it should be performed only to support a diagnosis of epilepsy in adults in whom the clinical history suggests that the seizure is likely to be epileptic in origin.

An important consideration is the overdiagnosis of epilepsy that has been a significant hurdle in treating seizures in the last few decades. A detailed clinical history is important to determine the relevance of prescribing an EEG. If performed in cases of probable syncope a false positive result on the EEG can further lead to faulty diagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Similarly, an EEG should also not be used to exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy in patients in whom the clinical presentation supports a diagnosis of a non-epileptic event. For this reason, it is generally performed after the second epileptic seizure but in certain circumstances, as evaluated by the specialist, it can be carried out after a first seizure.

An in-detail history of ongoing medication and a history of cerebrovascular disease and a history of migraine headaches and sleep deprivation is also important to avoid a misdiagnosis of seizure disorder.
