Chronic meralgia paresthetica is associated with specific pathologic findings on LFCN biopsy, including multifocal fiber loss, loss of large myelinated fibers, thinly myelinated profiles, regenerating nerve clusters, perineurial thickening, and subperineurial edema. Several cases also reported focal nerve indentation at the inguinal ligament and intraneural or epineurial inflammation.
