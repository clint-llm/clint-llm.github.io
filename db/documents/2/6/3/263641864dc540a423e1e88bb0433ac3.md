If a patient is experiencing acute onset of EPS, particularly dystonia, the provider must assess if an emergency airway intervention is necessary as laryngeal and pharyngeal dystonic reactions may increase the risk of imminent respiratory arrest. Dystonic reactions are rarely life-threatening, and the provider should discontinue the offending agent and manage pain if present. If the causative medication is a typical first-generation antipsychotic, switching to an atypical antipsychotic may be trialed. Administration of an antimuscarinic agent (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) or diphenhydramine may relieve dystonia within minutes.

For the treatment of akathisia, strategies similar to managing dystonia are employed, including stopping or reducing the dosage of the offending medication, switching to an atypical antipsychotic if a typical first-generation antipsychotic was the offending drug, and administering anti-muscarinic agents. Additional therapeutic strategies more specific to akathisia include administration of a beta-blocker (most commonly propranolol), amantadine, clonidine, benzodiazepines, mirtazapine, mianserin (tetracyclic antidepressant), cyproheptadine, and propoxyphene.

Tardive dyskinesia is treated by withdrawal or dose reduction of the causative medication, switching to an atypical antipsychotic, withdrawal of concurrent antimuscarinic medications (although trihexyphenidyl has been reported to be therapeutic

Drug-induced parkinsonism is treated with discontinuation or dose reduction of the causative medication, switching to an atypical antipsychotic, and administration of medications used for Parkinson disease, including amantadine, antimuscarinic agents, dopamine agonists, and levodopa.
