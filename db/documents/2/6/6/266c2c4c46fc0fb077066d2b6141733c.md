Plain radiography is usually not specific. Intraosseous schwannoma typically has a benign appearance. Bone foramina in the spine can be expanded. Chordomas, giant cell tumors, and chondroblastomas are part of the differential diagnoses for schwannomas. Bone destruction is usually present with these lesions, especially when the sacrum is involved.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans are among special studies to consider, but MRI is preferred. The MRI usually shows an oval or round mass with anÂ isointense or hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and a hyperintense, heterogeneous signal on T2-weighted images. The lesion enhances uniformly with gadolinium contrast. A target sign (central area of hypointensity with a peripheral T2 signal hyperintensity) is the most specific sign of a peripheral nerve sheath tumor but is not specific for a schwannoma.

Ultrasound can be used to detect schwannomas under the skin and can be useful during surgery.
