- Sodium oxybate is contraindicated in patients being treated with sedative-hypnotic agents such as benzodiazepines.

- Sodium oxybate is contraindicated in the patients drinking alcohol.

- Sodium oxybate is contraindicated in patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase(SSADH) deficiency. SSADH deficiency is a rare disorder of inborn error of metabolism variably characterized by mental retardation, hypotonia, and ataxia. In response to the enzyme deficiency, physiologic fluids from patients accumulate gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).

- The active ingredient of sodium oxybate is gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which is associated with severe adverse reactions and substance use disorder.

- Boxed Warning(CNS Depression): Obtundation and clinically significant respiratory depression occurred in clinical trials at recommended doses in sodium oxybate-treated adult patients. Many of the patients who received sodium oxybate during clinical trials in narcolepsy were receiving CNS stimulants.
