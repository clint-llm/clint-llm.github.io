In a patient presenting with a history of seizures, the primary evaluation includes classification of the type of seizure and subsequently, the localization of the seizure focus. In the case of partial epilepsies, the clinical presentation including the type of auras, if present, along with an EEG help in localizing the focus of the lesion, fairly accurately. Imaging modalities can aid in the localization if structural lesions are suspected.

With regards to the EEG, a trained specialist is quick to identify the source of the seizure even though it may record an abnormal waveform remote to the lesion, based on its morphology and frequency, in association with the presentation. Together, they help classify the localization of lesions into mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE), frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE), or occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE). The subjects with lesions that are limited to the temporal lobe were regarded as having either MTLE or LTLE, according to the involvement of the mesial temporal structures. The subjects with asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis (HS) with lateralization of a smaller hippocampus were also included in this study.
