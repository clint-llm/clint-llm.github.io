The treatment of ureterolithiasis is a team effort. Many patients present with symptoms in the emergency department or at their primary care physician (PCP). Patients should be referred to a urologist, especially if the patient has had multiple reoccurring episodes, a large stone, or difficulty passing calculus; this care can be coordinated by the physician. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists should all be involved in educating the patient on this disease, including possible dietary modifications, increasing fluid intake, and how to correctly take the prescribed medications.
