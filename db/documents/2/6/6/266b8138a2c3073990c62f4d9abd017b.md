Proximity to sources of volatile agents is a concern both in the operating room and in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), where the patient continues to exhale physiologically partitioned gas that has not fully equilibrated with the surrounding atmosphere.  PACU nurses are most directly impacted by this, as they dedicate their undivided attention to the recovering surgical patient.  One study described a “patient breathing zone” as being eight inches from the patient’s mouth and suggested a higher degree of exposure in this zone; the detectable levels of waste anesthetic gases exceeded recommended occupational safety limits.  As the distance from the source increases, the gas equilibrates with a greater volume and is ostensibly removed from the immediate vicinity, reducing its potential to cause harm among hospital personnel.  Maintaining appropriate distances may be practical and can promote safe patient interactions, but this may not be feasible for those patients requiring acute nursing care.  The is a currently marketed novel device that the patient wears, and is designed to passively scavenge exhaled anesthetic agents, thus reducing the impact of the patient breathing zone during routine post-anesthesia nursing care.
