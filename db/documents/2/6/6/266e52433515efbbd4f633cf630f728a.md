In the United States, the incidence of myonecrosis is only about 1000 cases per year. In less developed countries with decreased access to healthcare and antibiotics, the incidence is probably higher, but the exact number is unknown. With the best of care, including early recognition, surgical care, antibiotic treatment, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy the overall mortality rate is 20% to 30% and in some studies as low as 5% to 10%; however, if not treated the disease has a 100% fatality. Host factors such as anÂ immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, and spontaneous infections can have higher mortality rates of 67% or higher. If the infection involves the abdominal soft tissue or chest wall, the mortality rate can be as high as 60% compared to extremity infections with more favorable mortality of 5% to 30%.
