Patients diagnosed with PBC should ideally be managed under the care of a bone cancer specializing multidisciplinary team. The team should consist of specialists from radiology, histopathology, oncology, orthopedics, and a clinical nurse specialist or key worker. Radiologists and pathologists interpret initial imaging and tissue samples, allowing for a definitive diagnosis to be reached and operative planning to begin.

Oncologists determine the most appropriate neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy protocols, as well as arrange future follow-up and surveillance. Orthopedics plan and perform surgical resection of the tumor, along with any initial or future reconstruction that is required. Clinical nurse specialists or key workers act to educate the patient and their family, as well as direct towards different services available. They are a point of contact throughout the patient journey and work to coordinate the various teams. Other team members include physiotherapists, occupational therapists, prosthetists, orthotists, dieticians, social workers, and counselors.
