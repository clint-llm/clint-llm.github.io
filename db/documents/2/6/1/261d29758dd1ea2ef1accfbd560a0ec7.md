Dilation of the colon, thinning of the colonic wall, and deep ulcers are gross features that toxic megacolon shares with ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s disease. However, the hallmark of toxic megacolon is acute transmural inflammation of the colon with necrosis and granulation tissue, filled with inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and lymphocytes. The muscle fibers are usually shortened and rounded with collections of eosinophilic cytoplasm.

A key feature that distinguishes toxic megacolon from the neuropathic process is the presence of submucosal and myenteric plexi within the colon.
