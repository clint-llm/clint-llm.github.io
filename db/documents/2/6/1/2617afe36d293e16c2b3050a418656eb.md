Absolute contraindications to a peripheral nerve blockade are rare. They can include:

- Patient refusal

- Skin infection over the intended catheter or needle site

- Allergy to a chemical neurolytic agent

- Uncorrectable coagulopathy

In particular, uncorrectable coagulopathy must be emphasized. Oral anticoagulant needs to be held until the international normalized ratio(INR) is 1.5 or less because a bleeding disorder is considered as a contraindication, particularly if injection occurs at a non-compressible site. If radiofrequency ablation is planned, a patient with a pacemaker must be checked.
