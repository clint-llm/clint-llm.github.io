The muscles of the pharynx play an integral role in many vital processes such as breathing, swallowing, prevention of aspiration, and speaking. CoordinationÂ of the pharyngeal musculature with the laryngeal and tongue muscles is essential to the efficiency of these essential human functions. Broadly categorized by their orientation (circular versus longitudinal), these muscles allow the pharynx to change its size and shape to achieve with the required function. Understanding the embryology, structure, blood supply, lymphatics, innervation, and function of each of the paired pharyngeal muscles is critical for the diagnosis and treatment of many pathologic conditions.
