Damage or displacement of the vagal nuclei may also cause changes in baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, thus leading to cardiopulmonary disturbances. Over the last decade, much interest has been placed on the brain-gut axis via communication through the vagus nerve. Stimulation of vagal fibers in the intestines influences monoaminergic brain function, which influences mood and anxiety disorders.
