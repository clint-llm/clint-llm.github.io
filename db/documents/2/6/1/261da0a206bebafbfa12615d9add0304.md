Cavernous sinus aneurysms are most common in the elderly population. Cerebral aneurysms are more common in women than men, and this holds true for aneurysms in the cavernous sinus, a common site for aneurysm formation. Aneurysms, as demonstrated by van Rooij et al. 2006, represent a small percentage of treated cerebral aneurysms (2.7% in their study) given the differences in indication for treatment andÂ subarachnoid hemorrhage risk from aneurysms in other locations.
