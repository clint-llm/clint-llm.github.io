Anterior elbow dislocations tend to be a clinical diagnosis and are confirmed by radiographic images. However, when a patient presents after trauma with elbow pain, there are other diagnoses that need to be considered. A number of injuries can present as elbow pain, such as a distal humerus fracture, fracture of the radial head, fracture of the olecranon, or purely ligamentous injuries. It is important to approach each patient with a list of differential diagnoses and to use the history, physical exam, and imaging modalities to lead to an accurate diagnosis.
