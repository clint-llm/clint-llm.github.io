Hyperhidrosis affects approximately 3% of the United States population and is most common in patients between 20 to 60 years of age. There has been no evidence showing that either men or women are at increased risk.

Hyperhidrosis affects all races, but data show that the Japanese are more affected than any other ethnic group.
