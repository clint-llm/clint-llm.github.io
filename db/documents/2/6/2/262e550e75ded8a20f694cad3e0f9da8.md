The internal capsule (IC) is a subcortical white matter structure situated in the inferomedial portion of each cerebral hemisphere. It is composed of myelinated ascending and descending fiber tracts that course past the basal ganglia to connect the cerebral hemispheres with subcortical structures, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. As it traverses the basal ganglia structures, it divides the caudate nucleus and thalamus from the putamen and globus pallidus. Anatomically, the internal capsule can be divided into the anterior limb, genu, posterior limb, retrolenticular segment, and sublenticular segment.

The various portions of the internal capsule primarily receive their vascular supply from perforating arteries that arise from the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, anterior choroidal artery, and the internal carotid artery. These perforating arteries are prone to lipohyalinosis leading to ischemic damage of areas of the internal capsule resulting in clinically significant motor and sensory deficits.
