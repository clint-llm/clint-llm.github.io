There needs to be an interprofessional healthcare team effort to ensure maximum therapeutic response and safety outcomes in patients receiving prostaglandin therapy. After a provider prescribes a prostaglandin analog, nurses and pharmacists should educateÂ patients on the proper administration technique of the drug and any side effects that they may experience as a result of taking it. Clinicians and pharmacists should review the patient's medication list to ensure no drug-to-drug interactions to maximize the drug's therapeutic potential. Interprofessional collaboration between the clinician prescriber and pharmacist maximizes success and reduces adverse outcomes for prostaglandin therapy. [Level 5]
