The interpretation of an electrophysiological study includes the assessment of both the morphology and the timing of EGMs at baseline and after programmed electrical stimulation of the heart in relation to two or more simultaneously recorded surface ECG signals. Of note, the recording speed commonly used in EPS is 100 to 200 mm/sec instead of the usual 25 mm/sec of normal ECG recording. This sweep speed is adequate for a clear display of EGMs as well as for accurate measurements of the time intervals among the various deflections. While atrial and ventricular signals are easy to obtain and recognize due to their simultaneous inscription with the surface P and QRS complexes, the His bundle EGM requires specific maneuvers of the recording catheter, which must be oriented septally at the level of the tricuspid ring. In this area, His bundle EGM can be recorded as a biphasic or triphasic sharp deflection interpolated between the atrial and ventricular signals. Another important point is the recordings obtained from the multipolar CS catheter. Since CS runs in the atrioventricular groove, the electrophysiology catheter records both atrial and ventricular signals. More importantly, the signals obtained from the distal (near the tip located) pairs of electrodes originate from the left atrium and the left ventricle, while those inscribed from the more proximal pairs of electrodes are coming for the right side. This way, the CS recording makes possible the distinction between right and left atrial signals.

Beyond the identification of EGMs, the interpretation of an EPS requires the understanding of the following terms:

- **Cycle Length (CL):**It is measured between two consecutive events in milliseconds (ms) i.e., between two consecutive normal or paced atrial or ventricular signals. The shorter the cycle length, the faster the rate. For instance, the cycle length of 600 ms corresponds to a heart rate of 100 beats/min, while a cycle length of 400 ms corresponds to a heart rate of 150 beats/min.

- **Programmed Stimulation:**The pacing of cardiac tissue through one electrophysiology catheter.

- **Incremental pacing (or burst pacing):**The introduction of a specific number of pacing stimuli (train) at a progressive shorter cycle length.

- **Extra stimulus pacing:**Introduction of one or more (more commonly up to three) premature impulses at specific coupling intervals. The extra stimuli are introduced after a native impulse or after a train of eight impulses paced at a fixed cycle.

- **Coupling Interval:**The time measured in ms between a normal impulse and a premature impulse introduced through programmed stimulation (pacing).

- **Effective Refractory Period (ERP):**Refers to a particular tissue or structure; for example, ERP of the ventricle or the atrioventricular (AV) node. It is the longest coupling interval at which a premature impulse fails to propagate through the tissue or the structure.

The baseline analysis of intracardiac recordings starts with the measurement of the time intervals between consecutive signals in relation to the normal activation sequence of the heart in sinus rhythm. Since the sinus node is located high in the right atrium, the first atrial bipolar EGM is recorded form the HRA catheter, followed by the atrial signals in the His catheter and the proximal poles of the CS catheter. The most delayed atrial signal is normally inscribed from the distal pole of the CS catheter (CS 1,2), which is located at the lateral wall of the left atrium. The atrial signals are followed from the His signal and after that from the RV signal. The baseline time intervals (conduction intervals) measured after the identification of EGMs are:

**PA Interval:**Measured from the onset of the P wave to the onset of the low atrial signal in the His bundle recording. Represents the intra-atrial conduction time (normally: 25 to 55 ms).

**AH Interval:**Measured from the onset of the atrial signal to the onset of His bundle signal in His catheter recording. Represents the conduction time through the AV node (normally 55 to 125 msec).

**H Time:**Measured from the onset to the end of His bundle recording. Represents the conduction time through the His bundle (normally < 30 ms).

**HV Interval:**Measured from the onset of His deflection to the onset of the QRS in the surface EKG. Represents the conduction time from the His bundle to the ventricular myocardium (normally 35nto 55 msec). (Figure 3)
