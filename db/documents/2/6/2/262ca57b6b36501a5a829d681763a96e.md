Microsatellites are parts of the genome consisting of short repeat units, including trinucleotide repeats.

Anticipation is a genetic phenomenon commonly seen in trinucleotide repeat disorders such as Huntington disease and myotonic dystrophy in which symptoms of a genetic disorder manifest at earlier ages with each subsequent generation. Therefore as the number of trinucleotide repeats increases in an affected patient's progeny, one may observe an earlier and more severe manifestation of symptoms.
