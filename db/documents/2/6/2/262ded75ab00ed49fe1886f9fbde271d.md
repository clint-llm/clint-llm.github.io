Facilitated intubation, also known as medication-facilitated intubation (MFI) or sedation-facilitated intubation, refers to intubation performed using a sedative or anesthetic drug as an induction agent, without the use of a paralytic (neuromuscular blocking agent). In comparison, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) employs both an induction agent and a paralytic drug. Both procedures are performed to a varying degree by emergency medical service agencies across the nation.

**Geographic Variation**

Drug-facilitated intubation protocols, including regulations for both medication-facilitated intubation and rapid sequence intubation, vary between states and, in many cases, between regional and local emergency medical service agencies. One recent study found that eighteen states (35.3%) have statewide drug-facilitated intubation protocols. Of those states, only one (5.6%) has a protocol for sedation-facilitated intubation.

The utilization of medication-facilitated intubation compared to rapid sequence intubation also varies based on the patient's needs and the safety of the procedure.
