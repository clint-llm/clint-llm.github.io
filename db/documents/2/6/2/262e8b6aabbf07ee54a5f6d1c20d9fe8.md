HZO prevention and management involve an interprofessional approach. Preventative efforts often take place in the primary care office, where patients receive education on vaccination. Patients with acute disease may present to their primary care provider, urgent care, or the emergency department. It is important that these first-contact providers initiate antiviral treatment and promptly consult and refer to ophthalmology for further evaluation. Pharmacists can assist with dosing regimens and provide information on pharmacodynamic interactions. Those with severe disease may require inpatient admission under the care of a hospitalist and a consulting ophthalmologist. Patients may go on to develop a prolonged disease course with chronic complications requiring frequent follow-up visits with their healthcare team.
