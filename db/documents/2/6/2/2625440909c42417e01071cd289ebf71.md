Traction alopecia exhibits variable features in the histopathology depending on the stage of the disease. The early stage is characterized by an increased number of telogen and catagen hair follicles, with a normal number of hair follicles and trichomalacia (soft fragile and swollen hair). This is followed by drop-out of the terminal hairs and retained smaller-caliber hairs along the frontotemporal hairline reflected as vellus hairs. In later stages of traction alopecia, there is a decrease in the terminal follicle count which is replaced with fibrotic fibrous tracts. There is a characteristic absence of any inflammatory infiltrate at any time during the course of this disease.
