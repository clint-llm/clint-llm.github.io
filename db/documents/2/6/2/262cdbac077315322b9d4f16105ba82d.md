Many factors have been shown to play a role in the development of acute, chronic, and suppurative otitis media in children. Bezold's abscess is perhaps the penultimate complication of suppurative otitis media (SOM). If SOM is left untreated or unrecognized, it can progress to a Bezol's abscess. Risk factors includeÂ the following:

- Socioeconomic conditions: there is an increase in the number of cases in children living in poorer socioeconomic conditions.

- Daycare: there appears to be an increase in children attending daycare.

- Underlying medical conditions that affect the Eustachian tube function: children with cleft palate, craniofacial anomalies, congenital or acquired immune dysfunction, conditions affecting the ciliary function of the Eustachian tube and middle ear mucosa.

In adults, medical considerations that must be considered include the patient's HIV status, history of uncontrolled diabetes, renal failure, and patients who are immunosuppressed for other reasons. Additionally, patients with chronic, untreated ear disease who are without access to regular medical care and antibiotics may present with such late, severe, manifestations of SOM.
