The correct identification of the anxiety-inducing stressor is necessary to make an accurate diagnosis. In the case of SAD, the primary stressor is the patient being away from their attachment figure. The associated anxiety may manifest similarly to other anxiety disorders, which include generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. In addition, patients may present with multiple anxiety disorders. To assist with accurate diagnosis in children, using SCARED is recommended for assessment as it can differentiate various anxiety disorders from others.
