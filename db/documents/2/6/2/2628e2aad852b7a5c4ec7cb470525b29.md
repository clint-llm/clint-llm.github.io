There is no single effective treatment option available for Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.

Muscle relaxants can be used in small doses for muscle spasms. Another potential treatment option is to inhibit the activity of the ACVR1/ALK2 gene-related pathway, which inhibits abnormal bone formation. The other strategy would be to inhibit osteoblastic progenitor cell activity, which results in hindering the microenvironment for heterotopic ossificans. With the increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, new potential drug targets have been discovered.

Many drugs, such as imatinib, a human anti-activin A-neutralizing antibody, dorsomorphin, palovarotene, rapamyÂ­cin, are in clinical trials, and suitable drugs may be available in the coming future concerning the better understanding of the mechanism of onset of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva.
