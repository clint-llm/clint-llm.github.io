When a neonate presents with seizures, a thorough history, and physical examination are required.

As there is often an underlying provoking cause, the clinical history should focus on identifying risk factors and the likely etiologies.

Physical examination should focus on findings that may indicate an underlying etiology. This includes the general appearance of the neonate, vital signs, head circumference, mental status (and level of alertness), and the quality of the fontanelle to identify if the patient has bacterial meningitis (with or without septic shock) or acute intracranial hemorrhage.

If the patient is having seizure activity during the examination, the provider should focus on assessing the physical features to ensure it is a true seizure and to assist in identifying the etiology.

The classification of neonatal seizure types and their significant features are as follows:

- Focal clonic seizures
- Manifests as repetitive rhythmic contractions
- It can involve the face, upper or lower extremities, neck, or trunk
- It cannot be extinguished by the physical suppression of movement or limb repositioning
- May migrate to other areas of the body within the same seizure (most commonly contralaterally but can occur ipsilaterally as well)
- If generalized, the seizure activity is diffuse, bilateral, and synchronous

- Focal tonic seizures
- Manifests as a continuous but transient extremity posturing or asymmetric posturing of the trunk or neck
- May include horizontal eye deviation
- If generalized, may mimic decerebrate posturing (upper and lower extremity tonic extension) or decorticate posturing (upper extremity flexion and lower extremity extension)

- Myoclonic seizures
- Manifests as nonrepetitive contractions
- Involves flexor muscle groups of the extremity (commonly upper extremity), trunk, diaphragm, or face
- If generalized, the seizures may appear as bilateral jerking of the flexor muscles of the upper and lower extremities

Abrupt autonomic vital sign changes, while rare in otherwise healthy neonates, can be associated with subclinical seizure activity in neonates at risk for seizures.
