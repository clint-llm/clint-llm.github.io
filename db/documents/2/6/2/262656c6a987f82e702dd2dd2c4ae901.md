The treating/managing physician should be aware of the multiple injuries that can occur in association with Barton fractures and other fractures of the distal radius including tears of the triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC), traumatic acute carpal tunnel syndrome, development of compartment syndrome in the forearm at time of initial presentation, and development of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in the subsequent weeks and months following the initial treatment. Range-of-motion exercises for the wrist and fingers should be started as soon as possible to prevent wrist stiffness.

These complications can occur following Barton's fracture: Carpal tunnel syndrome, radial nerve compression, ulnar nerve injury, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), post-traumatic arthritis, radiocarpal instability, malunion, distal radioulnar joint instability, flexor tendon adhesions, tendon rupture, tendinitis, tenosynovitis, trigger finger, Dupuytren's contracture, and compartment syndrome.

Surgical site infection, loss of fracture reduction, iatrogenic fracture, tendon injuries, neurovascular compromise, compartment syndrome, painful implant, and wrist stiffness are the common complications postoperatively.
