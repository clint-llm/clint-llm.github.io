Assessing fitness to drive requires a multifactorial approach, and there is no single objective test or scale used for evaluation.

A low cognitive testing performance will often correlate with a patient’s inability to pass roadside driving tests. However, there is no clear pattern of regression. The 2010 AAN practice parameter for evaluating and managing driving risk in dementia suggested that patients with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤ of 24 are at increased risk for unsafe driving.

A caregiver’s impression of the patient’s driving safety has proven to be more indicative of driving impairment, and it is often more accurate than the patient’s self-assessment.

Triaging patients with these screening tests is important in guiding clinical recommendations.
