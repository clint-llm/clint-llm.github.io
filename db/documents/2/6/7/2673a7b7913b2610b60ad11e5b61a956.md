Prognosis is dependent upon the underlying primary disease process. These diseases can be completely benign and painless, where removal is indicated for cosmetic purposes only. However, there is a considerable chance there may be a premalignant or malignant cause that needs to be addressed. Yu et al. described a 38.9% rate at which the underlying lesions to a patientâ€™s cutaneous horn is malignant or premalignant. Therefore, a valid prognosis can only be achieved after histopathological analysis of the underlying condition. In one study, actinic keratoses (AK) were found in 83.84% of premalignant cohort cases, while SCC (in situ or invasive) was discovered in 93.75% of malignant cases. This suggests AK and SCC may be the most common primary disease processes in cutaneous horns with carcinogenic potential.
