Job syndrome is due to a specific genetic mutation of autosomal dominant inheritance in the STAT3. STAT3Â is involved in healing mechanisms and immune mechanisms. The mutation of this gene will lead to an intensification of the production of immunoglobulin E by B lymphocytes, the loss of the modulation capacity of their production by IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-gamma, and a defect chemotaxis of neutrophils. The lack of anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 is probably the cause of the inappropriate inflammatory response observed in patients with Job syndrome. IL-6 plays an essential role in the genesis of Th17 cells; therefore, the lack of this cytokine leads to a deficiency of Th17 cells in Job syndrome. The CD4 + Th17 cells play an important role in the defense against infections mainly bacteria and extracellular fungi.

In addition, aside from its immunological role, this molecule has the role of pleiotropic signaling, which explains other non-immunological findings observed in the Job syndrome, such as long bone fractures and a late rash. Secondary teeth with primary teeth retained among immunodeficiencies.
