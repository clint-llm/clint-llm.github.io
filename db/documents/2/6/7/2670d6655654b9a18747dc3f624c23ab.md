Shoulder pain is a common clinical complaint with an annual incidence of 14.7 per 1000 patients per year.

Shoulder joint injection can be with or without image guidance. Image-guided shoulder arthrography is a technique that was first described in 1933 by Oberholzer.

The important aspects of a fluroscopic guided shoulder joint injection include:

- Minimizing patient discomfort.

- Maintaining patient safety.

- Maintaining proper needle technique to enter the rotator cuff interval or the acromioclavicular joint.
