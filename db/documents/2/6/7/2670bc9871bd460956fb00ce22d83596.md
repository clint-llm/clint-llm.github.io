ACE inhibitors are one of the most widely used drugs for hypertension and heart failure, but their popularity does not mean they do notÂ require the management of an interprofessional team. Besides nephrologists and cardiologists, these drugs are widely prescribed by nurse practitioners and primary care providers. While ACE inhibitors are relatively safe, a pharmacist should examine the patient's medication record to verify dosing and check for drug-drug interactions. Nursing can provide patient counsel, monitor for interactions and adverse events, and report any issues to the prescriber. It is important to monitor renal function and levels of electrolytes regularly.
