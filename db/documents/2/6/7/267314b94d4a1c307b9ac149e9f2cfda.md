Pharmaceutics is the overall process of developing a new chemical entity into an approved therapy that is safe and effective in treating or preventing disease. It is a complex process requiring multiple scientific, medical, legal, commercial, and regulatory expertise. On average, it typically takes at least ten years for a new drug to complete the process from initial discovery to the retail marketplace, with clinical trials alone taking six to seven years on average. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development announced that it calculated that it costs pharmaceutical companies $2.6 billion to develop a new drug.

Pharmaceutical companies are also bringing technology into the picture to speed up the process, using computational methods and artificial intelligence (AI) to determine whether a molecule is likely to produce a viable drug.
