The maternal-fetal interface is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. It serves two primary functions listed as below,

- It serves as an interface between the mother and fetus allowing the transfer of nutrient and oxygen; also helps in removing waste products.

- It protects the growing fetus from the extrauterine environment, including infections.

Disturbance in the invasion of the trophoblast can cause several complications for both mother and fetus. The interruption during the establishment of the maternal-fetal interface may cause implantation failure and thereby infertility, recurrent miscarriage, or intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR).

The feto-maternal interface lacking gamma-interferon signaling is prone to viral infection of the fetus like the Zika virus.Toxoplasma, other [syphilis, varicella-zoster, Zika virus, human immunodeficiency virus), rubella cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex.
