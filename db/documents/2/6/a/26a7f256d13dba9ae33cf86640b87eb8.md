All members of the healthcare team should work in conjunction to prevent and treat PIH by educating patients on the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing when sun avoidance is not possible. Education on the usually self-limiting nature of PIH is also helpful. Primary care providers may initiate treatment with topical agents and may choose to refer to dermatology for chemical peels or laser therapy.
