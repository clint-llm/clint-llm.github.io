The variance in surgical and oncological management of glottic cancer across TNM stages highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary team. Invariably, there is an importance in performing an initial outpatient history and examination by an otolaryngologist. Subsequent initial investigations, including cross-sectional imaging and biopsy, radiologists, and pathologists, are essential in achieving definitive diagnosis and staging. Depending on the required treatment, otolaryngologists, and oncologists with a specialist interest in head and neck, cancer will be responsible for the provision of surgical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy interventions. Given the myriad of complications and the often life-changing nature of these treatments, early involvement of associated specialists such as speech and language therapists, nurse specialists, dieticians and psychologists are essential in maintaining patients' quality of life and providing a patient-centered care approach.
