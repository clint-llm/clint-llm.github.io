Favus is the most severe clinical type of tinea capitis. It is a chronic mutilating disease with serious familial and social implications.

The characteristic type of hair invasion in favus (endothrix infection) contributes to the chronic course of the favus, which persists as long as there is hair. Tinea favosa usually occurs in children and adolescents and persists throughout adult life inÂ the absence of treatment.

The treatment outcome varies with the stage at which the condition is diagnosed. With early diagnosis and proper therapeutic management, favus can be cured without sequelae. However, late treatment leads to the ultimate scarring alopecia in all clinical presentations.
