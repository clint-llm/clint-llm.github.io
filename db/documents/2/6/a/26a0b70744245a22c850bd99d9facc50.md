It is crucial that patients with fibromyalgia understand their illness before the prescription of any medications. The key elements of patient education include:

Reassuring the patient that fibromyalgia is a real disease

There is a role of stress and mood disturbances and the patients with fibromyalgia should be encouraged to learn relaxation techniques as well as be a part of formal stress reduction programs. About 30% of patients with fibromyalgia have major depression at the time of diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence is 74%. The lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorder is 60%. These patients should be encouraged to get treatment.

Good sleep hygiene is an essential part of the management of fibromyalgia and recognizing and obtaining treatment of sleep disorders that may contribute to symptoms of fibromyalgia is equally important.)
