Histopathologic examination of BSNS demonstrates hypercellular, uniform, long spindle-shaped cells in a fascicular pattern occasionally described as a "herringbone" configuration.

The cytoplasm of involved cells is scant and pale, and the tumor itself appears unencapsulated.

Infiltrative tumors will be embedded in a bony matrix.

Genetic features displayed by BSNS involve chromosomal translation t(2,4) and a fusion protein formed by the interaction of the PAX3-MAML genes.
