Evidence-based approach to renal cell cancer

Renal cell cancer is relatively common in the US and often presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms. The malignancy is ideally managed with an interprofessional team that includes a urologist, nephrologist, oncologist, and a geneticist. Over the past two decades, the mortality rates from this malignancy have dropped because of earlier detection and treatment. five-year survival for stage 1 cancer is greater than 90% and 79% for stage 2 renal cancer. For those with lymph node involvement, the survival drops to less than 40% over five years. Factors associated with improved survival include obesity, good performance status, complete excision of the primary and a long disease-free interval from the time of surgery to the presence of metastases. Patients with a family history should be educated about the need for other members of the family to undergo screening. Patients at high risk for renal cell cancer should also be educated about the signs and symptoms; as earlier the cancer is managed, the better the prognosis.
