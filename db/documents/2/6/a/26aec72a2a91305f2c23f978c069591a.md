**Overlapping Fifth Toe**

**Nonoperative**

Generally, an overlapping fifth toe will correct as children begin to walk.

**Operative**

Operative intervention is reserved for refractory cases of an overlapping fifth toe resulting in toe irritation and difficulty with shoewear. The goal of any operative intervention is to abduct, plantarflex, and internally rotate the deformed toe. This has been achieved historically by transferring the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) tendon to the conjoining tendons of the abductor digiti minimi and the flexor digitorum brevis.

Some have attempted to correct the deformity by syndactylization of the fourth and fifth toes, which functions by using the fourth toe as a permanent splint for the fifth toe.

**Congenital Curly Toe**

**Nonoperative**

Congenital curly toe most frequently corrects during early ambulation; therefore, observation is appropriate for initial management. Strapping has shown to be largely ineffective and has almost no role in management. Therefore, shoe modifications are appropriate for curly toes that cause discomfort after early childhood.

**Operative**

Historically, flexor tenotomies and flexor-to-extensor transfers were the mainstays of surgical treatment for refractory curly toe deformities; however, flexor-to-extensor transfers were shown to be less effective and more invasive than simple flexor tenotomies.

Painful lesions and deformities of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) can be effectively treated by resecting the head of the proximal phalanx. The degree of flexion contracture at the proximal interphalangeal joint determines the extent of bone excision. The medial and lateral collateral ligaments are kept intact to eliminate the potential of a flail toe. After correcting the sagittal plane and rotational deformity, K-wire is passed to hold the toe in the corrected position. Applying a Silastic lesser toe implant is a remedy for unsuccessful fifth toe resection arthroplasty.

The callus that forms over a bony protrusion in one of the little toes is known as a "corn." A thickened keratotic skin develops around the interphalangeal joint due to external shoe pressure. The treatment options range from using an enlarged toebox, doughnut-shaped pads, and foam pads to shaving the callus and excision of the bony prominences (condylectomy).

**Bunionette Deformity**

**Nonoperative**

Conservative treatment options include wearing wide shoes, specialized accommodating orthotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and forefoot barrier pads.

**Operative**

When conservative management fails, operative intervention is required according to the severity and grade of bunionette deformity. Resection of the lateral condyle and capsule plication is required for grade 1 deformity preserving the joint mobility and metatarsal length. The distal metatarsal osteotomy is used for type 2 deformity, which includes chevron-medializing osteotomy, step-cut osteotomy, transverse osteotomy, or oblique distal osteotomy. An****oblique diaphyseal rotational osteotomy (Ludloff, scarf) is recommended for bunionette deformity with increased intermetatarsal angle (IMA). A lateral incision along the 5th metatarsal bone is made in all surgical approaches.
