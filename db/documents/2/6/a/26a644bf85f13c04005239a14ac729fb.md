The HSV is a double-stranded DNA virus that is large and has a surrounding lipid envelope. The DNA in HSV-1 and HSV-2 have many similarities, thus causing much cross-reactivity in antibody production. The virus enters the body through epithelial cells or the mucous membranes. When it has replicated within the nucleus of the cells, it travels down the axon to the neurons where it can establish a latent infection.
