Tafamidis is disease-modifying transthyretin (TTR) kinetic stabilizer for treating transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR amyloidosis).

Transthyretin (TTR) is a soluble, tetrameric protein synthesized and secreted by the liver. Conformational change can occur in TTR either spontaneously with age (ATTRwt) or genetic abnormality (ATTRv), leading to destabilization and dissociation into monomers.

**Pharmacokinetics**(manufacturer's labeling)

- **Absorption:**Peak concentration is observed within 4 hours after dosing. No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of tafamidis are marked concerning high fat/calorie food intake.

- **Distribution:**The apparent volume of distribution(Vd) of tafamidis meglumine is 16 liters and 18.5 liters for tafamidis. Tafamidis predominantly binds to TTR. Plasma protein binding of tafamidis is high(>99% in vitro).

- **Metabolism:**Glucuronidation has been observed in clinical studies. However, the metabolism of tafamidis is not comprehensively understood.

- **Excretion:**The mean half-life of tafamidis is 49 hours, and the clearance of tafamidis meglumine is approximately 0.228 L/h and 0.263 L/h for tafamidis. Consequently, after multiple tafamidis dosing, drug accumulation is approximately 2.5-fold times greater than administration of a single dose. Approximately 22% of the dose is recovered in urine (primarily as the glucuronide metabolite). Approximately 59% of the dose is recovered in feces (primarily as the unchanged drug).
