Consultations with neurology and psychiatry are fundamental to the management of frontotemporal dementia. Geneticist evaluation may be indicated in patients with a significant family history of neurologic disorders. An interprofessional approach featuring physical and occupational therapists, dieticians, and support groups provide the comprehensive care required for patient and caregiver's physical and emotional health.
