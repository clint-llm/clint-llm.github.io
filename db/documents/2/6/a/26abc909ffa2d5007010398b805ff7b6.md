When considering the level of fidelity, more is not always better. Simulation educators need to avoid the fidelity trap, assuming students learn in proportion to the level of realism.higher-faster-further attitude espoused by some of today’s learners and educators can lead to using the highest level of fidelity in all instances, which can lead to a misuse of valuable resources and a skewed cost-benefit ratio.

Simulation is resource-intensive, generally requiring a more significant expenditure of resources.
