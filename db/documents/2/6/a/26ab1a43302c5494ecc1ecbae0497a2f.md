There are several reports of anaphylactic transfusion reactions to either IgE or IgG with anti-IgA antibodies in patients with undetectable IgA levels.

IgE-mediated transfusion reactions occur immediately via a type I hypersensitivity response. At first, an allergen induces the secretion of IgE by plasma cells. These IgE antibodies bind to and sensitize mast cells and basophils. Subsequent exposures to the allergen then cause crosslinking of preformed IgE on the sensitized mast cells and basophils. Ultimately, this causes degranulation of the cells and release of active mediators such as histamine, which in turn causes vasodilation and smooth muscle contraction.

There are several proposed mechanisms of how IgG anti-IgA antibodies can cause anaphylactic transfusion reactions. Some reports suggest that IgG anti-IgA antibodies may be a biomarker that increases the risk of non-IgE mediated anaphylaxis. Another proposed mechanism is that IgG anti-IgA antibodies react with infused IgA; thus, blood products with higher levels of IgA would be more likely to cause a reaction.
