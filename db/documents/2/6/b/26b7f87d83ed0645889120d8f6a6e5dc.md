Two possible mechanisms can explain the pathophysiology of CO2 embolism:

1) CO2 embolism can occur from the accidental intravascular injection of CO2, which may arise from the inappropriate placement of the Veress needle within the intravascular space. Â A similar mechanism is possible with trocar insertion.

2) CO2 embolism can also result from gas entering injured vessels, abdominal wall, or operative sites. This proposed mechanism results in less profound clinical change and may explain late-onset CO2 embolism.

The volume of gas entrained affects clinical presentation. In a study on cardiopulmonary responses to experimental venous CO2 embolism in pigs, researchers found a mortality of 60% at a continuous intravenous CO2 infusion rate of 1.2 mL/kg/min.

Gas in the venous circulation may obstruct pulmonary circulation and subsequently cause cardiac symptoms, including cardiovascular collapse and neurological sequelae.
