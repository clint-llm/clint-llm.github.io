Atrial tachycardia does not have many complications from the arrhythmia itself, but many of the difficulties come from the treatment methods. Chronic atrial tachycardia can cause cardiac remodeling, which could lead to pump dysfunction and heart failure.

Many complications can occur from cardiac ablation, most commonly bleeding from the site of insertion. Other complications to be aware of is mechanical trauma to the heart itself; such as damage to the heart vessels, the valves or even puncture the wall of the heart. Another feared complication of ablation is to create another arrhythmia, which could also cause the patient to become unstable. If the normal conduction is damaged enough, a pacemaker may be required to manage the new arrhythmia.

Complications from medication used to treat atrial tachycardia (see drugs classes side effects and contraindications). Cardioversion has its own set of possible complications. Complications can range from as benign as minor burning of the skin to severe arrhythmias and even asystole (see cardioversion complications).
