The use of plain radiographs is extremely limited in the evaluation of the pancreas. Although not diagnostic, calcifications of the pancreas may be visible on abdominal radiographs in the setting of chronic pancreatitis.

**Computed Tomography (CT) vs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs. Ultrasound**

A few general principles common to imaging in various body parts are essential when deciding which of these three cross-sectional modalities to use and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. In general, CT and MRI have large fields-of-view and are both very effective in identifying local abnormalities along with regional or more distant involvement.

CT and MR are better than ultrasound for characterizing solid lesions due to the advantage of administering intravenous contrast material and differences in signal intensity seen on MRI. On the other hand, cystic lesions can be detected with all three modalities but are better characterized by ultrasound and even better by MRI.
