Presyncope can be challenging to evaluate in a healthcare setting because of its broad differential diagnosis, which encompasses both relatively benign etiologies such as vasovagal presyncope and more concerning etiologies such as cardiac arrhythmias and GI bleed.  It is important to efficiently and accurately evaluate presyncopal patients, identifying, treating, and discharging those with easily correctable and less serious diagnoses, whilst stabilizing and providing a higher level of care to patients with more serious causes of presyncope who have the potential to decompensate and incur significant morbidity and potentially mortality.  This requires an interprofessional team approach in the healthcare setting with all members in constant communication, coordinating their efforts in a synergistic manner
