The treatment of abulia is by treating the underlying cause, if possible. Otherwise, it depends mainly on the drugs that increase the dopamine levels in the dopaminergic circuitry. These include:

- Carbidopa/levodopa

- Amantadine

- Bupropion, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor

- Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist and

- Nefiracetam, a new cyclic-aminobutyric compound that has been shown to enhance neurotransmission

- Olanzapine

- Agomelatine
