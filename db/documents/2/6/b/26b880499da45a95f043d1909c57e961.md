Tyrosine kinases (TK) are proteins exclusively found in cells of multicellular animals. They play a key role as mediators in the signal transduction cascade for regulating cell division and cell death pathways. The TKs can be subdivided into two groups, receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RTK) and non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase (NRTK). The RTK category consists of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and many more minor receptor proteins. The NRTK are cytoplasmic proteins that have 9 defined families consisting of Fes/Fer, Syk/Zap70, Abl, Tec, Jak, Ack, Fak, Csk, and Src. Four other NRTK exist outside of the defined families, Srm, Rak/Frk, Brk/Sik, and Rlk/Txk. NRTKs are highly regulated proteins with fundamental cellular functions such as apoptosis and cell differentiation.

The receptor tyrosine kinases are enzymes that are transmembrane receptors on the cell surface. They typically consist of an extracellular domain that functions to bind to specific ligands. A transmembrane region encompassing the entirety of the cell membrane and the intracellular kinase domain complete the RTK. Once a specific ligand binds to the extracellular portion of the receptor, the protein dimerizes and changes its structure, thus allowing the intracellular kinase domain to catalyze the addition of phosphate groups to the tyrosine residues in itself (autophosphorylation).

ATP is the primary source of phosphate. Once the protein dephosphorylates ATP and auto-phosphorylates the tyrosine residues residing in TK, the phosphotyrosines serve as docking sites for other proteins involved in signal transduction. This process is a series of complex biochemical processes that assist the cell in cell differentiation, regulation of cell growth, and cell death. The biochemical pathway is depicted in Figure 1. The crucial role tyrosine kinase proteins play in cell division has led oncologists to use the protein as a target site for targeted cancer therapy in an attempt to decrease uncontrolled cell division.

Antineoplastic medications are infamous for causing an array of toxicities ranging from dermatological manifestations to cardiovascular side-effects. Physicians face the challenge of having to deal with unexpected complications when administering cancer therapy. The use of targeted cancer treatment, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, is increasing because it is more effective and less toxic to normal tissue. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea caused by the inhibition of the wound healing and hydrating pathways.

The antineoplastic medications that commonly cause tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis are known as EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, TKIs which affect the PDGFR, proto-onco B-Raf (BRAF), Janus kinase (JAK), and VEGFR pathways also make patients susceptible to TKI keratitis. The EGFR pathway regulates not only the proliferation of cells but also ocular tissue differentiation. Thus, its inhibition can cause decreased proliferation of malignant cells but may also lead to ocular toxicity. Due to the collaboration between multiple specialties providing the best possible care, ophthalmologists should be made aware of the complications seen in targeted cancer therapy patients and subsequently have the knowledge to treat them promptly. The literature is limited on the course of TKI keratitis; however, case studies show a good prognosis in most patients with only a few cases refractory to maximal treatment.

This article will discuss the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and management of TKI keratitis and its complications.
