AEDs, particularly levetiracetam, clobazam, and ethosuximide, can be used early after diagnosis. Few specific AEDs such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine are relatively contraindicated and should be discontinued. If there is no improvement in the EEG or cognition after three months of AED therapy, a corticosteroid regimen should merit consideration after careful consideration of side effects.
