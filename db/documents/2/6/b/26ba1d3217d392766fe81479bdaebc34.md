Medication dosing for pediatric patients is described to use either the following methods for medication dosing: age-based dosing, allometric scaling, body surface area-based dosing, and weight-based dosing; neither method is to be more superior to the other and varies based on a medication's chemical properties and the age of the patient.

The absence of deliberate practice in correct pediatric medication dosing can have potential effects such as exposing the patient to suboptimal medication dosages and severe systemic toxicity, which may even result in fatalities.
