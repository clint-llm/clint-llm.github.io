The diagnosis and management of calcinosis cutis are not simple because there are many causes. It is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an internist, nephrologist, primary care provider, a rheumatologist, endocrinologist, and specialty care nurse. The interprofessional team can optimize the treatment of these patients through communication and coordination of care. Primary care physicians, dermatologist, and nurse practitioners provide diagnoses and care plans. Specialty care nurses should work with the team for coordination of care and are involved in patient education. Pharmacists should evaluate medications prescribed, recognize drug-drug interactions, provide patient education, and monitor compliance. The interprofessional team can thus improve outcomes for patients with calcinosis cutis.

The treatment is challenging and depends on the cause. The key is to avoid trauma, smoking cessation, decrease stress and exposure to the cold. Smaller lesions have been reported to respond to warfarin, ceftriaxone, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Surgical excision and carbon dioxide laser can also be used. Larger lesions respond to diltiazem, bisphosphonates, probenecid, aluminum hydroxide, and surgical excision or curettage. Patients with small and localized lesions are good candidates for surgical treatment whereas more generalized disease will require medical management. The outcomes for most patients are guarded because the condition has no cure.
