The germinal matrix is an immature thin-walled capillary network locatedÂ on the head of the caudate nucleus and underneath the ventricular ependyma.

Spontaneous rupture of the germinal matrix vessels may occur from hypoxia as a consequence of fluctuation in cerebral blood flow.

**Periventricular Hemorrhagic Infarction (PHI)**

Commonly and mistakenly, the parenchymal hemorrhagic infarction was termed as an extension of IVH. The incidence of hemorrhagic infarction increases with low gestational age. The PHI seemed to be associated with IVH as 1) it was observed in association with large IVH, 2) it occurred on the same side of the large IVH, and 3) it was detected after the occurrence of the IVH. The IVH leads to obstruction of the terminal veins and ultimately causes periventricular venous congestion with the development of hemorrhagic venous infarction.
