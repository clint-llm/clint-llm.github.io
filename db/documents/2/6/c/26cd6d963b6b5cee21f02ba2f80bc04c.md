The Dix-Hallpike test is pathognomonic, which is why laboratory tests are not indicated to establish the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. But there is a high association of BPPV with inner ear diseases where laboratory workup to delineate other pathologies may be needed.

The supine lateral head test is used to diagnose lateral or horizontal canal BPPV. It is similar to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The provider places the patient supine and flexes the neck 30 degrees from horizontal. Then the head is rotated to one side, left for one to two minutes, and then rotated in the opposite direction.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is largely a clinical diagnosis, and often the battery of laboratory and imaging tests ordered only helps rule out other possibilities. As mentioned above, obtaining a good history and performing a thorough neurological exam is imperative. Imaging of the head in BPPV is unremarkable. Head CT and MRI are useful to rule out infarct, hemorrhage, masses/tumors, or other pathology that suggests alternative causes of vertigo. The Dix-Hallpike, if it can be tolerated, should be performed as a provocative test to observe for expected changes in symptoms and localize which canal is involved.
