**Current Recommendations**

**AAP Statement**

In an update to the 1999 recommendations, new evidence indicated that health benefits outweighed the complications for newborn male circumcisions. There was found to be a reduction in urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, acquisition of HIV, and penile cancer. Circumcision was not associated with a decrease in sexual function and satisfaction. All families should be given the proper information regarding circumcision. These statements have also been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

**AAFP Statement**

Family physicians should provide the family with information in an unbiased manner. Neonatal circumcision has potential health benefits in the reduction of urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted infections and penile cancer. However, circumcision is not without complications. Now the HPV vaccine alone may aid in the reduction of penile cancer.

**American Urologic Association**

The circumcised newborn infant will experience the risks and complications associated with the procedure. During the first three to six months of life, the incidence of urinary tract infections is significantly higher in uncircumcised boys. The circumcised adult will profit from reduced health illnesses. The benefits and risks should be discussed with the family.
