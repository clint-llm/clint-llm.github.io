Paraesophageal hernias are rare but when they present are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, gastroenterologist, internist, radiologist and ICU nurses. The current evidence reveals that asymptomatic patients should be monitored and symptomatic patients need surgery.

The outcomes after surgery are poor and associated with severe complications that include gastric perforation, bleeding, aspiration, wound breakdown and adverse cardiac events. The goal should be to optimize the patient prior to surgery and ensure that the patient is fit for surgery.
