The tilt table test is a safe procedure. However, myocardial infarction or stroke may develop in persons with significant coronary or carotid artery stenosis. This is very rare. Arrhythmic complications may be represented by prolonged bradycardia, which may be treated with atropine. Ventricular fibrillation is extremely rare. Some patients may vomit after tilt testing or have severe weakness lasting for several hours. A headache is common, especially after nitroglycerine use. A few seconds of extremity myoclonus is common after syncope is noted before returning to consciousness (convulsive syncope). This should not be confused by the providers for seizures.
