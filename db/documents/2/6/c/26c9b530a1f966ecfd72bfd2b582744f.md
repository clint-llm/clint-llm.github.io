As mentioned above, chromosomal analysis can be used to diagnose variable aneuploidies such as monosomy X, trisomies, triploidy (3n/69), and tetraploidy (4n/92). These tests are preferred to diagnose balanced and unbalanced translocations, recurrent microdeletions such as 22q11.2 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome), 15q11.2q13.1 deletion (Prader-Willi/Angelman), or 5p15.3 microdeletion (cri-du-chat syndrome). In particular, CMA may be used to diagnose the etiology of developmental delay in patients without a known cause. It is also helpful to analyze autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability.

Translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 t(9;22)(q34;q11) was the first demonstration that cancer could result from a genetic abnormality. This aberration was named the Philadelphia chromosome.

Other significant abnormalities include translocation (15;17) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This subset of AML responds well to all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin), highlighting the role of cytogenetic testing in determining the appropriate treatment. Additionally, characteristic translocations in lymphomas include t(8;14) in Burkitt lymphoma, t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma, t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma. Translocation (12;21) in pediatric ALL and inversion (16) in AML are examples of aberrations that confer favorable prognosis, whereas inversion(3) and complex karyotype, defined as 3 or more concurrent chromosomal abnormalities, are examples of adverse prognosis in AML.
