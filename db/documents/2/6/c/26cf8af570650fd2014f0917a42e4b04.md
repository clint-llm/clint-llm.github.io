This operation requires basic laparoscopic equipment, including insufflation with carbon dioxide, drapes, monitors, laparoscopic instruments, and electrocautery. Unlike conventional laparoscopic procedures, bariatric patients require longer trocars and laparoscopic instruments to accommodate the thicker abdominal wall.

Laparoscopic adjusted gastric band procedures specifically require three 5 mm trocars, one 15 mm trocar, a liver retractor, an angled laparoscope, and a gastric band. There are two approved bands in the United States.
