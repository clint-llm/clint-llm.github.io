In both PET and SPECT cerebral perfusion examinations, providers should confirm that the patient has abstained from alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine use at least 10 hours before the exam.

In the case of vitally unstable patients, continuous monitoring of patient vitals and pulse oximetry by nursing staff may provide benefits. If SPECT or PET cerebral imaging is required in a patient who cannot cooperate with the exam, an anesthesia consult may benefit the case, considering that sedating medications may decrease the specificity of imaging findings.

In situations where sedation is required, it is recommended that sedation be administered at least 5 minutes after radiotracer administration. Resuscitative equipment should always be present within the imaging suite to ensure prompt treatment of emergent conditions as necessary.
