Infants with congenital hydroureteronephrosis should undergo a voiding cystourethrogram to identify patients with vesicoureteral reflux.

Adult patients with renal colic due to hydronephrosis should have a basic metabolic panel to evaluate renal function, as well as a urinalysis. Imaging is indicated in these cases based upon their medical history. A computed tomography (CT) scan is highly sensitive and specific when nephrolithiasis or external compression from neoplastic disease is the cause of symptoms. Additionally, CT will be sufficient to evaluate other causes of acute severe flank pain. In patients with a history of frequent kidney stones and symptoms consistent with prior episodes, an ultrasound is sufficient to evaluate for hydronephrosis.
