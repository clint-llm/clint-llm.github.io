**Skin Prick and Intradermal Testing**

The positive control normally produces a 3 mm wheal; if it does not, any allergen that is 3mm or larger would be considered positive.

**Serum IgE Testing**

High levels of IgE do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the reaction. The serum test results need to be analyzed with the patientâ€™s history and clinical exam context and cannot be strictly diagnosed with just the IgE levels. False positives may occur. It is possible since each allergen is tested specifically that the correct allergen was not tested for.

Similarly, even with low levels, a patient can still be at risk for anaphylaxis because serum testing does not measure the amount of bound IgE to mast cells or in tissues. A big advantage to IgE serum results is there is no subjectivity, potential for operator error, and the results can be compared and reviewed later.

**Patch Testing**

The results need to be read by a trained technician. Wheat is the most common food allergy found by skin patch testing.
