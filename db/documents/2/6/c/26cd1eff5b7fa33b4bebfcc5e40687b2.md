BPD is a chronic illness that persists beyond discharge from the hospital and into adulthood. Infants with BPD have a 50% chance of readmission to the hospital during their first year of life. They have an increased risk of developing reactive airway disease, asthma, emphysema, and RSV bronchiolitis. BPD also affects their growth and neurodevelopmental outcome. VLBW infants with BPD are more likely to have delays in fine and gross motor skills, and language.

Infants with BPD are at high risk for cardiopulmonary sequelae like pulmonary hypertension (PH), cor pulmonale, and systemic hypertension. A recent meta-analysis reported an accumulative estimated prevalence of PH in BPD to be 20% and can be as high as 40% in severe BPD. A newer, prospective study showed that BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) affects at least 8 to 25% of extremely low birth weight (birth weight less than 1000g) infants. Retrospective studies demonstrate a 2-year morbidity rate of 26 to 47% in patients with BPD-PH.
