Deterrence of VCM exposure is the responsibility of employers and workplaces. A standard hierarchy of controls approach should be used to reduce or prevent chronic workplace exposure to VCM. Consultation with industrial hygienists and/or occupational medicine physicians may be necessary to determine the best means to reduce workplace exposures to VCM. Employers must provide workers with education regarding the hazards of exposure to include carcinogenicity, appropriate usage of PPE, standard protocols to mitigate harm during an accidental exposure, and whatÂ type of occupational medical surveillance must take place annually.
