As described previously, both CT and magnetic resonance angiography are uncommonly performed in patients with seizure disorders. A notable exception includes patients who are suspected of having underlying ischemic or vascular disease within the head or neck. Outside of these narrow indications, cross-sectional angiography is seldomly performed during the routine seizure workup. Additionally, more invasive tests such as catheter-based angiography may be used for further delineation of vascular pathology but are rarely required. Before surgical interventions, vascular imaging may be warranted, but this is dependent on the individual clinical scenario.
