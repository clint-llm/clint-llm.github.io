Medication overuse headache is classified as a secondary headache or chronic headache syndrome in the latest version of ICHD-3 (2018) under subsection 8.2 as a chronic headache disorder secondary to a pre-existing headache syndrome.

As the name implies, chronic medication overuse is the most significant risk factor for the development of MOH, with each class of analgesics carrying a different risk profile.  The risk from lowest to highest is: triptans/ergotamine, single analgesic agents (NSAIDs, acetaminophen), and combination analgesics containing opiates or barbiturates. There have been observations that combination analgesics, particularly those containing opioids and/or barbiturates, have a two-fold increase in relative risk for MOH.

Some studies suggest that NSAIDs may have a protective effect from MOH in patients with ten headache days or less per month.
