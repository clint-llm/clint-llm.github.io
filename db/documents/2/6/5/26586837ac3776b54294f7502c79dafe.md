**Pharmacokinetics**

It has been well established that a minimum plasma concentration of 4mg/L of pralidoxime is necessary to protect the acetylcholinesterase enzyme against OP compounds.

Pralidoxime distributes evenly in the body's fluid compartments and has not been shown to bind to either hemoglobin or plasma proteins

**Absorption**

When given via the intramuscular route, pralidoxime shows zero-order kinetics. However, co-administration with avizafone and atropine accelerates the absorption of the drug due to modified blood flow at the injection site to the point that the best mechanical model applicable for this process shifts to first-order kinetics.

**Elimination**

Sidell et al. determined that the kidneys actively secrete pralidoxime in its original form without undergoing any significant metabolism. Most of the excretion is via urine and feces.

**Drug Interactions**

Pralidoxime has no known deleterious drug interactions. There is positive evidence suggesting its synergism when co-administered with atropine. On the one hand, pralidoxime was detected in the plasma earlier and in higher concentrations when given along with atropine and avizafone. On the other hand, the signs of atropinization also occurred earlier than expected when given alone. This synergy is the rationale behind including these drugs together in the auto-injector.
