Although the cause is unclear, sarcoidosis is believed to be a hyperactive immune response. Th1 cells stimulate the release of IL-2 and IFN-gamma which then activate macrophages. In turn, the inflammatory response induced by macrophages causes granuloma formation. The most common neurological abnormalities reported include the following:

- Papilledema

- Cranial neuropathies

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Myopathy and mononeuropathy

- Neuropsychiatric disturbances

- Ataxia

- Hydrocephalus
