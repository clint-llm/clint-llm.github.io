Fexofenadine is a metabolite of terfenadine and is a second-generation antihistamine. It is FDA approved to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Fexofenadine has approval for use in both children and adults. Children should be six months old or older, dependent upon the indication for use.

- Seasonal allergic rhinitis is characterized by symptoms including nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion, though antihistamines are less useful for nasal congestion symptoms. These symptoms can be triggered by seasonal or perennial allergens, including grass, pollens, dust, pet dander, mold, and others.

- In a double-blind,placebo-controlled, randomized trial, compared with loratadine, fexofenadine had similar safety and efficacy. However, fexofenadine worked more effectively for eye symptoms and nasal congestion symptoms.

- As the name implies, chronic idiopathic urticaria is a chronic condition due to spontaneous mast cell degranulation.
