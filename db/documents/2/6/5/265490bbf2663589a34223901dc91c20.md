Gallbladder polyps that have the appearance of pseudo or cholesterol polyps, in asymptomatic patients, can be followed with yearly gallbladder ultrasounds. These patients have a very low malignant risk. If serial ultrasounds reveal that the polyp is enlarging or if the patient becomes symptomatic, then cholecystectomy should be recommended. Patients with symptoms of chronic cholecystitis are usually best treated with laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy. Polyps that are 1 cm or greater in size should undergo cholecystectomy due to the increased risk of developing gallbladder cancer. Early intervention is preferred because an early gallbladder neoplasm has a much higher rate of cure than a more advanced lesion. In fact, stage 0 gallbladder cancer has about an 80% 5-year survival rate, and stage 1 has less than a 50% survival rate. Less than 10% of all gallbladder cancers are diagnosed at stage 1 or lower. More advanced gallbladder cancers require an open cholecystectomy with resection of the gallbladder fossa of the liver along with regional lymph node removal.
