Teamwork involving the surgeon, anesthesiologists, OR nurse, scrub technician, and recovery nurse will result in the best outcomes. Perhaps most important to the survival of the flap in the early postoperative period is the experience of the critical care nurses who will be taking care of the patient and performing regular evaluations of the flap's viability. Experienced nurses who are supported by a responsive surgical call team are more likely to recognize early signs of vascular insufficiency in the flap, generally venous congestion, and are therefore more likely to appropriately request an evaluation by a microvascular surgeon, who can then salvage the flap in a timely fashion, if necessary. Delay of more than 6-8 hours between cessation of adequate blood flow to the flap and restoration of perfusion carries with it a very high risk of flap death, which will then often require that the patient undergo a secondary reconstructive procedure.
