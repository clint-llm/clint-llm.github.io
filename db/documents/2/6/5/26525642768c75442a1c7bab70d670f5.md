Timolol is a common medication often used in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. All patient care team members (primary care physician, emergency department, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, etc.) must be aware of the contraindications of timolol and its potential side effects. The ophthalmic nurse should also ensure that the medication is working by regularly monitoring the intraocular pressure. Any vision or pressure changes require communication with the ophthalmologist. Ideally, only the ophthalmologist should change the dosage and frequency. Pharmacists can weigh in with medication reconciliation, dose verification, and counseling regarding adverse effects and communicate any concerns to the nurse or prescribing physician. Both the nurse and pharmacist are responsible for instruction on administering ocular formulations effectively.

The pharmacist should counsel the patient about the medication, the specific dose, and any side effects that may occur. Patients should immediately seek help if they overdose or experience serious side effects.

While timolol is a common and generally well-tolerated medication, an interprofessional team approach to include physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, collaborating as a unit, will optimize therapeutic results and minimize adverse events. [Level 5]
