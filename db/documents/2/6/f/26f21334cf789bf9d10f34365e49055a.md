Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which there is a build up of plaques inside arteries. These plaques are principally composed of lipids that induce an inflammatory reaction causing turbulent flow with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) as a result. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of atherosclerosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in the etiology of atherosclerosis.
- Describe the histopathologic changes in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis.
- Identify the treatment considerations for patients with atherosclerosis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to educate the patients on lifestyle changes and compliance to medication for those affected by atherosclerosis.
