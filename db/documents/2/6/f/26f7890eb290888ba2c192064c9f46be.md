The most important aspect of evaluation is the history and physical exam. There is no mandatory laboratory or imaging testing to complete a Peyronie disease workup.

As mentioned above, the AUA guidelines recommend performing an in-office ICI test with or without penile Doppler duplex ultrasound (PDUS) before any invasive intervention. A complete duplex ultrasound provides certain advantages, including identifying any calcifications, evaluating penile vascular flow, and evaluating the patient's erection quality after ICI. PDUS may help locate plaques not easily palpated and identify calcification in plaques. Levine et al. recently published a calcification grading system. The investigators found that patients with grade 3 or more extensive calcifications (greater than 1.5 cm in any dimension or multiple plaques greater than 1.0 cm) were more likely to undergo surgery when they also had a satisfactory erectile function. Patients with less severe calcifications of grade 1 (<0.3 cm) or grade 2 (0.3 to 1.5 cm) or no calcifications had no evidence of increased likelihood to proceed with surgery.

Thin section, high-resolution T2 MRI without fat suppression, has also been shown to be an excellent imaging modality for penile pathology, including PD.
