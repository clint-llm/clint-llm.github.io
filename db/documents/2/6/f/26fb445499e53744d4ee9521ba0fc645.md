Neuroblastoma is a rare abdominal tumor in young children. However, if the diagnosis is missed, the tumor is fatal. Hence, the diagnosis and treatment of neuroblastoma are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, a pediatric surgeon, oncologist, radiation therapist, social workers, pharmacist, dietitian, and specialty care nurses. A team dedicated to childhood cancers is vital as these patients have special needs. All cancer treatments can stunt growth, and hence, a dietitian should be involved early in the care.

The tumor may occur anywhere along the sympathetic chain and can be mistaken for a Wilms tumor. Oncologic pharmacists assist in the formulation of chemotherapy, check for drug-drug interactions, and provide family and patient education. Oncology nurse practitioners and nurses play a vital role in patient care and the education of the family. Occupation therapy is necessary as some children may develop neurological deficits that may impair motor function. A positive environment is essential to ensure that the child thrives in this difficult situation. Team members should openly communicate with each other to improve their care. [Level 5]

Over the past decade, the survival of these patients has slightly improved for early-stage lesions, but for late stages, the survival is abysmal. Thus, the impetus for the development of targeted therapeutics in the intensive management of high-risk groups is strong.
