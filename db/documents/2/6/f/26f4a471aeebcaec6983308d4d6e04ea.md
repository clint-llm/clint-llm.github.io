Lung volumes are followed to track a patient’s respiratory disease. While not routinely used in clinical practice, one way to measure residual volume and total lung capacity (TLC) is to measure a person’s FRC.

FRC can be measured/calculated by using techniques such as the whole body plethysmograph method (based on Boyle’s Law), and the helium dilution method (based on the Law of Conservation of Mass).
