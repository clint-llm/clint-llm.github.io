Early recognition and subsequently early treatment of compartment syndrome with fasciotomies causes a significant decrease in the risk of poor functional outcome, need for amputation, and death.

Additionally, the medico-legal burden of delayed fasciotomies is high; time from onset of the symptoms to fasciotomy is directly linked to an increasing pay-out amount in medical negligence claims. Fasciotomy performed early was associated with a successful defense of any medico-legal action.
