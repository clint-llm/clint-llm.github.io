Postoperative care for patients who have undergone surgery for bowel obstruction is focused on ensuring the resolution of obstructive symptoms and the ability of the patient to tolerate oral intake. Generally, patients are started on a clear liquid diet and advanced as tolerated. The resumption of bowel function can be confirmed clinically (if the patient is passing flatus/stool) and also radiographically.
