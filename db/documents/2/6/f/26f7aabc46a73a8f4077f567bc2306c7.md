Diagnosis of pectus carinatum is made clinically by visual inspection, with further details offered by lateral chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT).  Evaluation of the severity of the deformity is performed radiographically utilizing the Haller index, the ratio of the transverse diameter of the chest wall to the greatest anteroposterior diameter.  Studies suggest that chest radiographs are as effective as CT in determining the Haller index, with the additional benefit of decreased radiation exposure to the patient.
