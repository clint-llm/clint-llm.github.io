The time window for treatment for basilar occlusion have been extended to 24 hours since the white matter fibers forming a major component of the brainstem are more tolerant of ischemic insult. Moreover, abundant collaterals also help in minimizing neuronal death.

Emergency posterior fossa decompression may be life-saving in few patients with massive brainstem infarction.
