**Flow**

Flow can be laminar or turbulent. Laminar flow is smooth with low resistance. It is conceptualized as layers neatly stacked in parallel as they flow through a column. In contrast, turbulent flow is rough with high resistance and has a chaotic, unorganized structural pattern. Reynold’s number can quantify the likelihood of a fluid demonstrating turbulent flow. It states this likelihood is related to fluid viscosity, density, velocity, and the diameter of the column through which the fluid is traveling. Flow becomes more turbulent as velocity increases and the diameter of the column becomes smaller.

Heart sounds are primarily generated from vibrations of cardiac structures caused by changes that create turbulent flow.

**Physiologic Heart Sounds**

The S1 heart sound is produced as the mitral and tricuspid valves close in systole.

The S2 heart sound is produced with the closing of the aortic and pulmonic valves in diastole.

Different heart sounds exist aside from S1 and S2 that hold no pathologic consequence. The factors involved in the production of these sounds are the same factors involved with all heart sounds: turbulent flow and vibration of cardiac structures. These physiologic murmurs occur in systole, typically early systole, with a short duration. They are characterized as soft sounds affecting maximally 60% of systole and do not propagate well. These murmurs have also been called innocent, harmless, irrelevant, evolving, benign, habitual, infantile, growth murmurs, accidental, non-pathological, non-organic, normal, false, meaningless, ‘’functional’’, supine position, nonsignificant, transitory, and dynamic murmurs. Some specific examples are Still’s murmur, venous hum, and pulmonic flow murmur.
