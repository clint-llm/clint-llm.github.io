Revascularization for stenosed vein grafts is less effective than arterial stenosis concerning overall mortality, length of event-free survival, and total vein graft disease at five years.

Compared to their index CABG operation, those undergoing redo-CABG procedure have a perioperative mortality rate of 9.6% vs. 2.8%, respectively. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, insulin-dependent diabetes, redo surgery within one year of the index operation, and renal disease are all independent risk factors for increased mortality following redo-CABG.

The prognosis of those diagnosed with critical limb ischemia, a common indication for PABG, is poor. At one year of follow-up, approximately 45% will survive with both limbs, 30% will have been treated with an amputation, and 25% will have expired. At five years, approximately 60% of patients diagnosed with critical limb ischemia will die.
