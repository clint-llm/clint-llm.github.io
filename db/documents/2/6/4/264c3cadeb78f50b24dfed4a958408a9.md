As mentioned previously, millipedes lack the ability to bite, sting, or inject venom. Their primary defense mechanisms consist of coiling up and secreting toxins from the sides of their body. Within these secretions, a variety of irritating chemicals have been identified, some of which include hydrogen cyanide, hydrochloric acid, hydroquinones, benzoquinones, alkaloids, and phenols.
