The scapular anastomosis provides a rich blood supply to the muscles of the back and shoulders. This ensures adequate circulation even in the event of the occlusion of one of the branches involved in the anastomosis. This fact is especially evident in the event of a gradual occlusion; blood can still reach the target organ via the collateral blood supply, and symptoms might not be present.

An aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm might develop in the thyrocervical trunk. Dysphagia due to compression of the esophagus might ensue. The physical exam may be normal or might reveal a neck mass. Diagnosis is made or confirmed via computed tomography.

Injury to the thyrocervical trunk or its branches can occur due to trauma or iatrogenic injury. One example of iatrogenic injury is during cardiac interventions. Percutaneous coronary intervention is usually via trans-radial artery access. A rare yet devastating complication is thyrocervical trunk perforation. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential since the perforation can lead to a neck hematoma that compresses the trachea and thus compromises the airway.

Tumors in the head and neck can receive blood supply from the thyrocervical trunk or one of its branches. Treatment of such tumors can involve the embolization of the culprit branches. A solid understanding of the anatomy of the thyrocervical trunk enables employing adequate vascular treatment as well as recognizing symptoms of complications.
