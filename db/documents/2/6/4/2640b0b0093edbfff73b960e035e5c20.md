Weight loss regimes usually depend on dietary modulations and calorie restrictions, exercise, and sometimes drug intervention or surgery. However, it is concerning that most people are unable to maintain the lost weight, and many regain a significant part of the lost weight. Notably, there are individual differences observed in weight maintenance. There is no standard effective regime developed thus far, and individual differences are observed in the manifestation of such regimes, and in some patients, it may not be successful. These differences in the positive outcome of weight loss management programs may be due to lifestyle choices, eating habits, and individual metabolic variations, besides not complying with the healthy diet.

Weight lost through calorie restrictions poses a risk of bone mobilization or bone loss.  A combination of calorie restriction and exercise does not necessarily prevent or attenuate bone loss. Losing about 5% of body weight raises the risk for fractures, especially in older age individuals. It requires a controlled weight-loss program design to pinpoint mechanisms adapted to support the quality and density of bone sites susceptible to bone loss. Hence, besides the clinical regime of weight loss from the point when it is initiated to achieving a healthy weight, management of lost weight also requires clinical support.

Weight loss through pharmacological and surgical interventions is becoming more appealing. Besides improving an individual's health and emotional status, they effectively reduce the risk factors for metabolic diseases. Nonetheless, they are associated with significant age-specific side effects. Surgical interventions such as sleeve gastrectomy usually lead to swift weight loss but are accompanied by changes in hormones, bone density, and gastrointestinal problems.

Weight regain after weight loss is also a frequent problem encountered in obesity. This tendency is often due to the lack of compliance to exercise or dietary regimes. However, in many cases, it occurs due to physiological mechanisms and not due to high-calorie intake or lack of exercise. Gut hormone secretions may lead to a reduced secretion of anorectic hormones and an enhanced orexigenic hormone affecting metabolic adaptation. This imbalance causes weight to be regained after weight loss has taken place. The BMI-induced metabolic shift may also lead to the weight regain process. Hence, it concerns that many central (metabolic) and peripheral (food craving, hunger sensation, and enjoyment of eating) mechanisms can cause regain of weight.

Maintaining weight loss after following a specific regime such as calorie restriction, exercise, drug treatment, or surgical intervention always requires a careful assessment at the individual level. This should be followed by meticulous customization of weight management regimes to achieve a potent, sustained and healthy body weight.
