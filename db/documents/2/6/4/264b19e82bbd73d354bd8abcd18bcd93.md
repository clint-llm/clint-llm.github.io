Genetic susceptibility and reproductive hormones, especially estrogen, are found to be the principal contributing factors to the development of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). See details in the etiology section. Estrogen reduces the expression of nuclear hepatic bile acid receptors and hepatic biliary canalicular transport proteins in genetically susceptible women causing impairment of hepatic bile acid homeostasis and subsequent increased level of bile acids.
