After a confirmed or suspected exposure to Euphorbia latex has occurred, the priority is decontamination to prevent further injury. Wash the skin thoroughly with soap and water. Remove contact lenses if present. Eyes should be irrigated copiously with water or saline for a minimum of 30 minutes.

Laboratory and imaging studies are not required for isolated dermal or ocular exposures and are unlikely to reveal significant abnormalities. In Euphorbia latex ingestion with systemic symptoms such as prolonged vomiting or severe abdominal pain, it may be prudent to obtain serum chemistries to evaluate electrolytes and thoracic or abdominal imaging to evaluate for concomitant abnormalities. These events are rare, and studies should be tailored to the clinical presentation based on provider judgment.

If there is a concern regarding intentional ingestion, then recommend screening for co-ingestions including acetaminophen and salicylates in addition to routine studies such as the electrocardiogram. If the type of plant ingested is unknown, consider screening for cardiac glycoside ingestion with a serum digoxin level, as many plants contain cardiac glycosides that will cross-react with the digoxin assay. The digoxin level should only be used qualitatively and not quantitatively in cases of cardiac glycoside-containing plant ingestions.

Contact poison control if there are questions regarding the diagnosis, management, or in the rare event of severe toxicity.
