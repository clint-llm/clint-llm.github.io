Healthcare systems are supply constrained systems with unpredictable and fluctuating levels of demand. When the level of demand outpaces the available supply of resources, the healthcare system must make decisions on how to allocate available resources. In extremes of demand, such as mass casualty incidents or natural disasters, the healthcare system may be impaired to the point of near non-operation due to overwhelming need. Hospitals are expected to be able to maintain functionality for up to 96 hours without external resources, but to remain functional in the face of extreme demand, hospital systems must increase available resources or find ways to redistribute resources in more efficient ways.
