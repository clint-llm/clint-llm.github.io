Indications to perform SCS or FPR on a somatic dysfunction of the thoracic spine include an identified tender point associated with:

- Back pain

- Chest pain

- Neck pain

- Headache

- Joint hypo-mobility

- Fascial restrictions

- Muscle dysfunction or spasms in the localized area or the thoracic spine.

Indications are also based on the patientâ€™s needs. If the patient is not able to activate their own muscles and needs more assistance from the clinician, both of these passive, indirect techniques are appropriate.
