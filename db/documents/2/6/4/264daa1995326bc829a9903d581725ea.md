Acute bilirubin encephalopathy from the buildup of bilirubin in an infant's brain may manifest as hypotonia or poor suck reflex, which then progresses to irritability and hypertonia with retrocollis and opisthotonos. Long-term consequences of chronic bilirubin encephalopathy may lead to cerebral palsy, auditory dysfunction, paralysis of upward gaze, and permanent intellectual dysfunction.
