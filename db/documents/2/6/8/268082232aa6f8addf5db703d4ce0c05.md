Given that team-based interventions primarily drive healthcare, all healthcare team members must be aware of and utilize therapeutic communication techniques. As such, the specific information gathered by each team member may also differ, and thus the collective information can allow for a more holistic treatment approach if all team members are involved and communicating. Tools like SBAR and STICC can provide efficient methods of interprofessional communication, and opportunities within the healthcare organization or system are important for supporting such communication.

Interprofessional communication within teams has also shown benefits in attaining efficient and safe outcomes.

In addition, frequent and effective interprofessional communication is important to enhance treatment and prevent splitting behaviors in patients, where some providers may be considered "good" and others "bad." This is done by providing clear and consistent treatment recommendations that are from a “unified front,” as well as a consistent message of compassionate treatment from all team members. Therapeutic communication can facilitate this through the use of consistent empathetic approaches provided by each healthcare team member.
