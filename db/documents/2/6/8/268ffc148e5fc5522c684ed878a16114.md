Pheochromocytoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor with serious and lethal clinical and cardiovascular complications due to the effects of secreted catecholamines. There needs to be close coordination between theÂ primary care provider, nephrologist, and endocrinologist. In patients with diagnosed pheochromocytoma, all patients should undergo resection of the pheochromocytoma following medical preparation, and coordination with the general surgeon is highly recommended. Before surgery and preoperatively, a pharmacist should be involved. Perioperative and surgical nurses are essential for the care of these patients. Coordination of this interprofessional team will improve outcomes. [Level 5]
