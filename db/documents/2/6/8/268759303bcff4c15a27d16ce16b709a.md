Early diagnosis is the key to determining prognosis. A high degree of suspicion based on the clinical history and laboratory investigations can lead to earlier diagnosis and quicker initiation of therapy. Management of cardiac amyloidosis requires a multidisciplinary team. ClinicalÂ consultation with a cardiologist and active input of a hematologist is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment. Moreover, the cardiac amyloidosis team requires liver and heart transplant specialist input.

An individualized approach must be used to decide the extent of treatment for every patient. It also requires the expertise of an imaging specialist. However, endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard but is used less often. CMR has evolved as a useful tool in diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis.
