The rash is nearly always associated with an external heating source, which is why it is classified as a chronic environmental dermatosis.

Although the direct cause of erythema ab igne is external heat exposure, the cause of rashes in unique areas may be more descriptive. For instance, some people have EAI in areas of direct heat exposure from space heaters or heating pads, such as on the anterior legs or the lower back.
