The symptoms of nocardiosis vary depending on where the site of infection is. Patients with pulmonary nocardiosis can present with fever, weight loss, night sweats, cough, and chest pain. If the infection spreads to the CNS, symptoms can include headache, weakness, confusion, and seizures. Cutaneous nocardiosis can present with skin ulcers, nodules that are sometimes draining, and the infection can spread to the lymph nodes.

Delay in the diagnosis of an immunosuppressed patient with nocardiosis has been implicated in treatment failure and poor prognosis. Therefore, if there is suspicion for infection with Nocardia, it is imperative to notify the laboratory of this suspicion so that steps can be taken by the laboratory to identify the species and antibiotic sensitivity pattern.
