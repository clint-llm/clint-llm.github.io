Spontaneous coronary artery dissection mainly occurs in previously active patients but the risk can be exacerbated by strenuous exercise,  particularly isometric exercises. Patients should not be arbitrarily advised to restrict physical activity and referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program should be strongly considered. Referral from Vancouver General Hospital SCAD Program (blood pressure no higher than 130/80 mm Hg; heart rate 50% to 70% of heart rate reserve; free weights for resistance training of 2 to 12 lb, starting low and gradually increasing can be considered.

Patients face significant psychosocial stressors due to limited knowledge about the disease and lack of modifiable risk factors. Patient-centered counseling and support groups along with participation in organizations focusing on SCAD must be offered to these patients.
