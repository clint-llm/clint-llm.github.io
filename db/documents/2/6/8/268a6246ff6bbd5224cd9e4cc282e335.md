The axillary arch is a myofascial slip that derives from the latissimus dorsi muscle, involving the axilla and the shoulder. In about 40% of the population, the axillary arch receives innervation from the thoracodorsal nerve.Â The fascia can create several clinical problems; axillary arch dysfunction could cause nerve traction and be one of the causes of thoracic outlet syndrome.
