Tinea corporis is a superficial fungal skin infection of the body caused by dermatophytes. Tinea corporis is present worldwide. It is defined explicitly by the location of the lesions that may involve the trunk, neck, arms, and legs. Alternative names exist for dermatophyte infections that affect the other areas of the body. These include the scalp (tinea capitis), the face (tinea faciei), hands (tinea manuum), the groin (tinea cruris), and feet (tinea pedis).
