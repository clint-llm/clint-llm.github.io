A subdural hematoma, as its name implies, forms because of an abnormal collection of blood under the dura mater. This is one of the intracranial injuries associated with abusive head trauma, especially in pediatric patients. A small bleed may resolve spontaneously. However, a larger bleed may increase the distance between the bridging veins and lead to an extensive amount of blood around the brain, ultimately leading to herniation of the cerebral structures. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this subdural hematoma.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of subdural hematoma.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with subdural hematoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for subdural hematoma.
- Identify the significance of a coordinated collaboration among the members of an interprofessional team for the implementation of a comprehensive management strategy for patients with subdural hematoma.
