Patients may experience chronic sequelae related to marine envenomations which can lead to significant morbidity. Envenomations of the hand are well-reported and may result in joint contractures. Severe envenomations of the hand may even progress to compartment syndrome. Slow healing, necrotic ulcers may result from marine puncture wounds as well. Lastly, retained spines, persistent pain, and chronic neuropathy are also possible consequences.
