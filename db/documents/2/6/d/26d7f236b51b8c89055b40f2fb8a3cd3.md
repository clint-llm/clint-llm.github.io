Because of its larger caliber than an SLT, a DLT is more likely to cause trauma to the larynx, trachea, or bronchi. Iatrogenic tracheobronchial ruptures are rare but potentially devastating complications of DLT placement. Women, the elderly, patients of small stature, patients taking corticosteroids, and those with certain tracheal pathologies, including tracheomalacia and congenital anomalies, are more likely to experience these injuries.
