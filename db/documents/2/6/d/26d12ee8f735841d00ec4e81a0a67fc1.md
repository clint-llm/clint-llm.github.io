Opioids have had a wide range of uses in medicine throughout history. However, they have recently fallen under scrutiny due to the opioid crisis/epidemic currently plaguing the world, particularly in the USA. Opioids are still a crucial tool in many fields and aspects of medicine but are especially important in treating pain and anesthesia adjuncts or primary anesthetic agents during surgery and post-operatively. Opioids remain an essential tool in many aspects of anesthesia and surgical pain management. This activity covers opioid anesthesia, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing opioid anesthesia in light of the opioid crisis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for opioid anesthesia.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of opioid anesthetic agents.
- Review the potential adverse effects of opioid anesthetics.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from therapy with opioid anesthetics, especially in light of the ongoing opioid crisis.
