Mast cells are mononuclear cells. Most characteristically, they contain many small secretory granules, ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.8 micrometers. The granules are often so dense as to obscure the nucleus. IgE receptors are found in the plasma membrane. These bind the Fc region of circulating IgE, and two crosslinks to induce cell degranulation.

Two major types of mast cell have been identified and are distinguished by the content of their secretory granules. MC(T) cells contain granules with mostly tryptase. The majority of MC(T) cells are found near mucosal tissue that is exposed to the outside world, i.e. gastrointestinal or respiratory mucosa. These cells act predominantly in the immune response. MC(TC) cells contain tryptase as well as chymase and carboxypeptidase in the secretory granules. The majority of MC(TC) cells are found in the submucosa and connective tissue adjacent to the conjunctiva and skin, often near blood and lymphatic vessels. These cells play a pivotal role in tissue repair.
