The diagnosis and management of cervical myofascial pain are complex and best done with an interprofessional team that includes a pain specialist, physical medicine specialist, social worker, physical therapist, specialty care nurse, neurologist, and the primary care provider. There is no ideal treatment for this disorder and all presently available treatments have limitations. Relapse and remissions are common. The key is to educate the patient on changes in lifestyle such as proper posture, weight loss, discontinuation of smoking and limiting stress. For mild cases, the outlook is good but those who chronic pain tend to have a poor quality of life. Specialty care nurses in orthopedics, pain management, and rehabilitation may be involved. They can faciliated communication between the team members, monitor patients, arrange follow up, and provide education to patients and their families. Pharmacists review medication, drug-drug interactions, and educate patients.
