The posterior auricular artery's perfusion territory includesÂ four main muscles:

- The posterior auricular muscles

- The occipitalis muscle

- The temporalis muscle

- The sternocleidomastoid muscle (origin)

These muscles will also derive blood from other arteries, but some of their muscle fibers receive some blood from the perfusion territory of the posterior auricular artery.
