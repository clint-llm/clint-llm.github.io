Dextrocardia is often diagnosed incidentally on the routine radiological examination, which reveals an abnormal location of the heart. Electrocardiogram (EKG) can also reveal the presence of dextrocardia as evidenced by right axis deviation, inversion of all complexes in lead I, upright p wave in AVL, and an absent R wave progression in the anterior leads.
