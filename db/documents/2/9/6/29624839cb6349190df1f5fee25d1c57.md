The protection of patients and healthcare personnel against radiation exposure requires an interdisciplinary team approach with the guidance and input of multiple interprofessional team members. Implementation of a radiation safety program is ideal as all team members are subject to similar training and are educated on regulations and safety measures, increasing awareness among personnel providing radiologic services to patients to ultimately improve patient safety. All healthcare personnel should be trained in the potential negative outcomes of acute radiation exposure to increase awareness for potential complications such as dermatitis, skin necrosis, erythema, and hair loss.

Radiation safety programs are also ideally designed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of radiation biologists, medical physicists, and radiologists. Further measures include establishing strong lines of communication among team members to facilitate safe imaging, such as ensuring the minimal amount of personnel necessary is present to avoid unnecessary exposure and communicating beam-on time in busy settings.Â Radiation safety protocols utilize small retrospective cohort studies to help generate guidelines and estimate risk. However, a need for further larger prospective studies is necessary to help clarify the long-term harmful effects of low-dose occupational radiation exposure to help further generate safety measures.
