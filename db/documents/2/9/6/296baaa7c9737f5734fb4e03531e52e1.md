The cervical vertebrae serve as the origination and insertion points for a host of muscles that support and enable movement of the head and neck. Posteriorly, the erector spine muscles of the deep back traverse the entire length of the spine and insert on the spinous and transverse processes of the upper thoracic and cervical vertebrae. These muscles mostly provide postural support but also assist in flexion and extension of the vertebral column. The muscles of the posterior neck and suboccipital triangle are associated with the cervical vertebrae and enable the extension, rotation, and lateral bending of the neck. The deep muscles of the anterior neck also originate at various landmarks of cervical vertebrae before attaching to the cranium or first or second ribs. These muscles are responsible for neck flexion, rotation, lateral bending, and stabilization of the skull.
