**Specimen Preservation and Processing**

Preservation of the urine sample can be achieved with a boric acid solution or refrigeration for up to 24 hours. Both techniques yield adequate preservation of the sample. Samples that are left at room temperature for greater than 4 hours run the risk of bacterial overgrowth of causative and contamination organisms.Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have been noted to be inhibited when boric acid is used as a storage medium. Therefore, careful consideration of the storage medium should be practiced, and timely refrigeration must be prioritized.

Specimens are processed routinely using calibrated loops for plating. This method allows for CFU/mL findings as well as the isolation of colonies for identification and susceptibility testing. Some of the most utilized media are blood agar and MacConkey agar. The temperature of the plates should be kept between 35 to 37 degrees Celcius with a recommended incubation time of 24 to 48 hours. However, Oligella urolytica, a slow-growing, gram-negative, and rare UTI-causing organism, has been reported to have an incubation of over 48 hours.
