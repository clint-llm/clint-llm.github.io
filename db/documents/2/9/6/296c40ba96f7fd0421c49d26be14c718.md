The gastroepiploic artery (GEA) is made up of two arteries which supply the greater omentum and the stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA) is also referred to as the right gastro-omental artery or arteria gastroepiploic dextra in older texts. The RGEA is one of the distal vessels branching off the gastroduodenal artery. The vessel courses along the great curvature of the stomach in a right-to-left direction. It travels between layers of greater omentum giving off gastric and omental branches and can create an anastomosis with the left gastroepiploic artery. The left gastroepiploic artery (LGEA) is also known to as the left gastro-omental artery or arteria gastroepiploic sinistra in older texts. The LGEA is usually smaller in diameter than the RGEA, and commonly branches from the splenic artery near the tail of the pancreas. It courses medially along the greater curvature of the stomach towards the RGEA, giving off gastric and omental branches.
