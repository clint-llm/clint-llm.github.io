An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to diagnosing and treating geographic tongue can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Health care staff of primary care and emergency departments play a vital role in diagnosing and referring patients with tongue lesions to dermatology or otolaryngology that look like geographic tongue. This will aid in better patient satisfaction and quality of life.

Collaboration, shared decision making, and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of geographic tongue are identified; the better is the patient outcome and satisfaction.
