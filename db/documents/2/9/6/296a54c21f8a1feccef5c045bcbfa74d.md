The disease prognosis depends on several factors including:

- The rapidity of onset of symptoms: a more rapid onset requires more aggressive treatment

- Amount of vision loss at presentation: significant loss at the time of presentation suggests a higher risk of permanent vision loss.

- The grade of papilledema at presentation: higher grades suggest a greater risk of permanent vision.

It is not uncommon for this condition to cause symptoms for from months to years even with prompt treatment. Some patients will have continued papilledema, increased ICPs, and even residual visual field deficits.
