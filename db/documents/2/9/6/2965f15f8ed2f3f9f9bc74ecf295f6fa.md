Each institution should develop its own standardized protocol for hyperglycemia for use in the pre-op area, intraoperative, and post-anesthesia care unit to ensure perioperative glucose control. Communication amongst an interprofessional group is necessary as surgeons, anesthesiologists, intensivists, internal medicine providers, pharmacists, and nurses are closely involved in patient care. Most patients will be coming either from the main floor or ICU, so there should be a good handoff.
