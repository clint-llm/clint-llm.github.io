The semilunar valves develop as the endocardial cushion forms in the outflow tract (OFT) of the primordial looped heart tube; this is the first sign of valvulogenesis. Later this endocardial cushion fold becomes a primordial heart valve with highly proliferative valve progenitor cells. During remodeling and maturation, the valves are rudimentary. The primordial valve will grow and elongate into a thin fibrous cusp of the semilunar valve. These leaflets will become stratified into compartments consisting of highly organized collagen, proteoglycan, and elastin rich extracellular matrix during late gestation and soon after birth. This valves continues to mature and undergoes remodeling well into the juvenile stages.

The embryonic leaflet from which the valve derives is the splanchnic mesoderm.
