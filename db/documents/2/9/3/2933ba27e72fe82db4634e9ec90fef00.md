Tachypnea is a term used to define rapid and shallow breathing, which should not be confused with hyperventilation, which is when a patient's breathing is rapid but deep. Both are similar in that both result from a buildup of carbon dioxide in the lungs, leading to increased carbon dioxide in the blood.

This buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood makes the blood more acidic than usual, alerting the brain. In response, the brain signals the respiratory drive to increase in pace in an attempt to correct the imbalance. In doing so, the blood pH can return to within the normal range in acidity.
