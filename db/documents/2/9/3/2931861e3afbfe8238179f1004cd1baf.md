The exact mechanism and causes of postoperative ileus are incompletely understood. However, the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus can be attributed to the following three categories of mechanisms: neurogenic, inflammatory, and pharmacologic. The autonomic nervous system plays a major role in gastrointestinal motility. The parasympathetic system stimulates motility while the sympathetic system inhibits motility. Increased sympathetic stimulation plays a role in the inhibition of gastrointestinal motility after surgery. Hormones and neurotransmitters, such as nitric oxide, calcitonin-gene-related peptide, and corticotropin-releasing factor, may induce the development of postoperative ileus. Postoperative ileus is more likely to develop after prolonged major surgical procedures and general anesthesia with excessive gastrointestinal manipulation or interruption. Postoperative pain medication, particularly opioids, promotes the development or worsening of postoperative ileus due to their known inhibitory effect on gut motility.
