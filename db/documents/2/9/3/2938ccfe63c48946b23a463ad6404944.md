Isolated eyelid myokymia has a good prognosis. It is a benign condition and is unlikely to develop into other facial movement disorders or to be related to other neurologic illnesses. Most patients will notice a spontaneous improvement in symptoms over a few months. Stress and anxiety reduction are often prescribed but of little scientific value. Most patients will obtain a complete resolution after just one injection with botulinum neurotoxin. However, it is difficult to determine if this outcome was a direct result of the management, or just coincident with the condition's nature.
