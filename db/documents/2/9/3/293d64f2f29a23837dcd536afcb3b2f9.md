Cameron lesions can present with a broad range of clinical features. The patients can be completely asymptomatic in the beginning. Cameron lesions have been identified as an etiology for occult upper gastrointestinal blood loss, at times leading to iron deficiency anemia.

The larger hernias (>3 cm) are associated more frequently with iron deficiency anemia than the small hernias (<3 cm).
