TCAs have varying degrees of receptor affinities, leading to several adverse effects. The most common adverse effects include constipation, dizziness, and xerostomia.

TCAs may also cause cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, such as QTc prolongation, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death in patients with preexisting ischemic heart disease.

TCA use has been shown to lead to an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in individuals age 24 or less. Therefore, individuals started on TCAs of age 24 or less should be followed closely to assess for thoughts and behaviors related to suicide.

The use of TCAs during pregnancy has correlated with congenital eye, ear, face, and neck defects.
