**History**

Patients with trachoma will usually present with redness of the eyes, itching, and irritation of the eyes and eyelids, discharge from the eyes, swelling of the eyelids, eye pain, and photophobia. It is important to determine the duration of the symptoms. AÂ history of travel to endemic areas (e.g., North Africa, Middle East, India) should be obtained. Concomitant vaginitis, cervicitis, or urethritis should be ruled out if the patient is sexually active.

**Physical**

**Active Trachoma**

- Mixed follicular/papillary conjunctivitis. There may be some associated mucopurulent discharge.

- Superior epithelial keratitis is commonly seen.

- Corneal vascularization may lead to the development of pannus.

**Cicatricial Trachoma**

- Stellate or linear conjunctival scars, or broad confluent scars (sometimes referred to as the Arlt line) in advanced stages. Although the entire conjunctiva is involved, the effects are more prominent on the upper tarsal plate.

- A row of shallow depressions called Herbert pits might be formed in the superior limbus when the follicles in this region resolve.

- Trichiasis, distichiasis, corneal vascularization, and entropion may be seen.

- Severe corneal opacification can occur.

- Destruction of goblet cells and the ductules of the lacrimal glands eventually leads to a dry eye.
