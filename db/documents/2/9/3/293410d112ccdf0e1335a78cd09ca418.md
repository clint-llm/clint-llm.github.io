Microdontia generally has a good prognosis. The fact that it is developmental in origin does not necessarily affect the function of the dentition. Restorative and orthodontic interventions usually address any difficulties or concerns that the patient may have.

Macrodontia has a good prognosis, as the function of the dentition typically remains intact. Restorative and orthodontic interventions usually address any difficulties or concerns that the patient may encounter.
