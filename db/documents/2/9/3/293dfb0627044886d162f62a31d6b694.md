Like any other ventilators, NAVA also requires close coordination of physicians, registered nurses, and respiratory therapists for better management. Proper teaching and guidance are required before its implementation in any intensive care unit. Although NAVA has shown some promising results in few studies, larger studies are required for its widespread use. Proper monitoring, documentation, and trending ventilator data are required for better outcomes in the given patients.
