The initial evaluation and stabilization should be performed in conjunction with a trauma surgeon. Definitive surgery should be performed after stabilization when life-threatening injuries are addressed. Le Fort fractures require fixation of unstable fracture segments to stable structures.

- Restore the facial projection and the involved sinus cavities

- Reestablish proper occlusion of teeth; note that proper repair cannot be performed without good occlusion

- Restore the integrity of the nose and orbit

Le Fort fractures may be associated with other injuries such as dental or alveolar ridge fractures (alveolar and palatal fractures are commonly associated with all types of Le Fort fracturesÂ and make the repair more difficult and complex), cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and severe epistaxis.

In type III, significant facial swelling, deformity, and orbital ecchymosis are almost always present.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with CSF leak remains controversial and should be considered at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.
