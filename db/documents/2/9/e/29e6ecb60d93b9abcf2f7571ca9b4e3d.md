Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is believed to be caused by abnormal neural crest (NC) migration during early embryogenesis. Important ocular structures rely on adequate NC cell migration, such as ciliary body, cornea, and iris stroma. Transcription factors in different genes strongly regulate these processes.

In late gestation, the primordial endothelium that covers the cornea should undergo resorption, disruption of this process may result in posterior embryotoxon and abnormal insertion of the iris causing pupillary changes such as pseudopolycoria or ectropion uveae.

The previously discussed abnormalities in the development of the anterior chamber may affect the development of the Schlemm’s canal impairing outflow of aqueous humor and increasing the risk of glaucoma.

Abnormal NC migration associated with ARS often affects various extraocular tissues such as vestibuloacoustic ganglion tissue, which may cause hearing loss in some patients with ARS.
