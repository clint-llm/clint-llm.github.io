Neurotrophic keratitis, formerly known as neuroparalytic keratitis, is a degenerative corneal disease characterized by decreased or absent corneal sensation, leading to epithelial breakdown, impairment of healing, and ultimately corneal ulceration, melting and perforation. This activity describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of neurotrophic keratitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neurotrophic keratitis.
- Describe the presentation of neurotrophic keratitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options for neurotrophic keratitis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing coordination and communication to advance the treatment and management of neurotrophic keratitis and improve patient outcomes.
