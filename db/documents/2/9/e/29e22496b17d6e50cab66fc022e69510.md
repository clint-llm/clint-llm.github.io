Non-emergent adverse effects of neuroleptic agents can be managed without consultation. In cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or acute overdose, consultation with a poison control center or a toxicologist is advisable and may be invaluable in the appropriate management of these patients. In some hospitals, toxicologists are available for bedside consultation in these cases; where bedside toxicology consultation is not available, in the United States, regional poison control centers are available at all times for consultation by telephone at 1-800-222-1222. For patients outside the United States where bedside toxicology consultation is unavailable, the World Health Organization website provides a list of international poison control centers that may be able to help with the care of these patients.
