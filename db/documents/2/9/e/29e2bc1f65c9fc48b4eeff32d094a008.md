Patients are advised to remain in the hospital till the improvement of symptoms or resolution of fever and septic state. During the early post-operative phase, it is advisable to admit the patient in ICU. Patients should be educated about the risks and complications of the procedure and alternative options. Moreover, these patients require prolonged antibiotic therapy. Some authors suggest lifelong therapy, hence patient education is required.

Instruction for post-operative care for patients are:

- Wear loose clothing that does not irritate the wound

- Do not soak in the bathtub, hot tub, or swimming pool soon after surgery

- Clean incision with soap and water every day after wound epithelialization occurs

- Change wound dressings frequently

- Avoid any lotions, creams or herbal remedies on the wound

- A gradual return to activity is advised

As most patients are in the older age group, physiotherapy and occupational therapy may be advised.

Since mycotic aneurysms are associated with atherosclerosis, aggressive risk factor modification is also advised in these patients (DASH diet, smoking cessation, statins, aspirin).
