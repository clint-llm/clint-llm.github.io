The most important question in the evaluation of headache history is to ascertain whether the headache is of primary or secondary type. Primary headaches are recurrent headaches. The new-onset headache should undergo assessment for the secondary causes. In cases of recurrent headaches, the next important question is if the current episode is similar to the previous headaches. If this headache is similar to the previous headaches, a primary headache disorder is the most likely possibility. If the current headache is different from the previous headache episodes, an evaluation for the secondary causes is necessary (e.g., a patient with migraine or TTH may suffer from subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis and may present with a headache different from the usual headaches).

TTHs are recurrent headaches. The patients need to maintain a headache diary and write down their headache episodes, duration, severity, as well as aggravating and relieving factors. IHS requires at least ten episodes of headache for a diagnosis of TTH. These headaches vary from 30 minutes to 7 days in duration. The average duration is about 4 to 6 hours. The headaches are often bilateral in location and described as having dull, pressing, or band-like tightening (non-pulsating) quality. They are also of mild or moderate intensity, which is not aggravated by routine physical activity such as walking or climbing stairs. Therefore these patients continue performing their routine activities, unlike patients with migraines, who usually prefer to stay in quiet, dark rooms. TTH is better in the morning and usually worsens in the evening.

These patients may also complain of shoulder or neck muscle tightness as well as sleep disturbances. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia are typically absent or are very mild. These features, when present, easily differentiate TTH from migraines. Sometimes the symptoms are overlapping, and confirmation of an exact diagnosis may only occur over time. Medication history is also critical. The type, frequency, and response to analgesicÂ drugs require evaluation in all the patients.

Physical examination is normal in primary headache disorders, including the TTH. Although the transient trigeminal cranial features of ptosis, conjunctivitis, or orbital swelling may occur with the trigeminal autonomic cephalgias (TACs). Physical examination is vital in excluding the secondary causes, such as nuchal rigidity seen in meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage, focal neurological deficits seen in the space-occupying lesion, and/or papilledema in idiopathic intracranial hypertension, etc.

"Red flags" for secondary disorders should always be ruled out during the history and physical examination.

- Sudden onset of headache

- Age of onset of headache after 50 years of age

- Very severe headache

- New onset of headache with an underlying medical condition

- Headache with concomitant systemic illness

- Focal neurologic signs or symptoms

- Papilledema, and

- History of head trauma

Secondary headache disorders can also have an evaluation using the acronym: "SNOOP4".

- "S" stands for systemic symptoms, fevers, chills, myalgias, and weight loss.

- "N" is the neurological symptoms, especially the focal neurologic deficits.

- The first "O" is for older onset, meaning the age of 50 years or greater.

- The second "O" is onset, particularly that of a sudden onset headache like a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- "P1" is papilledema.

- "P2" is positional.

- "P3" is precipitated by the Valsalva maneuver or exertion.

- "P4" is a progressive headache or substantial pattern change.
