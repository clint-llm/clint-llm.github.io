The management of acute CHF is with an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, cardiologist, internist, and intensivist. In the field, EMS can assess the patient and initiate treatment but cannot confirm the diagnosis of CHF. The key is to keep the patient upright, provide oxygen, and limit IV fluids. These patients need immediate transport to a medical facility. The role of EMS is to recognize the signs of severe heart failure, initiate prehospital treatments, and safely transport the patient without delay.
