The retina is the innermost coat of the eyeball, responsible for processing light energy and generating visual information. The three major types of cells in the retina are the photoreceptors, glial cells, and neuronal cells.

The retinal ganglion cells are second-order neurons that relay image-forming and non-image-forming information from the bipolar cells to the lateral geniculate body. Multiple rods converge onto a single ganglion cell, whereas a single cone is connected to a single ganglion cell. At least twenty different types of retinal ganglion cells receive excitatory and inhibitive impulses from the amacrine and bipolar cells.

The retinal pigment epithelium is the outermost layer of the retina, which is made up of a single layer of regularly arranged cells with a polygonal shape. It has many roles, like phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, barrier function, transport of substrates, and protection against phototoxicity, as it contains pigments like melanin and lipofuscin.
