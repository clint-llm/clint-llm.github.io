Split-thickness skin grafts typically become adherent to the recipient wound bed 5 to 7 days following skin graft placement. The dressings placed intraoperatively are kept in place until 5 to 7 days postoperatively to minimize shear and traction to the healing skin graft. At 5 to 7 days postoperatively, the dressings are taken down, and the skin graft inspected. The graft should be pink at this point, indicating successful inosculation and revascularisation. For the next 7 to 14 days, dressing changes should be performed every 24 to 72 hours. These dressing changes typically consist of petroleum-infused gauze, bulky gauze/kerlix, ACE wrap, or wound VAC, and can be performed by the patient, home nursing care, or wound clinic. At the 2 to 3 week postoperative mark, the skin grafts should be adherent and epithelialized so the patient may resume showering and bathing, and may stop frequent dressing changes. Lotion can be applied to the skin graft to promote continued healing.
