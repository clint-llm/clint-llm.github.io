Only patients who are alert or mildly confused at the initial presentation have a good prognosis. Victims who are comatosed usually fair poorly. Those who are comatosed and resuscitated with CPR often develop severe brain injury and hypoxic encephalopathy. At least 10-30% of children with brain damage require long term rehabilitation. Hypothermia can protect the brain in some children. Other risks of drowning include aspiration, ARDs, and death.
