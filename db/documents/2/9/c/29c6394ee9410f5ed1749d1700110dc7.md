Complications occur from the disease itself and the treatment.

Neurological complications involving upper extremity

1. Extension of the tumor to C8 and T1 nerve roots results in weakness and atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand or pain and paresthesia of the fourth and fifth digits and the medial aspect of the arm and forearm

2. Extension to T2 causes abnormal sensation and pain in the axilla and medial aspect of the upper arm - triceps reflex may be lost

3. In approximately 5% of patients, tumors may invade intervertebral foramina early in the course of the disease, causing spinal cord compression and paraplegia - approximately 25% of patients ultimately develop spinal cord compression

4. In roughly 5% to 10% of patients, tumors may produce a phrenic or recurrent laryngeal neuropathy or superior vena cava syndrome

Treatment complications include

1. Surgical removal of lung tumors may result in chylothorax, ulnar nerve paralysis (seen in resection of the C8 nerve root), Horner syndrome (resection of the stellate ganglion and sympathetic chain),  cerebrospinal fluid leak and meningitis (Post-surgical complications); surgical mortality rates are 4% to 10%

2. Common side effects from radiotherapy include:

- Localized lung fibrosis, fatigue, esophagitis, and skin irritation

- Less commonly patients develop symptomatic pneumonitis

- Rare complications include skin fibrosis (leathery skin) with shoulder immobility

- Myelitis and brachial neuritis may cause weakness and pain in the hand, arm or shoulder

3. Chemotherapy-related complications like diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, nephrotoxicity (renal impairment, hypomagnesemia, Fanconi like syndrome, etc.), and peripheral neuropathy, to name a few.
