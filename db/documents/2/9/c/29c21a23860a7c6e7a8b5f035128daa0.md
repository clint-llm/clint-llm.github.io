Radiographic evaluation with anteroposterior (AP) and lateral knee radiographs should beÂ obtained. Lateral views are useful to assess for the displacement of the patellar fragments. Advanced imaging of patellar fractures is rarely warranted. Imaging of bipartite patella most commonly demonstrates a fragment at the superolateral pole. They can be differentiated from acute fractures by the appearance of smooth edges. Imaging of the contralateral knee may reveal a bilateral bipartite patella in up to 50% of cases.

Patients with suspected periprosthetic patellar fractures should be evaluated with formal anteroposterior, lateral, and skyline radiographs. In rare situations, a Technetium-99m bone scan may be of use to diagnose an occult fracture or to differentiate from an acute or chronic fracture. Careful interpretation of a bone scan is required as this type of scan may be positive for 48 months following the initial injury.
