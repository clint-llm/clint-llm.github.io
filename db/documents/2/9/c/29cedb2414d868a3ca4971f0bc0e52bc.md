Solar urticaria often has a chronic course. Approximately half of patients continue to be symptomatic ten to 15 years after the disease onset. A longer duration of solar urticaria before the first medical evaluation, as well as age older than 40 years, are associated with a longer disease course. Patients with exclusive reactivity to visible or natural light seem to have the best prognosis.
