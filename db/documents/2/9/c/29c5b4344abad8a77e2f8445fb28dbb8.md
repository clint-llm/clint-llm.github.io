High-output cardiac failure is a less common form of heart failure, and although it may sound contradictory at first, in the simplest form, it is still the heart's inability to provide sufficient blood for the body's demand. Most patients with heart failure are either classified as a systolic or diastolic dysfunction with increased systemic vascular resistance, however, patients with high output cardiac failure have normal cardiac function and decreased systemic vascular resistance, either secondary to diffuse arteriolar dilation or possible bypass of the arterioles and capillary beds, leading to activation of neurohormones. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of high output heart failure and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of high output failure.
- Describe the presentation of high output heart failure.
- Summarize the treatment options for high output failure.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by high output heart failure.
