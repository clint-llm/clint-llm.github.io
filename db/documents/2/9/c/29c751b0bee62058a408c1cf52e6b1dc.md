Digitalis use was first described in 1785 and was derived from the foxglove plant. Poisoning with digitalis can occur with acute over-ingestion of medication or as chronic toxicity most commonly due to decreased renal clearance. Some metabolic disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypercalcemia can make one more prone to toxicity as well as some drug interactions. Chronic toxicity is more common than acute intoxication.

The most common trigger of digoxin toxicity is hypokalemia, which may occur as a result of diuretic therapy. Dosing errors are also a common cause of toxicity in the younger population.

Factors that increase the risk of digoxin toxicity include:

- Hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism

- Advanced age

- MI

- Renal insufficiency

- Hypercalcemia

- Alkalosis

- Hypoxemia

- Acidosis

Medications that are associated with digoxin toxicity include?

- Diuretics

- Amiodarone

- Beta-blockers

- Benzodiazepines

- Calcium channel blockers

- Macrolide antibiotics

- Propylthiouracil

- Amphotericin
