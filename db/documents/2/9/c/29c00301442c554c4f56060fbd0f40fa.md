During smear taking, superficial nabothian cysts may getÂ ruptured by the spatula; the mucoid content can stick to the brush and be smeared upon the slides in conventional cytology or be mixed in with the preserving solution of the liquid-based cytology (LBC) preparations. In LBC, mucus is rarely present, as it dissolves in the preserving solutions and centrifugation preceding the slide preparation. Macroscopically, a nabothian cyst would appear as a cervical cyst containing mucinous liquid.

Microscopically, nabothian cysts are lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium or flattened epithelium without cellular mitosis or atypia.
