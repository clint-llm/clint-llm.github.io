Teprotumumab is a newly approved medication to manage active, moderate to severe thyroid eye disease. Teprotumumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating thyroid orbitopathy, under breakthrough therapy designation, as an Orphan Drug. It is an insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor in the class of biological therapy. This activity describes the indications and evidence supporting each indication, action, and contraindications for teprotumumab as a valuable agent in treating thyroid eye disease. Furthermore, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for interprofessional team members in the care of patients with thyroid orbitopathy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for teprotumumab.
- Describe its mechanism of action.
- Understand the most common adverse events associated with teprotumumab therapy.
- Explain the importance of monitoring for patients on teprotumumab.
