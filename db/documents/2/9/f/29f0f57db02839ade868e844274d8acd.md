People who work in high-risk occupations, participate in contact sports, and those whose work or recreation increases the risk of corneal abrasion or ultraviolet light exposure should wear protective eyewear. Patients who wear contact lenses should make sure they fit properly and wear them and replace them as instructed. The eye should not be rubbed after a foreign body injury as it may damage the cornea more. For larger corneal abrasions close follow-up with the ophthalmologist should be done.
