The PENG block is typically performed by an anesthesiologist with experience in regional anesthesia, usually with the assistance of a block nurse. Interprofessional communication skills are essential, as the nurse assists with sterile technique, preparation of the ultrasound by handing the probe to the performing provider. Ensuring that medications for sedation and analgesia are available, as well as preparation of the equipment, are some of these duties.

It is recommended that a regional anesthesia cart equipped with emergency medications and airway management equipment be readily available. Nurses are responsible for being able to quickly retrieve such items in the event of an emergent complication.Â All involved team members from the nursing staff, trainees, and performing providers should be familiar with the adverse effects of local anesthetics.
