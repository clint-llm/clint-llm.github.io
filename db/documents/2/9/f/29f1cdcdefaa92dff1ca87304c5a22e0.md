Initial management for trochanteric bursitis is always nonoperative. Antibiotics are not indicated in the management of trochanteric bursitis.

**Pharmaceutical**

Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) assist in blocking the inflammatory cascade and aid in symptomatic pain relief and propagation of bursitis. Before initiating NSAIDs, it is important to ensure patients have no contra-indications to the medications. NSAID therapy should be bypassed in those currently on blood thinners or at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Physical Therapy**

Physical therapy directed toward quadriceps strengthening and ischial tibial band stretching is important in addressing the underlying pathology. Hip abduction exercises should also be initiated to stretch and strengthen the gluteus medius and minimus.

**Corticosteroid Injections**

Trochanteric bursitis is also amenable to steroid injection. Injections deliver a localized dose of cortisone, often coupled with local anesthetic lidocaine or marcaine, to provide relief and directly target local inflammation. Injections can be delivered by both orthopedic surgeons and primary care providers. These are minor outpatient procedures performed under the usual procedural sterile technique. Long-term outcomes are similar in those who receive corticosteroid injections versus those who undergo physical therapy.

**Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections (PRP)**

The use of PRP throughout the field of orthopedics and sports medicine remains a continued hot topic of debate.

**Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy**

extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is an effective treatment for greater trochanteric pain syndrome, especially for those who have high signals on MRI. One study showed that ESWT yielded better results than corticosteroid injections or home exercises. With a success rate of 86.8% after two months following therapy, ESWT, in combination with a certain exercise regimen, is secure and successful for GTPS.

**Surgical Management**

Surgical management for trochanteric bursitis is rarely employed. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases or those not responding to usual conservative therapy. Surgical management includes sharp excision and debridement of the bursa.
