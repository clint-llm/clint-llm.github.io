Pulmonary hypertension is defined as an increase in the blood pressure of the arteries of the pulmonary system. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare cause of pulmonary hypertension and primarily involves the venous system.

Early symptoms for patients typically include shortness of breath or swelling in the legs. This can eventually progress to worsening shortness of breath on exertion, abdominal swelling, and low oxygen levels.

The workup for the pulmonary veno-occlusive disease includes obtaining an echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart. It can also include an X-ray of the chest, CT of the chest, and eventually, a right heart catheterization. A right heart catheterization is a procedure by which a physician takes a catheter, inserts it through a vein, and advances it into the pulmonary artery, where the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension can be made.

The clinician may also obtain genetic markers if the patient has a family history of this disorder.

The management of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease includes diureticsÂ to remove fluid from the body. Lung transplantation is currently the only proven curative treatment for this disease; patients need to understand this so expectations can be realistically set.
