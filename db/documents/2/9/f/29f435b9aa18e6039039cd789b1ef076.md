The management of PCM requires a closely coordinated, interprofessional team approach. The majority of patients present to a primary care provider or emergency clinician. Patients requiring hospitalization may need to be evaluated by pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists. Pharmacists can assist with the dosing of the medications and assist the medical team in avoiding drug-drug interactions. Clinical pharmacists play a crucial role in monitoring the patient for adverse reactions to therapy as all antifungals are associated with multiple hepatic and hematologic toxicities. The clinical nurse is essential in educating the patient about the expected long duration of therapy and the risk of complicated disease if treatment is prematurely discontinued. A collaborative interprofessional team can help provide a multifaceted treatment approach for the patient and help improve patient outcomes.[Level 5]
