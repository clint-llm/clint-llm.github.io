Breast cancer, the most common cancer-related causality of mortality, is a complex, heterogeneous disease classified into three main categories of hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The mentioned classification is based on histopathological findings. The discrete identification of the breast mass is specifically helpful for further target therapy. Accordingly, estrogen-receptor-positive and HER-2 positive breast cancers would benefit fromÂ tamoxifen and trastuzumab, respectively.
