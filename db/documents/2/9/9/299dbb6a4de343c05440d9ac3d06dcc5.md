Apixaban is a novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012 for use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots. Later, in 2014, it was approved to treat deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In 2014, it was also approved for use to reduce the risk of blood clots (DVT and PE) in patients following knee and hip replacement surgery. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, over-dose management, and toxicity of apixaban. It also highlights the role of interprofessional team members in patient care using apixaban as a treatment option.
