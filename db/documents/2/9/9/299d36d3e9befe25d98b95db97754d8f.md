The neck is the bridge between the head and the rest of the body. It is located in between the mandible and the clavicle, connecting the head directly to the torso, and contains numerous vital structures. It contains some of the most complex and intricate anatomy in the body and is comprised of numerous organs and tissues with essential structure and function for normal physiology. Structures contained within the neck are responsible for breathing, speaking, swallowing, regulation of metabolism, support and connection of the brain and cervical spine, and circulatory and lymphatic inflow and outflow from the head.
