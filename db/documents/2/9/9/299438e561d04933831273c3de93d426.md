Pathologic hemorrhoids are a result of increased pressure gradient within the hemorrhoid plexus. This typically results from increased intra-abdominal pressure experienced in scenarios such as prolonged straining during defecation or during pregnancy and labor. Not surprisingly, a history of chronic hard stool canÂ precipitate hemorrhoid disease.

Risk factors for hemorrhoids include:

- Family history

- Chronic diarrhea

- Sedentary lifestyle

- Obesity

- Higher socioeconomic status

- Injury to the spinal cord

- Rectal surgery

- Anal sex

- Inflammatory bowel disease
