Riehl melanosis (RM), commonly called pigmented contact dermatitis, is considered an acquired form of allergic contact dermatitis, typically to fragrance and other ingredients of cosmetic products. Although it is considered as a dermatitis, it presents clinically with hyperpigmentation over the face and shows pigment incontinence with minimal eczematous changes on histology. The condition is more commonly seen in dark-skinned people, causing an important psychosocial impact. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Riehl melanosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of Riehl melanosis.
- Identify the evaluation of a patient with suspected Riehl melanosis.
- Review the current management options available for Riehl melanosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by Riehl melanosis.
