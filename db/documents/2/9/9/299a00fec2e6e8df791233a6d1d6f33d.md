An operation to excise the sublingual gland most commonly involves transoral electrocautery and blunt dissection. Structures most at risk of injury during gland excision are the lingual nerve and Wharton's duct. The sublingual tissue can be found in the anterior floor of the mouth and directly deep to Whartonâ€™s duct.

A sublingual gland flap can be used to manage major pathologies affecting the mandible and maxilla bones; it seems that this surgery is capable of giving excellent results.
