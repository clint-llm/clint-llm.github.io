Urine composition predicts stone composition. Renal calculi can form when the urine composition has higher concentrations of calcium, and/or oxalate, and/or uric acid. Hypercalcinuria results in calcium stones, hyperuricosuria results in uric acid stones, hyperoxaluria results in oxalate stones.

Calcium oxalate makes up 74% of all renal calculi types. Calcium phosphate makes up 20%, and uric acid makes up 4% of stone types. Cystine and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones make up the rest of the stone types.  Usually, renal calculi are able to pass on their own. However, as the stone size increases to 7 mm and greater, they often do not pass without urologic intervention. Renal calculi 5 mm and smaller tend to pass on their own; however, since everyone's anatomy varies, some patients may be unable to pass what is considered a small stone.
