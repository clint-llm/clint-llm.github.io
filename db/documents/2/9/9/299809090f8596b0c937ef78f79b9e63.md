The presentation of malrotation depends on the age and acuity of presentation. Acute symptoms typically present with emesis - usually bilious (green or fluorescent yellow); however, emesis can be nonbilious. Bilious emesis in a child younger than one year should prompt immediate suspicion and workup for an obstructive lesion, including malrotation with volvulus. The anatomic features that lead to bowel obstruction and volvulus result from the narrow mesenteric base that allows for mobility of the small bowel. The small bowel twists around the superior mesenteric artery and leads to vascular compromise of the small bowel.

Abdominal distension may be present but is rarely present in the acute presentation and proximal area of the bowel obstruction, especially in young infants. Over hours, hemodynamic instability (from hypovolemia or shock), as well as peritonitis (indicating volvulus with inflammation) and hematochezia (indicating bowel ischemia with possible necrosis due to volvulus) can result.
