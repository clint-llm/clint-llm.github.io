Every patient presenting with opsoclonus or OMS requires comprehensive diagnostic investigation, including neuroimaging of the entire neuro-axis with contrast and a lumbar puncture. After exclusion of central nervous system (CNS) disease, investigations for occult malignancy as well as toxic, metabolic, and para-infectious causes must commence. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be performed in all patients, and if unrevealing, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan should ideally be performed in all patients, especially in those over 40 years of age.

Investigating children with opsoclonus or OMS requires a detailed search for the presence of neuroblastoma. This includes imaging of the entire neuro-axis with contrast and thin-cut CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Along with imaging, urine catecholamine measurements, including vanillyl mandelic acid and homovanillic acid, should be performed in addition to the I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan. Antibody screening should also be done in children with common isolates being anti-neurofilament antibodies (NF210K antibody), anti-Purkinje cell antibodies, and immunoglobulin G autoantibodies.

In all cases where the initial investigation is negative, repeat evaluation and re-investigation to exclude occult tumors should be undertaken a few months after the initial workup.
