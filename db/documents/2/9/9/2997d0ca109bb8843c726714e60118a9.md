Healthcare access is vital for children and their families, as well as to societyÂ in general. The provision of health care has a significant impact on children's physical and emotional health. Affordable health care for children can impact their growth and development, affecting their ability to achieve their full potentials as adults. If there is no provision for appropriate care, children are at an increased risk of developing preventable conditions when they are sick or injured. Failure to receive necessary health care can affect the lives of children and their families.
