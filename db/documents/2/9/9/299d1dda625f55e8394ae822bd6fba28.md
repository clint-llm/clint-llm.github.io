Uveitis can cause visual loss and blindness due to a variety of causes, including secondary complications like cataract, secondary glaucoma, choroidal neovascularizationÂ cystoid macular edema, optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusion, hemorrhage, and phthisis.

CME is common in birdshot chorioretinitis, sarcoidosis, and other uveitis, which cause extensive vitreous inflammation. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is seen more with choroidal involvement and disruption of the Bruch's membrane. Causes of CNV include presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, serpiginous choroiditis, and punctate inner choroidopathy.
