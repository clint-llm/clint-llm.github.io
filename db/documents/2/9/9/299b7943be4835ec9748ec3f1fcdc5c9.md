Macular edema per se is associated with progressive, irreversible loss of vision. The various treatment modalities also have their own share of complications. The most severe complication associated with laser photocoagulation is the accidental foveal burn. Therefore, a test burn should be given nasal to disc before starting the laser. Other complications include subretinal fibrosis/ scarring, burn expansion, paracentral scotoma, and choroidal neovascular membranes. Intravitreal injections have a higher rate of complication, and the most dreaded complication is endophthalmitis. Other complications include vitreous hemorrhage, cataract due to incorrect injection method, central retinal artery occlusion due to sudden increase in intraocular pressure, and retinal tears.
