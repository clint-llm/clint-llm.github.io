Moderate and severe infections with hantavirus serotypes lead to Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The incubation period of the virus varies from 2-4 weeks. The main cause of the disease is acute kidney injury (AKI), capillary leakage, and thrombocytopenia. The overall etiology is broad and has been identified to have viral factors, immune factors, and host genetic factors. Tubulointerstitial nephritis leads to acute kidney injury, cytokines and thrombocytopenia lead to capillary leakage and coagulation abnormalities. The virus itself has been noted not to be cytopathic and the disease is thought to be immunopathologic.
