Initially, the conduit of choice for coronary artery bypass grafting, the saphenous vein has been supplanted by the LIMA, the RA and increasingly the RIMA as bypass conduits of choice given its high rate of failure compared to arterialized grafts. More and more evidence is accumulating regarding additional arterial grafts such as the gastroepiploic artery; these have not demonstrated clear superiority to SVG, however, and are used less frequently

Despite new evidence supporting the use of arterial over vein grafts in coronary artery bypass grafting, utilization of the GSV remains a mainstay of the current treatment of coronary revascularization; this may be in part to surgeon comfort with SVG and a thorough understanding of SVG progression after revascularization as compared to its arterial competitors. While the LIMA remains the vessel of choice for coronary artery bypass grafting, the relative ease of harvest, length of usable vessel and comfort in its use make the SVG an indispensable tool in any cardiothoracic surgeon’s armamentarium in coronary revascularization.
