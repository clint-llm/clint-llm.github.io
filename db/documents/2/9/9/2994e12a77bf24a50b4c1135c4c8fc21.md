Any patient presenting to the clinic with signs of graft rejection should be admitted. The patient should be started on intravenous steroids 100 mg dexamethasone or 500 mg prednisolone in 150 ml of 5% dextrose solution two times for 3 days along with topical steroids 1% prednisolone of 0.1% dexamethasone 2 hourly for 3 days and later 6 times for 15 days, 4/3/2/1 times 3 months each based on the clinical response. Adjuvant drugs like 5% homatropine 2 times per day to relieve ciliary spasm and prevent the formation of synechiae and 0.5% timolol two times per day to prevent the development of secondary glaucoma.

Patients with regraft should be treated on similar lines. The patients must be educated regarding the importance of steroids in graft survival. They must be explained about the ill effects of noncompliance to treatment and the side effects of steroids overuse. The patient should be given a follow-up chart or a discharge sheet to understand the medication schedule and next follow-up date. The patient must be evaluated for graft clarity, visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and any other side effects related to surgery or medications on every visit.
