Calcific emboli:  White, dull (non-refractile), due to their larger size typically found in the central retinal artery close to the optic disc. This finding is consistent with cardiac disease originating from heart valve calcifications.

Platelet-fibrin emboli: White/gray, dull (non-refractile), elongated. This can be a finding for both cardiac and carotid disease; however, cholesterol emboli are more common in carotid disease.

Talc emboli­: Small, white/yellow, highly refractile, typically located in the macular region. This finding is associated with intravenous drug abuse.

Lipid/fat emboli:  Usually cannot visualize the emboli, cotton wool spots are often seen. This finding is associated with long bone fractures and chest trauma, i.e., Purtscher retinopathy.

Tumor cells: These proliferative neoplastic cells which can fall off the main the main lesion and lodge in the retinal arterioles.

Septic emboli:  These deposits are associated with bacterial endocarditis
