Routine x-rays are usually the first step if a radioopaque object is suspected. This will help determine the object, the location, and possible complications. Chest x-ray (posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral views) is usually adequate, but the neck and abdominal x-rays may be needed depending on clinical presentation. Flat objects like coins, bottle caps, or disc batteries are usually oriented in the coronal plane if they are lodged in the esophagus and appear round on the frontal (PA) view. However, if they are lodged in the trachea, they orient in the sagittal plane and appear round on the lateral view. If a circular “coin-like” object is seen on the x-ray, the object needs careful review looking for a “halo” or “double-ring” appearance, which identifies it as a button battery and the need for emergent removal. A chest x-ray can differentiate coins from button batteries with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of approximately 80%. Food, plastic, wood, and aluminum are not radioopaque, so they are not seen on routine x-rays. Bones and glass may or may not be seen on x-rays. If nothing is seen on routine x-rays, but suspicion of a foreign body remains high, then diagnostic endoscopy or CT scan may be indicated. CT scans have a high sensitivity for detecting foreign bodies plus are useful for detecting complications such as perforation.
