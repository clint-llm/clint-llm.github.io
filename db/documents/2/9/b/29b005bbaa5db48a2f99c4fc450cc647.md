A complete history, as well as a focused physical exam, is usually enough to elucidate the diagnosis. Essential elements of history should include

- Recent increase of scratching due to pruritus

- History of increased sweating

- Use of topical corticosteroids

- Recent and/or long term use of oral antibiotics

- Any hot tub and/or swimming pool exposure

- History of HIV with CD4 count less than 250 or immunosuppression (ex. A patient who recently had a transplant thatâ€™s on immunosuppressive drugs)

Physical exam should include close inspection of hair-bearing areas, including the bilateral upper and lower extremities as well as the chest, back, face, and scalp. On exam, the clinician should look for small pustules in these areas with peri-follicular inflammation.
