Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, rare, transmissible, universally fatal, neurodegenerative condition caused by prion proteins. This condition was first described in 1920 by Hans Creutzfeldt, later described in 1921 and 1923 by Alfons Jakob. Later, Clearance J. Gibbs started using the term Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) because the acronym was closer to his initials.
