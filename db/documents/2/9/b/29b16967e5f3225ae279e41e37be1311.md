Approximately 80 percent of vertigo is peripheral, whereas approximately 20 percent is central. Peripheral vertigo is most commonly due to a benign process; benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is by far the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. In contrast, central vertigo often indicates more serious pathology. Peripheral vertigo typically presents with acute, severe episodes. Peripheral vertigo usually is made worse with head movements and is generally associated with horizontal/rotary nystagmus, which is fatigable and unidirectional. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of peripheral vertigo and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of peripheral vertigo.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with peripheral vertigo.
- Review the treatment options available for peripheral vertigo.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by peripheral vertigo.
