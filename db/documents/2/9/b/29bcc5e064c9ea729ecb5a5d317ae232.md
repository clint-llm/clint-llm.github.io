The management of patients undergoing withdrawal symptoms involve multiple specialties. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms depends on the type of agent and duration of use. Some patients with mild withdrawal symptoms can be managed as outpatients but those with severe alcohol withdrawal with a history of seizures and DT may require admission. Besides a psychiatrist, other healthcare professionals that should be involved in the management of these patients include the internist, neurologist, pain specialist, intensivist, mental health nurse, pharmacist, and sometimes a cardiologist. The nurse should assist in patient monitoring and education. The pharmacist should evaluate for drug-drug interactions and assist in the selection and dosing of drugs used to control withdrawal symptoms. The outcomes depend on the agent ingested. For most patients, relapses and remissions are very common following addiction to drugs and alcohol. (Level V)
