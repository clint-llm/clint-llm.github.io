Current preclinical research is studying promising pharmacological agents as a possible treatment for ischemic spinal cord injuries. Neuroprotective therapies have as their basis the premise of limiting secondary injury after the initial damage by modulating inflammation, reducing cell death, and guarding against excitotoxicity. There are currently no proven pharmacological therapies for human spinal cord injury that provide neuroprotection. Studies use propofol, thymoquinone, minocycline, erythropoietin, and curcumin as possible neuroprotective pharmacologic agents. Antioxidants are used to protect against the oxidative damage caused by secondary neurodegeneration after acute SCI. Antioxidants seem to stabilize mitochondrial bioenergetics, protect neurons and achieve modest neurological recover after injury.

Emerging research is focusing on measures which could help prevent ischemic spinal cord injury during vascular surgery. Hypothermia preserves tissue integrity during periods of interrupted blood flow; animal studies suggest that hypothermia suppresses excitatory synaptic transmission and reduces injury to neurons. Hyperbaric oxygen increases tissue oxygenation and metabolism in penumbral tissue. Ischemic preconditioning is a way to prepare tissue for the ischemic state, thus rendering it more resistant to a hypoxic insult. Numerous preclinical investigations have looked at the molecular pathways and potential benefits of both pre and post-ischemic preconditioning with encouraging results. Other studies are examining how to counteract apoptosis which leads to neuronal cell death.

Many of the current treatments for spinal cord infarcts show only modest improvements in the functional outcome if used as monotherapy, which is probably attributable to the fact that many factors lead to the development of permanent neurological deficits. Thus, future treatment trials should consider a combined and multimodal treatment approach.
