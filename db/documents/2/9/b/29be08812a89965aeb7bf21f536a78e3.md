The urinalysis in affected individuals may show blood, nitrites, or leukocytes. It may also demonstrate a low urinary pH and a urinary tract infection (UTI). A plain x-ray or KUB is often the first study ordered, but in adult men, the stone may not be calcified, such as uric acid, so plain x-rays alone may not be sufficient. CT or a bladder ultrasound can be reliably used for imaging for possible bladder stones. Stones will typically show up on ultrasound as hyperechoic areas with shadowing.

Ammonium urate is radiolucent but may develop a calcific coating making it visible on x-rays.

If any bladder filling defect moves when the patient is repositioned, a bladder stone is likely, although it could also be a blood clot, fungal ball, or a papillary urothelial tumor on a long stalk. Since most of these patients will also have associated pelvic pain, hematuria, or voiding difficulties, a cystoscopy is frequently performed, and this will definitively show any bladder calculi.
