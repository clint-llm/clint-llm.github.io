JLNS is a disorder that is usually caught early in life and requires an interprofessional approach in treating the patient. (Level V) This is generally started with the pediatrician who initially diagnoses the disease and coordinates the care between the interprofessional team, including:

- Electrophysiology in determining appropriate medical therapy, ICD appropriateness, and activity restrictions

- Audiology to assess the extent of hearing loss

- Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician for cochlear implantation

- Geneticist to determine appropriate molecular genetic testing and evaluating family at risk

As morbidity and mortality are high in patients with this disease, regular assessment of patient's cardiovascular needs will be necessary. This comprises beta-blocker dose adjustments and ICD placement evaluation. Once an ICD is placed, periodic evaluation of inappropriate shocks and lead complications is indicated.
