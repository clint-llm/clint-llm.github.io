Riboflavin deficiency is extremely rare in the United States. Riboflavin deficiency is most common in developing countries in Asia and Africa. Older adults, alcoholics, and women who take birth control pills are most likely to suffer from riboflavin deficiency since the body cannot absorb much riboflavin when on birth control pills. Riboflavin deficiency can be related to many developmental abnormalities such as cleft lip and palate, growth retardation, and cardiac disease. Pregnant and lactating women, people with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (BVVL), and vegan people are also at risk of riboflavin deficiency.
