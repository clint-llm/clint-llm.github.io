On a cellular level, preload is related to the intrinsic properties of the actin and myosin filaments that make up the myocardial muscle. Preload determines the resting length of the cardiac muscle fibers at a given LVEDP.Â  Initially, when preload increases, the starting length of the muscle fibers also increases; consequentially, the resting tension increases. However, the amount the muscle fibers shorten during contraction also increases correspondingly. As a result, the final length of the muscle fibers does not change dramatically.
