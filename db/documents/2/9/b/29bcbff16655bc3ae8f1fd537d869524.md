Aortic heart valve replacement is done via open median sternotomy. Heart valves are first assessed with echocardiography. Other types of equipment used in the procedure are Hegar dilator (to measure the autografts) and polypropyleneÂ sutures (to attach the graft valve). Dacron tube is used in the Ross procedure to extend the pulmonary valve.
