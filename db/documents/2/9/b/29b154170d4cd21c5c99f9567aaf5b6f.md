Healthcare workers, including intensivists, infectious disease specialists, internists, and nurse practitioners who prescribe daptomycin, should monitor the patient to ensure safe administration of the medication. Baseline renal function tests are recommended to assess renal impairment and the necessity of dosage adjustments. Additionally, recommendations are that clinicians obtain baseline creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels in patients requiring treatment for greater than one week. After that, the CPK should be monitored at least once weekly. More frequent monitoring of CPK is necessary for patients with current or prior statin therapy, an unexplained elevation in CPK, or renal impairment. A board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can provide antibiogram data, verify dosing, and work with the nursing staff regarding administration. Nursing can also monitor for adverse events and administer the drug, alerting the attending promptly regarding any concerns.

Patients should also be monitored by nursing staff and clinicians for muscle pain or weakness, new-onset or worsening peripheral neuropathy, and signs or symptoms of eosinophilic pneumonia. Furthermore, prescribers should order testing for C. difficile infection when patients develop diarrhea. An interprofessional team of specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and clinicians monitoring treatment will provide the best patient outcomes.
