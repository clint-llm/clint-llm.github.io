Protein digestion begins in the stomach by the action of pepsinogen. The proteins are then broken down into smaller peptides by the action of various enzymes secreted by the pancreas and enzymes present at the brush border of the small intestine. These enzymes break down proteins into tri-peptides, di-peptides, and amino acids. The majority of amino acids are absorbed in jejunum through special transport protein located at the apical surface of brush borders. B0AT1 is a sodium-dependent co-transport protein for the absorption of neutral amino acids present at the apical surface of the small intestine and renal tubular cells. The absorption of neutral amino acids is independent of chloride concentration. The absorbed neutral amino acids are transported via the blood to other organs. In the kidney, it is filtered through glomerulus, where it is reabsorbed through B0AT1 membrane protein located in proximal tubular cells.

In Hartnup disease, there is a defect in B0AT1 protein, resulting in excessive excretion of neutral amino acids in urine and feces. A small amount of neutral amino acids is absorbed in the gut directly via paracellular transport and as oligopeptides from proton counter transport proteins.

Excess tryptophan present in the gut is converted to indolic compounds by the action of colonic bacteria. These indolic compounds are conjugated in the liver and are excreted in urine as indican.
