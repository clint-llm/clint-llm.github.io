The histopathology and molecular basis of brain tumors vary tremendously among the subtypes. For example:

**Teratomas**

Teratomas are derived from all 3 germ layers.

**Gliomas**

Gliomas arise from glial precursor cells of the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytic tumors make a large group of neoplasms that have different clinicopathologic and histological subtypes and grades from (WHO grade I to IV).

**Medulloblastoma**

Medulloblastoma is one of the embryonal brain tumors. Molecular studies have shown that medulloblastomas are not a single entity but rather a group of different neoplasms that have a different cell of origin and thus behave differently from each other. In the revised 2016 WHO classification of brain tumor, there are currently four identified subgroups of medulloblastoma wingless(WNT), sonic hedgehog(SHH), group 3, and group 4.
