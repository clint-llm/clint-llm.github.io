**What is HNPCC and Cancer Screening?**

Hereditary Non-polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal dominant trait and the most common cause of inherited Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Colorectal cancer screening is how doctors check the colon and rectum for signs of cancer or growths (polyps) that might become cancer.

**Who and when should cancer screening be done?**

In case of strong family history of colorectal cancers, early screening by endoscopy is recommended and should be performed every one to two years starting from the age of 25 and then every year from age 40, or screening should be done 10 years before the age of appearance of CRC in the youngest patient in the family.
