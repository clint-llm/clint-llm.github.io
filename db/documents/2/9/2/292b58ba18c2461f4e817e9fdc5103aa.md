Mastoidectomy is typically performed under general anesthesia in an operating room. Surgeons will need an operating microscope, a high-speed drill with appropriately-sized cutting and diamond-type burrs, otologic instruments, and other minor surgical instruments. Although facial nerve monitoring is not required, it is an often-used tool to improve the safety and speed of surgeons performing mastoidectomy.
