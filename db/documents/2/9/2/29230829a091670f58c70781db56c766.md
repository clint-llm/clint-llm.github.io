Denver Radiologic Grading Scale for Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury:

Grade I: Irregularity of the vessel wall or dissection/intramural hematoma with less than 25% stenosis

- Management: Anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, endovascular repair for symptomatic patients who are not candidates for anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy

Grade II: Intramural thrombus or raised intimal flap or dissection/intramural hematoma with greater than 25% stenosis

- Management: endovascular therapy if symptomatic, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, deferred endovascular repair in high-risk asymptomatic patients

Grade III: Pseudoaneurysm

- Management: endovascular therapy if symptomatic, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, deferred endovascular repair in high-risk asymptomatic patients

Grade IV: Vessel Occlusion

- Management: endovascular therapy if symptomatic, anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, deferred endovascular repair in high-risk asymptomatic patients

Grade V: Vessel transection

- Management: Vascular sacrifice, either open or endovascular if symptomatic followed by anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Asymptomatic patients have their condition managed with observational, operative, or endovascular treatment for ongoing hemorrhage.
