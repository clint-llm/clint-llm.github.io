The treatment of STP depends on the source of infection, the organisms involved, the structures being affected, and the individual patient's physiology. The main goals of treatment include removal of the source of infection, such as peripheral or central intravenous catheters, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic administration, possible anticoagulation (although this remains controversial), and evaluation by a surgical team for possible surgical intervention.

If there is frank purulence, then the infected vessel may need to be excised; this is possible in the periphery but not so when the central vessels are involved.

The role of anticoagulation is controversial. Some authors recommend anticoagulation to prevent the propagation of the thrombus, while others favor anticoagulation only if there is an extension of the thrombus; however, there are no controlled studies up to date. Anticoagulation should be held in patients who are thrombocytopenic, with a platelet count of less than 50,000/microL due to a high risk of bleeding.
