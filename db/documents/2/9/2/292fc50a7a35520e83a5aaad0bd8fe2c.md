The overall prognosis of HV deformity is good. Patients should first have a trial of conservative treatments. If the pain and functionality of the patient do not improve, surgery should then be a consideration. The postoperative recovery is dependent on the procedure. With any bone procedure, such as an osteotomy, healing takes around 6 to 7 weeks (corresponding to the complete bony union). If the patient is a smoker, the healing may take longer.

Postsurgical complications vary depending on the surgical procedure and technique. The more common complications include osseous non-union, hematoma, numbness, hardware failure, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, avascular necrosis, hallux varus, limited joint range of motion, and recurrence.

Recurrence rates differ based on procedure, ranging from 10Â to 47%. The etiology is typically multifactorial but typically includes anatomic predisposition, compliance with postsurgical instructions, medical comorbidities, and poor surgical technique.
