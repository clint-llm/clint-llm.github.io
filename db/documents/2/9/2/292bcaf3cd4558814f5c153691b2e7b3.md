The exact etiology of Kyrle disease is unknown. Many theories have been proposed in the literature including infectious, abnormal keratinization, defective differentiation of the epidermis and dermo-epidermal junction, elevated serum and tissue concentrations of fibronectin, uremia (renal failure), and hyperphosphatemia (diabetes mellitus). The high incidence of systemic disease associated with the development of Kyrle disease suggests an underlying systemic disorder as the main etiology.

Small case reports have shown a possible genetic predisposition with discoveries of both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. However, familial predisposition has not been extensively studied, and future studies are warranted to determine genomic significance.
