Skin grafts can be a life-altering procedureÂ for patients with large wounds that would otherwise be unable to heal. Cosmesis is often determined by timely wound debridement and treatment, often at specialized centers, if the wounds are large enough. It is essential that all teams work together, so that wound debridement and grafting occur in a timely manner so that patients have optimal outcomes. Patients with extensive injuries or burns that do not have sufficient skin available for grafting may be appropriate candidates for skin substitutes. Reestablishing skin continuity is essential to preventing infections and reduce insensible fluid losses, as well as provide patients with an increased quality of life.
