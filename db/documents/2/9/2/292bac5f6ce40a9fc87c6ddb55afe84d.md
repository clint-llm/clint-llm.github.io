Patellar dislocation is quite common and is best managed by an interprofessional team that may include a family clinician, physical therapist, and orthopedic nurses. Most simple cases of patella dislocation will spontaneously reduce, but recurrent cases should be referred to the orthopedic surgeon. The dislocation may often be associated with a knee pathology and lead to chronic pain, limitations in activity, and chronic arthritis. All interprofessional team members need to communicate with the rest of the interprofessional team regarding any changes in patient status and must keep meticulous and accurate patient records so that everyone on the case has access to the same updated patient data. This approach to these injuries will help achieve optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
