Opsoclonus is an ocular dyskinesia with an elusive underlying humoral and cell-mediated immunopathogenesis. All patients presenting with opsoclonus or OMS require extensive investigation to exclude the presence of occult tumors. Paraneoplastic opsoclonus in adults is commonly due to SCLC, breast carcinoma, or ovarian cancer whilst in children, neuroblastoma is the most common etiology. Immunotherapy is key in preventing relapse and worsening neurological outcome.
