There is no cure or definitive treatment for several of the neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, such as ChAc and MLS (see Table 5).

1) Treat symptomatically

2) Slow the development of progressive symptoms

3) Evaluate for and prevent where possible serious causes of morbidity and mortality such as ophthalmic involvement, metabolic/hormonal imbalances, seizures, cardiac involvement, and status dystonicus.

Interprofessional treatment teams have been advocated as the ideal approach in caring for patients who likely have complex and significant symptoms that run the gamut of neurological to psychiatric to multiple organ systems.

Consultation by medical specialists in neurology, psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, ophthalmology, or clinical genetics may be appropriate in identifying, evaluating, and managing patients diagnosed with neuroacanthocytosis syndromes (see Table 6).
