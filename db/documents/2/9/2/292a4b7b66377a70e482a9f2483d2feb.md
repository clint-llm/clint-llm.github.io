Bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurs when lung development arrests in the late canalicular to saccular stages of lung development. The pathology in BPD characteristically demonstrates decreased septation and alveolar hypoplasia resulting in simplified large alveoli and reduced area available for gaseous exchange. There is also dysregulated vasculature with smooth muscle hyperplasia in pulmonary vessels and abnormal alveolar capillaries. Additionally, there is also the presence of increased interstitial fibroproliferation and alveolar septation.
