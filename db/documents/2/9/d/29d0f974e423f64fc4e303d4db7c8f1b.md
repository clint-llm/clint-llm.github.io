A fundamental principle when immobilizing a fracture is that the splint must extend at least a joint above and a joint below the fracture. This means that for a metacarpal fracture the splint must extend from the mid-forearm to beyond the MC (metacarpophalangeal) joints. Careful examination and dressing of wounds as well as assessing and documenting neurovascular status should precede splint application.
