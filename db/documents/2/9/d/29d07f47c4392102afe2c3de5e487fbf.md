Presumptive testing should be a routine assessment. However, definitive testing should be used when there is a dispute about the findings of a presumptive test or when the results will inform a decision with significant implications for the patient, such as treatment transition or changes in medication therapy.

Multiple studies in the adult and pediatric populations confirm that urine drug screening very rarely changes clinical management. In a study of 160 pediatric cases in Australia to determine whether a rapid comprehensive urine drug screen that detects over 300 substances altered management, only three cases were found in which overall clinical management was changed based on the results.

A negative urine drug screen does not eliminate drug use as a cause of the presenting signs and symptoms; immunoassays have a narrow scope, and many drugs are not detected. A positive drug screen does not mean the patient is addicted to or under the influence of the drug. For example, a urine drug screen positive for cocaine does not mean the current clinical situation is due to cocaine use.
