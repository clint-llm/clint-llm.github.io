Menstrual-related headaches (MRH) are a common class of headaches that occur in women related to a decline in estrogen during the menstrual cycle. Menstrual-related headaches are related to several important factors, mainly estrogen, which has actions involved in the serotonergic and glutamatergic systems of the CNS. To treat this type of headache, it must be appropriately diagnosed in relation to the menstrual cycle or aligned with exogenous hormones, usually two days before the onset of menses to the third day of menstrual bleeding. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of MRH and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.
