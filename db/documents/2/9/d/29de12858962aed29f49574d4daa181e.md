# Continuing Education Activity

Primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in pregnancy is associated with the highest risk of trans-placental transmission. Universal screening for pregnant women is not recommended, thus providers must have a high index of suspicion for prenatal testing to identify an infected fetus. Congenital CMV infection is associated with poor long-term outcomes. However, the disease is mostly asymptomatic. This activity reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and describes an interprofessional approach to early intervention and follow up for neonates diagnosed with congenital (CMV) infection.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of congenital cytomegalovirus.
- Outline the prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and collaboration in order to employ better identification, screening, and treatment of congenital cytomegalovirus and improve patient outcomes.
- Explain the importance of an interprofessinal approach to early identification and treatment of a potentially CMV infected neonate.

# Introduction

Congenital cytomegalovirus (CCMV) infection is the most common intrauterine infection in the U.S. and the most common cause of non-genetic sensorineural hearing loss in children.

# Etiology

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the largest member of the herpes viridae family (HHV-5), and humans are the main reservoir. The virus sheds in bodily fluids such as saliva, urine, breast milk, semen, and blood. Primary infection of the host occurs when a previously uninfected individual acquires the disease for the first time.  In addition to primary infection, there can also be latent or non-primary infections. Non-primary infections result from reactivation of a previous infection or infection with a different strain of the virus.

An important risk factor for primary infection during pregnancy is prolonged exposure to young children.

# Epidemiology

Seroprevalence rates in women of reproductive age differ based on socioeconomic status. In developed countries, the seroprevalence rate ranges from 40 to 83%,

# History and Physical

Maternal CMV infection is frequently asymptomatic. Primary infection cannot clinically be distinguished from Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection and presents with symptoms that include fever, malaise, headache, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthralgias, and rash.

Fetal abnormalities include intracranial calcifications, microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, lenticulostriate vasculopathy, occipital horn anomalies, echogenic bowel, intrauterine growth restriction, hepatomegaly, pericardial effusion, and ascites. Also noted are placental inflammation and fetal death.

Laboratory findings include elevated aspartate transferase, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated CSF protein.

# Evaluation

Diagnosis can occurs in two settings – prenatal and postnatal. Prenatal diagnosis involves testing of the mother and fetus.

Universal screening for CMV in pregnancy is currently not a recommendation due to a lack of tests with high enough sensitivity and specificity, as well as limited options for intervention.  However, in certain circumstances, testing is advisable.  Such circumstances include mononucleosis-like illness in pregnancy, exposure to an individual with CMV infection, occupational exposure (health or childcare worker) or fetal ultrasound suggestive of congenital CMV infection such as the presence of ventriculomegaly, hyperechogenic bowel, intracranial calcifications, and hydrops.

Maternal testing involves determining the maternal antibody status.  A definitive diagnosis of primary CMV infection is obtained if there is seroconversion from a previously negative antibody status to an antibody positive status.

Fetal diagnosis is achieved via amniocentesis for amniotic fluid PCR with or without viral culture.  Replication of the virus in the fetal kidney, leading to shedding in the urine, occurs at least 5 to 7 weeks after infection.  Thus, the optimal time for performing this test is after 21 weeks gestation and 7 weeks after maternal infection.

Unless there is a high index of suspicion, CCMV often goes undetected at birth since most infected newborns are asymptomatic. Testing involves isolation of virus from urine or saliva via culture or DNA PCR within the first 3 weeks of life. After 3 weeks, it is not possible to determine the timing of infection – congenital vs. intrapartum or postnatal from breast milk or blood transfusion. Intrapartum or postnatal disease are not usually associated with long term sequelae.

# Treatment / Management

There is no definitive way to treat congenitally acquired CMV in utero. For fetuses with positive isolation of the virus, termination of the pregnancy can be offered to parents.  This offer must be accompanied with thorough counseling to enable the parents to make an informed decision.  If the parents opt to continue the pregnancy, close follow up with regular ultrasound exams is essential. The use of CMV hyperimmune globulin (CMV HIG) as a method of prevention, could reduce the number of congenitally infected newborns compared to no treatment.

At birth, the newborn must be tested within 3 weeks of delivery via saliva or urine PCR or culture.  If the diagnosis is confirmed, close follow up should be ensured for symptomatic neonates. Asymptomatic neonates also required to follow up, in particular, regular hearing screens. Pediatric subspecialists that have a role to play in the care of congenitally infected neonates include audiologists, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, neurologists, development/behavior specialists, infectious disease specialists, and physical/occupational therapists.

Neonates with symptomatic CCMV should receive oral valganciclovir for 6 months. This therapy has been shown to preserve normal hearing or prevent the progression of hearing loss, and also correlates with improved long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

# Differential Diagnosis

Other TORCH infections include toxoplasmosis, rubella, HSV, and syphilis.

# Prognosis

Prognosis is poor. Symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus leads to long term sequelae including sensorineural hearing loss, mental and developmental disabilities, and impaired vision. Around 10% of symptomatic newborns will die in the neonatal period, a number that may be low. Asymptomatic babies are not spared long-term sequelae, with 10 to 12% developing hearing loss and a smaller percentage of developing neuromotor disabilities and vision problems.

# Complications

Complications occur more commonly in symptomatic CMV infection. These include:

- Sensorineural hearing loss: Most common complication and it affects both symptomatic and asymptomatic neonates

- Neurodevelopmental delays: including motor deficits such as cerebral palsy, and cognitive deficits

- Ophthalmological deficits: ranging from the clinical finding of chorioretinitis to optic atrophy that may be associated with vision loss

- Seizures

- Death

# Deterrence and Patient Education

The greatest risk to pregnant women is exposure to urine or saliva of young children. Preventive steps that can reduce primary infection in pregnancy include education of pregnant women to increase awareness of CMV. Specific strategies that can be employed to decrease transmission include thorough hand washing after handling potentially infected articles, e.g., soiled diapers and toys, and limited intimate contact with children less than 6 years of age (such as kissing on the mouth or cheek, bed sharing, and wiping drool). Pregnant women should be counseled not to share utensils with their children or put a child’s pacifier in their mouth.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The primary care provider, nurse practitioner, obstetrician, infectious disease specialty trained nurse, and the pharmacist should operate in an interprofessional health team working with each other to educate the patient on CMV prevention, particularly in places where women are most at risk. Such facilities include obstetrics offices and childcare centers. Confirmed prenatal diagnosis or high suspicion of disease without confirmation should be communicated to the newborn medical team; to ensure neonatal testing, treatment if indicated, and appropriate follow up. Early diagnosis ensures access to treatment and early intervention services.
