The conditions approved by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society for hyperbaric oxygen therapy include:

- Decompression sickness

- Acute arterial gas emboli

- Necrotizing fasciitis

- Gas gangrene

- Refractory osteomyelitis

- Acute blood loss anemia

- Failed skin grafts

- Chronic radiation injury

- Carbon monoxide poisoning

- Acute thermal injury

- Compartment syndromes

- Compression injury

- Cranial abscess

- Arterial insufficiency

- Acute sensory hearing loss

There are numerous off-label indications such as autism, stroke, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that have not been proven to respond to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. A specific indication for hyperbaric oxygen therapy in wound healing is in cases of Wagner grade 3 diabetic wounds refractory to at least 30 days of conventional therapy. The Wagner scale categorizes the severity of diabetic foot wounds. This scale is as follows:

- Grade 0: skin intact

- Grade 1: superficial wound

- Grade 2: wound reaching bone or tendon

- Grade 3: abscess, osteomyelitis, or tendonitis

- Grade 4: gangrene involving forefoot or toes

- Grade 5: gangrene involving the whole foot
