Patient education by all healthcare team members about the proper disposal of expired medications can reduce costs to the healthcare system and save lives. Members of the healthcare team should be aware of projects such as National Drug Take-Back Day, which is coordinated by the DEA. This program allows patients to turn in expired and unused medications for safe disposal. If there are currently no programs available, healthcare members can educate patients on proper disposal techniques located on the FDAâ€™s website. Infographics are provided by the FDA and can be displayed in clinics and pharmacies to increase patient awareness. It is easy to educate patients on the importance of taking the medications they are being prescribed, but members of the healthcare team sometimes neglect the importance of educating patients on how to dispose of left-over medications.
