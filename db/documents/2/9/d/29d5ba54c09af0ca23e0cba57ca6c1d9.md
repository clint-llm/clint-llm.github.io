Airway suctioning refers to the collective measures that are used for clearing the airway of a patient. It involves suctioning, clearing secretions, and maintaining the patency of the airway. It is of particular importance for patients with mechanical ventilators, endotracheal tube (ET) intubations, tracheostomies, or other airway adjuncts. Clearance of airway secretions is a normal process and is critical to the prevention of respiratory infections, atelectasis, and preservation of airway patency. This activity reviews the role of surgical airway suctioning and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with viscous secretions and poor cough.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the methods of airway suctioning.
- Describe the indications for airway suctioning.
- Review the complications of airway suctioning.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication of patients needing airway suctioning and improving their outcomes.
