Carotid artery disease is often encountered by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner and the internist. Because the disorder can lead to a stroke, it is important to refer these patients to a vascular surgeon or an interventional radiologist. Both the open procedure and stenting are viable options for patients with carotid artery disease. Once treated, these patients need to be educated on prevention of atherosclerosis by changing lifestyle, reducing body weight, lowering cholesterol and participating in exercise.
