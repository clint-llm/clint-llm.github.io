**ATPs Role in Pain Control**

ATP demonstrates a reduction in acute perioperative pain in clinical studies.

**Anesthesia**

ATP supplementation produced positive outcomes during anesthesia. Evidence shows that low doses of adenosine reduce neuropathic pain, ischemic pain, and hyperalgesia to aÂ level comparable to morphine.

**Cardiology and Surgery**

ATP has been demonstrated to be a safe and practical pulmonary vasodilator in patients affected by pulmonary hypertension.
