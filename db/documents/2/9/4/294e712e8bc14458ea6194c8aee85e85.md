Administration of sugammadex from 2 mg/kg to 16 mg/kg demonstrates a linear and dose-dependent pharmacokinetic relationship, with an elimination half-life of 100 to 150 minutes and near 100% renal clearance.

While vecuronium and rocuronium should be dosed according to ideal body weight, sugammadex should be dosed according to actual body weight. For obese patients, the use of ideal body weight is likely not enough to achieve full reversal from rocuronium.

A few options for reinitiating neuromuscular blockade after administering sugammadexÂ include redosing rocuronium or vecuronium, succinylcholine, or administering a neuromuscular blocking drug from the benzylisoquinoline class. The company that manufactures sugammadex recommends a minimum waiting period of 5 minutes before administering a 1.2 mg/kg dose of rocuronium and a minimum waiting period of 4 hours before administering a 0.6 mg/kg dose of rocuronium or a 0.1 mg/kg dose of vecuronium. The product insert for sugammadex warms that patients receiving a 1.2 mg/kg dose of rocuronium within 30 minutes of reversal are likely to experience delayed onset and shortened duration of neuromuscular blockade. For patients that receive a 16 mg/kg dose of sugammadex, a minimum wait time of 24 hours is likely needed.

Sugammadex does not bind to succinylcholine or benzylisoquinoline neuromuscular blocking drugs such as mivacurium, atracurium, and cisatracurium.
