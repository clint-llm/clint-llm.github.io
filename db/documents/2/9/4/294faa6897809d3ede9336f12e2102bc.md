As with many bleeding disorders, a tiered management system exists for GT. For mild bleeding episodes, initial treatment may include local pressure, cauterization, sutures, or ice therapy.

If the bleeding is unresponsive or incompletely responds to local measures, or if the patient is undergoing surgery, platelets and/or recombinant activated clotting factor VII (rFVIIa) may be required.

Female patients may require menorrhagia management and should be screened for iron deficiency. Antifibrinolytics are the initial treatment for menorrhagia, although continuous hormone supplementation is a common preventative management technique.

Preventative management and symptomatic treatment work well for many patients. In select patients with GT with an extremely poor quality of life, curative treatment by way of hematopoietic stem cell transplant has been effective.
