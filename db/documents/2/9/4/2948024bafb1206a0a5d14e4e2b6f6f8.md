**Axillary Nodal Metastasis**

A lower frequency of axillary nodal metastasis in invasive lobular carcinoma than in invasive carcinoma of no special type has been reported in some series, the difference ranging from 3% to 10%.

**Distant Metastasis**

Metastases of invasive lobular carcinoma differ from those of invasive carcinoma of no special type. A higher frequency of tumor extension to the bone, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, meninges, ovary, and diffuse serosal involvement is observed in invasive lobular carcinoma, while the extension to the lung is more frequent in invasive carcinoma of no special type.
