Despite many advances in treatment, acute MI still carries a mortality rate of 5-30%; the majority of deaths occur prior to arrival to the hospital. In addition, within the first year after an MI, there is an additional mortality rate of 5% to 12%. The overall prognosis depends on the extent of heart muscle damage and ejection fraction. Patients with preserved left ventricular function tend to have good outcomes. Factors that worsen prognosis include:

- Diabetes

- Advanced age

- Delayed reperfusion

- Low ejection fraction

- Presence of congestive heart failure

- Elevations in C-reactive protein and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels

- Depression
