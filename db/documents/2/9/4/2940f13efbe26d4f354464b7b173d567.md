Clinicians should not start eplerenone therapy in patients with potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L or a CrCl less than 30 mL/min, as these increase the risk of serious hyperkalemia. Since eplerenone metabolism is via CYP3A4, potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (including specific protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, and clarithromycin) may increase eplerenone to unsafe blood concentrations.

Of note, when used for hypertension, more stringent contraindications are applied:

- Types 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria

- Serum creatinine over 2.0 mg/dL in males and 1.8 mg/dL in females or a CrCl below 50mL/min

- Concomitant use of potassium supplementation or potassium-sparing diuretics

Since Addison disease characteristically demonstrates an aldosterone deficiency, eplerenone is also contraindicated in these patients.
