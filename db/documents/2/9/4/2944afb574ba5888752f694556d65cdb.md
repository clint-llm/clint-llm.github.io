Thumb sucking is a behavior that can be grouped under a list of habits known as nonâ€“nutritive sucking habits. Within this group, we can also find the use of pacifiers, blankets, or sucking on other fingers as a comforting behavior.

Non-nutritive sucking habits are common in young children, and as they grow older, they tend to stop them. In most cases, this habit ceases spontaneously between 2 and 4 years of age.

Nevertheless, if thumb sucking continues, negative consequences can occur, such as a deformity of the nail or paronychia.

Clinicians must be aware of the non-nutritive sucking habits, including thumb-sucking and their negative impact on oral health, as well as the complications that can arise with them.
