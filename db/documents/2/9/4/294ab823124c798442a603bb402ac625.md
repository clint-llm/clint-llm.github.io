Skin involvement is common in sarcoidosis and it is estimated to occur in approximately 25 percent of patients. The skin lesionsÂ are further divided into specific and nonspecific lesions based upon histopathologic features. The annual incidence varies between 1 and 64 per 100,000 depending on the patient population. The real incidence of the disease remains difficult to determine, due to a highly variable clinical presentation and the large proportion of asymptomatic cases. Studies report a greater prevalence of the disease in northern Europe with a reported prevalence of 64 persons per 100,000 population in Sweden.
