Complications of acute pancreatitis can be divided into local and systemic. Peripancreatic fluid collections usually develop in less than 4 weeks after the initial presentation of pancreatitis whereas a pseudocyst and walled-off necrosis more than 4 weeks after the onset of acute pancreatitis.Local complications based on the revised Atlanta criteria include the following:

- Pancreatic pseudocyst( > 4 weeks)

- Walled-off necrosis ( > 4 weeks)

- Peri-pancreatic fluid collection(early phase)

- Acute necrotic collection( < 4 weeks)

Systemic complications include the following:

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

- Compartment syndrome

- Acute kidney injury (AKI)

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC)

Chronic pancreatitis has several complications including:

- Formation of pseudocysts

- Diabetes

- Pseudoaneurysms

- Splenic vein thrombosis

- Recurrent acute pancreatitis

- Risk of progression to pancreatic cancer
