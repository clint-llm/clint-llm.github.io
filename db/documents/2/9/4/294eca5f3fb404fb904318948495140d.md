For patients with an established treatment plan involving opioid therapy, frequent follow-up is essential for all patients, no matter their risk stratification. Higher risk patients require more frequent monitoring than lower-risk patients. Follow-ups may include re-screening of risk, urine drug screening, and observation for other clues of drug abuse. These clues may consist of requests for dose escalation, doctor shopping, forging prescriptions, requesting early prescriptions, unscheduled clinic visits, or emergency room visits with complaints of pain. Urine drug screening may identify illicit substances or non-use of prescribed medication. It is strongly recommended to collect a baseline urine drug screen to identify pre-existent drug abuse when present. These recommendations should involve interdisciplinary cooperation of physicians, nurses, technicians to improve patient outcomes.
