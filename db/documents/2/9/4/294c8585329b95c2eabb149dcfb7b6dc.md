While examining a patient for a femoral PSA, the clinician should perform a full vascular exam of the patient, as well as, a detailed medical history including HTN, smoking, hyperlipidemia, recent vascular interventions, or recent/remote trauma. The examiner should then proceed to perform a comprehensive vascular examination starting with a cardiovascular examination, followed by listening to any bruit in the neck, recording and examining any peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, as well as any investigating for pulsatile abdominal mass. A detailed examination should be tailored to a patient who presents with a pulsatile mass in the groin. A patient at this stage should not be mistaken as having an inguinal hernia as both entities could present with a bulge and pain. A bruit, however, would differentiate between the 2 as it is characteristic of PSA as opposed to an inguinal hernia.
