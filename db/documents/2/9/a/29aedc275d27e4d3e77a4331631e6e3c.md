Renal failure secondary to glycol ether toxicity is a condition that often results in morphological alterations of the renal tubular epithelium. Postpartum biopsy findings included thinning the tubular epithelium, sloughing cells, and cellular debris presence.

Additionally, ballooning of the tubular cells was observed in some cases. The detachment of tubular epithelium and tubular necrosis was also noted. The histological examination of liver samples showed centrilobular degeneration, necrosis, and ballooned hepatic cells. These findings highlight the significant morphological changes in patients with renal failure secondary to glycol ether toxicity.
