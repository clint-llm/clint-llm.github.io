Acne conglobata (AC) is a rare but severe form of nodulocystic acne. It usually presents with tender, disfiguring, double or triple interconnecting comedones, cysts, inflammatory nodules, and deep burrowing abscesses on the face, shoulders, back, chest, upper arms, buttocks, and thighs. The comedones often occur in groups of three, and the cysts often contain purulent, foul-smelling material that is discharged on the skin surface. It is a chronic inflammatory disease that inevitably leads to scar formation and disfigurement.

Acne conglobata is part of the follicular occlusion tetrad, a group of related diseases involving dysfunction of the follicular unit, including dissecting cellulitis, pilonidal disease, and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The follicular occlusion tetrad can be exceptionally difficult to treat. Whereas ordinary acne vulgaris can typically be managed with topical agents, AC requires aggressive treatment due to the degree of inflammation and formation of deep nodules and cysts.

Acne conglobata may occur in isolation or present with a systemic inflammatory condition, including SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis), PAPA syndrome (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne), PASH syndrome (pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, suppurative hidradenitis), or PAPASH syndrome (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, acne, suppurative hidradenitis).
