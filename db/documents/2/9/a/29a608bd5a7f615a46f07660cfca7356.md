Patients with amphetamines-related psychiatric disorders are commonly encountered in the emergency department. This spectrum of diagnoses has high morbidity and should be rapidly diagnosed and treated, and as such, management of this condition requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and psychological professionals. When these various disciplines operate in a coordinated fashion with open communication, patient outcomes will improve. [Level 5]

Emergency department clinicians and nurses must be aware of this diagnosis and its treatment and make appropriate referrals for treatment. Because these patients may suffer from various acute psychiatric disorders, including suicidal or homicidal thoughts, close monitoring is vital. There is a high risk of interpersonal violence and self-harm in this subgroup, and healthcare staff should maintain caution while in close proximity. The outcomes of these patients depend on the severity of psychiatric impairment and other comorbidities. For patients who abstain from the further use of amphetamines, the prognosis is good. However, many of these patients also have additional psychiatric disorders and often fail to comply with treatment. Many get lost to follow up and may eventually end up with legal problems leading to incarceration.
