A thorough and complete history and physical should be performed, including a detailed family genetic history. It is also important to recognize that patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome may be predisposed to congenital spinal stenosis. As such, a relatively low impact or low energy injury may induce a significant neurologic deficit.

Physical exam findings include shortened neck stature and low-lying hairline. Neurologic symptoms may include radiculopathy and myelopathy. A thorough neurological examination including cranial nerves, sensory, motor, and reflexes, and gait testing along with checking for signs of bowel or bladder incontinence is necessary.

The classic complete clinical triad of the low hairline, short neck, and restricted neck motion is only present in 50% of patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome. This variance can be secondary to several factors, such as time dependency of the congenitally-fused cervical patterns assessment and bias associated with the clinical evaluation of the clinical triad.

The presentation may occur simultaneously with Sprengel deformity, Duane syndrome, renal agenesis, Wildervanck syndrome, and other vascular and cardiac abnormalities. Approximately 50% of patients with Klippel-Feil will present with concurrent scoliosis. Fifty percent may have atlantoaxial instability. Approximately 30% will present with renal disease and 30% with deafness. All other systemsÂ require proper evaluation as well.
