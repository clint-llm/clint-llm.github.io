A complete patient history is necessary before starting a propofol infusion.  Patients should be encouraged to share any pertinent information that may deter using propofol as a sedative agent.   Any previous reactions with propofol or a known mitochondrial disease could clue clinicians into a high risk of adverse effects.  If there is a concern that high doses of propofol would be required or a patient is at risk of toxicity, another sedative should be considered.
