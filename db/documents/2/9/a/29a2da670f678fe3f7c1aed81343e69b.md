Central line placement is a common, often bedside, procedure. Placement under strict sterile conditions and subsequent catheter management, as well as a daily review of the need for continuing the central catheter, can help minimize complications associated with this procedure. This requires an interprofessional team of clinicians and nurses. The critical care nurse must perform daily dressingÂ inspections, periodically change the dressing following strict aseptic technique to prevent catheter-related infections, and report back to the clinician managing the case if any concerns arise, so corrective action(s) can be taken. An aseptic technique is also required when accessing the ports of the CVL.

Depending on the line's location, complications like pneumothorax, hematoma, bleeding, or extravasation can occur and should be monitored. Healthcare workers should generally avoid lines in the groin for more than 24 to 48 hours as they are prone to infections and make it difficult for the patient to ambulate or get out of bed. To ensure good practice and limit complications, most hospitals now have an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals in charge of central line insertion and monitoring, each checking and communicating any issues noted to the rest of the team so corrective action can occur if necessary. This universal practice has been shown to limit complications and optimize clinical outcomes for patients undergoing this procedure.
