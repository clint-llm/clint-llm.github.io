**Maternal Complications**

Preterm labor has been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, typically years after the delivery due to unclear reasons.

**Infant Complications**

Preterm labor and delivery are associated with the impaired neurodevelopmental outcome which includes impaired cognitive abilities, motor deficits, cerebral palsy, and vision and hearing losses. These risks increase with decreasing gestational age. Behavioral issues such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorders, and ADHD also associate to preterm labor.

**Neonatal Complications**

These include necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of immaturity, weak growth, and the presence ofÂ congenital anomalies.

With improved obstetric and neonatal care, the rate of complications in preterm births has decreased. With patient-specific education and follow up, the long-term sequelae and disability have improved.
