Percutaneous coronary intervention is being used extensively over the last many years. 80% of PCI is being done with stents. Over the past 20 years, short-term mortality, MI, and target vessel revascularization have shown a significant reduction in patients with PCI.

Comparing the outcomes in different trials for PCI vs. CABG and medical therapy, the following are the preferred treatments for different patient categories. SYNTAX score is a tool used to estimate the complexity of coronary lesions and helps determine the decision-making process between PCI or CABG.

**PCI vs. CABG**

- CABG is preferred in patients with two or three-vessel disease with high SYNTAX scores.

- CABG is also preferred in patients with the left main disease or one or two-vessel disease and low SYNTAX score.

- CABG has shown better outcomes with multivessel disease in patients with diabetes compared with PCI.

- LIMA to LAD graft has better survival irrespective of other grafts present.

- Studies have shown better patency of internal mammary graft compared with SVG.

**PCI vs. Medical Therapy**

- Medical therapy with high-dose statins is preferred over balloon angioplasty in patients with mild anginal symptoms.

- PCI is preferred over medical therapy if the patient has;

- Severe symptoms
- Failed medical therapy
- High-risk coronary anatomy
- Worsening LV function
