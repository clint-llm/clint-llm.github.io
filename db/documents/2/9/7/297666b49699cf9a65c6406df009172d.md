Indications regarding laparoscopic vs open pancreatectomy are relatively the same but rely heavily on the surgeon's experience and their comfort level with the technique.

**Total Pancreatectomy**

- Malignant tumors of the pancreatic head with involvement in the left pancreas

- Unable to obtain tumor-free R0 resections at the pancreatic margin

- Unable to perform pancreatic anastomosis after pancreaticoduodenectomy

- Recurrent pancreatic cancer in the remnant pancreas

- Removal of the remaining pancreas after Whipple complication (bleeding or leak)

- multifocal intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in all parts of the pancreas

- multifocal neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas with a history of  multiple endocrine neoplasias

- Hereditary pancreatic cancer or Family history (controversial)

- Intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis or multiple bouts of recurrent acute pancreatitis

**Distal Pancreatectomy**

- Benign or malignant tumors involving the body or tail of the pancreas located to the left side of the superior mesenteric vein

- Chronic pancreatitis confined to the body or tail

- Pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas

- Trauma to the distal pancreas

- Ductal disruption or stricture +/- pancreatic fistula in body or tail

**Central Pancreatectomy**

- Benign or borderline lesions located in the neck or proximal body of the pancreas

- Enucleation of the lesion unable to be performed at the neck/proximal body

- Trauma-related injury to the neck/proximal body

- Among other considerations will need a distal pancreatic tail >5 to 6 cm to make pancreatic conservation worth the risk
