- Any previous anaphylactic or serious skin reaction (for example, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxicillin or any other beta-lactam is a contraindication to amoxicillin. These reactions may have crossover sensitivity with cephalosporins or carbapenems. However, it is important to note that newer data has suggested a much lower cross-reactivity with cephalosporins and carbapenems than once suspected.

- An important consideration is determining if the patientâ€™s allergic rash is a type-I or a type-IV hypersensitivity reaction. Occasionally patients will report a childhood allergy to amoxicillin, which is, in fact, a type-IV-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, often in the setting of infectious mononucleosis; this is not a contraindication to giving repeat amoxicillin. However, a type-1 mediated hypersensitivity reaction is a contraindication given that a repeat exposure puts the patient at risk for anaphylaxis.

- Skin testing has been approved to help assist in hypersensitivity to penicillins. Reports are that the risk of an allergic reaction in a patient with a positive skin test is roughly four percent. In contrast, a negative skin test has a relatively high sensitivity in ruling out a type-I hypersensitivity reaction.
