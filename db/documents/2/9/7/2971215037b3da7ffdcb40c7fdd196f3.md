Fecal occult blood testing requires medication and dietary restrictions before testing. These restrictions decrease the risk of false-negative and false-positive results.

Avoiding certain foods for three days before FOBT should help prevent false test results.

Guaiac-based methods are prone to interference from many sources. One of these is plant peroxidases. Raw fruits and vegetables such as turnips, broccoli, horseradish, cauliflower, cantaloupe, parsnip, and red radish contain high concentrations of peroxidases.

Furthermore, gastric acid denatures peroxidase, so ingesting raw vegetables should not be problematic in patients with normal gastric acid secretion.

Ingestion of red meat can cause false-positive results due to the peroxidase activity of heme in the meat.

A data meta-analysis concluded that dietary restriction might not be necessary for guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests.

Using a povidone-iodine antiseptic solution is associated with false-positive results with guaiac-based assays.

Using such antiseptic solutions on the perianal area or during urinary catheterization should be avoided beforeÂ FOBT using guaiac methods. Drugs such as aspirin, other anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, naproxen, corticosteroids, or phenylbutazone, cancer chemotherapeutic agents, and alcohol in excess can all cause a positive reaction due to loss of blood from gastric irritation. Recent studies, however, suggest that low-dose aspirin does not affect the test.
