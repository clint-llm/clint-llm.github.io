Generally, hepatic hemangiomas are asymptomatic and found in imaging studies for other reasons, for example, laparotomy or autopsy. Hemangiomas greater than 4 cm, however, tend to cause abdominal pain and discomfort.

The most common symptoms are right upper quadrant pain, generalized abdominal pain, or abdominal fullness. If there is bleeding within the lesion, this can lead to expansion and inflammation of Glissonâ€™s capsule and lead to acute abdominal pain. When the hemangioma becomes large, symptomatology is related to compression of adjacent structures (i.e., early satiety from gastric compression).

Physical exam and laboratory testing are usually non-contributory. Rarely there will be a palpable mass or changes in the liver function tests.
