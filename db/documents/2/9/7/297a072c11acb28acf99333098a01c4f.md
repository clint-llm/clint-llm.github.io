# Continuing Education Activity

Although the basics of evaluating and treating most unknown ingestants are well known, many overdoses require very specific treatment if the patient is to have any chance of survival. Despite widespread public education, childproof containers, and other safety measures, accidental overdoses continue to occur. In the United States, poison control centers receive over 2.2 million calls each year, 47% of which concern children less than six years of age. Most pediatric accidental ingestions involve cosmetics and personal care products, followed by cleaning products, and then analgesics and prescription medications. Adult overdoses usually are due to the intentional ingestion of analgesics and sedative-hypnotics. This activity reviews the deadly single dose toxic agents and discusses the interprofessional team's role in educating families on protecting children from exposure to these agents.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the challenges of public education in regard to preventing overdoses.
- Identify the common causes of pediatric and adult overdoses.
- Describe the common interventions for single-dose agent overdoses.
- Review the interprofessional team's role in educating families on protecting children from exposure to these deadly single-dose toxic agents.

# Introduction

Although the basics of evaluating and treating most unknown ingestants are well known, many overdoses require very specific treatment if the patient is to have any chance of survival.

Despite widespread public education, childproof containers, and other safety measures, accidental overdoses continue to occur.  In the United States, poison control centers receive over 2.2 million calls each year, 47% of which concern children less than six years of age.  Most pediatric accidental ingestions involve cosmetics and personal care products, followed by cleaning products, and then analgesics and prescription medications.  Adult overdoses usually are due to the intentional ingestion of analgesics and sedative-hypnotics.

# Function

**Toxicokinetics**

- Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists: alpha-2 receptors mediate the transmission of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine & norepinephrine) across the synapse, effectively antagonizing them

- Sulfonylureas: stimulates the pancreas to increase insulin production

- Calcium channel blockers: decrease cardiac inotropy and increase vasodilation; can also block insulin secretion in the setting of overdose, which can directly affect the heart and thereby worsening shock

- Beta-blockers: direct action on the heart causing bradycardia (less severe in children); blockage of gluconeogenesis leading to hypoglycemia; central nervous system (CNS) depression (crosses blood-brain barrier due to high lipid solubility)

- Tricyclic antidepressants: block fast sodium channels, leading to intraventricular conduction delay; wide QRS and right axis deviation on EKG

- Opioids: direct suppression of CNS respiratory center leading to hypoxic respiratory failure

- Anti-diarrheals: biphasic toxicity - first anticholinergic effects and then a longer-lasting opioid effect

- Salicylates/Methyl salicylates: direct stimulation of CNS respiratory center (respiratory alkalosis) then metabolic acidosis

- Antipsychotics: block post-synaptic dopamine receptors and the reticular activating system (also some serotonin antagonism)

- Antimalarials: sodium channel blockade; QRS widening

- Antiarrhythmics: sodium channel blockade; QRS widening

- Terpenoid (camphor): topical rubefacient induces local hyperemia and warmth

- Non-alkaloid toxic lignans: interrupt cell mitosis by binding to tubulin and disrupting the microtubular network, thereby disturbing cellular protein assembly and leading to sepsis and multisystem organ failure

- Plant toxins/secondary metabolites: same as the lignan. Interrupt cell mitosis by binding to tubulin and disrupting the microtubular network, thereby disturbing cellular protein assembly and leading to sepsis and multisystem organ failure

- Oral acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: act on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors; cholinergic toxidrome

- Methylxanthines: inhibit phosphodiesterase enzymes which increase cAMP and cGMP to cause bronchodilation

- Partial opioid agonist/synthetics: direct suppression of CNS respiratory center (one lick can be enough to be toxic in a child)

- Toxic alcohols: metabolized into toxic chemicals like aldehyde, organic acids, acetone

- Caustics/household products: direct mucosal and pulmonary damage (toxicity related to pH < 3 and > 13), methemoglobinemia (methacrylic acid), cyanide (a metabolite of acrylonitrile)

**Symptoms/Physical Findings/Labs/EKG**

- Sulfonylureas: anorexia, weakness, prolonged hypoglycemia up to 18 to 24 hours, lethargy, seizure, coma, headache, confusion, irritability

- Calcium channel blockers: hyperglycemia, cardiovascular collapse, bradycardia, hypotension (verapamil and nifedipine worst)

- Beta-blockers: bradycardia and hypotension (generally not as severe in children), hypoglycemia, seizures, reflex tachycardia, 2nd- and 3rd-degree heart block, Torsades de pointes

- Tricyclic antidepressants: seizures, anticholinergic toxidrome, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, cardiac conduction abnormalities (QRS prolongation and prominent R in aVR, hypotension, CNS depression, tachycardia then torsades de pointes)

- Opioids: hypoxic respiratory failure, miosis, CNS depression

- Anti-diarrheals: initially anticholinergic toxidrome then opioid toxidrome; cardiac dysrhythmias, ataxia, irritability, hypokalemia, myopathy, neuropathy, AMS, ocular toxicity, ototoxicity

- Salicylates/methyl salicylates: nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tinnitus, CNS depression, hyperventilation, primary metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, coma

- Antimalarials: delirium, coma, dysrhythmias, seizures, prolonged QT, widened QRS, hypotension, hypoglycemia, visual disturbances (blurry, diplopia, altered color perception)

- Antiarrhythmics: nausea and vomiting, hypotension, QRS widening, heart block, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, torsades de pointes

- Terpenoid (camphor): respiratory suppression, status epilepticus, typical odor, GI distress, sense of warmth, CNS hyperactivity, then depression

- Non-alkaloid toxic lignan: GI symptoms, CNS changes (confusion, coma, delirium, hallucinations), pancytopenia

- Plant toxin/secondary metabolite: Same as lignan. GI symptoms, CNS changes (confusion, coma, delirium, hallucinations), pancytopenia

# Clinical Significance

Although there is little primary research into poisonings, there are numerous case reports and summary articles on the topic. Novel therapies are in development and testing all the time; for example, methylene blue in amlodipine overdose and “old” therapies such as ECMO are seeing more use and with greater success.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Although identification and proper management of toxic ingestions are vital skills for emergency and acute care clinicians, one cannot forget those that support our mission both before arrival and after treatment and discharge.  Caring for these complicated overdoses is a daunting task, especially for the pre-hospital personnel, as well as those providing aftercare. Numerous studies and articles are now focusing on reducing unnecessary ER visits for minor ingestions and patient safety, and proper mental health or substance abuse referrals.

Due to the complexity and risk of patients exposed to these agents, an interprofessional team approach will lead to the best outcomes. The nurse should help the clinician obtain an accurate patient and family history, including making calls as necessary to family members and pharmacists. The specialty-trained toxicology pharmacist should evaluate drug-drug interactions, select antidotes, and provide guidance for care to the team. The clinician should consult a clinical toxicologist in most cases to assist in guiding evaluation and therapy. Often a mental health counselor is involved as well. Only by working together as a team will these patients obtain the best care and chance for long-term survival. [Level 5]
