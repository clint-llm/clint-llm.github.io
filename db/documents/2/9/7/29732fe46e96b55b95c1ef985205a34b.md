**Patient-Specific AED Levels**

It is reasonable to check a single AED level while the patient is seizure-free to serve as a “benchmark” for future reference if seizure control deteriorates or symptoms suggestive of toxicity develop.

**Breakthrough Seizures**

In an epilepsy patient who has been stable over a period presenting with unprovoked breakthrough seizures, it may be worthwhile checking drug levels to guide management.

**Status Epilepticus**

The goal of management in status epilepticus is aborting the attack using a benzodiazepine followed by an AED load, often with phenytoin. Monitoring AED levels in this setting could guide further loading if clinically indicated.

**Drug Substitution**

Variation exists between different generic and brand name AEDs. Thus, guidelines recommend against switching between different generics and brands. However, monitoring AED levels can guide dose adjustments when substitution is necessary.

**Pharmacokinetics**

AED efficacy can be impacted by pregnancy, liver and renal disease, drug interactions in polypharmacy, and aging. Therefore, drug levels can help adjust the dose to achieve a seizure-free quality of life.
