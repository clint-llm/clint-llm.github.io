Although the complete mechanism of action probiotics have on the body is not fully understood, there have been certain notable findings in the past. Research has found probiotics to enhance the immune system, playing a role in both innate and adaptive immunity and increasing the overall efficiency. Furthermore, research shows that probiotics carry many anti-inflammatory effects. They act as a regulatory substance for the immune system, helping to sustain homeostasis when it comes to inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses.
