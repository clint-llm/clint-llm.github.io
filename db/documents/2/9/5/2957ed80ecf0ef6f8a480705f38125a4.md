Chronic alcohol consumption causes 17% to 25% of acute pancreatitis cases worldwide and is the second most common cause of AP after gallstones. It usually manifests in patients with over five years of ongoing, substantial alcohol use (~4-5 drinks daily) and only rarely occurs from isolated binge drinking

Chronic alcohol consumption is the single most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, resulting in ~40% to 70%Â of all cases

The dose-response relationship between alcohol use and AP and CP is linear in men but non-linear for AP in women
