The eruption of PG is polymorphic. Pruritus is the main symptom, and it may precede the manifestation of skin lesions in some cases. It may be very severe and have a significant emotional impact on the patient. The eruption can include eczematous or erythema multiforme-like lesions, erythematous urticarial plaques and papules which progress to vesicles, tense blisters and bullae in over 65% of cases. At first, the lesions erupt in the periumbilical area and subsequently spread to the abdominal region and the extremities, involving exceptionally the face or mucous membranes. The lesions may extend to the entire body. There is no mucosal involvement. The clinical aspect and the distribution of skin lesions or histological examinations (almost constantly unspecific) in the initial phase cannot distinguish pemphigoid gestationis from other pruriginous dermatoses of pregnancy especially the multi-morphe eruption of pregnancy (previously nommed Polymorphic Urticarial Papules and Plaques of Pregnancy (PUPPP)) which is the main differential diagnosis. This latter also develops in the third trimester of pregnancy and exhibit similar clinical features. In pre-bullous stage, the differentiation between the two diseases is impossible, both histopathologically and clinically. However, the direct immunofluorescence is negative in this case.
