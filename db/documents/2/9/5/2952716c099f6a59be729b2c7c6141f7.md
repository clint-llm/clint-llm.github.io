In patients who develop severe infections involving the CNS, most of the expected complications result in neurologic disability. In those who develop the neuroinvasive disease but survive, about 50% will have some form of long-lasting neurologic disability.

Retrospective studies have highlighted a wide spectrum of deficits, but the most common include persistent headaches, memory impairment, ataxia, tremor, weakness, encephalopathy, hemiplegia, or persistent ophthalmoplegia.
