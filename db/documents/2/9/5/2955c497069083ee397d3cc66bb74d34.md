Surgery usually is performed at gradient levels lower than in valvular aortic stenosis to avoid the progressive obstruction. The indications for surgery is based on expert opinion currently due to limited studies. The likelihood of progression varies with the initial gradient. The risk of progression in adult patients is considerably lower than in childhood.

Surgery is usually curative and is recommended for symptomatic disease with a measured gradient with cardiac angiography of more than 30 mmHg.

Surgical intervention has been successful in most patients with good long-term results. Ross procedure is usually performed, where the diseased aortic valve is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary valve. Sometimes the application of a Y patch and resection with end to end anastomosis have also been successful. Operative risk is higher in patients if there is associated diffuse arteriopathy and biventricular outflow obstruction. Trans-catheter stent placement is another effective alternative, or adjunctive therapy can be used in some patients, especially in those with the involvement of smaller aortic branch vessels.
