- Coprolalia is the most common of the copro phenomena.

- It is usually associated with tic disorders, in particular, Tourette syndrome.

- The distress it produces can lead to a decrease in academic performance and social isolation.

- Medications such as risperidone and aripiprazole, have been shown to improve tics, as well as habit reversal therapy and other specific behavioral treatments.

- Individuals with coprolalia may need special education services, or given classroom accommodations (leave the classroom as necessary or ignoring their tics).

- More studies and research are needed to determine the cause and management of coprolalia.
