Worldwide, drowning accounts for an estimated 360, 000 deaths annually. This represents 7% of all injury-related fatalities and is the leading cause of death among young males. It is estimated that 4, 000 fatalities occur each year in the United States. Furthermore, it is estimated that for every fatal drowning, four non-fatal drowning victims seek medical care. Fifty percent of those patients require hospital admission and interventions. There are three age-related peaks of victimsÂ which include small children (younger than 5), adolescents, and the elderly. Patients may drown in bathtubs, pools, large bodies of water or even rain-filled buckets in the yard. Risk factors for drowning include children and teenagers, residents of southern states, occurring during summer months, concomitant drug or alcohol use, and associated medical problems including dysrhythmias or epilepsy.
