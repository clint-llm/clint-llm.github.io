The specific affinity of membrane receptors on target cells determines the action of CCK and gastrin. CCK-1 and 2 are part of the class 1 G-protein-coupled receptor family. It is made up of seven transmembrane domains connected by intracellular and extracellular loops with an extracellular N-terminal and intracellular C-terminal tails. They divide these receptors into subtypes based on their affinity to CCK or gastrin. The CCK-1 receptor has an affinity 500-times higher for CCK than gastrin. The CCK2 receptor has the same affinity for CCK as it does for gastrin. CCK-1 receptor also has a very high affinity for sulfated CCK than non-sulfated CCK while CCK-2 receptor cannot differentiate between the 2. One of the extracellular loops of CCK-2 receptor contains 5 amino acids paramount to gastrin sensitivity. Loss of His207 from CCK-2 receptor leads to a loss of CCK binding. His207 is also found in the CCK-1 receptor binding site, and an exchange in this region for another amino acid and the Asp region of CCK leads to a loss or gain of affinity. Therefore, the binding sites of CCK-1 and CCK-2 receptors share some homologous regions and the Asp of CCK further demarcates the binding site of the CCK-2 receptor.
