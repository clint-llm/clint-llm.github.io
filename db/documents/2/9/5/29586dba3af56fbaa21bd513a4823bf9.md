Mutations of the ATM gene are responsible for A-T. Nonsense, frameshift, missense, and insertion-deletion mutations of the ATM gene associated with A-T have been described. In the majority of cases, mutations lead to a truncated and thus nonfunctional protein. Compound heterozygous mutations are not infrequent as well.

ATM is involved in many different molecular mechanisms.

The mechanism underlying the formations of telangiectasia remains unknown. This condition results in dilated blood vessels and is one of the hallmarks of the disorder.
