# Introduction

Lipofuscin is a pigmented, heterogenous byproduct of failed intracellular catabolism conventionally found within lysosomes or the cytosol of aging postmitotic cells. Although it is present in virtually any cell type, phenotypically proliferative cells often dilute its concentration to an insignificant level.

Lipofuscin is frequently used interchangeably with “ceroid” or “ceroid lipofuscin” as both ceroid and lipofuscin are autofluorescent intracellular accumulations of similar composition.

# Structure

Its Latin namesake translates to “dark lipid,” which is only partially correct in characterizing its variable composition.

Metals such as iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, manganese, and calcium make up only 2% of lipofuscin.

Fluorophores are another important component of lipofuscin structure. Its 400nm to 700nm fluorescence emission spectrum is a testament to its tissue-to-tissue variability.

The continuous net positive gain of intracellular lipofuscin can have a dramatic effect on the lysosomal structure. As seen in the work of Sitte and collaborators, progressive formation within fibroblast lysosomes and spillover into the cytoplasm can cause a toxic effect, hastening apoptosis.

# Function

Outside of congenital lysosomal storage disease diagnostics, lipofuscin has no traditional histological purpose or clinical value other than indicating oxidative dyshomeostasis and aging cellular machinery. For over a century its main histological utility was the identification of cellular senescence, inversely correlating with longevity.

As previously mentioned, recent discoveries have led to a greater understanding of lipofuscin’s function as a potentiator, rather than bystander, of apoptosis and intracellular dysregulation. While the exact details of lipofuscin’s effect on the cell are still hypothetical, there is agreement on several areas of research.. Sequelae include the release of toxic lipofuscin and excess iron into the cytosol, restarting the cycle as another lysosome attempts to degrade the nondegradable.

There are reports of other mechanisms of collateral damage. Cross-linked lipofuscin proteins such as 4-hydroxynonenal are very weak proteasomal substrates and limit proteasome efficacy.

# Tissue Preparation

Lipofuscin can exist in almost any tissue; therefore tissue preparation varies significantly. Extraction for analysis is the preferred method in postmitotic cells where lipofuscin is most abundant. Traditionally, organic solvent extraction or density gradient ultracentrifugation were used to isolate lipofuscin due to its high lipid content.

# Histochemistry and Cytochemistry

Due to its highly variable and polymeric nature, there are no antibodies specific for lipofuscin. Jung et al. pointed out that using non-overlapping antibodies and probes can be used to localize lipofuscin's fluorescence with other cellular structures of interest.

# Microscopy, Light

Both light and electron microscopy are viable methods to identify lipofuscin with or without histochemical or immunocytochemical staining; however, fluorescence microscopy is the gold standard for quantitative identification.

Lipofuscin granule spatial arrangement is variable, even though there may be more predictable locations per cell type. It is often free floating in the cytoplasm. With electron microscopic magnification, detailed lysosomal membranes can be easily seen surrounding the granular aggregations.

# Clinical Significance

The clinical significance of lipofuscin is yet to be fully elucidated despite its ubiquity in aging and a number of diseases. As discussed earlier, its hypothesized role in cellular degeneration via oxidative sequelae is likely widespread in many common pathologies; however, there are diseases in which lipofuscin accumulation is suspected to be a legitimate risk factor.

Congenital neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) have the strongest evidence for the implication of lipofuscin's direct role in pathology. These early onset lysosomal storage disorders cause a massive buildup of lipofuscin visible on biopsy. With NCLs such as Batten disease and Niemann-Pick C disease, inevitable and progressive accumulation leads to cell dysfunction and death at a young age.

Elderly patients often present with hyperpigmented macules and patches most frequently on their dorsal hands and other sun-exposed areas of the skin. These benign melanin and lipofuscin-rich areas are colloquially known as "age spots" or "liver spots," and have no clinical significance.

The role of lipofuscin in most other pathologies are much less defined. Age-related macular degeneration’s correlation to lipofuscin accumulation has been hypothesized but remains highly controversial. Most agree that lipofuscin accumulation inhibits phagocytosis of retinal pigment epithelial cells and that its fluorophores sensitize lysosomes to the visible light spectrum, leading to cellular instability.

Lipofuscin accumulation has been observed, but not implicated, in many other common diseases found in the clinical setting. A prominent area of investigation is underway in analyzing its presence and possible role in advancing some of the most prolific age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Its accumulation has been noted in a number of other diseases including but not limited to atherosclerosis, Niemann-Pick disease, brown bowel syndrome, pigmented cysts, dermal hyperpigmentation, as well as numerous neoplastic processes such as pancreatic tumors, non-choroidal melanomas, and mammary gland carcinomas.

While these pathologies may have a unique relationship with lipofuscin, it is important to keep in mind that the clinical significance of finding lipofuscin in a biopsy of the prototypical patient is limited outside of signifying cellular senescence or oxidative stress. Seeing that lipofuscin can potentially be in any cell type of any patient of older age, incidental finding on biopsy does not require further workup unless there is a specific indication.
