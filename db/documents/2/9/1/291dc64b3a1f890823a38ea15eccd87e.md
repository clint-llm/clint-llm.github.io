Cells that are shrunken by hypertonicity respond initially with RVI. It increases the uptake of inorganic salts and the osmotic influx of water but results in high intracellular inorganic salt concentration that can perturb cellular function and structure. To counteract this, cells activate TonEBP for the transcription of genes for aldose reductase (for sorbitol synthesis) and transporters of betaine, inositol, and taurine. This process accumulates large amounts of organic osmolytes, which provide an osmoprotective effect.

Most cells in mammals are generally not stressed by hypertonicity because of the close control of NaCl concentration in virtually all extracellular body fluids. The renal inner medulla is a striking exception.
