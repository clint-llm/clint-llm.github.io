Iron plays a central role in the maturation and proper functioning of erythrocytes. It is essential to hematologic function. Hepcidin acts as a critical regulator for serum iron levels by modulating the release of iron from intracellular storage sites. When hepcidin levels become elevated, iron remains in its intracellular storage form, bound to the molecule ferritin. Hepcidin forms a connection between the immune system and the hematologic system. The theory is that during inflammatory states, hepcidin levels increase, so that serum iron levels decrease. The decreased serum iron levels prevent the invading pathogen from using the hostâ€™s iron stores for its growth. Therefore, hepcidin is an essential mediator for immune defenses as well as hematologic functioning.
