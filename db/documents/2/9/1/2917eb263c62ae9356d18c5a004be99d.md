Congenital vertical talus needs to be differentiated from various other deformities of the foot like congenital talipes equinovarus, calcaneovalgus foot, and posterior medial bowing of the tibia. In congenital vertical talus, displacement of the talonavicular joint is directed medially and downward, whereas, in congenital vertical talus, it is directed laterally and upward. In cases of calcaneovalgus foot, a gap that is palpated between the neck of the talus and navicular bone dorsally occurs primarily due to the forefoot dorsiflexion at the midtarsal joints, vanishes on doing plantar flexion.
