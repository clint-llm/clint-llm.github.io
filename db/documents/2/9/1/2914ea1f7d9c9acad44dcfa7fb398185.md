Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a medical/hematologic emergency, and all TTP patients should be placed in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. An internist can act as the operational hub, but if an intensivist is available, they should be used for tactical level management. Organ ischemia may develop into failure, and other specialties (e.g., renal) may need to be involved.
