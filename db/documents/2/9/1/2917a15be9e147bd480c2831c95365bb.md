Many glial cells provide support for an essential nervous system function. In addition to providing support for neurons, glial cells aid in the maintenance of homeostasis, and form myelin. As a whole, glial cells are the most abundant cells in the central nervous system. The most notable glial cells include oligodendrocytes, SchwannÂ cells, astrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells. Most glial cells are capable of mitotic division.
