The primary treatment for nocardiosis is characterized by a minimum of 6 months and should extend for at least 1 month after symptoms of infection have resolved after the use of antibiotics. Skin infections in an immunocompetent patient may be managed with monotherapy. For pulmonary or disseminated disease, empiric therapy should consist of 2 to 3 agents. However, there are no therapies proven to be superior at this time. As such, antibiotics should be tailored following culture and sensitivity patterns. Potential agents to use include trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, minocycline, extended-spectrum fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin, linezolid, tigecycline, dapsone, and clarithromycin.

Sulfonamides are the first-line agents, especially sulfadiazine which has good penetrability into the brain. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also preferred by some clinicians. For severe disease, combination drug therapy is recommended

Simple abscesses require surgical incision and drainage. Brain abscesses will require surgical intervention if the mass effect is large or if there is no improvement after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy.

Close monitoring is essential for up to 1 year following cessation of antibiotics to detect relapse infection. Likewise, radiographic studies and laboratory studies should be monitored.
