Insufficient endogenous insulin leads to hyperglycemia, hyperglucagonemia, glucosuria, and without treatment, eventually ketosis, acidosis, dehydration, and death. About one-third of patients with newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetes present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) which has a mortality rate of around 0.3-0.5%, despite aggressive treatment.

The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial was the pivotal study published in 1993 documenting the clear association of chronicÂ hyperglycemia with long-term microvascular complications such retinopathy, neuropathy, and microalbuminuria (as a surrogate for nephropathy).

For the last several decades, therapies have focused on normalizing glucose while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia while at the same time monitoring for chronic complications and acknowledging the important psychosocial factors that affect a growing and developing children with a chronic disease.
