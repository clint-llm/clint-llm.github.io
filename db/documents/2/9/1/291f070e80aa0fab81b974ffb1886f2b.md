Morbidity and complications from benign orbital tumors primarily stem from their space-occupying effect. Certain vascular tumors, such as orbital varices, may cause spontaneous orbital hemorrhage. Surgical biopsy or surgical excision of orbital masses may result in orbital hemorrhage or damage toÂ vital structures.

Surgical complications vary depending on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Incomplete excision of certain orbital tumors, such as cavernous hemangiomas, may result in recurrence.
