Bone marrow failure (BMF) refers to the decreased production of one or more major hematopoietic lineages, which leads to diminished or absent hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow and attendant cytopenias. It can be divided into two categories: acquired and inherited. This activity will review the inherited forms in greater detail while briefly mentioning the acquired forms (covered more thoroughly under each specific topic). Inherited bone marrow failure (IBMF) is bone marrow failure that occurs from germline mutations passed down from parents or arising de novo. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of bone marrow failure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of bone marrow failure.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with bone marrow failure.
- Summarize the treatment options for bone marrow failure.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by bone marrow failure.
