Accessory muscle use is the activation of muscles to aid in ventilation that are generally not active. While this can be a normal finding during activities such as exercise or singing, it is an important finding in patients who are at rest. The list of accessory muscles includes, but is not limited to, the scalenes, sternocleidomastoids, internal intercostals, transversus thoracis, pectoralis major and minor, serratus anterior, serratus posterior superior and inferior, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and the muscles of the abdominal wall.

Injury to the brain, spinal cord, or phrenic nerve can paralyze the diaphragm and prevent patients from being able to breathe, thus requiring artificial ventilation.

A pneumothorax occurs when free air makes its way into the pleural cavity between the parietal and visceral pleurae. This may cause atelectasis or deflation of the affected lung. A pneumothorax can be caused by an internal insult such as a ruptured bleb or an external injury such as a broken rib or penetrating wound. Treatment may require the removal of the free air by thoracentesis/needle thoracotomy or the placement of a chest tube.
