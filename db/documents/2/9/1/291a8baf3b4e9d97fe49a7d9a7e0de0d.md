Preventing mosquito bites is the most important therapy, as it prevents not only the local skin reaction but also any mosquito born illnesses. Patients are advised to wear clothes that cover their arms and legs and to avoid the most active time for mosquitos, dusk, and dawn.

In many countries in the developing world, mosquito nets are used to protect from bites at night. In fact, “la mosquetera” is a mainstay gift of baby showers in Latin America. If nets are permethrin-treated, it increases their effectiveness; however, caution should be used in infants to avoid toxicity.

DEET (diethyltoluamide) is the most commonly recommended and studied mosquito repellant to date. It works by creating an offensive odor and foul taste barrier that discourages biting. Although it has an excellent safety protocol with proper use, care must be taken to not leave on overnight or apply to faces; this is especially important in children who are at higher risk for toxicity. Picaridin is a new repellant, with comparable efficacy to DEET, but without the unpleasant odor.

Prior to the introduction of DEET, citronella was the premier insect repellant. However, in head to head trial, it appears it only confers one hour of protection, versus the 8 hours of protection provided by DEET.

Global eradication programs including spraying of bodies of water and eliminating small pools of water are thought to have controlled mosquito-borne illnesses, especially in the United States.
