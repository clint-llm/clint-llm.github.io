Nerves of the intrinsic hand arise from the brachial plexus, a network of nerves from ventral rami between the C5 to T1 nerve roots. The nerves of the brachial plexus that supply muscles of the intrinsic hand include the median and ulnar nerve. The median nerve is composed of C5 to C8 nerve roots and enters the hand through the carpal tunnel, where it divides into a recurrent motor branch and cutaneous branch. The ulnar nerve is composed of the C8 to T1 nerve roots and enters the hand through the Guyon canal, where it divides into a superficial and deep branch.

The thenar muscle group receives innervation from the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve, a branch of the median nerve.
