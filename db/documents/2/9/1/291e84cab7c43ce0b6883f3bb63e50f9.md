The most important aspect of treatment is patient and family education in patients affected by these syndromes. Patients suffer from cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms. Patients and their families need to be educated on the importance of providing supportive and safe environments for patients who will likely have a progressive decline in functional and cognitive abilities. Referrals to social work and other supportive services should be made early to help them cope with the changing needs of the patient.
