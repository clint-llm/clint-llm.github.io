The differential diagnosis for classic Vohwinkel syndrome includes other PPKs with hearing impairment. These include Bart-Pumphrey syndrome, which presents as a non-mutilating PPK with deafness, knuckle pads, and leukonychia. Bart-Pumphrey syndrome lacks the starfish-shaped keratoses as well as the honeycomb pattern to the PPK.

The differential diagnosis for mutilating PPKs (PPKs with digital constriction bands) includes Olmsted syndrome, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome, Loricrin keratoderma, and Mal de Meleda.
