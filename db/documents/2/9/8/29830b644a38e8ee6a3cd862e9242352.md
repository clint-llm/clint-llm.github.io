When evaluating a patient with CM-II, the diagnose is primarily based on the neuroanatomy seen on imaging. There are currently no biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid, cultured tissue, or blood to confirm the diagnosis. As such, neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most important modality in evaluating patients. For patients who can not tolerate an MRI, a CT can aid in the diagnosis of CM-II. If fetal ventriculomegaly is present, the diagnosis of CM-II can be made with fetal ultrasound in some cases.

- Antenatal ultrasound – classic findings
- Lemon sign – describes the frontal bone indentation depicting a lemon
- Banana cerebellum sign – describes the cerebellum wrapping around the brain stem

- MRI - posterior fossa classic findings

- Small posterior fossa
- Brainstem appearing downward displaced
- Low-lying and elongated fourth ventricles
- Beaked tectal plate
- Inferior displaced cerebellar tonsil and vermis through the foramen magnum

- MRI - spine classic findings

- Spina bifida aperta
- Myelomeningocele
- Tethered cord

Overall, the diagnosis of CM-II requires careful evaluation if there is evidence of spinal myelomeningocele. MRI can be useful in diagnosing CM-II by showing a downward displacement of the medulla and cerebellum vermis, among other findings as described above.
