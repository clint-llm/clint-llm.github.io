The safe use of cardioplegia during cardiac surgery requires a team approach and excellent interprofessional communication. With numerous moving parts encountered during open-heart surgery and the use of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine, it is of utmost importance for physicians, perfusionists, nurses, and surgical assistance to pay close attention and speak up should an issue arise. AÂ designated heart team that practices and works together can make for improved patient safety and better patient outcomes. Close-loop feedback is used during critical times between the cardiac surgeon and perfusionist to diminish any room for error. As previously noted, cardioplegia solutions vary, and to date, there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the administration of cardioplegia during cardiac surgery. As illustrated by the 2011 ACCF/AHA Guideline for CABG Surgery, reductions in reperfusion injury or surgically induced systemic inflammatory response by way of pharmacological agents or controlled reperfusion strategies that seek to induce myocardial preconditioning have not been proven, and their benefits remain uncertain.
