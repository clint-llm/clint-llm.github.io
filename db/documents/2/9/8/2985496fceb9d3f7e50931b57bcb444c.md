Complications during and after the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)Â in general include

- Perioperative hemorrhage

- Perioperative myocardial infarction

- Renal dysfunction

- Arrhythmias

- Cerebrovascular accidents (CVA)

- Cardiac tamponade

- Respiratory tract infection

- Sternotomy wound infection

- Graft failure.

Cerebrovascular accidents are reported in about 1% of patients having IMA bypass graft and mainly determined by underlying risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, advanced age, prior CVA, aortic atherosclerosis, and peripheral arterial disease.

Although the sternal wound infection rate has significantly reduced, however, it is relatively more common in patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and advanced age.

The most common perioperative arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which can be managed with beta-blockers, amiodarone, and anticoagulation. It is associated with embolic stroke and increases perioperative mortality.
