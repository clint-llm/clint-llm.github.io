**Pharmacotherapy**

**NSAIDs**

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used by clinicians to symptomatically manage patients with myofascial pain.  These medications are available in both oral and topical formulations, although there is no scientific evidence to validate their use.

**Muscle Relaxants**

- Muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine) act on the central nervous system to reduce central pain stimulation. However, there is no scientific evidence in the literature for their use as a treatment for TPs.

**Benzodiazepines**

- Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam and diazepam have several side effects. (ataxia, cognitive decline, and depression) Although a study showed promising results of benzodiazepines in treating TPs, it was not feasible to follow such a long-term therapeutic trial because of the side effects of Benzodiazepines.

**Antidepressants**

- Antidepressant drugs (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are used for relieving myofascial pain in the presence of mood disorders. Several recent studies support the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of myofascial pain. Nortryptyline has also been successful in some studies.

**Lidocaine Patches**

- A transdermal patch of lidocaine has fewer adverse effects than a needle infiltration. One study showed that transdermal patches decreased pain at TPs. Larger studies are lacking at present.

**Botox**

- Botulinum toxin targets central and peripheral nerve endings. It blocks the release of ACh from the nerve endings and hence decreases muscle spasm at TPs. Studies on the efficacy of botulinum toxin in reducing myofascial pain are mixed.

**Non-pharmacological Modalities**

**Exercise/Physical therapy/Postural Regiments**

- Active and consistent physical exercise is an effective strategy in the treatment of myofascial pain. It improves the range of motion, mood, and pain threshold. One of the exercises prescribed for myofascial pain is stretching exercises which lengthens the myofascial compartments containing the TPs and may prevent the further appearance of other tender areas.

- A repeated load in undesirable positions predispose to muscle injury and may cause microtrauma, increasing the risk of developing myofascial pain. Hence postural rehabilitation is another strategy that can be used for this syndrome.

- All non-pharmacological measures that reduce stress (yoga, meditation, behavioral therapy, and acupuncture) help reduce muscle tone, promoting an increase in the pain threshold.

**Ultrasound**

- Ultrasound functions by applying mechanical and thermal energy to underlying connective tissue, improving circulation, elasticity, and metabolism. A few studies show the usefulness of ultrasound to decrease the pain of active TPs even though the benefits are temporary.

**Dry Needling**

- Dry needling involves the insertion of a needle directly into the trigger points, which reduces myofascial pain. It is one of the quickest ways to inactivate TPs. The use of dry needling seems promising in some studies with patients diagnosed with myofascial pain. It is thought to act on the cutaneous type A-delta fibers.

**Manipulative Therapy (OMT)**

- The manipulation of joints in the treatment of TPs has been observed to be effective, but there are no randomized studies to prove its efficacy at present.
