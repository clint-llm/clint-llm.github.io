A detailed history, along with complete physical examination, should be conducted to rule out any contraindication of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). The investigations are based around locating the stones, identifying any complication due to stones, and finding any hidden risk factor. X-ray KUB is used as an initial screening test for significant nephrolithiasis. Ultrasound KUB can detect non-calcified stones if they are bigger than 5 mm. It can also detect obstruction and hydronephrosis.

CT scan is the most sensitive test in localizing the calculi and identifying any complication. Other investigations include urinalysis, urine culture, and white blood cell count with differential to rule out infections. Coagulation profiling should be done to detect any bleeding diathesis. The patient should be educated about different treatment options available to him and the benefits and potential risks of each of them. Informed consent should be obtained before initiating the procedure. With ESWL, the key factors that require consideration and discussion with the patient include the possibility of retreatment and post-ESWL complications and their management.
