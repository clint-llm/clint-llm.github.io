Recommended monitoring includes a CBC, renal tests, and hepatic panel. These recommendations are from the American College of Rheumatology for use in rheumatoid arthritis patients who use NSAIDs chronically and who have no comorbidities nor history of complications. Monitoring is less common in patients not considered high risk for NSAID toxicity. However, NSAIDs areÂ either contraindicated, or their use requires monitoring in patients with liver or renal problems.
