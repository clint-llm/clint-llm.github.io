TMPs may have to perform a remote assessment of casualties. They should be familiar with all resources which are useful in determining a casualty’s condition remotely, including binoculars, spotting scopes, and night vision optics. The TMP must also be aware of situational variables impacting rescue or evacuation of casualties. Medical intelligence obtained should be relayed to the scene commander/team leader. The decision to attempt a rescue will be dependent on the risks versus benefits, available manpower, and the likelihood of success.

TMPs must also be able to perform an assessment of illness/injury and to provide treatment via a surrogate without the use of tactile or visual cues. In some cases, the surrogate may be the casualty and must be guided in effective self-assessment and treatment. Time is critical when addressing preventable causes of death, such as massive hemorrhage and airway compromise. The TMP must be proficient in effectively and concisely directing a surrogate to perform life-saving medical care. Effectively providing remote assessment and surrogate care is a challenging and fatigable skill.  Like all essential skills, it requires practice to attain proficiency.
