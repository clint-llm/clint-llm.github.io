Saxitoxin was issued to pilots of U-2 spy planes as an injector hidden in a silver dollar; this was depicted in the film Bridge of Spies.

An outbreak of ASP in Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 1987 resulted in 19 hospitalizations and four deaths; consumption of blue mussels containing domoic acid was determined to be the cause. In 1977, mussels and scallops harvested in the Miyagi prefecture of Japan caused outbreaks of DSP in Tokyo and Yokohama.
