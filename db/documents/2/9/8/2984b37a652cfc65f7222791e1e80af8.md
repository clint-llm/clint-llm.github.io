Contraindications to thyroid nodule FNA include:

- Bleeding diathesis

- An uncooperative patient

- Infection at the skin site of needle entry

- Results of FNA not altering management

Evaluating the patient for a past medical history of bleeding diathesis is especially important. Local post-procedural hematomas in patients with bleeding disorders can exert a mass effect on the trachea and cause significant respiratory distress.

Different studies have suggested that FNA procedures can be performed safely in patients taking antithrombotic and anticoagulant agents without the need for discontinuation.
