A thorough history and physical exam should be performed for any suspected exposure and will aid subsequent decisions. Specifically, the timing and quantity of ingestion should be identified. The clinician should evaluate for co-ingestions. The intent of overdose should be ascertained. History should also include a review of medications to identify any interactions that may lead to seizures or cardiovascular collapse.

Physical exam findings are variable; the most common symptoms described in overdose include tachycardia, seizures, and agitation. The frequency of seizure is variable in retrospective studies, from 17% to 47%.
