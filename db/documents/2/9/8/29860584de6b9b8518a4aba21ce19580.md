Any conditions that affect the cerebrum and its grey and white matter can alter its normal function. The hemispheres may develop primary brain tumors. Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant primary brain tumor that is commonly found in the cerebral hemisphere and can cross the corpus callosum. Oligodendroglioma is another primary brain tumor that commonly affects the frontal lobe. Meningioma may compress adjacent cerebral structures. Multiple sclerosis is the autoimmune and demyelination of the brain and spinal cord. Most often affects white women in their 20s and 30s and present with scanning speech, intention tremor, and nystagmus. One of the tools used diagnosed multiple sclerosis is to visualize periventricular plaque on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which represents areas of demyelination of axons.

A neurodegenerative disorder that affects the cortices results in a decrease in cognitive abilities and memory. One of the most common etiologies of dementia in the elderly population is Alzheimer disease and results from widespread cortical atrophy. The second most common origin of dementia is vascular dementia, which is caused by multiple infarcts to cortical regions. Frontotemporal dementia is due to the generation of the frontal and temporal lobe and present with personality and behavioral changes. Lewy body dementia is dementia and hallucination due to Lewy bodies located in the cortex.
