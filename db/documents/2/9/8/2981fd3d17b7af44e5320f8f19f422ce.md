Pes cavus is an orthopedic condition that manifests in both children and adults. It is defined primarily by the elevation of the longitudinal arch of the foot: a high arched foot. The cavovarus foot is the primary manifestation of cavus and results in pathological malposition of the foot, usually as a result of underlying muscular imbalances as a result of neurologic conditions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with pes cavus conditions by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pes cavus in the different populations it is likely to occur. 
- Describe the evaluation of pes cavus conditions. 
- Outline the management options available for pes cavus.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pes cavus and improve outcomes.
