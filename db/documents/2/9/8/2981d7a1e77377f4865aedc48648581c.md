Allergies have been reported for each class of local anesthetics, but crossover sensitivity does not occur. Ester local anesthetics are metabolized to a para-aminobenzoic acid-like compound, and anaphylaxis has been reported. Amide local anesthetics sometimes contain the preservative methylparaben, which has also been reported to cause severe allergic reactions.

It is essential to know which class of local anesthetic caused the reaction and avoid that class in the future. Some pathological states, including decreased cardiac output, renal pathology, severe hepatic disease, cholinesterase activity, fetal acidosis, sepsis, can alter the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of specific local anesthetics. For example, patients with depressed hepatic function may experience a prolonged duration of action or a higher risk of toxicity with amides. Patients with a cholinesterase deficiency may have prolonged effects of esters.
