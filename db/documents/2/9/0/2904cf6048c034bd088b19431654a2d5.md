Conjunctival concretions have no gender predilection. They are mostly a finding in elderly individuals, but it is not unusual to find them in younger people in the second or third decade of life, especially the ones that are secondary to chronic inflammation. In one study, researchers reported them in around 40 to 50% of the studied population. Research has found no predilection for the left or right eye, the upper or lower part of the palpebral conjunctiva.
