Actinic purpura results from the extravasation of blood into the dermis. This phenomenon is due to the skin atrophy and fragility of the blood vessels in elderly individuals, which is exacerbated by chronic sun exposure. The lesions of Actinic purpura are commonly located on sun-exposed areas, like the arms, face, and neck. Skin atrophy in dermatoporosis is due to an alteration of collagen. These collagen changes may correspond to changes in bone density similar to that seen in osteoporosis. It postulates that bone collagen also changes along with skin collagen, which leads to alteration in bone density. The pronounced skin atrophy caused by the photo-aging and ultraviolet radiation exposure makes the dermal vascular network very sensitive to the slightest trauma or any shearing force.

The formation of purple patches and macules of this condition develops due to the passage of red blood cells into the dermis results in the deposition of hemosiderin in the interstitial space. There is no infiltration of the vessels and usually no inflammatory reaction of the dermal tissue. The absence of phagocytosis results in delayed resorption of extravasated blood. This fact results in the formation of purple patches and macules of the ecchymotic aspect.
