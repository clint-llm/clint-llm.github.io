KS is the most common form of aneuploidy, which occurs when an individual has an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell. KS has an estimated prevalence of between 1:500 to 1:1000 males. KS is not always recognized before adulthood and may be diagnosed later. However, recognizing and diagnosing KS typically occurs after one or more of the items listed below come to clinical attention.

- By prenatal testing or because of genital abnormalities seen at birth in a child with hypotonia

- In an adolescent with learning or behavioral difficulties

- In an adolescent evaluated for tall stature, small testicular size, or incomplete puberty

- In adult men evaluated for infertility (3% of all men evaluated for infertility have KS)

However, up to two-thirds of cases of KS may go undiagnosed. Comparative studies suggest that KS may occur more often in the setting of increasing parental age, environmentally-derived errors in meiosis I, or decreased elective termination for prenatally diagnosed cases. Underdiagnosis is also likely due to variable phenotype, with many cases having only subtle findings. It is estimated that approximately a quarter of individuals with KS have no discernable diagnostic features by history or exam. With the increased use of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), the frequency of prenatal diagnosis is expected to increase, resulting in early diagnosis management by health care professionals who care for children.
