When a polysomnogram (PSG) is determined to be necessary, the patient should be educated on the procedures and potential outcomes of the study. Electrodes, other monitoring devices, and their uses should be clearly explained to the patient and the reasons for the monitoring in their specific case. The patient's regular sleep schedule should be identified to allow for optimum timing of the sleep period in conjunction with laboratory procedures and availability. Based on the indication of the study, patients may need to be aware of the potential for the initiation of PAP initiation, if indicated. PAP may be uncomfortable, and setting expectations can often lead to a more successful titration.

In general, patients should take their medications as prescribed the day and night of the PSG, including sleep aids. However, medication reconciliation must also be performed and recorded before a sleep study to avoid unwanted or unexpected impacts on sleep. This is particularly true if benzodiazepines or opioids are among the medications, since these medications may exacerbate sleep-disordered breathing.

Alcohol use before a sleep study can have a similar effect.
