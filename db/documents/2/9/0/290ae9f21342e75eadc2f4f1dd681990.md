Patients usually present with pain, watering, and foreign body sensation in the affected eye. However, these features may be absent in neurotrophic PEDs. There may be blurring of vision, redness, photophobia, pain with blinking, and eye movements. PED, if left untreated, can lead to corneal inflammation, infection, ulceration, scarring, melting, and even perforation due to disruption of the protective epithelial and stromal layers of the cornea.

A comprehensive history comprising duration, mechanism of trauma, prior treatment received and surgeries, associated ocular and systemic comorbidities, family history, the immune status will help arrive at an etiological diagnosis and allow more specific treatment. Distinguishing an epithelial defect from a PED can be done based on the time required for complete healing after an injury. An epithelial defect recovers by 7 to 10 days, while a PED will not heal even after two weeks, and such a patient is usually refractory to standard treatments and supportive care.
