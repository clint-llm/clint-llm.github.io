Lichen simplex chronicus is defined as a common form of chronic neurodermatitis that presents as dry, patchy areas of skin that are scaly and thick. The hypertrophic epidermis generally seen is typically the result of habitual scratching or rubbing of a specific area of the skin. The root of the disorder may be both a primary symptom, reflective of perhaps a psychological component or secondary to other cutaneous issues such as eczema or psoriasis. The development of such plaques is the result of the pruritic dermatoses that typically result from the psychological stressors. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of lichen simplex chronicus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of lichen simplex chronicus.
- Describe the presentation of lichen simplex chronicus.
- Summarize the management of lichen simplex chronicus.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by lichen simplex chronicus.
