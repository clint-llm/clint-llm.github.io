Hemorrhoidal columns are a normal part of anorectal anatomy and require treatment when they become symptomatic. The first-line treatment includes conservative management, and the patient should receive education on fiber supplementation for adequate results.

When medical management fails and the degree of prolapse advances, surgical excision is the preferred method of treatment. Success rates of removal are excellent, with low rates of recurrence. When comparing open and closed techniques, they both have similar rates of postoperative pain, need for analgesics, and complications.
