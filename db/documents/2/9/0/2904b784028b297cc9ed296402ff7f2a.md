Symptoms of uncomplicated UTIs are pain on urination (dysuria), frequent urination (frequency), inability to start the urine stream (hesitancy), sudden onset of the need to urinate (urgency), and blood in the urine (hematuria). Usually, patients with uncomplicated UTIs do not have fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or back pain, which are signs of kidney involvement or upper tract disease/pyelonephritis.

A urinary tract infection diagnosis is a combination of signs, symptoms, and urinalysis results confirmed with urine cultures. Be wary of medical literature based on the results of the urinalysis of asymptomatic patients.

Patients with spinal cord injury or those who are paralyzed may present with:

- Autonomic instability (autonomic dysreflexia) which presents with severe hypertension and headache

- Unexplained fatigue

- Fever

- Cloudly,Â foul-smelling urine (although odor and cloudy appearance are insufficient for a diagnosis without other symptoms)

- Chills

Patients with permanent indwelling Foley catheters or suprapubic tubes will sometimes tend to have vague symptoms that may include an elevated WBC count and low-grade fever. Most patients with catheters will have pyuria and elevated bacterial colony counts in the urine. This is not a true urinary tract infection (and should not be treated) unless there are systemic signs or symptoms of pain, hematuria, or other abnormal bladder activity.
