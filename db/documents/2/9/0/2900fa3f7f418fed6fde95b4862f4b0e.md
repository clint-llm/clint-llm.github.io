Management of DGS requires an interprofessional approach by a team of healthcare professionals. Obstetricians and genetic counselors can assist in diagnosis and management prenatally. Neonatologists, primary care pediatricians, family medicine physicians, immunologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, pediatricians, craniofacial surgeons, and otherÂ medical specialties may be involved in the care of patients with DGS. Collaboration with nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, speech therapists, and other healthcare professionals is paramount. Pharmacists can verify agent selection and dosing with medications to address the endocrine aspects of the disease. Nursing can counsel parents and monitor treatment progress. Psychological professionals can assist with developmental difficulties, as well as work with family members. Patients with DGS require lifelong, consistent follow-up. Because numerous organs are involved, close follow up with each specialist is necessary. Open communication and collaboration between all members of the interprofessional healthcare team are vital to ensure good outcomes. [Level 5]

Diagnosis and management can be challenging, and the interprofessional team can provide a collaborative effort to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with DGS. Current evidence regarding the management of DGS reflects level 5 evidence, and treatment options require a tailored approach around the individual patient's disease manifestations.
