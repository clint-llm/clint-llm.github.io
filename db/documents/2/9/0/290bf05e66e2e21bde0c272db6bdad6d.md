Immunocompromised patients are more susceptible to infections from Y. enterocolitica. They are also prone to developing more severe sequelae of the disease. Sequelae include sepsis and splenic and hepatic abscesses from disseminating the bacteria from the gut to these organs and the bloodstream. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis are more prone to acquiring Y. enterocolitica infections. This condition is associated with higher than normal total iron levels in the blood. Y. enterocolitica is a siderophile (iron-loving) bacteria. In fact, Y. enterocolitica is the most commonly found bacteria in contaminated units of stored packed red blood cells. Most otherwise healthy patients who contract these bacteria exhibit self-limiting gastrointestinal symptoms, but the very young, elderly, or very sick are more likely to acquire this infection and are more likely to develop symptoms. People who exhibit poor personal hygiene may also be at an increased risk of infection. Patients who have recently received a blood transfusion who develop symptoms not characteristic for transfusion reactions such as generalized malaise, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, fever, and abdominal pain should be worked up for Y. enterocolitica bacteremia. This is because of the correlation between infected stored blood products and Y. enterocolitica.
