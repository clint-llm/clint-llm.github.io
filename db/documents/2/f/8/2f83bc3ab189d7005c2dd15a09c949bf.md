While the facial nerve develops from the second pharyngeal arch, the geniculate ganglion develops mainly from the epibranchial placode. A minor portion of its neurons, however, come from neural crest cells.

The geniculate ganglion can be first identified around the 6th week of gestation and grows near to its final size around the 15th week.

Of interest, the sensory innervation provided by the geniculate ganglion appears to be necessary for the formation of taste bud cells, not only during embryogenesis but also through adult life.
