Calf injuries are quite common amongst athletes and involve the gastrocnemius, soleus, popliteal, and plantaris muscles. A gastrocnemius rupture can result in significant pain, limping, and swelling of the posterior calf as well as substantial functional impairment. Proper diagnosis of this injury from other injuries in this anatomical area of the lower leg is essential to efficient management and recovery in athletes.

The gastrocnemius is the most superficial muscle and bulky among the muscles in the back (posterior compartment) of the leg. It has two head (lateral and medial) taking origin from the two respective condyles of the femur.  Few fibers also take origin from the capsule of the knee joint. The muscle is inserted into the calcaneus bone along with muscle soleus by a common, long, and thick tendon called tendocalcaneus or Achilles tendon. Sometimes the soleus, along with the two heads of gastrocnemius, is considered as a single muscle and referred to as triceps surae.

Supplied by the tibial nerve and posterior tibial artery, this muscle is the chief plantar flexor of the ankle.
