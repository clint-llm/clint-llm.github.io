The interprofessional approach in the management of any case of hypokalemic periodic paralysis can improve patient outcomes on any inpatient floor or even outpatients. The comprehensive goals of the therapy are to identify and avoid triggering factors, treat the manifestations, treat or prevent complications, and reduce the future attacks of muscle weakness. The management involves interprofessional care that includes hospitalists, nursing staff, dieticians, geneticists. Careful identification of the triggering factors and their avoidance is essential in preventing future attacks. The careful monitoring of patients by nursing staff while in the hospital can prevent any life-threatening complications arising from hypokalemia or potassium administration during treatment. The involvement of dieticians to modify the diet can reduce future attacks from consuming large carbohydrate meals. Careful arrangements of surrounding structures inside the room can prevent secondary complications, which can occur from falls during attacks of muscle weakness. Prenatal pregnancy genetic testing can be offered to couples who have a positive family history of hypokalemic periodic paralysis if they prefer to conceive.
