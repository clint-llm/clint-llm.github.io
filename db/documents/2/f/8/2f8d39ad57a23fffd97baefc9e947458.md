The accurate measurement of LVEF is very important for managing patients with cardiovascular disease. LVEF also has a prognostic value in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with congestive heart failure, after myocardial infarction, and after revascularization.

LVEF plays an important role in assessing the severity of a decrease in the systolic function of the heart and thus is helpful in directing the management of various cardiovascular diseases.

Indications for measuring LVEF include:

- Defining the anatomy and function of the left ventricle

- Assessing global and segmental left ventricular function: qualitative and quantitative

- Assessing patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular diseases

- Identifying the category of heart failure, i.e., heart failure with preserved (HFpEF) or reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)

- Ventricular arrhythmias to assess for structural etiology

- Planned or prior exposure to potentially cardiotoxic therapy

- Evaluation before a procedure for which left ventricular systolic function may be a risk factor or contraindication

- Assessing congenital heart disease

- Assessing valvular disorders
