Wegener granulomatosis - renamed as granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a small-medium vessel necrotizing vasculitis, which is a component of a vast spectrum of disorders entitled the anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic-antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides (AAV). AAV includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA or Churg Strauss syndrome). This classification on the Modern Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitides was laid down at the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference in 2012.

The first case was described by a German medical student named Heinz Klinger in 1931. Five years later, in 1936, a German pathologist, Friedrich Wegener, described three cases of peculiar small-medium vessel vasculitis with granulomatous inflammation and identified the disorder as a distinct form of vasculitis. In 1954, Godman and Churg published a review of 22 cases, and the disease was universally known as Wegener's granulomatosis.
