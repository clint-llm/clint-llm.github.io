The absence or dysfunction of the ductus venosus can lead to various disease states, fetal anomalies, and adverse outcomes. The absence of this shunt is associated with fetal hydrops, chromosomal aberration, in utero heart failure, and portal vein absence.

Failure of this shunt to close postpartum leads to a condition called patent ductus venosus, which may lead to galactosemia, hypoxemia, hepatic dysfunction, and encephalopathy with hyperammonemia.

Rare familial cases of patients with liver disease were found to have a patent ductus venosus, which suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.

Maternal diabetes may also adversely affect flow through the ductus venosus with an increased risk for fetal macrosomia and perinatal complications.
