The talus and calcaneus appear as cartilage precursors during the eighth week of gestation, and by the ninth embryonic week, the subtalar joint starts forming, with the posterior aspect developing faster than the anterior aspect. With the fusion of three ossification centers, by the tenth week of gestation, the anterior, posterior, and medial portions of the talus form. The first ossification center fuses to create the head and body of the talus, the second fuses to develop the posterior process of the talus, and the third fuses to form the lateral process of the talus,  Around the eleventh week of gestation, marks the completion of the tarsal canal and sinus tarsi. By the 14th week, the joints in the area, as well as their surrounding joint capsule and ligamentous structures (like the inferior extensor retinaculum) fully form.
