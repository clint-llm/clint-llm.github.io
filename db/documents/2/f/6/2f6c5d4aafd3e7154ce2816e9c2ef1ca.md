Prenatal diagnosis is made by ultrasound around 18 weeks gestational age. However, it is highly dependent on ultrasound technician experience and skill. With traditional 2D ultrasound, cleft lip is more accurately detected than cleft palate. 3D ultrasound has been a significant advancement with 100% sensitivity in detecting cleft palate in a fetus that has already been diagnosed with cleft lip. Prenatal MRI is useful for further characterization of the cleft and is used when a CL/P has already been identified to evaluate for other defects, especially intracranial findings. Prenatal identification allows for parental counseling and earlier intervention.

After birth, cleft palate is easily diagnosed on examination of the neonate. Patient history will include respiratory distress and reflux during feeding. Feeding time is generally prolonged due to this with infant fatigue. Most infants will have difficulty with an adequate latch as well. On examination, there will be a visible palatal defect, except in cases of a submucosal cleft. These are felt on palpation as a midline defect in the hard palate.
