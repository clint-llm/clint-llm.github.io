There has been a proposal that insomnia is a hyperarousal disorder that could reflect a deficit in sleep homeostasis.

In the central nervous system (CNS), there is a balance between the excitatory effects of the Glutamate receptors and the inhibitory effects of the GABA receptors. In the central nervous system, GABA exerts its influence via ionotropic GABAA and GABAC receptors and metabotropic GABAB receptors.

BZs and Z-drugs act via the so-called BZ-binding site located at the interface between a- and c-subunits and thereby specifically bind to gamma-containing receptors.

Zaleplon, a pyrazolopyrimidine hypnotic, binds to the benzodiazepine type 1 site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype A (GABA-A) receptor/chloride-ion channel complex.

Zaleplon improves sleep without producing rebound effects in outpatients with insomnia.
