The Poison Prevention Packaging Act has critically impacted the procedures of providing prescriptions over the last century. This Act allows pharmacists the opportunity to discuss the proper handling of the storage of pharmaceuticals in the consumers' homes. By discussing these topics with the consumers, pharmacists will continue to protect children from potential hazards.

Simultaneously, efforts to properly provide for elders and persons with disabilities remain to provide a high-quality standard of care. The pharmacist must dispense oral prescription drugs in special packaging unless the drug is exempted or the patient or prescribing practitioner requests nonspecial packaging.Â However, in nursing homes, the staff is not required to give medication in a child-resistant container since nursing homes are an institution and are therefore exempt from the law.
