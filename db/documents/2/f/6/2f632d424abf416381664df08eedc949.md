If divided into four zones, the tibia has been used to identify deep peroneal nerve injury risk during ankle external fixator placement. Zone 1 includes where the nerve courses around the fibular neck and lies on the interosseous membrane at theÂ proximal portion of the tibia. Zone 2 includes where the nerve still lies on the interosseous membrane but remains at the posterior edge of the lateral tibia. Zone 3 includes where the nerve moves away from the membrane and lies directly in contact with the tibia. Finally, zone 4 includes where the nerve lies on the anterior portion of the distal tibia. Deep peroneal nerve injury was found to be most at risk for injury in zones 2 and 3 when placing an external fixator.
