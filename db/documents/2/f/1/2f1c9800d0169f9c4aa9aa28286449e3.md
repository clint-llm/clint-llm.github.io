**Postpartum Endometritis**

Most patients should be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, including those with moderate to severe disease, concern for sepsis, and/or patients with endometritis after a cesarean delivery. A Cochrane review on antibiotic regimens for postpartum endometritis identified IV clindamycin plus gentamicin as the most effective antibiotic regimen.

The recommended regimen is:

- Gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours (preferred) or 1.5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours or**PLUS**clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours

- If GBS-positive, or signs/symptoms fail to improve within 48 hours: **ADD**Ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours (or 2 g IV loading dose, followed by 1 g every 4-8 hours) or Ampicillin-sulbactam 3g IV every 6 hours

Daily gentamicin dosing is associated with a shorter hospitalization time compared with dosing every 8 hours and has been shown to be just as effective.

Significant clinical improvement in response to antibiotics typically occurs within 48 to 72 hours. If there is no clinical improvement within 24 hours, providers should consider adding ampicillin 2 g initially, followed by 2 g every 6 hours (or 1 g every 4-8 hours) for enhanced Enterococcus coverage. For those that do not improve within 72 hours, providers should broaden their differential diagnosis to include other infections such as pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and pelvic septic thrombophlebitis.

IV antibiotics should continue until the patient becomes afebrile for at least 24 hours in addition to improvements in the pain and leukocytosis. At this time, there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that continuing antibiotics in oral form following clinical improvement improves significant patient-oriented outcomes.

In mild cases that are identified in patients after discharge from the hospital, oral antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) may be carefully considered.

In low-resource settings where IV therapy is unavailable, oral and/or IM antibiotics may be considered. A 2015 review in Obstetrics & Gynecology identified the following 5 alternative non-IV regimens as appropriate for use in postpartum endometritis:

- Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 875 mg/125 mg PO every 12 hours

- Gentamicin 4.5 g IM every 24 hours **PLUS**clindamycin 600 mg PO every 6 hours

- Cefotetan 2 g IM every 8 hours

- Meropenum **OR**Imipenem-cilastatin 500 mg IM every 8 hours

- Amoxicillin 500 mg PO every 8 hours **PLUS**metronidazole 500 mg PO every 8 hours

**Acute Endometritis/PID**

Several different antibiotic regimens are recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Option 1:

- Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM x1

- **PLUS**doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily for 14 days

- **PLUS**metronidazole 500 mg PO twice daily for 14 days

Option 2:

- Cefoxitin 2 g IM x1

- **PLUS**probenecid 1 g PO x1

- **PLUS**doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily for 14 days

- **PLUS**metronidazole 500 mg PO twice daily for 14 days

Option 3:

- Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporins

- **PLUS**doxycycline 100 mg PO twice daily for 14 days

- **PLUS**metronidazole 500 mg PO twice daily for 14 days

Alternative regimens for patients with severe cephalosporin allergies include:

- Levofloxacin 500 mg PO once daily **PLUS**metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours

- Moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily for 14 days (preferred for M. genitalium infections)

- Azithromycin 500 mg IV once daily for 1-2 doses, followed by 250 mg PO daily for a total duration of 7 days of azithromycin therapy **PLUS**metronidazole 500 mg PO three times daily for 12-14 days

Indications for hospitalization include:

- Tuboovarian abscess

- Failure of outpatient therapy (or unable to follow or tolerate the regimen)

- Severe illness, including high fever or other "alarm features"

- Surgical emergencies cannot be excluded

If admitted to the hospital, patients should be treated with parental antibiotics until patients show signs of clinical improvement (typically within 24-48 hours), at which time they can be transitioned to an oral regimen. Recommended parental regimens include:

- Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours **OR**cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours

- **PLUS**Doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV every 12 hours

Alternative regimens:

- Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours **PLUS**doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV every 12 hours

- Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours **PLUS**gentamicin IV or IM 3-5 mg/kg every 24 hours

**Chronic Endometritis**

Chronic endometritis is typically treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 14 days.

For chronic granulomatous endometritis, antitubercular therapy is recommended with:

- Isoniazid 300 mg per day

- **PLUS**rifampicin 450-600 mg per day

- **PLUS**ethambutol 800-1200 mg per day

- **PLUS**pyrazinamide 1200-1500 mg per day
