Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a condition that has been described (rash) as early as the 15th century by a pediatrician named B. Metlinger. It has been associated with a reaction to meconium to the skin of the baby, and the name of the condition has changed several times over the years, from erythema populated to erythema dyspepsia and erythema neonatorum allergicum. In 1912, Dr. Karl Leiner, an Austrian pediatrician, named the condition erythema toxicum neonatorum and currentlyÂ this is the denomination used for these skin findings.

The eruption features small yellowish pustules and papules that are surrounded by an irregular reddish wheal. The majority of lesions are temporary, often disappearing within a few hours and reappearing elsewhere. Asides from the soles and palms, these lesions can occur on any part of the body.

The skin disorder presents within the first week of life and usually resolves within 7-14 days.
