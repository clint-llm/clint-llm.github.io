Klippel Trenaunay syndrome should be differentiated by the other overgrowth syndromes presenting as hemihypertrophy and other vascular syndromes with cutaneous lesionsÂ such as CLOVES (congenital lipomatous overgrowth vascular malformation with epidermal nevus and skeletal abnormalities); MCAP syndrome (megalencephaly-capillary malformation); DCMO (diffuse capillary malformation with overgrowth); FAO (fibro adipose overgrowth); proteus syndrome-post-natal skeletal and connective tissue overgrowth with epidermal nevi and vascular malformation; Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome characterized by hemihypertrophy, neonatal hypoglycemia, omphalocele, ear abnormalities; Maffucci syndrome-multiple enchondromas; plexiform neurofibromatosis in NF-1 presenting as localized hypertrophy.

A special distinction should be made with respect to Parkes-Weber syndrome (PWS), as KTS and PWS can be easily confused and often mistaken for the other. PWS is characterized by soft-tissue and bone hypertrophy with high-flow arteriovenous malformations and fistulas.
