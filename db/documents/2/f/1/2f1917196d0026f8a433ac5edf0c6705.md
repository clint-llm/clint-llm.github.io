The cervical spine has eight cervical spinal segments and seven vertebral bodies. Within the lumbar region, the vertebral bodies are larger than in the thoracic and cervical regions; the lumbar spine is designed for weight-bearing purposes.

The posterior horn is at the posterior aspect of the gray matter of the spinal cord. Components of the peripherally located white matter of the spinal cord are the posterior funiculus, lateral funiculus, anterior funiculus, and anterior commissure (which crosses the midline anteriorly).

Anterior spinal nerves carry motor fibers that affect motor nerves at the motor endplates of muscles. The lumbosacral enlargement is from T11 through S1 of the spinal cord. The lumbosacral enlargement gives off anterior rami of the spinal nerves, which make up the nerves of the lumbar and sacral plexus.

The central canal of the spinal cord supplies the spinal cord and spinal nerves with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and is contiguous with the ventricular system of the brain, where the CSF is produced. CSF is present in the center of the gray matter, surrounding the spinal cord, in the subarachnoid space, and surrounding the spinal nerves.

There are five lumbar vertebral bodies, five lumbar spinal nerves, and five lumbar spinal segments. The adult spinal cord terminates at the L1 or L2Â vertebral level. The terminal aspect of the spinal cord is the conus medullaris, and immediately inferior to the spinal cord is the cauda equina. The cauda equina is a cordlike structure composed of thickened and elongated nerve roots that occupy the spinal canal. The cauda equina attaches to the mid-sacral canal at approximately the level of the S2 vertebra.

Spinal nerves exit the spinal cord via the intervertebral foramen bilaterally at the lateral aspects of the vertebral column. Spinal nerves are secured by thickenings in the pia mater, forming thin ligaments called denticulate ligaments. Denticulate ligaments attach to the arachnoid and dura mater stabilizing the position of each spinal nerve root within the vertebral column.
