Scarlet fever is a blanching, papular rash, commonly described as a sandpaper rash. It is usually associated with Streptococcus pyogenes pharyngitis in school-age and adolescent children. The first-line treatment is penicillin, though a first-generation cephalosporin can be used in patients who are allergic to penicillin. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of scarlet fever and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in preventing complications in those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of scarlet fever. 
- Review the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections.
- Summarize the potential complications of untreated Streptococcus pyogenes infections.
- Outline interprofessional team sessions to practice using the "teach-back" method, which can help ensure patients know how to take antibiotics in the manner prescribed for treatment of streptococcal pyogenes infections and to ensure recognition of the importance of complying with the antibiotic regimen in order to enhance outcomes for patients with scarlet fever.
