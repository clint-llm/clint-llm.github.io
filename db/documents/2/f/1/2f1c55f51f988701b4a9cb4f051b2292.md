Preventive services have proven an essential aspect of healthcare; however, they appear consistently underutilized in the United States.

Some examples of commonly used prevention strategies are:

**Primordial:**

- Government policy: Increasing taxes on cigarettes; Decreasing advertisement of tobacco

- Built Environment: Access to safe walking paths; access to stores with healthy food options

**Primary:**

- Immunizations

- Tobacco Cessation Programs

- Needle Exchange Programs

- Micro-Nutrient Supplementation Programs

**Secondary:**

- Papanicolaou (Pap) smear for early detection of cervical cancer

- Mammography, for early detection of breast cancer

- Colonoscopies, for early detection of colon cancer

- Blood Pressure Screening

**Tertiary:**

- Occupational and physical therapy in burn patients

- Cardiac rehab in post-myocardial infarction patients

- Diabetic foot care

**Quarternary:**

The following conditions are susceptible to over-treatment:

- Radiological incidentalomas

- The use of antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction that reduced arrhythmias but increased mortality

- The use of hormone replacement therapy led to an increased number of cases of breast cancers, stroke, and thromboembolic events. It was also a failure in reducing cardiovascular mortality.

- Medically unexplained symptoms

- Functional disorders

- Bodily distress syndrome
