The most commonly reported side effects (occurring in more than 10% of adults) include headaches, fatigue, dry mouth, malaise, and constipation. Some less common effects range from central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, such as drowsiness and sedation, to local injection site reactions and pruritus.

Although typically clinically insignificant,Â EKG interval changes such as QTc elongation can be seen. These changes typically occur within 1 to 2 hours after administration, returning to baseline within 24 hours. As with any medication that causes QTc elongation, there is a concern for Torsade de Pointes and other arrhythmias.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Concurrent administration of pimozide with ondansetron should be avoided due to the risk of QTc prolongation.
