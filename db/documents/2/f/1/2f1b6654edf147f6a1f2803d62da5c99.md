- Following the resolutionÂ of the illness, all live-virus vaccinations should be delayed by 5 months.

- There have been no cases in which infected babies with resolved cases of infantile botulism have had a recurrence.

- If the baby was treated with human BIG-IV, they have a protective level of toxin-neutralizing antibody 6 months following administration.

- Any subsequent siblings of infected babies do not have an increased chance of contracting infantile botulism.

- Following discharge from the hospital, strict handwashing and special handling of soiled diapers of these babies should be practiced because they can continue to shed the toxin for weeks to months.
