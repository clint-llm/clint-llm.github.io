The majority of patients with perioral dermatitis can be managed effectively and safely by a primary clinician or a dermatologist. However, due to potential toxicity from treatments, it is important for there to be open lines of interprofessional communication between clinicians, nurses, medical assistants, and pharmacists. Patients should be encouraged to contact the office with intolerance of any topical or oral medications. As was discussed, patients may flare with discontinuation of topical steroids, possibly requiring a tapering regimen and frequent follow-up to formulate a treatment plan. Tetracycline antibiotics which are commonly used for treatment also can cause allergic reactions, gastrointestinal upset, and photosensitivity, and therefore, patients should be advised to notify the office with any concerns.
