Superior ophthalmic vein cannulation for the treatment of carotid cavernous fistula requires an interprofessional approach. A neurointerventionalist is required for the femoral access and eventual endovascular treatment of the fistula once the vein has been cannulated. An orbital surgeon is required for the surgical procedure. Trained staff are required to assist in the interventional suite, while anesthetists will be needed to monitor the patient. Nursing and clinic staff can aid in screening patients on the day of surgery to ensure that symptoms are ongoing. Pharmacists may be needed to aid with post-operative pain management, which is typically minor in this setting. This is why an interprofessional team approach care is necessary for these patients, as it leads to better outcomes. [Level 5]
