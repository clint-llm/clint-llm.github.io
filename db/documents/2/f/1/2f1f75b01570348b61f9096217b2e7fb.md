Part of what makes clonus a useful assessment is how quickly and easily it can be performed without specialized equipment or added cost. The test can be performed by nurses, medical students, the primary caregiver, or the specialist. It is commonly used to evaluate patients for which there is a concern for upper motor neuron syndrome, for instance, in patients at risk of stroke. Many types of clinicians are trained to perform clonus including nurses and physicians. The clearest way to document clonus findings is to explain what was found and how it was performed, but often, simply noting that reflexes are "4" or "5" is adequate.

If clonus is discovered on the physical exam, the nurse practitioner or primary care provider should refer the patient to a neurologist for further investigation. In addition, a pharmacist should be consulted to evaluate drugs as an underlying cause. Once the etiology is determined, and a course of action undertaken, the interprofessional team will communicate to monitor for a successful outcome. [Level V]
