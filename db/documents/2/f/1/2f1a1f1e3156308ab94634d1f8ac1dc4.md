Common adverse effects seen in patients treated with docetaxel include infusion reactions, myelosuppression, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea, and fluid retention. Infusion reactions can range from standard flushing, itching, dyspnea, and fever to potentially life-threatening anaphylactic shock and cardiorespiratory arrest.

Patients often experience skin toxicities with docetaxel use. Namely, acral erythema, characterized by tingling in the palms and soles followed by edema and tenderness, and erythrodysesthesia, where fixed solitary plaques develop on the skin adjacent to the infusion site, are the most commonly seen. Peripheral neuropathy, both sensory and motor, is arguably the most common long-term side effect of docetaxel. This neuropathy, along with fatigue and neutropenia, is often the dose-limiting factor that causes patients to defer further treatment.

Docetaxel is known to confer resistance in multiple types of solid tumors. Through the alteration of blood vessels impairing drug distribution, efflux pumps decreasing intracellular drug concentration, alterations in microtubule structure or function evading stabilization by the drug, or the upregulation of anti-apoptotic pathways, tumors eventually adapt to survive the once-lethal environment created by docetaxel. These adaptations are another treatment-limiting factor that comes into play with long-term chemotherapy administration.
