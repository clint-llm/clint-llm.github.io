Direct laryngoscopy allows visualization of the larynx. It is used during general anesthesia, for surgical procedures of the larynx, and during resuscitation. This tool is useful in multiple hospital settings, from the emergency department to the intensive care unit and the operating room. By visualizing the larynx, endotracheal intubation is facilitated. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and complications of direct laryngoscopy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures visualized during direct laryngoscopy.
- Describe the technique of direct laryngoscopy.
- Review the indications of direct laryngoscopy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination of patients undergoing direct laryngoscopy and improving outcomes.
