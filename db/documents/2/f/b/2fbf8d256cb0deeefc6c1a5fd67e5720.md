Ultrasound therapies are alternative therapies due to their low risk of complications. Low-intensity ultrasound can cause superficial burns due to prolonged exposure times. Therefore, the ultrasound wand should remain in motion when in contact with the skin. HIFU paired with MRI has the advantage of monitoring the temperatures of the tissues receiving treatment.
