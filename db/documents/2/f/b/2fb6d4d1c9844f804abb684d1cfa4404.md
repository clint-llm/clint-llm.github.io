Left renal vein occlusion is a rare disorder that is difficult to diagnose. Because of its diverse presentation and complexity in diagnosis, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists. Since NCS is uncommon, management over the recent decades has been a subject of debate, and it varies a lotÂ depending on the symptoms and age of the patient. Young patients who are in their adolescence with short periods of mild hematuria and insignificant pain can be observed without any treatment for at least 2 years as with physical development the increase in fat and fibrous tissue relieve the LRV obstruction.

The outcomes remain unknown because of the few cases and lack of controlled trials.
