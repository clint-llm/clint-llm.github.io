While a technically simple and versatile procedure, rare but serious complications can occur and the potential for complications must not be overlooked by the surgeon. Complication rates are variable and incidence has been reported in several studies between 6.7% TO 8.77%.

The most commonly encountered complications are anatomic and include nasal septal deviation resulting from an inadequate reduction of the cartilaginous septum when performing a maxillary impaction, non-union of the osteotomy gap, improper positioning of the maxilla.

Ischemic complications to include avascular necrosis are associated with large advancements, segmental osteotomies, and major anatomic irregularities. If a large advancement is anticipated consideration should be given to two jaw surgery to limit large anterior/posterior movements in a single jaw.

Damage to teeth or root amputation is another complication that may be encountered but is related to surgeon experience and failure to initiate the osteotomy apical to the roots of the teeth. Neurosensory deficits in the infraorbital nerve are frequently seen after surgery secondary to compression or retraction but typically resolve with the majority of patients regaining full sensation at 2 months and all patients regaining sensation in 6 months.
