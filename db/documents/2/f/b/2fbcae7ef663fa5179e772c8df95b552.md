Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is a protocol-based multidisciplinary initiative designed to improve various outcomes. ERAS-based protocols typically cover the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. They have led to many benefits, such as decreasing hospital length of stay, complications, readmission rates, and costs.

ERAS guidelines have been around for over a decade and exist in many surgical specialties, but recently they have come to the forefront in cardiac surgery. In 2019, the ERAS Cardiac Society (ERAS CS) released its first consensus expert review guidelines for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This is commonly referred to as the Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery (ERACS) guidelines.
