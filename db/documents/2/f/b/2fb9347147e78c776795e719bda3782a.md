Morton neuroma is best managed non-surgically with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including a podiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, sports physician, nurse practitioner, and primary care provider. The patient may require pain medications, but the key is changes in shoe wear. The nurse should encourage the patient to wear appropriate, well-padded, non-constrictive shoewear. Obese patients may benefit from weight loss, so a dietary consult is appropriate. The patient may benefit from physical therapy and the use of warm compresses and ice to ease the pain.

**Outcomes**

Most patients with Morton neuroma have a good recovery with non-surgical treatment. A few patients may require surgery if the neuroma is localized and can be excised. However, even after surgery, the recurrence rate of neuroma and/or pain is veryÂ high. The key is to change footwear and lose weight.
