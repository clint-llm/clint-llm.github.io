The evaluation of the patient with a suspected plant alkaloid toxic exposure centers on plant identification and consultation with a medical toxicologist or poison control center. Identifying the plant species based on characteristic features and consultation with a poison expert can be diagnostic. The now decommissioned Federal Drug Administration-managed PLANTOX database can be utilized for comparison.

As analytical science methods continue to advance, confirmatory DNA analysis of plant material may become more widespread. The diagnosis is generally clinical, and laboratory studies may be of limited diagnostic utility. In the case of cocaine toxicity, urine assays detect its primary metabolite, benzoylecgonine, within four hours of cocaine use and up to 10 days after use.

Laboratory evaluation should investigate possible co-ingestions, and an electrocardiogram should be performed to evaluate for dysrhythmias or conduction abnormalities. The remainder of the workup should be dictated by the history and physical examination. For patients with altered mental status, it is prudent to broaden the differential and workup to other medical causes, including but not limited to infectious or structural, as appropriate. Anticholinergic toxicity is identified based on presentation, although clinical specimens can be tested for atropine and scopolamine.
