Treatment of primary thyroid lymphoma depends on the histological subtype and staging of the tumor. Combined modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is preferred over chemotherapy alone for limited-stage DLBCL as it is associated with a higher five-year failure-free survival rate.

Obstructive symptoms usually improve within hours of chemotherapy (R- CHOP) initiation due to the steroid (prednisolone) in the regimen. Due to this rapid effect, even patients with severe airway compromise due to tracheal compression can be safely and successfully managed medically, avoiding the need for tracheostomy or thyroidectomy.
