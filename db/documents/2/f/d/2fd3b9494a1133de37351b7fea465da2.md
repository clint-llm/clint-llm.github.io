Opinions and values regarding cannabinoids in medicine vary by individual. They can range from seeing the great potential to ease suffering to believing molecules derived from cannabis have no place in modern medicine.  Regardless of personal values, healthcare providers should recognize the existence and use of cannabinoids among their patient population and consider this when deciding on treatment options. Patients should feel comfortable telling their provider if and how they use cannabinoids and the type (CBD:THC ratio). Dronabinol and nabilone are both legal throughout and are available by prescription in all 50 states.

Using cannabinoids for emetic control is best accomplished with an interprofessional healthcare team model. The primary specialties that are prescribing dronabinol and nabilone are oncology, palliative care, and infectious diseases. Oncology providers will often order simultaneous treatment with a cannabinoid alongside chemotherapy regimens.
