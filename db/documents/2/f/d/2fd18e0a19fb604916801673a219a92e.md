Water toxicity in normal circumstances is rare as there is a precise regulation of the water content in the body. However, excessive water ingestion may occur in the following conditions:

- Exercise: Drinking water after prolonged exercise repletes water without correcting electrolyte losses.

- Psychogenic polydipsia: Craving water excessively due to a persistent sensation of thirst.

- Excessive water ingestion in prison torture or water drinking competitions.

- Water repletion in conditions when the ADH levels are high, e.g., gastroenteritis causing water loss.
