Zoantharia is currently commonly found in tropical and subtropical oceans, including Hawaii, along the western American coastline from Florida to Brazil, many Atlantic islands, Japan, and Australia. They live in shallow, hard-bottomed ocean floors up to 12 meters deep; thus, ocular exposure to the water shared with these animals can correlate with PTX exposure.

Keratoconjunctivitis, or inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva, has multiple etiologies. Epidemiologic data, therefore, is dependent on the underlying cause. Due to its relative rarity in the literature, PTX-associated keratoconjunctivitis has no epidemiological studies or estimates to our knowledge.
