A high clinical suspicion is needed for diagnosing this entity. Streptobacillus moniliformis can be identified by culture. However, it is very difficult to be cultured. The specimen has to be inoculated in culture media that is devoid of Sodium Polyanethol Sulphonate which is an anticoagulant used in culture media because it inhibits the growth of the organism. Anaerobic culture bottles are suitable for the test since they do not contain Sodium Polyanethol Sulphonate.

Spirillosis cannot be cultured, and it can be only identified using dark ground microscopy or Giemsa staining techniques.
