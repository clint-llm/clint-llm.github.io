The administration of treatment requires preparatory measures to prevent problems. For alemtuzumab, preparation includes prophylaxisÂ against tumor lysis syndrome, antimicrobial prophylaxis (Pneumocystis jiroveci and Herpesviridae [HSV, CMV]), and monitoring for CMV reactivation. CNS prophylaxis currently is not advocated as bone marrow transplantation may be a serious consolidative therapy for the T-PLL patient; the lengthy process of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of siblings should be initiated as soon as possible.
