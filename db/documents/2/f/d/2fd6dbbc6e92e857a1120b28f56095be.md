The inferior alveolar nerve block is the most popular anesthetic technique dentists use in regular practice. The inferior alveolar nerve block provides temporary anesthesia sufficient for a number of surgical procedures. The technique involves the insertion of the needle in the area surrounding the mandibular foramen to deposit local anesthetic solution near the entry of the nerve into the inferior alveolar canal.

One essential anatomical structure in the insertion area is the pterygoid plexus, which is posterior and superior to the mandibular foramen. Technical failure of the inferior alveolar nerve block is mainly due to improper identification of anatomical landmarks and not because of a rare anatomical variation. The failure rate is reported to be around 15% to 20%.
