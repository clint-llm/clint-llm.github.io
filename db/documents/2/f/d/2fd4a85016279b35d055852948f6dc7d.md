The procedure is performed under general anesthesia unless contraindicated. The patient is placed in a supine position with the head fixed on a Mayfield clamp holder. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is assessed for any lateralizing lesions or ventricular asymmetry. The preferred site of insertion is the right frontal region unless indicated for a tumor cyst or if there is an anterior horn asymmetry that favors a left-sided approach. Pre-soaking the reservoir system in an antibiotic saline solution is recommended.

Image-guided Technique:Â Preoperative neuronavigation CT scan or MRI with adhesive fiducial markers is performed before surgery. Preoperative imaging is loaded into the image guidance system, followed by a delineation of entry and target points on the surgical planning software. The entry point is through the crown of a gyrus avoiding cortical vessels. The target point is directed to the ipsilateral foramen of Monro. The passive reference frame of the image guidance system is attached to the articulating arm of the Mayfield clamp holder. Fiducial registration is performed, and image-guidance accuracy is checked.
