Spontaneous abortion is the loss of pregnancy naturally before twenty weeks of gestation. Colloquially, spontaneous abortion is referred to as a ‘miscarriage’ to avoid association with induced abortion.

Early pregnancy loss takes many different forms. In missed abortion, there is asymptomatic or ‘missed’ death of the embryo or fetus without sufficient uterine contractions to push out the products of conception.

Complete abortion is defined as a ‘complete’ passage of all conception products.
