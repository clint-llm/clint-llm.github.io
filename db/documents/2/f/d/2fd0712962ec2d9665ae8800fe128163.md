RegardingÂ contact dermatitis, the first step is to avoid the causative agent. Patch testing can help identify the etiologic agent. The results of patch testing can be listed on the American Contact Dermatitis Society website, which can provide patients with a list of non-allergenic products that can be used. Treatment includes topical steroids for local reactions. Severe reactions require the use of systemic steroids. If oral steroids are ineffective, immunosuppressants such as oral cyclosporine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil a. For mild-to-moderate dermatitis, calcineurin inhibitors, pimecrolimus, and tacrolimus are options.

With photoallergy and phototoxicity, UVA radiation is usually a requirement to precipitate the reaction. The patient should avoid the etiologic agent, but if avoidance is not possible, the patient should avoid direct sunlight and tanning beds and wear protective clothing and non-allergenic sunscreen.

Barrier creams and high-lipid moisturizers can help to prevent and improve irritant contact dermatitis.
