Phthiriasis palpebrarum, caused by Pthirus pubis (sometimes written as Phthirus pubis), is an hominoxius hematophagous arthropod, an obligate parasite of human beings.Pediculus humanus corporis). Male parasites are smaller than females, and both are smaller than head lice and body lice.Pthirus pubis (ciliary phthiriasis) has a crab-like round body with thick second and third sets of legs, having large claws allowing the parasite to cling to the hair. It infests mainly pubic hair (inducing phthiriasis pubis). However, it may spread out to other hairy areas such as the abdomen, thighs, chest, axillary region, beard, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Pthirus pubis feeds on blood up to five times a day.

Infestation with Pthirus pubis occurs mainly through sexual intercourse or during interactions between an infested parent and their child. Transmission of Pthirus pubis to eyelashes may be manual from the infested body hair or during sexual contact. Indirect transmission through clothes or towels contaminated with nits is less frequent and is denied by some authors. Phthiriasis palpebrarum rarely can be misdiagnosed as blepharoconjunctivitis.Phthirus pubis and Demodex of the eyelids in a 48-year-old female.
