Hemoglobin is made of globin proteins, consisting of two alpha and two beta chains bound together by a haem ring. The number of alpha globins must precisely match the number of beta globins. If there is any form of mismatch, it impairs the ability to form normal hemoglobin.

Beta thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation of the Hb B gene located on chromosome number 11, which is responsible for beta-globin synthesis.

Heterozygotes for either type of the allele present with microcytosis clinically named beta thalassemia minor. Compound heterozygotes for two (B+) thalassemia alleles or one B+ and one B0 allele have comparatively more severe symptoms like hemolysis, anemia, iron loading, and at the time, require transfusion. They are clinically referred to as Beta Thalassemia Intermedia. And individuals with both B0 thalassemia alleles present with the most severe form of the disease with transfusion-dependent anemia termed Beta thalassemia major.

Beta thalassemia varies widely, generally depending on the ethnic population. It is most common in Africa, the Mediterranean, and Southeast Asian people.
