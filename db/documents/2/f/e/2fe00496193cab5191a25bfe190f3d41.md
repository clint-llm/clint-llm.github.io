The prognosis depends on early detection and prompt treatment of acute closed-angle glaucoma. A study conducted on 116 cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma concluded that the delay in presentation and the time taken to end the acute episode was the most important factor in determining the final outcome of these patients. High intraocular pressure was less effective in determining the long-term prognosis of this condition.
