Given its strong mineralocorticoid effect, fludrocortisone plays an essential role in the treatment of primary and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency. This drug may also be used to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is a congenital enzymatic deficiency disorder that manifests with mineralocorticoid deficiency in up to 75% of cases. Even though this corticosteroid is not approved in the pediatric population by the Food and Drug Administration for uses other than congenital adrenal hyperplasia, it is indicated off-label for adrenocortical insufficiency.

The drug received its patent in 1953 and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.
