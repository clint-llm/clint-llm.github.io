Rocuronium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker widely used to produce muscle relaxation to help facilitate surgery and ventilation of the lungs in elective and emergent situations. It is one of the many non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers used but has the distinct advantage of being fast-acting and reversible. The major indications for its use are:

- Provide airway muscle paralysis to facilitate endotracheal intubation in elective as well as emergent conditions

- Provide surgical paralysis to facilitate surgery

- Provide chest wall relaxation to facilitate mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients who are under adequate sedation

- Provide a defasciculating dose to prevent fasciculations during depolarizing muscle paralysis to prevent myalgias. (off-label)

- Prevent shivering in patients post cardiac resuscitation after the return of spontaneous circulation during therapeutic hypothermia (off-label)

It is vital to ensure that the patients who receive a muscle relaxant like rocuronium are adequately sedated to prevent the risk of awareness. A patient can be paralyzed but awake and cannot show the motor signs of awareness.
