Catecholamines are involved in a multitude of physiologic processes and pathology. The following are a few of many examples where knowledge of the degradation pathways has clinical significance.

Parkinson disease is associated with insufficient dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway. When pharmacological therapy is necessary, one option is a class of drugs called MAO-B inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the initial step of dopamine degradation and increase dopamine levels in the extracellular space. An additional class of drugs, sometimes used with exogenous dopamine therapy, is COMT inhibitors. Similarly, these drugs decrease the rate of dopamine degradation.

Schizophrenia, as opposed to Parkinson disease, is associated with excess dopamine. The primary treatment is with D2 receptor blockers. A medication formerly used in treatment was reserpine. This agent blocked the storage of produced catecholamines into vesicles, thereby increasing the rate of intracellular degradation. This drug is no longer used for this purpose because of a significant side-effect profile, especially with older individuals.

Pheochromocytomas are adrenal medullary tumors associated with the production of large amounts of catecholamines. They can manifest as episodes of tachycardia, hypertension, and headache. The diagnosis of pheochromocytomas and other catecholamine-producing tumors requires detecting metabolites HVA and VMA in the plasma and urine.
