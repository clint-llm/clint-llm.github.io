Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most commonly diagnosed gastrointestinal diseases. IBS, in the absence of any other causative disease, is defined as the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort with altered bowel habits. Diagnosis of IBS has evolved since its first discovery, and today the Rome IV diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose IBS. Depending on the subclass of IBS, symptoms can be managed by a variety of medications and nonpharmaceutical agents. Nonetheless, IBS treatment should be individualized, and a significant factor in management remains a strong patient-physician relationship.
