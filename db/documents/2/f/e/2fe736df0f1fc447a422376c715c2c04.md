Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as an important regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Increased activity is associated with higher LDL cholesterol levels, while certain gain of function mutations cause autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia with very high cholesterol levels, premature atherosclerotic vascular disease, and the development of tendon xanthomas.

**Normal Cholesterol Metabolism**

LDL cholesterol is normally cleared from the circulation as apoprotein B100 on the surface of LDL binds to LDL receptors on hepatic and extrahepatic tissues. LDL bound to its receptors undergoes a process of endocytosis. The endocytic vesicle fuses with lysosomes, increasing the intracellular concentration of free cholesterol. As the intracellular concentration of cholesterol increases, three events occur.

- Decrease activity of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis

- Activation of ACAT, an enzyme that increases the storage of cholesterol as a cholesterol ester

- Reduced expression of LDL receptors on the cell surface

In this highly integrated system, as the cell takes up more cholesterol by this normal LDL-receptor pathway, de novo production of cholesterol decreases, and less is taken up by the LDL receptors. When LDL levels are particularly high or undergo modification, such as glycation or oxidation, they are more apt to be taken up by the scavenger pathway on endothelial cells, leading to the development of atherosclerotic plaques and vascular disease.

An important concept to recognize is that LDL receptors continually recycle back to the cell surface, where they can bind and clear more LDL cholesterol. PCSK9, a product of hepatocytes, is secreted into the plasma, where it binds to the LDL receptors facilitating lysosomal degradation of LDL receptors. Thus, PCSK9 reduces the expression of LDL receptors on the cell membrane, thereby decreasing the clearance of LDL cholesterol.

Statins decrease HMG-CoA reductase activity, reducing cholesterol synthesis. Reduced intracellular cholesterol leads to increased recycling and the expression of LDL receptors on the cell surface. This, in turn, allows for increased clearance of LDL cholesterol by this non-atherogenic receptor-mediated pathway, leaving less LDL to be taken up by the scavenger pathway. However, statins also increase the activity of PCSK9. While statins effectively decrease cholesterol levels, their efficacy is diminished by this increase in PCSK9 activity.

**PCSK9**

Familial hypercholesterolemia is characterized by extremely high total and LDL cholesterol levels, premature vascular disease, and tendon xanthomas. In most cases, it is due to a genetic mutation of the LDL receptor, rarely a mutation of the apoprotein B100 gene. In 2003, researchers found a family in France with the familial hypercholesterolemia phenotype without an identifiable mutation of the LDL receptor or apoprotein B100.

Understanding these basic principles of cholesterol metabolism led to the hypothesis that measures to reduce PCSK9 activity would lower LDL cholesterol levels and possibly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Three pharmaceutical products are available in the United States that reduce PCSK9 activity: alirocumab, evolocumab, and inclisiran. Alirocumab and evolocumab are fully-humanized monoclonal antibodies injected subcutaneously at intervals of every 2 to 4 weeks that are highly effective in lowering total and LDL cholesterol. Whether used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, they typically reduce LDL cholesterol levels by 50% to 60%. The effect is sustained as long as treatment continues.
