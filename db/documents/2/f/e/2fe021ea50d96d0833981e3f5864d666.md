The most common condition of filariasis is a hydrocele.

Additional manifestations include:

Filariatic fever - manifests with lymphangitis and lymphadenitis with nonspecific symptoms including headache, fever, chills, and general malaise.

Filarial abscess - may form causing localized swelling and pain until rupture, which results in the discharge of dead adult worms. Granulomatous reactions can lead to lumps in subcutaneous tissues.

Acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADL) - repeated bouts of lymphangitis causing lymphedema.

Lymphedema - graded based on the extent of the condition

- Grade I: Extremity pitting edema, reversible

- Grade II: Extremity pitting or nonpitting edema, nonreversible

- Grade II: Nonpitting, nonreversible edema, with skin thickening

- Grade IV: Nonpitting, nonreversible, thickened and nodular appearance of the skin, classified as elephantiasis.

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia - an immune response to filarial infection. It causes pulmonary restrictive lung disease, wheezing, shortness of breath, and eosinophilia.
