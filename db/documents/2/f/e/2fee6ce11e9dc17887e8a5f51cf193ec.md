Given the relative rarity of tibial neuropathy, more common causes of foot numbness, tingling, and pain should always be considered.

Polyneuropathies from diabetes, alcohol use, or autoimmune causes must be ruled out. Frequently, an initial presentation of polyneuropathy is incorrectly diagnosed as tibial neuropathy due to the similarity of the symptoms. Lumbosacral radiculopathy can present similarly to tibial neuropathy, particularly in the L5 and S1 distributions. Sciatic nerve impingement or piriformis syndrome can also cause similar symptoms with more involvement of the proximal lower extremity muscles. Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of plantar foot pain that should be excluded, as it can present similarly to tibial neuropathy.

Morton neuroma can cause pain under the metatarsal bones, which is burning or tingling, similar to a tibial neuropathy. Neurogenic or vascular claudication may also present with foot pain.
