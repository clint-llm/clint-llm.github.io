Granular cell tumors were described as early as 1926 by the Russian pathologist Abrikossoff. They were initially coined granular cell myoblastomas, as they were believed to be of muscular origin. With the advent of immunohistochemical stains and electron microscopy, they are now believed to be Schwannian derivation.

These rare tumors are most commonly reported in the skin, oral cavity, digestive tract, and subcutaneous tissue. However, they can occur anywhere in the body, including breast, bladder, nervous system, respiratory and genitourinary tracts. All age groups and genders can be affected, but it is classically found in women in their 4th to 6th decades of life.

The vast majority behave indolently. Based on histologic criteria or the presence of metastasis, however, 1% to 2% of these lesions can be malignant, with poor prognosis and few curative options beyond surgical excision.
