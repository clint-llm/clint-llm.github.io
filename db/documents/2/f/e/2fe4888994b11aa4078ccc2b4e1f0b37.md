For several reasons, olfactory testing is of clinical significance.

In contrast, diseases of the brain which affect olfaction, such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease, negatively impact performance on suprathreshold tests while the odor threshold is normal. Thus, besides history and a physical exam, olfactory testing can be fundamental in making a diagnosis and therefore leads to proper treatment. Finally, olfactory testing is easy to do.
