A thorough history and physical exam guide a provider on the diagnostic workup for dizziness symptoms.

If there is clinical concern for a central neurologic cause for symptoms, a patient should undergo a non-contrast head CT, CTAs of the head and neck, and an MRI of the head. Additionally, they may benefit from an Echocardiogram with bubble study and carotid doppler ultrasounds to complete a stroke workup. An Echocardiogram is also of great value when evaluating a cardiovascular etiology. Often a patient may require very specialized testing and imaging when the history and physical exam directs the healthcare provider towards a specific diagnosis (i.e., superior canal dehiscence and high-resolution temporal bone CT imaging; vestibular neuritis and gadolinium contrast MRI).
