Atopic dermatitis patients have a defective skin barrier that is susceptible to xerosis and environmental irritants and allergens that lead to inflammation, pruritus, and the classic clinical findings of atopic dermatitis. The barrier defect may be caused in part by decreased levels of ceramides, which are sphingolipids in the stratum corneum which play a role in the skin's barrier function and prevent transepidermal water loss. The defective skin barrier allows irritants and allergens to penetrate the skin and cause inflammation via an overactive Th2 response (with increased IL-4, IL-5 cytokines) in acute lesions and Th1 response (with IFN-gamma and IL-12) in chronic lesions. Scratching of the skin also stimulates keratinocytes to release inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6. Decreased anti-microbial peptides (human beta-defensins, cathelicidins) in the epidermis of atopic patients also contribute to Staphylococcus aureus colonization seen in more than 90% of atopic dermatitis patients. S. aureus may worsen the inflammation of atopic dermatitis lesions and lead to secondary infection and impetiginization.

In AD, there is significant water loss across the epidermis, but why there is dysregulation of the epithelial barrier is not fully understood. It is believed that filaggrin, which is critical for epithelial integrity, may be dysfunctional.
