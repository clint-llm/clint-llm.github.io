Since adrenal crises affect many organs and have a high mortality rate, the disorder should be managed by an interprofessional team inside the ICU. This team should include an intensivist and an endocrinologist. Other important members of the team include an ICU nurse and a pharmacist. ICU nurses must monitor vitals, urine output, and hemodynamics continuously. The education of the patients about the disease and its potential complications along with discussion about sick day rules is of significant importance in the prevention of adrenal crisis
