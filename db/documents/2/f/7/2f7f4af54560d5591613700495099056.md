The use of IVIG has expanded significantly over the past three decades. In general, the management of patients with immune deficits is best with an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, hematology nurses, and pharmacists. While IVIG is effective, patients need to understand that the therapy is not benign and is associated with adverse effects. Close monitoring of patients is necessary because of allergies, anaphylaxis, and graft versus host reactions. Given the potential for adverse events with immunotherapy, the entire team must be vigilant for these reactions. The pharmacist must have close involvement with nursing and the clinician staff, with all members of the interprofessional team informed and communicating regarding the adverse event profile, so immunotherapy has the best chance to help the patient with minimal chance for deleterious effects.
