Diuretic toxicity can present in the form of electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia), acid/base disturbances (hypochloremic alkalosis), and dehydration secondary to excessive diuresis. Care is necessary to check electrolytes while the patient is on a diuretic periodically. Treatment would include rehydration, correction of the acid/base disturbance, and electrolyte replacement. If hypotension is unresolved, pressure support may be necessary.
