Injury may occur when batteries are swallowed or aspirated. Most batteries pass through the GI tract without incident. Damage occurs when disk batteries become lodged in the nasopharynx, oropharynx, trachea, esophagus, or GI tract and lead to local injury, ulceration, perforation, or fistula formation. Damage may be acute but is often delayed, and long-term sequelae may occur days to weeks after injury and initial treatment.
