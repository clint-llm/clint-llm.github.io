The primary way to make aÂ diagnosis is with a full-thickness biopsy of the nail bed. A recent study by Reilly et al., published in December 2017, demonstrated that there could be a large disparity between the tumor thickness on initial biopsy versus the final tumor thickness. This point highlights the importance of having a good quality biopsy to make the initial histological assessment followed up with a management plan.

A nail bed biopsy should be performed using a digital nerve block. A tourniquet is useful for hemostasis, but the digit should not be exsanguinated in malignancy. The nail plate should be carefully removed using a periosteal elevator. To visualize the germinal matrix, two radial incisions can be made at 45 degrees on either side of the eponychial fold. A full-thickness biopsy should then be taken of the pigmented area. Ideally, this should be an excisional biopsy if possible. The defect is then repaired using an absorbable suture, and the nail is replaced in the eponychial fold.

Following the excisional biopsy of the pigmented lesion in the nail bed, a further management plan can be made based on the histological report. The report will detail the subtype of malignant melanoma, the Breslow thickness, and other histological characteristics.
