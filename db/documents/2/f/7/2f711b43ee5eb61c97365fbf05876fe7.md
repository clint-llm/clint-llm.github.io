The etiology of primary osteoarthritis is poorly understood and involves both genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetics was found to contribute to the development of OA by 30% to 65%.Â Age is the strongest risk factor for OA and is believed to be linked to a decreased adaptability of the joint to resist biomechanical injury, sarcopenia, and increased bone turnover. Female gender is associated with a higher prevalence of OA due to gender differences in joint alignment, ligament strength, pregnancy, and bone density. Menopause, in particular, is associated with an increased risk of OA, suggesting a role of estrogen in OA development and pain sensitization. Anatomical factors, including joint malalignment or congenital deformities, can lead to biomechanical injury, increasing the susceptibility of developing OA. Modifiable environmental factors play a major role in the development of OA. This includes occupations requiring repetitive movements and obesity, metabolic syndrome, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, muscle weakness, and low bone density.
