**Limitations to the AGS Beers Criteria®**

The AGS Beers Criteria® complements clinical judgment and decision-making and should not be used independently to add or remove medications for patients. Treatment should be individualized, understanding that patients are complex and conditions differ between individuals**.**

The AGS Beers Criteria® does not always apply to hospitalized and palliative care patients. Risk-benefit ratios vary in these settings, and there are innumerable scenarios to consider.

Finally, the AGS Beers Criteria® was validated using evidence from the United States and is not necessarily applicable in all countries.
