The widespread use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) was a significant milestone in the development of anesthesia. Before the introduction of NMBA, anesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous and inhalational agents. The introduction of NMBA led to a significant conceptual change in the practice of anesthesia. Anesthesia was redefined to include a triad of narcosis, analgesia, and muscle relaxation. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of NMBAs, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes in anesthesia and other conditions where NMBA have therapeutic benefit.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action and administration NMBAs.
- Summarize when the use of a NMBA is indicated.
- Review the adverse effect profile and contraindications of NMBA use.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with NMBAs.
