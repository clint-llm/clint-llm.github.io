Although follicular adenomas are mostly sporadic, multiple other etiological factors have been identified

- Iodine deficiency: This is a known risk factor seen in individuals consuming non-iodized sea salt regularly.

- Genetic alterations: PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) includes several syndromes like Cowden syndrome and BRRS. Multiple follicular adenomas may occur along with other clinical manifestations. PTHS is due to mutations causing inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. Other genetic mutations in BRAF, NRAS, RET, and KRAS can also cause unexplained follicular adenomas. Follicular adenomas are also part of various syndromes like Familial adenomatous polyposis(FAP), Carney Complex syndrome. Genetic rearrangement of the PAX8-PPAR gene causes loss of follicular growth inhibition, thus facilitating the development of follicular neoplasms.

- Prior I-131 radiation exposure also increases the risk of malignant lesions of the thyroid.
