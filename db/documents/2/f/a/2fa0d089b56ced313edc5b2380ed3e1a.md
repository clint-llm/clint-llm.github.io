Before 1880, ophthalmia neonatorum due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae was the most common cause of neonatal blindness. Early detection and timely treatment of infected mothers are essential elements to prevent permanent ocular damage. If left untreated or partially treated, corneal ulceration, perforation, and blindness can occur. Approximately 10000 cases of blindness per year are secondary to ophthalmia neonatorum worldwide. Fortunately, in most cases, neonatal ophthalmia neonatorum caused by non-gonococcal bacteria is a mild disease and has a good prognosis; however, up to 50% of babies born to mothers with chlamydia infection may develop neonatal conjunctivitis, and from those, between 10% to 20% are at risk to having pneumonia. Chemical conjunctivitis secondary to silver nitrate is self-limiting.
