A multidisciplinary approach is required to manage pancreatic fistulas. The team can consist of surgeons, nutritionists, primary care doctors, wound care nurses, interventional radiologists, and interventional gastroenterologists. Appropriate communications and coordination must occur between this group of individuals when treating patients with a pancreatic fistula of different degrees.

Regardless of the complexity of the pancreatic fistula, the patient’s nutritional status needs to be adequate, and the replacement of fluids and electrolytes should be a priority. There should be a discussion with the patient with regards to methods of fulfilling any nutritional deficiency, such as with total parenteral nutrition or enteral feeding. Any surrounding skin wound or irritation near the fistula site should be nursed with the help of a wound care nurse.

Once the patient and the fistula are optimized and stabilized, a definitive treatment plan can be performed from the specialists, non-operatively, or operatively. This multidisciplinary approach can give patients the best chance to achieve great outcomes and avoid complications.
