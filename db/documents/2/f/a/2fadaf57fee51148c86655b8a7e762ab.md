Depending on the size of the melanoma, various treatment modalities can be used. For uveal melanoma, options include the following:

- Plaque radiation therapy

- Particle beam radiotherapy

- Transpupillary thermotherapy

- Laser photocoagulation

- Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery

- Local surgical resection

- Enucleation

Advances aimed at vision and eye preservation have been made with techniques such as transretinal endoresection and transscleral resection.

Studies show that there may be 0% to 15% response rates from using chemotherapeutic agents as used in cutaneous melanoma. Chemotherapy agents that have been used are dacarbazine, temozolomide, cisplatin, treosulfan, and fotemustine.

Iris melanomas can be usually treated with surgical resection. Larger iris melanomas that are not able to be surgically resected will be treated with plaque therapy or enucleation.

Small and medium-sized choroidal tumors are mostly treated by radiation therapy, while larger advanced tumors are treated by enucleation or orbital exenteration when there is spread into the orbit.

Effective treatment regimens for conjunctival melanoma include local excision with adjuvant chemotherapy (mitomycin).
