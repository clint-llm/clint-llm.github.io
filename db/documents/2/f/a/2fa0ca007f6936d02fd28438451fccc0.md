A patient with sinus bradycardia should be evaluated for hemodynamic instability. If found to be hemodynamically unstable, the patient can be treated with intravenous (IV) atropine 0.5 mg push every 3 to 5 minutes up to 3 mg total. If the patient's symptoms and heart rate do not improve, the patient is a candidate for a temporary pacemaker. If the patient on arrival is hemodynamically stable but has signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, they should be treated for an acute myocardial infarction appropriately.

Hypothermic patients should be warmed to normothermia before making definitive decisions on treatment.

While management decisions are being made for a patient with sinus bradycardia, the patient's medication list should also be reviewed for possible causes of bradycardia, and those medications should be withdrawn if possible. If a patient has comorbid conditions that require him to be on certain medications, which may be causing the sinus bradycardia, then in that case-patient may be a candidate for a permanent pacemaker. In cases where medication can be withdrawn, withdrawal is made, and if symptoms and heart rate still do not improve, then the patient may be evaluated for a permanent pacemaker.
