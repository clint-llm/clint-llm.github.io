The etiology seems multifactorial, and various theories have been proposed.

- Genetic and familial factors- These factors are more common in the anterior and middle forms of hypospadias.

- Hormonal factors- As hypospadias sometimes can be associated with cryptorchidism and micropenis, hormonal factors, particularly the imbalance between androgen and estrogen, are thought to play a major role in abnormal development of the urethra and the foreskin.

- Environmental factors- Animal studies identified a few “environmental-endocrine disruptors,” causing hypospadias.

- Maternal factors- Maternal hypertension, oligohydramnios, preterm delivery, and monochorionic twinning all are associated with severe hypospadias.
