The administration of antibiotics, chemotherapeutic drugs, or immunosuppressive therapy disrupts the normal colonic biome, which allows for C. difficile colonization. C. difficile induces colitis via exotoxin production, toxin A, and toxin B. These toxins generate inflammation, colonic cell cytoskeleton disruption, and cellular death. The pseudomembranes of pseudomembranous colitis form as these toxins pathologically hyperstimulate the native immune system by drawing neutrophils to invade the colonic mucosa.
