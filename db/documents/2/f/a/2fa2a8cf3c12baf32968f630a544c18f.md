The differential diagnosis for a heart located on the right side of the thoracic cavity is very narrow. However, dextrocardia must be differentiated from:

- Cardiac dextroposition: The heart is displaced to the right side as a result of extracardiac causes, such as a diaphragmatic hernia, right pneumonectomy, or right lung hypoplasia.

- Kartagener syndrome: Dextrocardia situs inversus is accompanied by primary ciliary dyskinesia.

- Dextroversion: The heart is abnormally positioned to the right and rotated.

- Transposition of the great vessels (TGA): The major vessels of the heart connect in reverse with a reversal of the heart chambers.

- Heterotaxy: Mirrored internal organs do not develop or function properly.

- Endocardial cushion defect
