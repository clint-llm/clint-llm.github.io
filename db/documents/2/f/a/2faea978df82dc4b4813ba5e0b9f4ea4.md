Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast represents neoplastic lesions, typically localized to the breast ducts with no evidence of invasion into the surrounding tissue. The diagnosis of DCIS has significantly increased in the recent past since the implementation of routine screening mammograms. Therapeutic approaches include surgery, radiation therapy, and adjuvant endocrine therapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of DCIS and highlights the healthcare team's role in managing patients with DCIS.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of ductal carcinoma in situ.
- Summarize the evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ.
- Identify the management options available for ductal carcinoma in situ.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that can improve outcomes for patients who require ductal carcinoma in situ.
