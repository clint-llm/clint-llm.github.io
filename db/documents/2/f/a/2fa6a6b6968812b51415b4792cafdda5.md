The pathophysiology of MI involves the rupture of a coronary artery plaque, thrombosis, and blockage of the downstream perfusion leading to myocardial ischemia then necrosis. The culprit vessel in most patients is the right coronary artery that then feeds the posterior descending artery. This anatomy is said to be right dominant. A minority of patients have left dominate anatomy with the posterior coronary artery supplied from the circumflex artery.  The most common ECG finding with inferior wall MI is ST elevation in ECG leads II, III and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in lead aVL.  The right coronary artery perfuses the AV node, so there are associated bradycardias, heart blocks and arrhythmias associated with inferior wall MIs.
