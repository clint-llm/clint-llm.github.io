Patient education plays a vital role in the treatment of Berrett's esophagus. In addition to compliance with reflux therapy, they must be educated on the importance of lifestyle changes to prevent its progression to severe disease. Smoking cessation, alcohol avoidance, and weight loss therapy are essential changes that the patient must adapt to improve their outcome. Although multiple sources advise specific dietary changes, none have been linked to improved symptoms or prognosis. Most important in regards to dietary modification is the reduction in portion size. Limiting portion size, avoiding eating 3 hours before sleeping, and reducing weight have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in Barrett's metaplasia.
