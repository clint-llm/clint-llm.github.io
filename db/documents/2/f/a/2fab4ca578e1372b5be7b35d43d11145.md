Atypical ductal hyperplasia, due to its lack of imaging findings, is, by definition, an incidental pathology finding. Most frequently, this is found on core needle biopsy; however, it can also be discovered on excisional biopsies, breast oncologic surgeries, cosmetic breast reductions, or any other breast surgery resulting in submitting breast tissue to pathology. The prevalence of atypical ductal hyperplasia in biopsies has been in the 3.5 to 5% range and most frequently found on core needle biopsy.

Rates of ADH in a large study from 2009 reviewing nearly 31,000 biopsies demonstrated initially increasing rate of diagnosis with the increase in breast cancer awareness, screening mammographies, prophylactic mastectomies, and use of post-menopausal hormonal therapy - resulting in peak diagnosis of ADH in 1999 (5.5 cases per 10,000 mamograms). Since the loss of favor of post-menopausal hormonal therapy, however, there has been a slight decrease in the diagnosis of ADH over time.

Typical patients are females in their fifth to sixth decade of life, as this is the population most likely to be undergoing breast biopsies. Males are also susceptible to atypical ductal hyperplasia, although diagnosis is less common. One Dutch study analyzing over 5,000 cases of excised breast tissue for gynecomastia in males found a prevalence of 0.4% of atypical ductal hyperplasia.
