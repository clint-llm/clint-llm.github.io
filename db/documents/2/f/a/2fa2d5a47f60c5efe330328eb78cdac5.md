As mentioned previously, there is no consensus on the definition of lumbar spinal stenosis diagnostic criteria. However, in evaluating low back pain, neuroimaging is indicated when there are new-onset symptoms and suspicion of lumbosacral radiculopathy or spinal stenosis. In patients without suspicion of infection, metastasis, or postoperative spine symptoms, non-contrast MRI of the lumbosacral spine is the modality of choice for lumbar spinal stenosis, and CT myelography is an option when MRI is contraindicated.

Electromyography and nerve conduction studies (EMG) are also used to aid the diagnosis of diagnosis, as this distinguishes polyneuropathy, radiculopathy, or other peripheral nerve disorders from lumbar spinal stenosis.
