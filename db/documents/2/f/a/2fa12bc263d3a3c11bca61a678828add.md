Identifying risk factors and performing a thorough assessment before transferring a temporoparietal fascial flap is imperative. The patient should be evaluated by a surgeon experienced in reconstructive surgery using the TPFF. If necessary, the patient should see a primary care provider for medical optimization in anticipation of general anesthesia. Lastly, the patient should be monitored by the preoperative, operative, and postoperative specialty nurses to assist with the coordination of care and education.

An interprofessional team consisting of an experienced surgeon, anesthesiologist, surgical assistant, and operative nurse should perform the TPFF transfer to optimize outcomes. Close follow-up should monitor the patient for potential complications: flap necrosis, alopecia, wound breakdown, hematoma, and facial paralysis. Team members should counsel the patient regarding appropriate wound care and postoperative activity level. [Level 5]
