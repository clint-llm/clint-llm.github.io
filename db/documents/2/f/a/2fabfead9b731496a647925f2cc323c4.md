The Ovary is an oval-shaped organ about the size of an almond. It is organized into germ cells (i.e. oocytes) and somatic cells (i.e. granulosa, theca, and stromal cells) that work together to develop dominant mature follicles that can be released through ovulation for possible fertilization. The actions of the ovary are regulated primarily by FSH and LH hormones produced by the Anterior Pituitary gland as previously mentioned. Those hormones act as ligands to two receptor types found on somatic cells. The actions of these cells propagate the development of the adjacent germ cells to mature by providing an estrogen-rich environment.

- **Germ Cells**:
- An **oocyte**is the germ cell within the ovary that progresses through a series of maturation steps.
- Primordial follicles are immature germ cells or primary follicles arrested in Prophase I of Meiosis.
- The onset of pubescence enables the completion of primordial follicles into primary oocytes through a process called folliculogenesis.
- Primary oocytes have a single layer of granulosa cells surrounding them. When the theca cell layer develops adjacent to the granulosa cells, the primary follicle develops into a secondary follicle.
- A mature (Graafian) follicle is characterized by the development of a liquid-filled cavity called the Antrum. Immediately prior to ovulation, the Graafian follicle begins Meiosis II and arrests at Metaphase II. This process is only completed if the oocyte is fertilized.

- **Somatic Cells:**
- **Granulosa cells**immediately surround the growing oocyte. They respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) released by the anterior pituitary by converting androgens to estrogen prior to the LH surge. The androgens used by the granulosa cells are provided by the Theca cells that lie outside of the granulosa cells. After the LH surge, the granulosa cells undergo a receptor transition called “luteinization”. Luteinization converts granulosa cells into cells that are receptive to the luteinizing hormone. This process enables granulosa cells to now produce Progesterone instead of estrogen as they previously did. After ovulation, granulosa cells in conjunction with the Theca-lutein cells create the Corpus Luteum which is primarily responsible for Progesterone.
- **Theca cells**appear as the follicle matures, and are found immediately outside of the granulosa cells. Their main function is to synthesize androgens that diffuse into the near-by granulosa cells for conversion to estrogen. Theca cells are regulated by LH and these cells undergo a “luteinization” phase like the granulosa cells, where they become “theca-lutein” cells that directly produce progesterone as part of the Corpus Luteum.
- **Stromal cells**are the connective tissue cells that create the organizational scaffolding for the organ-specific cells. (i.e. fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, etc.) Stromal cells are a major source of malignant processes, especially in the ovary. In fact, epithelial cells are responsible for the most common type of ovarian cancer.
