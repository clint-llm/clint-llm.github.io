By understanding the biochemistry of clotting factors, healthcare professionals can quickly identify probable causes of a patient's coagulopathy by examining a patient's coagulation studies. For elevations in PT/INR, we can focus in on conditions such as liver disease, warfarin use, vitamin-K deficiency, and deficiencies in the extrinsic or common pathway. For elevations in PTT, we narrow our focus on more common causes such as hemophilias, unfractionated heparin use, vitamin-K deficiency,Â and vWF, with careful attention to BT. It is important to remember that prolongations in PT and PTT could also be due to deficiencies in the common pathway, but the previous conditions and examples yield a higher probability of identifying the root of the coagulopathy.
