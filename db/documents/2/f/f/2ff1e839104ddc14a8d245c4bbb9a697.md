Patient management is an essential component of sacral neuromodulation, and providers must closely monitor patients to receive optimal therapy. Symptom diaries can be an effective and objective method for providers to determine if therapeutic efficacy decreases. Additionally, patient expectations must be managed as it is likely patients will not experience 100% improvement of all symptoms. When therapy effectiveness has been reduced, providers must investigate the cause and troubleshoot the device. Many different variables can be used to program the patientâ€™s IPG, and the patient must work with the medical team to modify program parameters to optimize therapy. This can be performed by physicians, advanced practice providers, and nursing staff in an outpatient setting.

An interprofessional healthcare team including specialists, other clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists will best drive patient care to optimal outcomes. [Level 5]
