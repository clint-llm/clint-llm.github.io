Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is believed to occur through both catabolic and anti-anabolic mechanisms. In terms of catabolic mechanisms, corticosteroids upregulate proteolytic systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, cathepsins (lysosomes), and calpains (calcium-dependent systems). This increases the proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins by dissociating actin from myosin.
