After making the diagnosis of perianal streptococcal dermatitis, treatment is relatively straightforward. In minor cases of the disease, some sources recommend treating PSD with topical antimicrobials. However, oral antibiotics are the recommended first-line treatment of the disease. The most successful treatment regimens utilize a combination of systemic and topical antibiotics. Systemic antibiotics include penicillin V, erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, penicillinase-resistant penicillin, or cephalosporins. These oral antibiotics work best in conjunction with a topical antiseptic such as chlorhexidine, or an antibiotic such as mupirocin. Treatment duration is for 14 to 21 days, and perianal swabs and culture should be taken to ensure eradication of the bacteria.
