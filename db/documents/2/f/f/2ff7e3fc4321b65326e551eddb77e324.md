The equation for mean corpuscular volume [MCV (fL) = Hct (%) X 10 / RBC (106/microgram)] explains how macrocytic anemia represents large red blood cells (RBCs) in comparison to total amount. Folate and vitamin B12 are necessary for RBC nucleic acid synthesis. Without DNA or RNA, erythropoiesis is ineffective with nuclear/cytoplasmic asynchrony, resulting in larger erythrogenic precursors with abnormal nuclei (ex. hypersegmentation) but normal cytoplasms. Anemia occurring in the presence of macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils is known as megaloblastic anemia. The absence of hypersegmented neutrophils characterizes non-megaloblastic anemia. This occurs from mechanisms discussed earlier: abnormalities involving the RBC membrane, excess erythrocytic precursors, increased cell volume, or RBC toxicity.

Daily folate needs are 100 to 200 micrograms, and the body can absorb 400 micrograms/day. Healthy patients have stores for 4 months. Folate is largely absorbed in the small bowel. In comparison, daily vitamin B12 requirements are one microgram, and the body can absorb 2 to 3 micrograms/day. Most patients have several years of B12 stores. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the ileum when bound by an intrinsic factor (IF), a protein produced by the gastric parietal cells. Abnormalities in these cascades cause deficiencies in folate or vitamin B12, respectively.
