The yolk sac gives rise to primordial germ cells, which develop in the embryo and eventually become ovaries or testes in the fetus. A yolk sac tumor, also known as an endodermal sinus tumor, is a rare but highly malignant tumor of these germ cells. Both children and adults may develop yolk sac tumors, but the incidence is higher in children. A yolk sac tumor is the most common testicular tumor in young children and infants. Yolk sac tumors are well-circumscribed.Â They produce alpha-fetoprotein, which can support the diagnosis if found to be elevated. On histology, perivascular structures called Schiller-Duval bodies are seen in yolk sac tumors and are pathognomonic if present. They appear as perivascular bodies with tumor cells organized around a blood vessel.

The erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) are present in the yolk sac, from which the macrophages will derive.
