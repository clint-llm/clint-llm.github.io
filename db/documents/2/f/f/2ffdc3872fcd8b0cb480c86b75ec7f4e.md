Central retinal vein occlusion has a better prognosis in younger patients. One-third of older patients improve without treatment, one-third stay the same, and one-third get worse. If the central retinal vein occlusion does not become ischemic, return to baseline or near baseline vision occurs in about 50% of patients. Chronic macular edema is the main cause of poor vision. In most cases, the prognosis correlates with initial visual acuity.

- If visual acuity is 20/60 or better, the visual acuity is likely to remain the same.

- If the patient has 20/80-20/200 vision, the clinical course varies. Visual acuity may improve, stay the same, or worsen.

- In visual acuity worse than 20/200, improvement is unlikely.

Ischemic central retinal vein occlusion has a more variable prognosis due to macular ischemia. Patients have a high risk of neovascular glaucoma due to the development of rubeosis iris (neovascularization of the iris) in 50% of eyes, usually between 2 to 4 months. Retinal neovascularization occurs in 5% of the eyes.
