Damage to the abducens nuclei can occur from brainstem trauma, infiltration, ischemia, inflammation, compression, demyelination, or metabolic insult.

Abducens nerve paresis may serve as a non-localizing sign of increased intracranial pressure due to the long subarachnoid course of the nerve between the brainstem and clivus, where it can get stretched at the sharp edge of the petrous bone or compressed between the pons and the basilar artery.

Paresis of the abducens nerve produces an isolated ipsilateral abduction deficit. However, because of the intranuclear connections, lesions that damage the abducens nucleus produce a conjugate gaze palsy toward the side of the lesion, rather than just an ipsilateral abduction weakness that would occur from isolated damage to the abducens nerve.

In many cases of injury to the abducens nuclei or fascicles, an ipsilateral facial nerve palsy will also be present, since the genu of the facial nerve fascicle passes around the abducens nucleus before exiting the brainstem.

The one-and-a-half syndrome consists of an ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy combined with an ipsilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).

Congenital absence or hypoplasia of the abducens nucleus may occur with Mobius syndrome and Duane retraction syndrome.

Electromyography (EMG) may assist in distinguishing nuclear or infranuclear involvement from other causes of abduction defect due to a pathology of the lateral rectus muscle.
