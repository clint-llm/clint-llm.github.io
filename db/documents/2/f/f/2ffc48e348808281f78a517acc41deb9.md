Sulfonylureas have a narrow therapeutic index.

Educate patients that the hypoglycemia alert value is ≤ 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L).

The “Rule of 15” or “15-15” rule applies to treatment with glucose. The patient should receive 15 grams of glucose, recheck blood glucose levels 15 minutes later, and repeat the process as needed until hypoglycemia resolves.

In hospitalized patients, intravenous (IV) dextrose is the first-line therapy for severe hypoglycemia from sulfonylureas.

Glucagon stimulates glucose production in the liver and is useful for patients who refuse or cannot take oral glucose.

Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that results in an effect opposite to that of sulfonylureas. By binding to the somatostatin-2 receptors on the pancreatic beta cells, octreotide inhibits calcium influx, thus blocking insulin secretion.

Monitor all patients for 12 hours after hypoglycemia treatment to recognize and treat recurrent episodes.
