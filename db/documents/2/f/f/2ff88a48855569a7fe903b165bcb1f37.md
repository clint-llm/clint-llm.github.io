The anatomy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is commonly variable. The nerve has been noted exiting the pelvis in seven different locations in relation to the inguinal ligament and ASIS. It most commonly exits medial to ASIS and under the inguinal ligament but has also been seen exiting the pelvis medial to ASIS and superior to the inguinal ligament. The LFCN may also exit superior to ASIS itself or even lateral to ASIS. Occasionally, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve passes through ASIS, the inguinal ligament, or sartorius; however, it can be found medial to the sartorius 86% of the time. The distance from the nerve to ASIS is also highly variable, creating a zone in which the LFCN might be found, ranging from 10 mm (most common) to 46 mm medially. The bifurcation pattern of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is also highly variable. The nerve may bifurcate in the thigh (most common), in the pelvis, near the exit to the pelvis, or the LFCN may trifurcate or quadrificate.

Most commonly, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve originates directly from L2-L3 nerve roots in the lumbar plexus, but it has also been noted to arise from L1 and L2, or L3 and L4. It may form as a collateral branch of the femoral nerve, or it might be absent altogether, and sensation to the anterolateral thigh is replaced by the ilioinguinal nerve, a branch of the anterior femoral cutaneous nerve, or a branch of the genitofemoral nerve.
