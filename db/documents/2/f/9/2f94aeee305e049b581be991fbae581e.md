Bursitis may present acutely or chronically, with wide variation in symptoms and presentation. A detailed history focusing on medical and social histories will assist the clinician in differentiating. Important historical factors include the presence of immunosuppression (e.g., diabetes, chronic steroid use) and hobbies or occupation (e.g., housemaid, carpentry, roofing, gardening). Acute bursitis more commonly arises from trauma, infection, or crystalline joint disease, whereas chronic bursitis tends to be the result of inflammatory arthropathies and repetitive pressure or overuse. The physical examination findings also vary. Acute bursitis generally presents with erythema, warmth, and tenderness on palpation of the bursa, and possibly decreased range-of-motion in certain planes secondary to discomfort. Contrarily, chronic bursitis is often painless - the bursa has had time to expand and to accommodate for the increased fluid. In either scenario, it is important to assess the area for signs of overlying trauma, erythema, and warmth. One study suggested that an increase in the surface temperature of just 2.2 degrees centigrade between the skin overlying the affected bursa and the unaffected, contralateral bursa was highly sensitive and specific for septic bursitis.
