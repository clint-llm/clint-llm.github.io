In the United States, the physician's eligibility to perform a brain death examination varies from state to state and institution to institution. Most states and institutions legally allow any physician to perform brain death exams, while some only allow neurologists, neurosurgeons, and intensive care specialists.

Time of death is also country and institutional guideline-based. Time of death, as per AAN, is when PCO2 reaches the target value during the apnea test. While patients who underwent the ancillary examination, death is when the results are officially reported.
