Usually, histological examination is not necessary to make a diagnosis of aÂ hepatic cyst as the diagnosis is often made on radiologic and clinical findings. Regardless, there are differences in terms of histopathology when it comes to different hepatic cysts.

Simple cysts are comprised of a thin outer layer, dense fibrous tissue, and an inner epithelial lining. This epithelial lining is made up of a single layer of cuboidal or columnar cells. Simple cysts lack cellular atypia or mesenchymal stroma. They are fluid-filled, and most are less than 3 cm in size. The fluid within the cyst is sterile and cytologically negative. A distinct histological feature of an echinococcal cyst is that it is associated with calcifications. Ciliated hepatic foregut cysts consist are comprised of a ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, a subepithelial connective tissue layer, smooth muscle, and a fibrous capsule.
