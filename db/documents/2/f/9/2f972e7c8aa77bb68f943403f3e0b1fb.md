Asthma and COPD are common chronic diseases with multiple treatment guidelines throughout the world, but beta-2 agonists are an essential part of every guideline; this necessitates thorough and accurate knowledge of different aspects related to them, including the significant adverse effects and contraindications. Practitioners should always respect the individual difference between patients’ responses to treatment, so customization of treatment regimen according to all of the previous factors is a must.

Beta-2 agonists are not the first-line management drug for asthma, and patients require education about when and how to use them properly, as multiple studies showed that tolerance to B2 agonists is rapid if used incorrectly.

Patients with chronic respiratory inflammatory diseases should receive care from an interprofessional team of healthcare workers, including pulmonologists or allergists, family clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), pharmacists, and nurses, who should all understand the therapeutic use of beta-2 receptors and the drugs that exert inhibitory or agonistic effects on them. This knowledge will help both with therapy choices as well as monitoring for adverse events. This will require open communication and collaborative effort between all clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, with each discipline empowered to offer suggestions and alert other team members to status changes. This will bring about better patient outcomes while minimizing potential adverse events from beta-2 receptor drugs. [Level 5] In this vein of thought, cardiologists and obstetricians should identify the clinical relevance of drugs affecting B2 receptors, which their patients may be taking, and adjust the medications they prescribe accordingly to improve efficacy and prevent adverse effects.

The general public needs more information about the dangerous outcomes of B2 agonists if used inappropriately or without medical advice, such as its use as an anabolic drug, and emergency physicians and nurses should have the training to identify the clinical picture of these drugs’ overdose correctly.
