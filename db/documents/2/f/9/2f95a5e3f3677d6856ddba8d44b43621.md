Kienbock disease is invariably progressive, and joint destruction occurs within 3-5 years of onset.

Prognosis depends on:

Functional Staging: The greater the extent of viable bone, the better the prognosis.

Negative ulnar variance: The greater the negative variance, the more severe the disease and the more likely it is to progress.

Age at diagnosis: Patients diagnosed at an older age are more likely to have advanced stage disease and are more likely to progress.

It is significant to note that the severity of symptoms does not always correlate with morphologic stage.
