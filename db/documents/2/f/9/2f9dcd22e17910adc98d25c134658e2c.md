The temporalis muscle, which serves as one of the muscles of mastication, is attached to the temporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid. The upper fibers of the lateral pterygoid muscle attach to the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid as well as the infratemporal crest. The lateral pterygoid muscle attaches to the lateral aspect of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process while the medial pterygoid muscle is attached to the medial aspect of the lateral plate as well as the pterygoid fossa. The medial division of the pterygoid process, called the medial plate, serves as a site of attachment to the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.
