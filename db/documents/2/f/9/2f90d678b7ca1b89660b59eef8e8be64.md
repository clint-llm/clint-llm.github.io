Diagnosis is difficult to make clinically as the signs and symptoms are usually vague and non-specific. Patients typically present with either an acute or gradual course of symptoms. The most common symptoms reported are an epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include abdominal distension, weight loss, early satiety and postprandial epigastric pain which worsens in the supine position. Â Symptoms are alleviated with the release of the angle which can be demonstrated in a prone, knee to the chest or left lateral decubitus position. Pain can be intermittent or chronic depending on the severity of obstruction. In the acute phase, severe intestinal obstruction leads to life-threatening dilatation of the stomach. In the chronic state, non-specific and intermittent postprandial pain, nausea, vomiting and weight loss often prevail. The cycle of nausea and vomiting leads to inadequate food intake with results in weight loss and thus, aggravation of the syndrome.
