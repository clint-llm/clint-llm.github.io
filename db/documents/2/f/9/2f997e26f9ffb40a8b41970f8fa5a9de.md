The supratrochlear nerve may become entrapped at the supraorbital margin, supraorbital foramen, orÂ within the corrugator supercilii muscle; the condition may present as chronic frontal migraine. The nerve is relieved by endoscopically or by injecting the botulinum toxin to relieve the migraine.

Embolia Cutis Medicamentosa (ECS) is a phenomenon following an intra-arterial filler injection. The drug or fluid may accidentally enter the supratrochlear or supraorbital artery while injecting the glabellar skin. Injecting fluid in the supratrochlear artery has been found as one of the causes of embolism of the ophthalmic artery and central artery of the retina; embolism of the central artery of the retina may lead to blindness.
