Risperidone should not be given if a known allergy/hypersensitivity to risperidone or paliperidone (a metabolite of risperidone) is present. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder or HPPD may be a relative contraindication for risperidone because some patients treated with risperidone for their HPPD reported that panic and visual symptoms intensified.
