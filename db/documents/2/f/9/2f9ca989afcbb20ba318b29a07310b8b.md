Parathyroid hormone is a polypeptide that is synthesized and cleaved into an active form within the parathyroid gland. The initial structure formed is a pre-pro-PTH, a 115 amino acid polypeptide that is cleaved to form pro-PTH comprised of 90 amino acids. It is then cleaved a second time, again at the amino-terminal portion, to form active parathyroid hormone comprised of 84 amino acids. This is the primary hormone that is stored, secreted, and functions in the body. The process of synthesis, cleavage, and storage is estimated to take less than an hour. Active PTH secretion can occur as quickly as a few seconds when low serum calcium is detected. The mechanism of secretion is via exocytosis, a process where the hormone is released through a membrane vesicle carried to the cell membrane, releasing the hormone after the vesicle fuses with the outer membrane. The serum half-life of activated PTH is a few minutes, and is removed from the serum quickly by the kidney and liver.
