Most commonly, the history includes either changing characteristics in an existing mole or the identification of a new mole.

The characteristics of melanoma are commonly known by the acronym ABCDE and include the following:

- A - Asymmetry

- B - Irregular border

- C - Color variations, especially red, white, and blue tones in a brown or black lesion

- D - Diameter greater than 6 mm

- E - Elevated surface

Also, melanomas may itch, bleed, ulcerate, or develop satellites. Patients who present with metastatic disease or with primary sites other than the skin have signs and symptoms related to the affected organ system(s).

It is also important to examine all lymph node groups.
