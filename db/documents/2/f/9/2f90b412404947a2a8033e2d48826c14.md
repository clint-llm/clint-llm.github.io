Blunt cardiac trauma is generally caused by a direct impact to the anterior chest, sudden high-speed deceleration, compression of the chest, or a mixture of those.  Motor vehicle accidents are the most common cause and include all three of the mechanisms above.  Individuals struck by motor vehicle falls, crush injuries, and seemingly innocuous trauma such as sports-related (baseball hitting a chest) or animal-related (animal kick) may also cause blunt cardiac injury (BCI).

Penetrating cardiac trauma has been primarily due to stab wounds, with gunshot wounds being the second leading cause. Non-firearm-related blast injuries and impalements are also causes of penetrating cardiac trauma.
