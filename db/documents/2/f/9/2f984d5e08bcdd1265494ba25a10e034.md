The most important evaluation is biopsy with histopathologic examination. These lesions can be reliably diagnosed through this method, along with the correlated clinical exam. If these lesions are evaluated before biopsy by sonography, they should appear as an avascular lesion within the dermis, which will often have superficial subcutis involvement and spiculated margins that are not well defined. The size and margins of these lesions correlate well on the histopathologic exam with sonographic findings.
