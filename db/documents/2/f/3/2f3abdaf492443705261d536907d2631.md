Myoclonic epilepsy with red-ragged fibers (MERRF) is a rare multisystem mitochondrial disease with predominant progressive myoclonus. It is common in children and young adolescents. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of MERRF and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and inheritance pattern of myoclonic epilepsy with red-ragged fibers.
- Review the multisystem involvement in patients with myoclonic epilepsy with red-ragged fibers.
- Outline the diagnostic tests available for myoclonic epilepsy with red-ragged fibers.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to myoclonic epilepsy with red-ragged fibers (MERRF) and improve outcomes.
