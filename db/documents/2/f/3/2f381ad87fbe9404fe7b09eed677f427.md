Periodic limb movements in sleep is a common finding in a polysomnogram. Unfortunately, it is an underdiagnosed condition. Having understood the potential cardiovascular adverse effects and the benefits in quality of sleep with treatment, all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and even pharmacists, should be vigilant in identifying this condition, and either diagnosing and treating these patients or referring them to clinical settings for a thorough diagnostic workup. This requires open communication channels between various healthcare disciplines, with each team member contributing their expertise. For example, pharmacists must ensure that the medication used for this condition does not interact with other medications the patient may already be taking and can contact the nurse or clinician if they note any concerns. Nurses will coordinate referrals, assist in evaluation, and counsel patients.

Given the overall lack of understanding of this and other sleep disorders, it is crucial to get the patient where they need to be for proper diagnosis and management. This interprofessional paradigm is the optimal mean by which to accomplish this. [Level 5]
