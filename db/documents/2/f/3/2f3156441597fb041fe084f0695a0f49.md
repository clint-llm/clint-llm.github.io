A focused history and physical should be performed, starting with a primary survey of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Shock and respiratory failure are common sequelae of snakebites, so close observation is crucial. Establishing the time of the bite as well as any previous interventions and asking about existing medical problems (e.g., cardiac, pulmonary, and renal disease), current symptoms, allergies, and last tetanus immunization are also important. Close examination and documentation of the patient's injuries are crucial, as worsening erythema, swelling, or blistering around the snakebite site could precede clinical deterioration. Although not advised, if the patient was able to take a sufficient quality photograph or physically capture the snake, identification of the species could be useful in guiding management. Time should not be wasted trying to find, photograph, or kill the snake. Bedside ultrasound of the bite location can be utilized to evaluate the depth and extent of associated skin and soft tissue involvement.
