NORSE (and FIRES in children) is an uncommon neurological condition associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality. Most patients remain unresponsive to multiple anesthetic agents and evolve into SRSE. A 12% mortality rate has been seen in children and 16% to 27% in adults.

Most of the survivors eventually develop multidrug-resistant epilepsy on long-term follow-up and significant cognitive and functional impairment. Prolonged ICU stay, medical complications, duration of barbiturate induced coma, and use of multiple anesthetic agents have been associated with worse outcomes both in children and adults.
