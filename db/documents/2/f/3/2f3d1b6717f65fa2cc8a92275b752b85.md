The NTS typically causes gastroenteritis, while S. typhi causes systemic disease through the use of virulence factors. One type of virulence factor produced by S. typhi and not NTS includes the Vi antigen, which is a polysaccharide capsule that prevents phagocytosis and destruction from immune cells. Another virulence factor specific to typhoidal Salmonella includes the typhoid toxin. The typhoid toxin is made when the Salmonella bacterium is intracellular and secreted through vesicles to the extracellular space leading to reduced circulating neutrophils, lethargy, and other neurological complications. Other significant virulence factors include the flagella, which helps promote the bacteriumâ€™s motility and the type III secretion system, which allows the attachment and insertion process into human nonphagocytic cells.
