Hemodynamic stability is the first step in determining treatment for a patient with atrial tachycardia. According to the 2015 American College of Cardiology

For a hemodynamically stable patient, according to the same guidelines as above, first line management is IV beta-blockers, IV Diltiazem or IV Verapamil.

In chronic management of atrial tachycardia beta blockers, diltiazem and verapamil can be used in their oral forms. In patients without structural heart defects or ischemic heart disease, flecainide or propafenone can be used. Patients canÂ be managed on amiodarone

Cardioversion can also be used for patients who have refractory atrial tachycardia or atrial tachycardia which has been difficult or unable to control pharmacologically. Another non-pharmacologic treatment used in refractory cases is treatment by radiofrequency catheter ablation.
