Patient education regarding maternal and neonatal complications of substance use in pregnancy is essential. Comprehensive prenatal and postnatal care, including behavioral counseling and psychosocial support, improves clinical outcomes.

Women whose newborns are at risk for NOWS benefit from learning what to expect after delivery. Nurses and other clinicians can discuss newborn withdrawal symptoms, comfort measures, breastfeeding, pharmacotherapy options, and the need for close observation. Many labor and delivery units offer prenatal tours to mothers with OUD to prepare them for their perinatal experience.

Patient education, counseling, and monitoring do not end with delivery. Women with SUD are at high risk for postpartum relapse and must be educated about the dangers of resuming substance use after delivery. They should be screened and closely monitored, especially during the first postpartum year. Continued medication-assisted treatment and consultation with substance use specialists and behavior therapists will help achieve optimal outcomes.
