Lesser toe deformities are generally caused by an imbalance of the intrinsic and extrinsic musculature in the foot.

Mallet toes are flexion deformities of the distal interphalangeal joints. They are most commonly caused by tightness or contracture of the flexor digitorum longus that inserts at the base of the distal phalanx of the lesser toes.

Hammer toes are flexion deformities of the proximal interphalangeal joints and extension of the distal interphalangeal joints caused by an overpull of the extensor digitorum longus. Occasionally, metatarsophalangeal joint hyperextension is present, and the deformity may be flexible or rigid.

Claw toes are characterized by an extension deformity of the metatarsophalangeal joint, which results in unopposed flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. This deformity is more commonly associated with neuromuscular diseases and inflammatory arthropathies.
