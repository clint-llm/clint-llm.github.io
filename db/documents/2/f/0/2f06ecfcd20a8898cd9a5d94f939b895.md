Stellate ganglion block (SGB) is used for the treatment of many medical conditions including complex regional pain syndrome and peripheral vascular disease. Historically, the anesthetic has been injected at the C6 or C7 vertebral level with the Chassignacâ€™s tubercle, the cricoid cartilage, and the carotid artery serving as the anatomic landmarks to the procedure. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and complications of a stellate ganglion block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with chronic pain.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures one should know for a stellate ganglion block.
- Describe the technique of performing a stellate ganglion block.
- Review the complications of a stellate ganglion block.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to assist patients undergoing a stellate ganglion block.
