Possible differential diagnoses that need to be considered in a patient presenting with a spontaneous fracture or after low impact trauma are:

1) Vitamin D deficiency (less than 20nmol/L) or insufficiency (less than 30 nmol/L) which can cause osteomalacia and increased risk of hip fractures in men and women. This is reversible after treatment with cholecalciferol.

2) Solid tumors with bone metastasis are common causes of fractures. Solid tumors more associated with bone metastasis are lung, breast, and prostate.

3) Hematologic malignancies can commonly present with bone fracture, multiple myeloma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, although it is considered a bone marrow tumor.

4) Primary bone tumors are much less common than bone metastasis, however, should also be considered as potential causes of fractures. The most common malignant primary bone tumor is osteosarcoma, although occurs more frequently in younger patients (2nd or 3rd decade).

5) Avascular necrosis of the femur should also be ruled out when a patient presents with subtle pain and limited range of motion of the hip, especially when not associated with trauma and in the presence of risk factors (glucocorticoid use, sickle cell disease).
