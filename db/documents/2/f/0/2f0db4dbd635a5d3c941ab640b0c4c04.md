The advantage of ONSUS is that it can be performed with most ultrasound equipment that is abundantly available in emergency departments and ICUs throughout the United States. There are commercially available high-frequency ocular ultrasound units designed for dedicated studies of the eye, but most conventional ultrasound units with a high frequency (7 to 10 MHz or higher) linear array probes are sufficient to visualize the optic nerve with the closed eye technique.
