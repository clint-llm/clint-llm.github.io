The modifiedÂ Ashworth scale is the most universally accepted clinical tool used to measure the increase of muscle tone.

In 1964, Bryan Ashworth published the Ashworth Scale as a method of grading spasticity while working with multiple sclerosis patients. The original Ashworth scale was a 5 point numerical scale that graded spasticity from 0 to 4, with 0 being no resistance and 4 being a limb rigid in flexion or extension.

- 0: No increase in muscle tone

- 1: Slight increase in muscle tone, with a catch and release or minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when an affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension

- 1+: Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested as a catch, followed by minimal resistance through the remainder (less than half) of the range of motion

- 2: A marked increase in muscle tone throughout most of the range of motion, but affected part(s) are still easily moved

- 3: Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult

- 4: Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension
