Short- and long-term prognoses of a patient with bowel perforation depend on multiple factors. For instance, age, medical comorbidities, benign or malignant cause, and tolerance to treatment are important considerations when discussing prognosis. Since surgery is commonly necessary, patients who are unable to tolerate or choose not to undergo surgery when it is required may have a worse prognosis.
