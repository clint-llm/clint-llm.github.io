Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is a pulmonary vasculature mechanism. However, inappropriate and chronic vasoconstriction can lead to pulmonary hypertension, which has systemic ramifications. Pulmonary hypertension increases the work of the heart. The right ventricle, which propels poorly oxygenated blood into the pulmonary artery, works harder to overcome the increasing pressures in the pulmonary circuit, leading to right ventricular hypertrophy in most cases. The grim sequelae of pulmonary hypertension may lead to the classic 'cor pulmonale' presentation in which right heart failure leads to venous congestion.
