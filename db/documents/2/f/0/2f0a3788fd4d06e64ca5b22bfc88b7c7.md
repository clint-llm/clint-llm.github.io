**Abdominal Wall**

The incision of the abdominal wall is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures. Prior to performing a rush PMCS, it is ideal to have a basic understanding of the layers involved. There are 9 layers of the abdominal wall which include the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia, preperitoneal adipose and areolar tissue, and peritoneum. The blood supply for the abdominal wall is composed of superficial and deep arteries. The superficial blood supply is located in the subcutaneous tissue and supplies blood to everything above the external oblique aponeurosis and anterior rectus sheath. It consists of the superficial inferior epigastric, superficial external pudendal, and superficial circumflex artery. The deep blood vessels are located in the musculofascial layers and supply blood to the muscles and fascia below the external oblique aponeurosis. A midline incision is an ideal approach in PMCS because it takes advantage that only the terminal branches of the blood vessels and nerves are in the linea alba. This reduces the risk for major bleeds and nerve damage from the procedure and provides the most significant exposure to the abdominal organs.

**The Uterus**

Understanding uterine anatomy is imperative for ensuring optimal exposure, maximizing hemostasis, and avoiding injury to critical abdominal structures such as viscera, blood vessels, and nerves. The uterus can be divided into 2 portions, the uterine corpus, and the uterine cervix. The uterine corpus, which is also known as the body, has an inverted triangular shape. The superior portion of the body is called the fundus. An inferior portion that joins the cervix is known as the isthmus. The body is made up of 3 layers which are the serosa (outer layer), myometrium (middle layer), and endometrium (inner layer). The uterus is supported by the uterosacral and cardinal ligament complex, round ligament, broad ligament, and the endo-pelvic fascia. The blood supply for the uterus mainly comes from the uterine artery. The uterine artery originates from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries in the retroperitoneum. The practitioner should be aware of the importance of the course of the uterine artery. The uterine artery courses through the cardinal ligament and passes over the ureter (located 1.5-cm lateral to the uterus). It reaches the uterus at the level of the internal cervical os. The uterine arteries give off branches, which tortuously course along the lateral aspect of the uterus, running superiorly to the corpus, and inferiorly to the cervix. The corpus also receives collateral flow from anastomoses of the ovarian arteries.

**Physiology**

There are physiologic changes that occur during late pregnancy. During the third trimester of pregnancy, there is an increase in cardiac output and circulating blood volume by 30% to 40%. This is important because maternal signs and symptoms of shock may not manifest until the mother has lost over 40% of her blood volume. Also, an enlarged uterus can elevate the diaphragm about 4 cm which, in turn, can cause a 20% decrease in functional residual capacity. Finally, the gravid uterus can cause compression of the inferior vena cave (IVC) leading to hypotension.
