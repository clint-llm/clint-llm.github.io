Sore throat is an extremely common presenting complaint in providers' offices, emergency departments, and urgent care centers.

The other bacterial causes of sore throat are rarer but are highly associated with risk factors. While gonorrhea and chlamydia are frequently asymptomatic, a pharyngeal STI is present inÂ nearly 10% of those with some risk factors.
