Sinusitis is a common disease that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists. The key to treatment is to reduce the triggers. Patients should be urged to quit smoking. In addition, the early empirical use of antibiotics should be avoided. The outcomes depend on the cause, but irrespective of treatment, recurrences are common and lead to poor quality of life.
