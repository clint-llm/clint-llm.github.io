Sometimes the diagnosis of hypermagnesaemia can be challenging because:

- Checking serum magnesium is not routine

- Many clinicians are unfamiliar with this uncommon condition.

- Symptoms and signs are non-specific. A more characteristic clinical picture is an expression of overt disease.

Hypermagnesaemia is often a diagnosis of exclusion among a wide range of causes of neurologic or cardiorespiratory depression. These causes include:

- Acute renal failure

- Hypercalcemia

- Hyperkalemia

- Hypoparathyroidism

- Hypothyroidism

- Lithium toxicity

- Hemolysis

- Rhabdomyolysis
