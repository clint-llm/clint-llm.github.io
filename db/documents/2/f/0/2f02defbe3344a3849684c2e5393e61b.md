Zones of the physis:

- Resting zone - located closest to the epiphysis, location of germinal matrix, inactive chondroblasts

- Proliferative zone - active chondroblasts, like the name sounds, chondroblasts create proteins for the extracellular matrix (ECM)

- Hypertrophic Zone - more organized chondroblasts, decreased production of ECM, the zone subdivides further:

- Zone of maturation
- Zone of provisional degeneration
- Zone of provisional calcification - weakest zone, where physeal injuries occur

- Zone of calcification - the level that cartilage becomes calcified/becomes bone

Two other important structures surround the physis:

- The groove of Ranvier - located on the diaphyseal side of the growth plate, supports peripheral growth of growth plate, made up of osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and chondroblasts.

- Ring of LaCroix - makes the physis more stable, fibrous, connects metaphysis, and epiphyseal periosteum.

Blood supply located on epiphyseal end via periosteum.
