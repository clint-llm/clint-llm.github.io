Saint Louis encephalitis virus is a Flavivirus, a single-stranded RNA virus transmitted by the Culex species mosquitoes. The most common mosquito vectors are Culex pipiens, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex tarsalis, and Culex nigripalpus. Wild birds serve as amplifying hosts in that they develop significant viremia to infect other mosquitoes but do not develop clinical symptoms themselves. The birds involved are present in both urban and rural environments and include pigeons, blue jays, robins, and house sparrows. Humans and domestic animals are dead-end hosts in that the contract the virus and may develop symptoms, but do not develop significant viremia to transmit the virus to other biting mosquitoes. There is no person-to-person transmission of Saint Louis encephalitis. Transmission for aerosolized laboratory samples is possible but rare. Transmission may be possible by blood transfusion.
