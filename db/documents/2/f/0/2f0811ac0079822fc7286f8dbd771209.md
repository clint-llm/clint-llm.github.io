The healthcare team, i.e., clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to ensure that patients with dyslipidemia correctly take their medications, e.g., fluvastatin, and, importantly, discuss any serious adverse drug reactions they encounter, e.g., muscle pain, jaundice, etc. Clinicians should review a complete medication list for the patient before prescribing fluvastatin to prevent clinically significant drug interactions.****Nursing should verify dosing before administration, and pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation to answer any questions or address concerns other healthcare team members may have. Clinicians should use the ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk algorithm, a standardized guideline to predict risk and guide management for patients at risk of ASCVD for shared clinical decisions.
