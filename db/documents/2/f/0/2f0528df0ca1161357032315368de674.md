**Central versus Peripheral Diabe****tes Insipidus**

Patients with CDI and PDI present with excessive diluted urine (polyuria) and thirst (polydipsia). If the patient has an impaired thirst drive, they may present with mild hypernatremia. Differentiating CDI and PDI requires checking urine osmolality and a water deprivation test. In Psychogenic polydipsia, the urine osmolarity will return to baseline within a couple of hours after a water deprivation test. However, if the osmolarity continues to trend below baseline, injecting 2 g of desmopressin (vasopressin agonist) would be the next step. In central diabetes insipidus, the urine osmolarity should slowly return to baseline a couple of hours after administering desmopressin. In peripheral diabetes insipidus, there will be no change in urine osmolarity despite administration of desmopressin. The long-term treatment for CDI is desmopressin via nasal spray, orally, or subcutaneous injections. As for PDI, long-term treatment is with sodium depletion, thiazide diuretics, and removal of any offending agents, like lithium. Studies have shown that removing electrolytes from the body will increase the reabsorption of sodium and water in the proximal tubules.

**Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone**

SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion once all other causes of hyponatremia have been ruled out. Treatment depends on the status of the patient; if asymptomatic, then water restriction is sufficient. If this treatment fails to improve the sodium level, then add lithium or demeclocycline. Both agents antagonize antidiuretic hormone, which will induce diuresis and ultimately correct the sodium level. ADH receptor antagonists like tolvaptan and conivaptan are also approved for the treatment of SIADH. In symptomatic patients, first-line treatment depends on the severity of the symptoms.
