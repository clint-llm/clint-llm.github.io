Hyphema is the accumulation of red blood cells (RBCs) in the anterior chamber of the eye. By definition, blood must be grossly visible, either on direct inspection or via slit-lamp examination. Blood accumulates from the disruption of the vessels of the iris or ciliary body, usually due to trauma or underlying medical conditions. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of hyphema and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of hyphema.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hyphema.
- Review the complications of hyphema.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the management of patients with hyphema.
