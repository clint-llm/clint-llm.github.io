Lateral medullary syndrome (LMS), also called Wallenberg syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome results from a vascular event in the lateral part of the medulla oblongata. It was named after Adolf Wallenberg (1862-1949), who was a renowned Jewish neurologist and neuroanatomist who practiced in Germany. He first reported the case of LMS. The arteries commonly involved inÂ LMS are the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) or the vertebral artery. Lateral medullary syndrome characteristically has varied neurologic manifestations. The damage is to the inferior cerebellar peduncle and dorsolateral medulla, descending spinal tract, the nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, nuclei, and fibers of the vagus nerves and glossopharyngeal, descending sympathetic tract fibers, spinothalamic tract, and vestibular nuclei.
