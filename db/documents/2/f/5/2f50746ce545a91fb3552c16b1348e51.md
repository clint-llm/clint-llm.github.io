If tympanostomy tube placement is the sole procedure in children, then general anesthesia with mask ventilation alone is performed. General endotracheal anesthesia is performed in children undergoing additional procedures, such as adenoidectomy or cleft palate repair.

The majority of adolescent and adult patients can tolerate TT placement in the clinic under local anesthesia with topical lidocaine, phenol, or lidocaine injection.
