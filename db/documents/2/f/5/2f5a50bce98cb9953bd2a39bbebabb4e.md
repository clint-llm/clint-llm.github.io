**Coronary Perfusion Pressure in Cardiovascular Disease**

CPP becomes reduced in common cardiac conditions, including heart failure and coronary artery disease; patients with these conditions are more prone to myocardial ischemia.

The impaired ejection of blood from the left ventricle defines systolic heart failure; this increases LVEDP, and thus CPP and left ventricular perfusion are reduced.

Atherosclerotic plaques causing stenosis of coronary vessel lumens characterize coronary artery disease. Plaques impede flow through coronary circulation, necessitating compensatory coronary vasodilation distal to the plaque to maintain coronary flow and myocardial oxygen delivery. As stenosis progresses, the coronary flow becomes dependent on CPP. Myocardial ischemia occurs when CPP is unable to sustain coronary perfusion as autoregulation fails.

**Coronary Perfusion Pressure in Type 2 Myocardial Infarction**

Type 1 myocardial infarction implies the rupture of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent thrombus formation and stenosis of the arterial lumen.

Type 1 and 2 myocardial infarctions are associated with similar mortality rates

**Therapeutic Modification of Coronary Perfusion Pressure**

Two examples of therapies that modify CPP are glyceryl trinitrate and the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

- Glyceryl Trinitrate

Glyceryl trinitrate is an agent used in the acute management of type 1 myocardial infarction. Studies have shown that low-dose glyceryl trinitrate administration reduces LVEDP without reducing aortic diastolic pressure, thus increasing CPP.

- Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump

The IABP is the most commonly used form of mechanical support in the acutely failing heart.

**Pearls**

- Left ventricular myocardial perfusion occurs in diastole rather than systole due to the arrangement of the coronary anatomy.

- Coronary perfusion pressure is a significant determinant of myocardial oxygen supply; local factors regulate coronary flow across a range of coronary perfusion pressures.

- If coronary perfusion pressure becomes acutely reduced in patients with circulatory shock, type 2 myocardial infarction may occur; this has a different etiology from the widely known type 1 myocardial infarction.
