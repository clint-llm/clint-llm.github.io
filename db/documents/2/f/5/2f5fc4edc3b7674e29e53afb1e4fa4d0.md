Agoraphobia, while only recently differentiated from panic disorder with its diagnostic criteria, is extremely prevalent in the general population. When present, it causes significant distress and potential disability in an individual’s life. Due to its “persistent and chronic” course, if left untreated, it is essential that agoraphobia is diagnosed early and intervention initiated promptly. It is critical that healthcare professionals, particularly primary care providers, be well-versed in the symptomatology of agoraphobia and proficient in diagnosing and starting any necessary treatment. Patients must have a connection to avenues to obtain adequate resources for their distress and disability, and referrals to psychology and psychiatry should take place if deemed necessary. Treatment can involve psychologists, social workers, psychiatric nurses, and nurse practitioners. They all participate in patient education and monitor patients. Nursing staff can assess compliance, answer patient questions, and watch for adverse effects from medication, alerting the prescriber promptly of any concerns. Pharmacists review prescriptions, check for interactions and inform patients about side effects. They can also provide input on which agents are best to use for a specific patient and therapy modifications if progress stalls. These interprofessional interventions can improve patient outcomes for agoraphobia patients. [Level 5]
