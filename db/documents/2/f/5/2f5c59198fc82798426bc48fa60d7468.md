Post-operatively, patients should be receiving information regarding activity restrictions. If patients are not comfortable using crutches or other devices, a physical therapy consult is in order.  Post-operative care should emphasize to the patient the need for icing, elevation, and other pain modalities. The patient and family members should have involvement to ensure compliance.
