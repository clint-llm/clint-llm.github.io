Practitioners have believed that artificial rupture of membranes either can assist in inducing labor or augmenting spontaneous labor. It is commonly felt that relieving the amniotic sac of amniotic fluid induces uterine contraction activity, increases the strength of contractions, and may augment labor by allowing direct pressure from the fetal scalp on the uterine cervix which may assist in dilating the cervix. While these are commonly held beliefs of many practitioners, the data to support amniotomy for these reasons is uncertain. Some studies have produced data supporting the practice, while others suggest that this practice does not, in fact, accomplish any of these outcomes. As a result, meta-analysis has been performed; however, the data has been mixed. Meta-analysis seems to suggest that amniotomy to shorten spontaneous labor does not produce a discernible difference when compared to no amniotomy. Nevertheless, when there is a delay in labor, the meta-analysis suggests there is a modest reduction in the rate of cesarean section when the rupture of membranes in conjunction with the use of oxytocin is used as an early intervention.
