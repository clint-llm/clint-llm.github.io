In general, globin gene mutations affecting hemoglobin are common and affect 7% of the entire world population.

**Common Variants of SCA or HbSS Disease**

- Hemoglobin S-beta-0 thalassemia (Clinically behaves exactly like HbSS disease)

- Hemoglobin SC (a milder variant of SCD) - can have a phenotypic presentation of sickle cell anemia

- Hemoglobin S-beta+ thalassemia (a milder variant of SCD)

Several other hemoglobin variants are present that can mimic SCA if they are inherited along with HbS.

- Hemoglobin Jamaica-Plain (beta-68 [E12] Leu -> Phe)

- Hemoglobin Quebec-Chori (beta-87 [F3] Thr > Ile)

- Hemoglobin D-Punjab (beta-globin, codon 121, glutamine to glutamic acid)

- Hemoglobin O-Arab

- Hemoglobin E

Other conditions that can present with hemolysis, where SCA can be ruled out with history, examination, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and study of the peripheral smear

- Antibody-mediated autoimmune hemolytic anemia (both warm and cold antibodies)

- Other hemoglobinopathies- alpha or beta-thalassemia

- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

- RBC-membrane defects (hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis)

- Enzyme defects (pyruvate kinase deficiency, glucose-6-phosphate deficiency)

- Drug-induced hemolysis

- Transfusion-related hemolysis (acute or delayed hemolytic reaction)

- Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (atypical or typical hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura)

- Infectious causes (malaria, babesiosis, Rickettsia, Clostridia, Bartonella)

- Vasculitis-induced hemolysis
