Undiagnosed LCL and PLC injuries often have several long-term complications. The most common complications are continued knee instability and chronic pain. Reports also show that approximately 35% of PLC injuriesÂ may have an associated peroneal nerve palsy. This comorbidity is likely due to the proximity of the peroneal nerve to the LCL. Patients may develop long-term foot drop, as well as lower extremity weakness and decreased sensation. In those patients treated with surgical intervention, common postoperative complications include hardware irritation and stiffness.
