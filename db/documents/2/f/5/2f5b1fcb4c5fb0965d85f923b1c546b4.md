PCOs can be performed overall multiple levels allowing for a smooth or harmonious restoration of sagittal balance. Generally, one level of PCO will result in 10 degrees of correction. Approximately 1 mm of resection will result in 1 degree of correction. This is ideal for cases of gradual correction, such as in Scheuermann Kyphosis. It also can be used as an adjunct at additional levels during more complex deformity corrections.

PSO is best suited for patients with a significant and rigid sagittal imbalance. The PSO can result in approximately 30 degrees of correction with maximum bony resection. They are best performed at the apex of a sharp deformity.

VCR is best suited for the most complex spinal deformities. This includes rigid multiplanar deformity, fixed coronal imbalance, hemivertebra excisions, and sharp angular deformities. Correction of up to 35 to 60 degrees can be obtained.
