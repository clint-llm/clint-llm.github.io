Traditionally, bilateral 4-gland exploration was the procedure of choice for hyperparathyroidism. However, because a single adenoma causes 85% of the disease, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is emerging as the gold standard for parathyroid adenoma.

Due to the short half-life of PTH, the Miami criteria dictates that the PTH level should decrease by at least 50% within 10 minutes of adenoma removal. If this value is not met, further exploration is warranted. Missing glands can be found in the retropharyngeal or retro-esophageal planes, posterior mediastinum, thymus, mediastinum, inside the thyroid capsule or gland, or in the carotid sheath.
