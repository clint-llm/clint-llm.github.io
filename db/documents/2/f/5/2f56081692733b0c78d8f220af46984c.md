The external iliac artery is the major artery responsible for blood supply to the lower extremities. At the level of the inguinal ligament, the external iliac artery becomes the common femoral artery. This artery then becomes the superficial femoral artery, which at the adductor canal becomes the popliteal artery. The popliteal artery, found in the popliteal fossa, is the primary supply of blood to the distal lower extremity.
