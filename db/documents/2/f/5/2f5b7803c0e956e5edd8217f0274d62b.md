As healthcare costs continue to soar, it is the responsibility of healthcare providers to order advanced imaging judiciously. Not all facilities have access to MRI, and, as mentioned, there are strong preliminary imaging modalities widely available that can guide care and treatment. The clinician can inquire if the clinical question was addressed on recent existing imaging. Conversation with your radiology colleagues can also answer if the exam being ordered is appropriate.

While MRI is our most technologically advanced modality, it is not appropriate in all situations. Medicare spends $10 billion annually on imaging, a good portion of which is repeat or unnecessary imaging.
