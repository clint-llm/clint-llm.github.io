A diagnosis of diverticulosis often requires interdisciplinary care. Primary care doctors are front line providers who see these patients. Gastroenterologists and general surgeons get involved if the diverticular disease gets complicated. Infectious disease helps determine what antibiotics would help patients with the right selection of antibiotics if the disease is refractory to standard regimens.
