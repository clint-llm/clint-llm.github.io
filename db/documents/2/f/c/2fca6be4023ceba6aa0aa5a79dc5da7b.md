The network of lymphatic vessels and LNs extends throughout the entire body to support the proper function of its immune system along with the absorption of dietary fats and fluid homeostasis. Unlike arteries and veins, lymphatics are blind-ending vessels that transport interstitial fluid, immune cells, and macromolecules, collectively called lymph, through LNs and back to the chest for return into the blood supply via the subclavian veins. Lymph originates when blood plasma leaks out of capillaries and into the interstitial space. Along with the normal macromolecules and lymphocytes within the plasma, dead cells and material that may be harmful to the body such as bacteria, viruses, and tumor cells also leak out, and in turn, enter the lymph. The fluid and cells are transported back to the chest by the lymphatic vessels. Along the way, nodes, like those found in the mediastinum, sample the lymph, filtering out potential threats and unwanted cellular debris before it re-enters the blood supply. Macrophages within the lymph nodes phagocytize these unwanted substances and then break them down for recycling by the body. T-lymphocytes sample antigens from pathogens and interact with B cells to initiate clonal expansion for antibody production. With immune cell activation, LNs grown as cells within the divide. Rapid growth can cause pain, while slow mitotic activity (often seen with cancer) results in painless lymphadenopathy.
