Examination of peripheral blood smears can be beneficial in distinguishing various causes of neutrophilia. Platelet clumping can be seen on peripheral smears in factitious neutrophilia. Myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and increased band forms are seen in severe infections or CML. The presence of toxic granulations and Dohle bodies can also be seen in various infectious and inflammatory states.

Granulomatous diseases are characterized by granulomata, which are defined as the localized accumulation of activated epithelioid macrophages. In Leukocyte adhesion factor deficiency(LAD), marked neutrophilia accompanied by mild lymphocytosis can be seen even in the absence of any ongoing infection. If there is an ongoing infection, then biopsies of infected tissues can show inflammatory infiltrates devoid of neutrophils.
