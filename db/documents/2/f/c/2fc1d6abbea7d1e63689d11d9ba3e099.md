Treatment ofÂ intracranial hypotension is related to the underlying cause. In cases of benign ICH and CSF leak, conservative measures are preferred initially, as many patients respond to such without undergoing surgical intervention. Effective therapies include bed rest, good oral hydration, caffeine supplementation, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and abdominal binders. If conservative measures fail to improve symptoms, more invasive treatment such as lumbar epidural blood patch (EBP) and less commonly, continuous epidural saline infusion and surgical repair of the leak are performed. Epidural blood patches have been found effective in most patients but can recur in days to weeks.
