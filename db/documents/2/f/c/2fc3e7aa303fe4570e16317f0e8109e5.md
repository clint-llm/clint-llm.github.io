Nausea is the most common symptom in gastroparesis. Other common symptoms include vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness, and bloating. Vomitus often contains undigested chewed food. Both weight loss and weight gain can occur. Wide glycemic fluctuations can also happen in gastroparesis.

Factors that may trigger an exacerbation of diabetic gastroparesis include uncontrolled blood glucose levels, medication noncompliance or intolerance, adrenal insufficiency, and infection.
