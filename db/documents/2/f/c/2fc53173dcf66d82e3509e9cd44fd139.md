**Neural Mechanisms**

Campbell and Green defined the neural mechanism for CS. They proposed different visual channels for handling the information about various bands of spatial frequencies.

For coarse gratings,  the central and peripheral retina has equal contrast sensitivity per unit area of the retina, but the more the area stimulated greater the CS. In peripheral retinal diseases, the CS is reduced, and low-frequency grating use help to provide a quick check of peripheral retinal function.

Campbell and Robson proposed that independent mechanisms in the nervous system exist that are highly sensitive to a limited range of spatial frequencies. There is selective orientation and transfer of interocular adaptation effect in the visual cortex at the site of neurons. This helped explain the vital role of these interactions in complex image recognition and magnification generalization.

**M and P Pathways**

The ganglion cells are subdivided into

- **P cells**- These cells have a high spatial resolution

- **p cells**- These cells are small and slow conducting cells that give input to the parvocellular layer of the lateral geniculate body.

- **M cells**- These cells have higher CS and temporal resolution and lower spatial resolution.

- **m cells**- These are large and flat conducting axons that provide input to the magnocellular layers

**Channel Theory**

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is susceptible to particular spatial frequency and is a function of several independent and parallel detecting mechanisms. The visual system is split up into several spatial frequency components separately, and the information is further transmitted into various channels in the cortex, where it is transformed.

The visual system is composed of 4 to 6 spatial frequency channels. The CSF channels depend on a series of ganglion cells with varied receptive fields so that they have maximum sensitivity to various spatial frequencies. A partial response is obtained from the ganglion cells when the stimulus size is smaller than the central receptive field. When the stimulus size is larger than the central receptive field, the response from the ganglion cells is reduced.
