Dextromethorphan received FA approval in 1958. Recreational misuse began shortly thereafter. Drug companies attempted to blunt its misuse by developing liquid formations that required consumption of a significant amount for CNS effects to be achieved. However, misuse was still common. In the United States, abuse of dextromethorphan leads to approximately 6000 emergency department visits a year.
