**Approaches**

Hysteroscopy offers the advantage of the ability to perform in the office setting with minimal to no sedation with a paracervical block and avoidance of incisions and intra-abdominal entry with its attendant risks.

Laparoscopy offers the advantage of immediate efficacy and ability to evaluate the pelvis.

Minilaparotomy is used for postpartum sterilizations, in patients who have significant risks with laparoscopy, or as an interval procedure in low-resource settings.
