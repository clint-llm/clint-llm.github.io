Any permanent difference in the nucleotide sequence of a gene concerning a reference genome merits consideration as a genetic change or mutation. All changes identified following the tiered protocol must be confirmed by sequencing, and their pathogenic role in disease has to be determined.

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommends following this nomenclature and classification for the findings of genetics tests, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. The application of NGS has enhanced our comprehension of genetic diseases but also has driven the simultaneous identification of numerous genetic variants whose role in disease needs to be carefully studied.

Molecular genetic testing had accelerated progress with the incorporation of PCR on it, and this was followed by a giant step when next-generation sequencing allowed the generation of genome-wide data.
