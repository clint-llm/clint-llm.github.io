Regional anesthesia using upper extremity peripheral nerve blocks can complement general anesthesia and is effective as surgical and postoperative analgesia. Using nerve blocks to target the brachial plexus reduces intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements and decreases opioid-related adverse effects like respiratory depression, oversedation, and nausea and vomiting. Ultrasound guidance has become the standard of care when performing the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary blocks. This multimodal pain management has also been shown to increase both patient and surgeon satisfaction. This activity reviews the techniques of upper limb regional anesthesia, its indications, contraindications, and complications. The activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring the safe delivery of the analgesic agent and improving outcomes in patients undergoing procedures of the upper limb.

**Objectives:**
- Apply the anatomy of the brachial plexus to the techniques of upper extremity regional anesthesia.
- Implement best practices when performing the interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, and axillary nerve blocks.
- Report the contraindications and complications of the 4 discussed upper limb anesthetic procedures.
- Apply interprofessional team strategies for improving the care of patients receiving upper extremity regional anesthesia.
