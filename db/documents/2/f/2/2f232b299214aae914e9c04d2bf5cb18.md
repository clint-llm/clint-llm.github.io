It is vital for clinicians, including nurse practitioners, to recognize early signs of inflammation in a joint, especially septic arthritis. Joint aspiration should take place, and the patient started immediately on antibiotics if the fluid reveals the presence of bacteria. Early interventions can lower morbidity and mortality for patients.

All patients need to follow up to ensure that the condition is not worsening. Some patients may benefit from temporary offloading of the extremity, and others may require an ambulatory device. Physical therapy is recommended for all patients to regain muscle strength and joint function. The pharmacist should educate the patient on pain management. The dietitian should recommend a weight loss program if obese and consumption of a healthy diet. Finally, the nurse should educate the patient on safe sex practicies to prevent gonococcal arthritis.

Monoarticular arthritis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, therapists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
