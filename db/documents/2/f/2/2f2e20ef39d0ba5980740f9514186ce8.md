Women known to have preeclampsia may develop eclamptic, generalized, tonic-clonic seizures that conclude with no persistent neurologic deficit, meaning they do not deserve diagnostic evaluation beyond that performed for preeclampsia. A preeclampsia workup would include evaluating renal function, liver function, complete blood count, and imaging of the fetoplacental unit. Obstetric ultrasound imaging of the fetus includes an assessment of fetal growth as well as fetal health (biophysical profile and as indicated umbilical artery cord Doppler studies), including fetal heart rate strip.

- Persistent neurologic deficits

- ProlongedÂ loss of consciousness

- The onset of seizures is 48 hours beyond delivery.

- An eclamptic seizure occurs before 20 weeks.

- Recurrent seizures despite adequate magnesium sulfate therapy
