The word “dizziness” is very vague and may be described differently among patients. Patients may characterize it as light-headedness, faintness, nausea, or an unsteady feeling. On the other hand, true vertigo is a spinning sensation of movement and more suggestive of vestibular disease. Complicating the diagnosis of vertigo is the fact that the above sensations often accompany vestibular disease. These demonstrate is why the management of vestibular vertigo requires the effort of a collaborative interprofessional healthcare team.

The main concern in a patient presenting with acute vertigo is a vascular accident of the cerebellum or brainstem. However, vestibular neuritis is distinguishable from a central cause such as a cerebrovascular event with the use of the HINTS exam either by a specialist or someone specifically trained in the examination. In these patients, a referral to an ENT colleague is a strong recommendation.

A pharmacist can perform medication reconciliation to see if any drugs are known to cause vertigo, and if the clinician initiates pharmaceutical therapy for the vertigo, the pharmacist can verify dosing and counsel the patient on administration, adverse effects, etc. Nursing can monitor treatment progress, answer patient questions, check and reinforce administration, and report any concerns to the treating clinician.

Vestibular neuritis is a self-limiting disease with vestibular symptoms lasting for one to two days, followed by a gradual reduction in symptoms. Rarely does the illness lasts more than several days to a few weeks. Early improvement in symptoms is believed mainly due to central compensation. For this reason, symptomatic treatment with medications is stopped within the first 48 to  72 hours of the patient’s symptoms as it may interfere with central compensation and long-term recovery.

Most patients will experience vestibular neuritis only once, with some experiencing a residual imbalance and nonspecific dizziness persisting for months. If this occurs, the vestibular function can substantially be improved if patients follow through an individually designed vestibular rehabilitation program. The interprofessional team can guide these cases to their optimal result through open communication and collaborative teamwork. [Level 5]
