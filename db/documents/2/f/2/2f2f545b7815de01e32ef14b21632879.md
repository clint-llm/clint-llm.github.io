Patients presenting with atlantoaxial instability can suffer from a spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms, although most are asymptomatic.****

- Neck pain

- Restricted neck movements

- Pyramidal signs and myelopathy

- Lower cranial nerve palsies

- Respiratory failure

- Vertebral artery dissection

- Quadriplegia

- Death

Atlantoaxial instability is seldom discovered incidentally during radiologic evaluation for acute neck injuries. Clinicians must obtain a complete history to guide adequate management. The history should include a review of any current or past neck trauma, head injury, or fall. This is especially crucial when evaluating children, where prior spinal trauma may result in an improperly healed odontoid process injury leading to mechanical instability and/or neurological symptoms in later years.
