Nasal polyps are usually a manifestation of the underlying disease process; therefore, complications are usually determined by the underlying problem. Patients with nasal polyps have obstructive nasal symptoms with impaired sleep and, to a lesser extent, chronic fatigue. Nasal polyps can obstruct the paranasal sinuses drainage pathways facilitating the formation of mucoceles.

Mucoceles can be responsible for the compression of orbital structures, causing exophthalmos, diplopia, and unsightly appearance. Some patients may have such an extensive disease that their QOL is severely compromised. In such a scenario, nasal polyps might result in irreversible anosmia.Â Also, it has been described that nasal polyps contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
