Disk batteries (or button batteries) are found in many consumer electronics. The last few decades have seen an increase in demand for compact electronic products with a broadened use of larger and more powerful batteries. With the rise in the use of button batteries, the incidence of battery ingestion has also increased. Disk batteries can cause serious injury when aspirated or swallowed. Most ingestions occur in small children. This review presents the pathophysiology of disk battery ingestion, the epidemiology, presentation, and management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of disk battery ingestion.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with disk battery ingestion.
- Review the treatment and management options available for disk battery ingestion.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with disk battery ingestion.
