The pyramidal tract arises from layer-V pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. In humans, the pyramidal tract is one of the last developing descending pathways. While the fibers of the pyramidal tract reach the pyramidal decussation by the eighth week of fertilization, the actual development takes much longer, and full myelination does not fully complete until between 2 and 3 years of age. A multitude of genes guides this developmental process. However, much of this process is still being researched and is not fully known.
