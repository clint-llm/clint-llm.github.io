Underlying the pathogenesis of prosthetic joint infection is the simple fact that prostheses are foreign bodies and they can promote the formation of biofilm by several notable organisms. These organisms form communities in a hydrated polymeric matrix on implant surfaces and necrotic tissues. These bacterial aggregates with their inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents are the main culprit for prosthetic joint infection Staphylococcus aureus, a notable player in prosthetic joint infections may form small colony variants that often grow slowly and are associated with recurrent and difficult-to-treat infections. It takes four weeks for maturation of biofilms

**Haematogenous spread**with the following are the most commonly encountered foci for infection along with the most commonly involved organisms

- Skin and soft tissue infections (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus).

- Respiratory tract infections (e.g. Streptococcus pneumonia).

- Urinary tract infections (e.g. Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp.).

- Gastrointestinal infections (e.g. Bacteroides, Salmonella, Streptococcus gallolyticus)

- Dental procedures (e.g. Viridans streptococci).

- Infected intra-vascular devices (e.g Staphylococcus epidermidis).

**Direct spread**through a route communicating the prosthesis and the outer environment e.g Sinus tract or open periprosthetic fracture.

**Local spread**from a nearby septic focus e.g  osteomyelitis or soft tissue infection.
