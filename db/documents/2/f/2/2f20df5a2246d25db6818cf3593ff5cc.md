Protein is an essential nutrient for the health and development of our bodies. The general complications of protein intolerances leading to protein deficiency are loss of muscle mass, delayed growth, failure to thrive, and a weakened immune system. Affected individuals may have symptoms such as swelling in the legs, face, and other parts, dry and brittle hair, fatigue, and frequent infections.

In adults, allergic reactions to cow's milk proteins are often complicated by lactose intolerance, which increases with age. IgE-mediated allergic conditions may cause anaphylactic reactions and angioedema, which can be life-threatening without management. Diarrhea and vomiting associated with FPIES and eosinophilic gastroenteritis may lead to complications, including severe dehydration and hypovolemic shock.
