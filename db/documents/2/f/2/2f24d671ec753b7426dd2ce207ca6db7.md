Histologically, LE specific cutaneous findings share many features, but systemic lupus erythematosus has some distinct findings. Most characteristic findings are moderate hyperkeratosis with focal disorientation, interface dermatitis, and peri-appendageal mononuclear cell infiltrate confined to the superficial dermis. Basement membrane thickening is usually not seen in SCLE, Â dermal edema may be noted. The inflammatory infiltrate of the interface dermatitis consists mainly of activated T cells and macrophages.
