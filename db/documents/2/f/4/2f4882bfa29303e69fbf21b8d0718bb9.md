Certain medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), will falsely decrease CRP levels. Statins, as well,Â have been known to reduce CRP levels falsely. Recent injury or illness can falsely elevate levels, particularly when using this test for cardiac risk stratification. Magnesium supplementation also can decrease CRP levels.

As mentioned above, mild elevations in CRP can be seen without any systemic or inflammatory disease. Females and elderly patients have higher levels of CRP. Obesity, insomnia, depression, smoking, and diabetes can all contribute to mild elevations in CRP, and the results shall be interpreted with caution in individuals with these comorbidities.
