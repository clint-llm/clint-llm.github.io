Nuclear medicine and other radiological techniques impart some ionizing radiation exposure to patients. Within the pediatric population, the disease distribution of pathology is also different compared to adults. With this in mind, applications differ slightly compared to the adult population. This article outlines the appropriate use of nuclear medicine techniques in the pediatric population.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the concept of standard of care and problem-solving exams in pediatric nuclear medicine.
- Summarize high yield exams in pediatric nuclear medicine.
- Outline the applications of Nuclear medicine in pediatric oncology.
- Describe the optimal strategy to address radiation exposure in pediatric nuclear medicine.
