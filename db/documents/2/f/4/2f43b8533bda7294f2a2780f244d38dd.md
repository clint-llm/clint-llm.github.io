Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous acquired or hereditary disease that results from the abnormal deposition of beta-sheet fibrillar protein aggregates in various tissues. This disease can be localized or systemic with amyloid accumulating in the spleen, liver, kidney, blood vessels and nerves. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of amyloidosis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of amyloidosis.
- Review the pathophysiology of amyloidosis.
- Summarize the treatment of amyloidosis using the Standard Mayo Clinic staging system.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for those affected by amyloidosis.
