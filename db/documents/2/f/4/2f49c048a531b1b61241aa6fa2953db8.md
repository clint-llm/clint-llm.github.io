Since severe upper airway obstruction can cause death within minutes, a rapid and efficient approach is critical in suspected cases.  Stridor should be recognizable by all staff, from respiratory therapists and nursing staff to physicians of all specialties. All Emergency Department and ward staff should be aware that it is imperative to contact the airway team on-call in the case of new-onset stridor in the setting of respiratory distress. In light of this, it is important for healthcare staff to regularly undergo Basic Life Support (BLS) training.
