The most significant component of evaluation for a patient who presents with signs and symptoms of sinus bradycardia is history and physical assessment. These should include vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate) and an electrocardiogram. During assessment it should be established whether the patient is hemodynamically unstable, evaluation for this includes high blood pressure, altered mental status or difficulty breathing. If the patient is healthy, athletic and has no symptoms then sinus bradycardia may be a normal finding for the patient. On the contrary, in older individuals, sinus bradycardia may point towards an unhealthy sinus node. Patients with congestive heart failure often have sinus bradycardia. These patients may have compromised blood supply from the right coronary artery or left circumflex artery to the sinus node secondary to some underlying ischemic heart disease.
