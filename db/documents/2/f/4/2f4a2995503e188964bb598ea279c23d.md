Low von Willebrand factor is quite common in the general population, but not all patients have clinically significant bleeding issues. Therefore, a significant proportion of the patient population goes undiagnosed. Most cases are diagnosed formally after investigating significant bleeding problems such as recurrent and excessive bruising, prolonged bleeding from minor skin trauma, and prolonged bleeding from mucosal surfaces (epistaxis, dental extractions, menstruation).

The physical examination can often be normal. Sometimes evidence of bleeding/bruising (petechiae, hematomas) may be noted.

In the case of a qualitative defect, von Willebrand disease may mimic hemophilia and predominantly present with bleeding into soft tissues, joints, and hematuria rather than mucocutaneous bleeding. Sometimes, type 2N von Willebrand disease is misdiagnosed as hemophilia.
