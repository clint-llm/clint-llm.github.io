Montelukast administration is via the oral route, without regard to food or meals. It should be taken a single dose in the evening in patients with asthma and both asthma and allergic rhinitis. For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, administration can be either morning or evening. It should be taken at least two hours before exercise to prevent exercise-induced asthma. Patients should not take another dose within 24 hours.

Zafirlukast is administered orally. It should be taken 2 hours after or 1 hour before meals because food decreases bioavailability by 40%.
