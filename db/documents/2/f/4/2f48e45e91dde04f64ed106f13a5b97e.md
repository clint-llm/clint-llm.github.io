Pronator teres syndrome is a compressive neuropathy of the median nerve as it travels between the two heads of the pronator teres. Its clinical manifestations include pain, paresthesias, and weakness.

Although most patients improve with conservative measures, surgical decompression may be an option in severe forms of this syndrome or for those who failed conservative treatment. Surgery aims to decompress the median nerve between the two heads of the pronator teres. The superficial facia of the pronator teres is first released. This can be followed by either partial or complete resection of tendon origin, depending on the extent of median nerve compression.

Patients undergoing this surgery show good outcomes demonstrating improvement in the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) survey score and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score.

Medial epicondylitis, also known as golfer’s elbow, is a condition characterized by pain along the medial aspect of the elbow. The pain often has an insidious onset and is worsened by forearm pronation or wrist flexion. The pronator teres is often implicated as a source of pathology in this condition. The mainstay of treatment is conservative and thus includes stretching and strengthening exercises, but surgical interventions aimed at excising abnormal tissue, which may involve the pronator teres, can improve patients’ pain and functional status in recalcitrant cases.
