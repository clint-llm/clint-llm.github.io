If a clinician clinically suspects SMA following a thorough history and clinical exam, genetic testing is usually sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of SMA.

Other diagnostic tests are options if initial genetic testing fails to detect homozygous SMN1 gene exon 7 deletion:

- Creatinine kinase - normal (although can be very mildly elevated)

- Nerve conduction studies- sensory nerves demonstrate normal action potentials, motor nerves may show diminished motor action potentials

- Needle electromyography (EMG) - SMA type I: denervation changes without reinnervation. SMA II+III: Neurogenic patterns (action potentials with prolonged duration, increased amplitude, and diminished recruitment)

- Muscle biopsy - mostly obsolete as a diagnostic tool due to advances in genetic and less invasive testing but when performed in a patient with SMA shows a neurogenic pattern
