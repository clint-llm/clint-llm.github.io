Following the eradication of poliovirus, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause of acute or subacute, flaccid neuromuscular weakness worldwide; however, other disorders may mimic GBS. If flaccid weakness occurs in a critically ill patient with multiorgan involvement, critical illness neuropathy and myopathy should be considered. Other etiologies that may mimic GBS include tick paralysis. There would be an initial presentation of neuromuscular junction disorder, acute intermittent porphyria, HIV infection, spinal cord disorders, toxic neuropathies, and even infections (such as West Nile virus or rabies). Some atypical clinical features should lead providers to consider other diagnoses. These include early bowel and bladder involvement, asymmetric features, and hyperreflexia or normal reflexes.

Distinguishing GBS from its mimics would require a thoughtful evaluation of history, clinical presentation, and ancillary data. Regarding the clinical presentation, the presence of dilated pupils may be more suggestive of tick paralysis or botulism. Ancillary testing such as electromyography and nerve conduction studies may distinguish GBS from critical illness neuropathy/myopathy, along with history and clinical context. Cerebrospinal fluid testing showing pleocytosis rather than the classic albuminocytologic dissociation may lead to further consideration of infectious etiologies such as HIV or West Nile Virus infection.
