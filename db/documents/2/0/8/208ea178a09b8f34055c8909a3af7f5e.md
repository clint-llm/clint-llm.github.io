Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is a benign disease. Reports exist of concomitant nephropathy in a few cases, but the association is not all that common. According to the location of the lesions, complications may present. Rectal bleeding was reported in colonic ALHE. Orbital ALHE can present with proptosis, diplopia and blurred vision. Arterial ALHE can result in compressing proximal nerves: there are prior reports of entrapment of the ulnar nerve resulting in paresthesia and tactile dysesthesia of the involved area. Arterial ALHE can also cause complete occlusion of the vessel lumen leading to chronic ischemia. A case of cardiac ALHE presented with supraventricular arrhythmia.
