Primary dysmenorrhea is diagnosed, depending upon the history and physical examination.

- A pelvic examination is important for evaluating dysmenorrhoea if the history of onset and duration of lower abdominal pain suggests secondary dysmenorrhoea or if the dysmenorrhea is not responding to medical treatment.

- The use of ultrasound in the evaluation of primary dysmenorrhea has little significance. However, ultrasound can be useful in differentiating secondary dysmenorrhea and causes that include endometriosis and adenomyosis.

- The pregnancy tests using urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (B-HCG) are useful in history suggestive of suspected pregnancy.

- Patients who are at risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or when pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is suspected will need endocervical or vaginal swabs.

- If indicated by clinical examination and history, to rule out suspected malignancy cervical cytology samples may be required.

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Doppler ultrasonography may be required if torsion of adnexa, adenomyosis, or deep pelvic endometriosis is suspected or if there are inconclusive findings on the transvaginal ultrasonography.

- Laparoscopy may be indicated when all the non-invasive investigations have been carried out and the cause remains unknown.
