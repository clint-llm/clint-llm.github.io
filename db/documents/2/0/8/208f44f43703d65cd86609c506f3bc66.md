In addition to a complete history and physical examination, laboratory and radiologic examinations are important. Laboratory studies include a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, HIV testing in specific cases, anoscopy, and anal mass biopsy or fine-needle aspiration, as well as imaging as indicated, including CT or PET scan or an MRI. Imaging is imperative, specifically when metastatic disease is suspected. Moreover, if the diagnosis of anal cancer is confirmed, testing for HPV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia is recommended.
