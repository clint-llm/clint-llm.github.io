Following acute trauma to the hand, simple preventative measures such as elevation to reduce swelling and appropriate splinting can help reduce the extent of stiffness that occurs. If splinting is indicated acutely for pain relief and to allow for healing, the hand should be placed into a position of safe immobilization with the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints at 70 to 90 degrees of flexion, interphalangeal (IP) joints in full extension, and the wrist in 0 to 30 degrees of extension.

Once the hand has become stiff, treatment options include non-operative measures such as range of motion exercises, static and dynamic splints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to reduce inflammation and, therefore, the risk of developing stiffness. The principle for splinting is that of low-load with prolonged stress.

Operative intervention is required if non-operative management has failed to provide an acceptable restoration of function. The potential for patient benefit from an operation needs to be balanced with the generation of further scar tissue and the potential devascularization, which comes with surgery.
