Pelvic ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice to evaluate the uterus, cervix, ovaries, and adnexa. In the postmenopausal patient, it is performed for a variety of reasons, but most often for the evaluation of postmenopausal bleeding or an adnexal mass. This activity reviews pelvic ultrasound in the postmenopausal patient and highlights the interprofessional team's role in performing and evaluating these imaging studies.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the normal findings seen on ultrasound in postmenopausal women.
- Outline the workup of a patient with postmenopausal bleeding and the role of ultrasound in that evaluation.
- Review the ideal technique to measure endometrial thickness while performing pelvic ultrasound.
- Review how ultrasound can be used to characterize adnexal masses in postmenopausal patients.
