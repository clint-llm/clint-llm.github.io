While the filtration-reabsorption balance model is the classically taught version, recent studies have shown that it has limitations in accurately depicting microcirculation in most tissues. Michael and Phillips challenged the traditional model when they used capillaries of frog mesentery to demonstrate that fluid absorption occurred transiently when hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (Pc) fell below plasma oncotic pressure (πc). In the steady-state, though, the fluid dynamics changed. When hydrostatic pressure in the capillary (Pc) was lower than plasma oncotic pressure (πc) in this setting, no absorption occurred. This evidence that capillaries in low-pressure organ systems can absorb fluid only transiently and not continuously made it apparent that an additional factor that influences dynamics, namely the interplay between oncotic pressure of the interstitium and capillary filtration rate.
