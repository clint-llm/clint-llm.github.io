Inter-facility transport has the potential for complications, especially in an emergency setting. Healthcare providers need to learn about the system, understand optimal uses, coordinate with administrative personnel for preplanning, and consider the risk-benefits when contemplating transfer.

The use of inter-facility transport is worthwhile even without established planning. Investigation of the benefit of interfacility transport services, using the delta REMS score, showed that non-optimal utilization was not associated with patient deterioration.

Another area with an opportunity for improvement is the inter-facility transportation systems. A lack of research and literature makes the development of an optimal setup unlikely in the near future. Improvements at the level of the transport service may not be implemented as efficiently as hospital safety programs due to limited data, management, and finances.
