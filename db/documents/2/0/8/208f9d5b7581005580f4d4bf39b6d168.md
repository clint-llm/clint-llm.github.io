It is essential to understand the embryological development of the human ear to understand the pathogenesis of congenital aural atresia, whether in isolation or in conjunction with other craniofacial abnormalities. The external ear collectively develops from contributions of the first and second pharyngeal arches and the first pharyngeal cleft.

The auricular portion of the external ear begins to develop during week six of gestation. The six hillocks of His are six small buds of mesenchyme, which arise from the first and second pharyngeal arches. Each of these six hillocks is believed to be responsible for developing a portion of the auricle.

During the fourth week of gestation, the external auditory canal portion of the external ear begins to arise from the first pharyngeal cleft (or groove). This ectodermal structure begins to migrate towards the pharyngeal pouch endoderm until it is interrupted by mesoderm.

As evidenced by the intricate orchestration of the embryologic derivatives, an atretic external ear canal can also present with microtia through aberrant interactions of the pharyngeal arches and clefts. Similarly, other pharyngeal arch abnormalities may be present such as mandibular hypoplasia, cleft palate, profound hearing loss, and in some cases, airway compromise.
