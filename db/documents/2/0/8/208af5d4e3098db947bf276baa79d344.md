Significant pre-operative planning by the surgeon must be undertaken. For complex deformity correction, this can occur with the help of formal 3D models. A growing quantity of literature documents that team-based care is necessary for these cases to improve operative outcomes, reduce blood loss, and prevent infection. During the case, it becomes important for the surgeon to communicate and realize the portion of the procedure where he or she could stop and stage the operation if necessary. This can become a safety check.

From the patient’s perspective, all medical co-morbidities should be controlled. Meeting with the pre-operative team to ensure proper medical management in the adult population is critical. This is even more vital in the pediatric population, who might be prone to respiratory issues and malnutrition pre-operatively. Certain patients in the pediatric population benefit from gravity traction for a prolonged period prior to surgery. There should be an absolute emphasis on proper discussion with the patient and the patient’s family to manage and describe proper expectations for the pre-operative, operative, and post-operative course.
