Hyperkyphosis, in general, increases with age, especially after the age of 40, and the prevalence is about 20% to 40% in adults 60 years or older.

In Scheuermannâ€™s disease, the prevalence is about 0.4% to 8% in the United States, with males being twice as likely to have it compared to females. Most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 13 to 16 years old and are rarely diagnosed under the age of 10.
