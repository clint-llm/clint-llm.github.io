These cells lack typical enterocyte glycoproteins, mainly alkaline phosphatase and sucrase-isomaltase. These are used as negative markers for the identification of M cells. Due to their shortened, irregular microvilli, M cells also stain poorly for actin, villi, and other microvilli-associated proteins. This lack of villous staining can be further used to identify M cells.
