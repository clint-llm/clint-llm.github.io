Obeticholic acid is available as a 5 or 10-milligram oral tablet for patients with PBC with inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA. The inadequate response is defined as ALP greater than 1.67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or elevated bilirubin greater than two times the ULN after one year of treatment with UDCA.

When treating patients with severe liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or C) or with a prior hepatic decompensation event, the recommendation is to begin with the 5 mg tablet once weekly, and if needed and well-tolerated, it can be increased to 5 mg twice weekly with a minimum of 3 days apart for each dose.

The maximum dose for Child-Pugh Class B or C or patients with a prior decompensation event is 10 mg twice weekly. Obeticholic acid can be taken with or without food. OCA should be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours or more after ingesting the bile acid resin if the patient is on a bile-acid binding resin.

OCA with doses varying from the FDA approved are also being evaluated. A double-blind study with patients with PBC that had an inadequate response to UDCA demonstrated that once-daily doses of OCA ranging from 10 to 50 mg for three months improved ALP levels γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alanine aminotransferase.

There is limited human data on the use of OCA during pregnancy, lactation, and in the pediatric population.
