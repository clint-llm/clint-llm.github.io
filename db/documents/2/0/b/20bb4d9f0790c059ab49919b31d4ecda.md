Here are some complications ofÂ LeFort osteotomy:

- Incomplete skeletal growth/skeletal immaturity

- Severe and/or uncontrolled periodontal disease

- progressive dentofacial deformities (e.g. condylar hyperplasia, idiopathic condylar resorption)

- bone/joint diseases (e.g. osteoporosis, osteopenia)

- medical comorbidities (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, immunocompromise)

- poor nutritional status (hypoalbuminemia)

Contraindications should be considered relative in nature and in certain scenarios may conversely be an indication for the surgery. Thus the surgeon must perform a thorough pre-operative evaluation and ensure that informed consent is obtained from the patient, parent, or legal guardian regarding risks, benefits, and potential complications before proceeding with surgery.
