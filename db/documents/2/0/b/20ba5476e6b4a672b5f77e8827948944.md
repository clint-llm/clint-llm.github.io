Prior to using the mass spectrometer, a sample must be prepared for it to be ionized. Thus, samples are either in the liquid or gaseous phase by utilizing chromatography techniques. The two types of chromatography procedures that are used to prepare the sample are gas chromatography and liquid chromatography.

**Gas Chromatography**

Gas chromatography separates components of a mixture of gases and filters the passage of these molecules based on physical characteristics like shape, size, molecular weight, and boiling point. A sample is diluted and vaporized in the chromatograph, where it is separated. After separation, the gases enter the mass spectrometer for analysis. Notably, a gas chromatography sample must be volatile, meaning it must enter the gas phase so it does not break down while in the mass spectrometer apparatus.

**Liquid Chromatography**

Liquid chromatography separates samples based on interactions with the mobile and stationary phases. This can be based on polarities, meaning that if a component of the specimen has a different polarity compared to the mobile phase, it will migrate down the chromatograph column faster. The sampleÂ is separated into bands into individual components that can be further analyzed in mass spectrometry.

Other techniques used for sample preparation include electrospray ionization, which uses high voltages to separate out components, and fast atom bombardment, which uses a beam to generate ions from a solid phase.

The types of samples that can be analyzed within mass spectrometry include proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and fatty acids, to name a few.
