Plain radiographs can aid in the diagnosis of clinodactyly. A radial or ulnar curvature will be present, and a shortened middle phalanx will often be seen, which is typically shorter on the radial rather than the ulnar side. A C-shaped physis or delta phalanx may also be present on plain radiographs.
