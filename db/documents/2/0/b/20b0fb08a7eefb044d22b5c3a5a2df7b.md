**The Role Of Sugar In Dental Caries**

Dental caries occur when the demineralization of the enamel exceeds its demineralization capacity.

**Classification of Sugars**

The sugars most commonly found in an average diet are sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose, and maltose, from which some regard sucrose as the most cariogenic.

Natural sugars are those intrinsically found in the structure of fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, and dairy products.

Added sugars, also called free sugars by the WHO, are the sugars added to foods and drinks by manufacturers or cooks and sugars present in edible products other than fresh fruit, vegetables, milk, and grains

**Starchy Food**

Dietary starches refer to a variety of food rich in starch (a polymeric carbohydrate), including bread, pasta, potatoes, potato products, rice, oats, breakfast cereals, and other grains. Dietary starches are of low cariogenicity.

**The Adhesiveness of Sugar**

The adhesiveness of food is directly related to its cariogenic potential.

**The Amount and Frequency of Sugar Consumed**

It is well established that sugar consumption positively correlates with the development of dental caries.

Several studies evaluate the association between the amount and frequency of sugar intake and dental caries. For example, one study found that 3-year-old children that ingested sugars four to five times per day were six times more likely to have a high caries rate than children with the lowest frequency of sugar intake.

The “sugar-caries relationship” also depends on oral hygiene, fluoride exposure, and socio-economic status.

**Types of Sweeteners**

Sugar substitutes pose numerous benefits for preventing and controlling mainly diabetes mellitus, weight, and dental caries. This article will discuss the most important features of sugar substitutes concerning oral health. Of course, sugar substitutes need to be safe for consumption; they must be non-toxic, non-oncogenic, and nutritionally appropriate for the specific drink or food.

Sweeteners are substances that provide sweetness to food and drinks and are classified into two main types according to their caloric potential: caloric (carbohydrate-based) and non-caloric (non-carbohydrate based).

Table 1. Classification of sweeteners based on their caloric potential.

**Sucrose**

Sucrose is the most common dietary sugar.

**Sugar Alcohols**

Sugar alcohols result from reducing the carbonyl group of sugars.

They are not fermented or only a little by oral microorganisms; therefore, they are non-cariogenic.

All sugar alcohols, except erythritol, have been associated with unpleasant adverse effects, including abdominal discomfort and flatulence, and when taken in excess, they may induce diarrhea.

**Xylitol**

Xylitol is a non-cariogenic and antibacterial sugar alcohol.

Xylitol is believed to have an antimicrobial action on the biofilm. Studies have demonstrated that it impairs plaque formation and the adherence of bacteria.

However, the anti-cariogenic action of xylitol is still under study and is yet to be well supported by evidence.

**Non-caloric Sweeteners**

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the following non-caloric chemically synthesized sweeteners to be consumed in the United States: aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, and neotame.
