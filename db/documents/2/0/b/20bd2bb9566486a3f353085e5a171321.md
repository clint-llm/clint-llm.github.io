The precise pathophysiologic mechanism underlying Takotsubo cardiomyopathy remains elusive. Various hypotheses have been postulated and include elevated levels of circulating plasma catecholamines and their circulating metabolites due to underlying stress, microvascular dysfunction or microcirculatory disorder, inflammation, estrogen deficiency, spasm of the epicardial coronary vessels, and aborted myocardial infarction.

The role of inflammation in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is depicted by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which shows myocardial edema, necrosis, fibrosis, and late gadolinium enhancement.

An impaired microvascular function has also been demonstrated by measuring the index of microvascular resistance by introducing a pressure wire in the coronary arteries.
