Pertussis initially presents similarly to other respiratory infections, such as viral upper respiratory infection, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Key differentiating factors of pertussis include typical progression through the three phases and persistent cough without fever. Foreign body aspiration should be considered in younger patients, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be considered in older patients with the appropriate history. The striking leukocytosis may also be confused with leukemia.
