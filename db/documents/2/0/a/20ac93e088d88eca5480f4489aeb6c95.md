Hydrazine exposure is commonly seen in occupations involving the handling, production, and use of rocket fuel. Patients treated for tuberculosis and presenting with refractory seizures strongly suggests isoniazid overdose. Decontamination and good supportive care will manage most cases of hydrazine exposures.

Respiratory arrest and death are primarily secondary to the neurological sequelae of coma and refractory seizures and are treated with IV pyridoxine in addition to benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Admissions observing for delayed pulmonary edema is reasonable as it may occur up to 24 to 48 hours after inhalational exposure.
