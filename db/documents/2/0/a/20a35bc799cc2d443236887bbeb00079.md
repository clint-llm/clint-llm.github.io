Mucopolysaccharides are long-chain sugar molecules consisting of repeating disaccharide units. They are the main component of the extracellular matrix of connective tissue throughout the body, including the skin, joints, heart valves, eyes, and tendons. The breakdown of mucopolysaccharides starts in lysosomes.

Iduronate 2-sulfatase in the first enzyme involved in the catabolism of heparan and dermatan sulfate. It cleaves the O-linked sulfate moiety from the mucopolysaccharides. Absent or decreased activity of this enzyme results in excessive abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans, dermatan, and heparan sulfate in lysosomes. This causes hypertrophy and increases the number of lysosomes in the cells throughout the body. The increased accumulation of dermatan and heparan sulfate causes impaired cellular functions like cell adhesion, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking of different molecules, and intracellular ionic balance. It also promotes nitric oxide synthesis and inflammatory cascade, which have deleterious effects.

There is a secondary accumulation of gangliosides (GM2 and GM3) in the brain. It causes mitochondrial dysfunction and storage of impaired proteins in neurons resulting in activation of microglia and neuronal death. It involves generalized grey and white matter in the brain.
