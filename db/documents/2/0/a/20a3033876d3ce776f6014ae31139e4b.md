The precise incidence of tumor lysis syndrome is not known. There are inherent risk factors that can increase the incidence of tumor lysis syndrome, including but not limited to tumor burden, tumors with a high rate of proliferation, tumors with high sensitivity to chemotherapy, and preexisting renal disease or impairment of the patient. The predisposition to tumor lysis syndrome is not related to race or sex. In a study that queried the database of the National Inpatient Sample, the most common malignancies associated with tumor lysis syndrome include non-Hodgkin lymphoma (30%), solid tumors (20%), acute myeloid leukemia (19%), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (13%). The overall in-hospital mortality was approximately 21%.

Cairo et al. described the incidence of tumor lysis syndrome based on the risk stratification outlined above. The percentage expressed is the reported incidences of tumor lysis syndrome based on each specific malignancy, including:

**High-Risk Tumors**

- Acute lymphocytic leukemia (5.2% to 23%)

- Acute myeloid leukemia with a WBC count greater than 75,000 (18 %)

- B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (26.4%)

- Burkitt lymphoma (14.9%)

**Intermediate-Risk Tumors**

- Acute myeloid leukemia with WBC counts between 25,000 and 50,000 (6%)

- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (6%)

**Low-risk Tumors**

- Acute myeloid leukemia with WBC count less than 25,000 (1%)

- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.33%)

- Chronic myelogenous leukemia (Case reports)

- A solid tumor (Case reports)

Tumor lysis syndrome is most commonly associated with the initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, there are case reports of tumor lysis syndrome precipitated by radiation therapy, including the use of thalidomide, dexamethasone therapy, and the use of newer chemotherapeutic agents like rituximab and bortezomib.
