The presentations of macrocytic anemia are dependent on the underlying cause. Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency complain of mood disturbances and neurologic symptoms like loss of balance, memory loss, paresthesias, peripheral neuropathy. The remainder of symptoms is specific to the underlying cause (constitutional symptoms from primary bone marrow disease, gastrointestinal upset from enteral malabsorption, or hypoactive metabolism from hypothyroidism). Folate deficiency has common features except neuropsychiatric complaints. Prior surgeries include a gastric bypass for weight loss or ileal resection for colonic pathologies. Family or personal medical histories reveal autoimmune diseases or hemolytic anemias. Certain medical conditions require at-risk medications. Review of dietary intake reveals excessive alcohol consumption or limited food choices (“tea and toast”).

Physical exam may reveal nonspecific anemia findings (conjunctival pallor), neurologic deficits if vitamin B12 deficient (impaired proprioception or vibration, positive Romberg sign), and stigmata of underlying diseases (glossitis from autoimmune atrophic gastritis, hepatosplenomegaly from familial hemolytic anemias, hypopigmentation from vitiligo, or jaundice and spider angiomata from alcohol abuse).
