Cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) are striated, branched, contain many mitochondria, and are under involuntary control. Each myocyte contains a single, centrally located nucleus and is surrounded by a cell membrane known as the sarcolemma. The sarcolemma of cardiac muscle cells contains voltage-gated calcium channels, specialized ion channels that skeletal muscle does not possess.

Cardiac muscle cells contain branched fibers connected via intercalated discs that contain gap junctions and desmosomes. These interconnections allow the cardiomyocytes to contract together in a synchronized fashion to enable the heart to work as a pump.

The functional unit of cardiomyocyte contraction is the sarcomere, which consists of thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments, the interactions between which form the basis of the sliding filament theory.

The sarcolemma is the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane containing transverse tubules (t-tubules). These t-tubules are highly branched invaginations of the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma that function in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), action potential initiation and regulation, maintaining the resting membrane potential, and signal transduction. T-tubules regulate the cardiac ECC by concentrating voltage-gated L-type calcium channels and positioning them in close proximity to calcium sense and release channels, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), at the junctional membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
