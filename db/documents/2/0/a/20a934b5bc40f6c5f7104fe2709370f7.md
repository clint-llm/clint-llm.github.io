The retrobulbar block, initially described in 1884, had been widely referred to as the "gold standard" in ophthalmological surgery for many years. Though its rates of adverse effects are low, the introduction of newer techniques with potentially less adverse effects and similar anesthetic profiles has relegated the use of this regional anesthesia technique. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and potential complications of retrobulbar blockade and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving the care of patients undergoing ophthalmological surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of a retrobulbar block.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regard to the retrobulbar block.
- Identify the potential complications and clinical significance of the retrobulbar block.
- Implement interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance retrobulbar block and improve outcomes.
