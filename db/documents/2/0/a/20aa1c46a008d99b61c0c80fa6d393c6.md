The diagnosis of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is made after a detailed clinical history and physical exam. A family history of the disease is highly suggestive of the disorder. Genetic tests are available prenatally and postnatally for a definitive diagnosis. Prenatally, chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis can be done to obtain tissues for genetic testing.

Molecular genetic testing is available and tests for the SMN gene. Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is caused by partial or complete loss of SMN gene. Electromyography (EMG) testing can be helpful in identifying myopathic potentials, but due to the widespread availability of genetic testing, it is no longer used in the diagnosis of this condition.
