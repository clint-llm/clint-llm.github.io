The absolute contraindication of felodipine use includes hypersensitivity to felodipineÂ or excipients.

The relative contraindications for the use of felodipine include:

- **Liver failure:**Patients with liver failure cannot metabolize felodipine resulting in elevated plasma concentration of the medication.

- **Severe hypotension:**Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists should not be used in patients with severe hypotension as they may precipitate the condition and cause syncope.

- **Acute coronary syndrome:**Felodipine has a significant vasodilatory effect, which results in reflex tachycardia, which increases the myocardial oxygen demand and worsens myocardial ischemia.

- **Pregnancy and lactation:**In animal studies, felodipine has been shown to cause teratogenic effects, including digital anomalies and ossification of terminal phalanges. It is a former FDA pregnancy category C drug.
