Since cystitis cystica, cystitis glandularis, and nephrogenic adenomas may have the clinical or radiological appearance of a bladder malignancy or ureteral pseudotumors, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of possible urinary malignancies.

The histological examination confirms the final diagnosis. Assessment of the histological features of cystitis cystica facilitates its correct categorization and differentiation from adenocarcinoma of the bladder. Interprofessional collaboration is vital for the proper diagnosis and management for better outcomes.

Each team member must contribute from their area of expertise, monitor the patient's progress, record their observations in the patient's permanent medical record, and reach out to other team members as necessary so therapeutic modifications can be instituted if necessary. This interprofessional paradigm will lead to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Regarding the treatment, it is essential to eliminate any predisposing factor, either irritation, infection, or obstruction if possible. If no action is taken on these factors, the therapeutic and prophylactic measures listed will ultimately not beÂ effective. Follow-up should be arranged (typically every six months) in selected patients due to the possibility of bladder adenocarcinoma transformation and to detect any complications as early as possible.
