There are no American guidelines regarding the follow-up of the patient postoperatively. It is suggested that repeating biochemical tests be done after 14 days of tumor surgery. However, even if the result is normal, it does not mean that the tumor is completely resected. If plasma-free metanephrine or urinary fractioned metanephrine levels are elevated for about 3 months after surgical removal, this is an indication for repeat imaging.

European guidelines recommend annual, postoperative follow-up for 10 years with biochemical testing for any recurrence or metastasis. Patients who have familial pheochromocytoma should be followed annually for a lifetime. These recommendations are for patients who have abnormal biochemical tests preoperatively. Chromogranin A measurement should be used in the population having normal, preoperative, biochemical tests.
