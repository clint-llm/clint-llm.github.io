Suspected cases of HLH typically undergo a biopsy of either lymph nodes, bone marrow (BM), or spleen. The historical histopathologic finding is hemophagocytosis, in which macrophages are captured engulfing bone marrow cells. Although pathognomonic, this finding is not actually required for diagnosis. In fact, in patients who otherwise meet diagnostic criteria, pathologic review demonstrates hemophagocytosis present in only 67% of pediatric and 85% of adult cases.
