Dermoscopy reveals the following signs

- The disappearance of follicular orifices and discrete peri-follicular desquamation

- Marked perifollicular hyperkeratosis, more visible without immersion

- Perifollicular erythema more visible with non-contact dermatoscopy

- The disappearance of the follicular openings, which is not easy to highlight

Special examination of the frontal line is required, especially at the early stages of the disease.
