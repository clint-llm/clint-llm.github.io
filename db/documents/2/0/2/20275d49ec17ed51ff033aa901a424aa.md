Initial studies showed that felbamate carried relatively little systemic toxicity and less CNS depression when compared to the older generation AEDs. Common side effects include drowsiness, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, dizziness, and headache.

A rapid titration schedule can increase the risk of neurologic side effects. Decreasing the titration rate may reduce this risk. Somnolence is more likely to occur in the first 4 weeks of treatment and decreases with continued therapy.
