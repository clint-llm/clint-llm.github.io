The prognosis of PDS and PG is dependent on the level of IOP-associated risk factors like myopia and optic nerve damage. If the IOP is well controlled, the prognosis in the majority of cases is favorable. Permanent blindness is rare in these cases. The prognosis is also dependent on disease progression as the condition usually progresses very fast. Approximately 10% progress to PG after five years of PDS onset, and 15% progress to PG after ten years of the disease process. PDS patients with normal IOP and normal aqueous humor dynamics usually have a low risk for developing PG and have a favorable prognosis.
