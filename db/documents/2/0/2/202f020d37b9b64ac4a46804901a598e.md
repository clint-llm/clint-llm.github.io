As part of physical therapy as an initial treatment, patients should be educated regarding home exercises, as well as proper posture. Given the correlation between obesity and the development of lumbosacral facet joint dysfunction, weight loss counseling serves as an important tool in preventing the development of facetogenic pain. Patients should seek professional evaluation from an orthopedist, a physiatrist, or a spinal surgeon, to receive a thorough evaluation to rule out more serious "red flag" etiologies of low back pain prior to implementation of a proper treatment plan.
