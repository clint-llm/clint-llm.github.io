FCH is an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal lipid accumulation in the circulation, which can lead to cardiovascular disease and associated complications. Effective management of FCH requires close communication and care coordination among the interprofessional healthcare team, including the primary care clinician, cardiologist, nurse, pharmacist, and mid-level providers.

As part of preventive care, the primary care team should conduct lipid screening to evaluate serum cholesterol levels in accordance with the guidelines provided by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Additionally, they should assess contributing risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction, such as hypertension and diabetes. Earlier screening and diagnostic assessments may be warranted in patients at higher risk or with a family history of FCH. Comprehensive patient history should also be obtained, focusing on familial dyslipidemias or family history of heart disease.

The primary care provider should discuss preventative measures and healthy lifestyle strategies with patients, including weight loss, dietary modifications, smoking cessation, alcohol use, and routine exercise. Early goal-directed therapy with first-line statin treatment is recommended for patients with FCH. Patients with uncontrolled hyperlipidemia and underlying comorbidities, such as prior CAD, hypertension, and diabetes, who are at risk for adverse cardiovascular events, may benefit from specialty care provided by cardiologists or endocrinologists for a more comprehensive management plan.

Patient education on FCH is an essential responsibility of the interprofessional team, including primary care providers, specialists, and healthcare professionals such as advanced practice practitioners. This education aims to enhance patient understanding of the disease, improve communication between patients and healthcare providers, and ensure continuity of care, leading to improved outcomes for individuals with genetic dyslipidemia.
