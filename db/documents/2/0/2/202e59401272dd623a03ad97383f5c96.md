Beta-lactamase inhibitors are medications that are used ubiquitously in modern medicine due to their ability to combat bacterial antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antimicrobial resistance poses an enormous global public health challenge.****Therefore, careful monitoring and prescribing of patients taking Beta-lactamase inhibitors in combination with beta-lactam antimicrobials are of paramount importance. Interprofessional health teams of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must work together to determine the necessity of treatment, as well as to counsel patients regarding the proper administration of this class of medications. Patients must complete their entire course of medication and must not share this medication with others. By working together, members of an interprofessional healthcare team canÂ strive to prevent adverse outcomes for the patient and antimicrobial resistance in the community.
