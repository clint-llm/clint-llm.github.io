Pain is a significant and distressing issue for millions of individuals across the United States; an estimated 20% of the American population was affected by pain in 2016.

Since pain is classified as a symptom and not a diagnosis, it is important to appropriately distinguish pain classification: acute vs. chronic, nociceptive vs. neuropathic, somatic vs. visceral, etc. This helps narrow the differential diagnosis and thus leads to proper evaluation and proper treatment. The treatment of pain is often methodical and ranges from nonpharmacological to pharmacological to interventional measures. As a possible result of the opioid epidemic and the complexity of pain and individualized results of pain management, medical cannabis has garnered interest as an additional avenue of pharmacological treatment even though it is not currently FDA-approved for pain.
