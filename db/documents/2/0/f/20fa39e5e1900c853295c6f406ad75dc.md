The pathophysiology of premenstrual syndrome is complex, imprecise, and is not fully understood.

- It is anticipated that PMS is likely to be influenced by the action of progesterone on neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), opioids, serotonin, and catecholamine. Preexisting serotonin deficiency with increased progesterone sensitivity is also considered responsible for this disorder.

- An increase in prolactin levels or an increase in its sensitivity to the effect of prolactin, glucose metabolism alterations, abnormal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function, insulin resistance, and certain nutritional electrolyte deficiencies, and genetic factors have a role in PMS.

- Stress amplifies the sympathetic activity, and this results in menstrual pain by significantly increasing the intensity of uterine contraction.
