HbH disease is classified as moderate to severe in alpha thalassemia. Due to the variety of genetic mutations, as explained previously, there is marked variation in phenotypic expression. Patients can be asymptomatic, have episodic anemia requiring transfusions, and even fatal hydrops fetalis in utero.

Clinical presentation usually starts in the latter part of gestation with hemolytic anemia due to the formation of HbBarts. The most severe form will result in fatal hydrops fetalis. At birth, neonates present with jaundice and anemia.

As they age, patients will have fluctuating degrees of anemia. This anemia is due to a combination of ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. Periods of increased oxidant stress, such as sepsis or certain medications, tend to increase the rate of hemolysis. Patients would then have the typical presentation of hemolytic anemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, elevated LDH, decreased haptoglobin, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, jaundice, variable bony changes, premature biliary tract disease, leg ulcers, and eventually iron overload if multiple transfusions are required without adequate iron chelation.

In adults, the diagnosis is suspected in patients with microcytic anemiaÂ with normal iron stores and a normal hemoglobin A2 level on electrophoresis. Hemoglobin levels are usually 8 to 10 g/dL at baseline.
