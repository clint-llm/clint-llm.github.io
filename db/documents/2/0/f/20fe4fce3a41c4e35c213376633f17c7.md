Hemoglobin C is a benign hemoglobinopathy. It is caused due to mutation in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. The patient may be asymptomatic or may show signs and symptoms of anemia due to chronic hemolysis and hence requires the efforts of an interprofessional health care team. Interprofessional care may be useful and includes a geneticist, hematologist, and ophthalmologist.

Once the diagnosis is made, the hematologist has an important role as a primary caretaker in the management of the patients. As there is a high possibility ofÂ co-inheritance of this disease with other hemoglobinopathies, thus geneticists should be involved. Genetic counseling also plays a vital role if the high-risk couples for this disease wish to have a baby. In patients with HbSC disease, vascular retinopathy might occur. Thus, ophthalmologists should take care of these patients on a regular follow-up basis and help prevent and manage retinopathy.[Level 5]
