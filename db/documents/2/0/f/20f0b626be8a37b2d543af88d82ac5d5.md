Infants with typical clinical findings of Lowe syndrome should undergo laboratory testing, particularly if presenting with failure to thrive. Serum and urine testing may reveal metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, elevated creatinine, proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and/or aminoaciduria. In the presence of neurologic abnormalities, imaging may be warranted. Typical findings include periventricular and deep hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mild ventriculomegaly may also be present.

The definitive diagnosis of Lowe syndrome is based on molecular genetic testing. Cultured skin fibroblasts demonstrate the reduced activity of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase. Genetic testing can reveal a pathogenic variant of the OCRL gene. Antenatal testing is also available if Lowe syndrome is suspected. Ultrasound may reveal the presence of fetal cataracts.
