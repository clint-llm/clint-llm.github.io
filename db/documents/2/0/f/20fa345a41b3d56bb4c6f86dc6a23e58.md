A comprehensive history should be obtained during an initial visit due to the multiple organ systems affected by MEN1 Syndrome. Likewise, comprehensive family history can lead to early diagnosis as MEN1 may affect members of the same family. Patients in the same family may have different manifestations due to heterogeneous phenotypic expression.

A complete physical examination is of utmost importance during initial and follow-up visits. Attention should be directed to any visual field changes or masses in the neck or abdominal region. Physicians may identify MEN1 in many patients after incidental, abnormal laboratory, or imaging studies. Symptoms may differ depending upon which organs are affected. The physical examination may be normal in many of these patients as the tumor size may be small.
