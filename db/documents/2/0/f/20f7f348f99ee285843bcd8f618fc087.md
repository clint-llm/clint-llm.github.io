Vestibular dysfunction often presents as dizziness. Dizziness is a common complaint of patients 40 years of age and older, leading to 10 million visits to ambulatory care settings per year and accounting for 25% of emergency department visits. Vestibular dysfunction is strongly associated with stroke and demyelinating diseases. Twenty-five percent of patients with vestibular disorders have had a stroke. Patients with vestibular dysfunction are at higher risk for falls due to vertigo and gait imbalance, and falls are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients 70 years of age and older.

The overall 1-year incidence of vestibular dysfunction is 4.9%, while the lifetime incidence is 7.4%. Risk factors that increase the risk of vestibular dysfunction include female gender, lower educational level, age above 40, cardiovascular disease, and depression.
