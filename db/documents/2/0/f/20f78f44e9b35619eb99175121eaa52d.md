In order to make a diagnosis of HE, there must be confirmed the presence of liver disease (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, ultrasound or liver biopsy demonstrating liver disease) or a portosystemic shunt, and exclusion of other potential etiologies (e.g., intracranial lesions, masses, hemorrhage or stroke; seizure activity; post-seizure encephalopathy; intracranial infections; or toxic encephalopathy from other causes).

During the intermediate stages of HE, a characteristic jerking movement of the limbs is often observed (e.g., asterixis) when the patient attempts to hold arms outstretched with hands bent upward at the wrist.  Other physical signs may include hyperreflexia, a positive Babinski’s sign, or Parkinsonian symptoms (e.g., rigidity or tremors).
