The proximal renal tubular epithelium is the kidney tissue from which RCC arises. The two forms are sporadic: nonhereditary and hereditary. The structural alterations of both forms occur on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p).

Families at high risk for developing renal cancer were studied, which led to the cloning of genes. The genes whose alteration resulted in RCC formation were tumor suppressors (VHL, TSC) or oncogenes (MET).
