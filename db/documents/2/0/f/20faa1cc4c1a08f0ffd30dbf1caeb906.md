The PPD test is simple, inexpensive, and rapidly identifies TB infection. In cases of latent TB, treatment should be initiated to prevent progression to active disease. Shorter treatment regimens are more likely to be completed than the six to nine months isoniazid regimen. Shorter duration regimens are recommended by the CDC and NTCA and includeÂ three months of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine, four months of daily rifampin, or three months of daily isoniazid and rifampin.

The detection and treatment of LTBI decrease the burden of active TB.
