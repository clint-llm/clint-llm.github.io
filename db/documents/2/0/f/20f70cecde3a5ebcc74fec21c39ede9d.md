The child with mild illness may be monitored from home. Parents should be instructed to bring the child to the primary care office or emergency department if symptoms indicate the child has worsened. Symptoms requiring additional evaluation may include increased difficulty breathing or change in color, fever, change in levels of activity or alertness, and inadequate fluid intake.

The child with more serious illness will require hospitalization with an appropriate level of care and monitoring depending on the severity of the illness.  One criterion to determine the need for hospitalization is if the child sustains oxygen saturation less than 90%.

The nurse caring for a child with pneumonia in an inpatient setting should monitor the child based on the severity of the illness. Respiratory status on an inpatient hospital unit (non-intensive care) should be assessed at least every 4 hours. If supplemental oxygen is required, pulse oximetry can be used to determine the appropriate amount of oxygen to be delivered.
