Asthma and COPD are diseases that result due to different pathogeneses. However, two published explanations discussed the mechanism of ACO. The Dutch hypothesis was published in the 1960s by Dick Orie. He suggested that asthma and COPD have the same genetic factors but different environmental factors that can present with different phenotypes. In ACO, the patient will have features of both diseases due to exposure to both environmental factors, and they cannot be separated.

On the other hand, the British hypothesis, first proposed in 1965, suggested that ACO pathophysiology has features of both COPD and asthma. However, risk factors such as smoking contribute to asthma, and asthma-related factors, such as allergies, contribute to COPD.
