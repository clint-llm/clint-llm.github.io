During embryology, the nervous system is developed from the ectodermal germ layer. In the beginning, the notochord is beneath the ectoderm and induces the ectoderm to differentiate into the neuroectoderm and the neural plate. It is the neural plate that will further differentiate into the neural tube and the neural crest cells. The neural tube is responsible for developing the central nervous system. While the neural crest is responsible for the development of the peripheral nervous system.

The neural tube will further differentiate into the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and the rhombencephalon. First, the prosencephalon is further divided into the telencephalon and the diencephalon. The telencephalon will develop into the cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia, and the lateral ventricles. This makes the telencephalon the origin of the postcentral gyrus. While the diencephalon will develop into the thalamus, hypothalamus, and the third ventricle. Secondly, the mesencephalon will develop into the midbrain and the cerebral aqueduct. Lastly, the rhombencephalon will further differentiate into the metencephalon and the myelencephalon. The metencephalin later develops into the pons, cerebellum, and the upper part of the fourth ventricle. Finally, the myelencephalon will develop into the medulla and the lower part of the fourth ventricle.
