Accessory sacroiliac joints have been reported in the current literature. These accessory joints are additional articular facets found within the primary sacroiliac joint. The accessory joints have their own capsule, cartilage and synovial membrane. There is a wide range of prevalence with an accessory joint found in 8-40% of dissected specimens. The accessory joints are found most commonly in men, on the right side of the body, and in older individuals. Although rare, individuals can have multiple accessory joints.
