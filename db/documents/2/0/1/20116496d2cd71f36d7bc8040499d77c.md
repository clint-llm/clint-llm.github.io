More than 50% of patients with adrenal crisis do not have a prior diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Education regarding the diagnosis and the stress dose steroids is a crucial part of the management of adrenal crisis.

**Strategies for Prevention**

- Discussion of sick days rule includes doubling or tripling the daily oral dose during acute illness (to mimic the physiologic response of increased cortisol levels under stressful situations) 
- If fever >38 C: doubling the dose of oral corticosteroids is recommended.
- If fever >39 C: tripling the dose of oral corticosteroids is recommended.

- In case of significant emotional stress (e.g. death of a loved one, major upcoming examination): an additional dose of 10 mg hydrocortisone is recommended

- Stress dose is needed during stressful situations, including trauma, surgery, major procedures, and severe illness (see Table below).

- The patient should be aware of signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, dizziness, confusion, low blood glucose, fever, loss of sense of well-being, etc.

- The importance of wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace

- The patient should have additional emergency supplies at home in case it is needed 
- An emergency kit should be available in case it is needed when oral doses cannot be taken: significant nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of consciousness:

- 100 mg hydrocortisone sodium succinate for injection or dexamethasone 4 mg, along with vials of sterile 0.9 percent normal saline and syringes

- The patient should carry a steroid card outlining what to do in an emergency in case they go to a hospital where the providers might be aware of the management of adrenal crisis.

- This card to mention the dosing for glucocorticoid administration: 100 mg hydrocortisone IV/IM followed by 200 mg over the next 24 hours given IM/IV (50 mg every 6 hours)

- Regular follow-ups with an endocrinologist with the discussion of stress dosing in each visit

- Frequency of follow-up:

- Adults: yearly
- Children: every 3-6 months
