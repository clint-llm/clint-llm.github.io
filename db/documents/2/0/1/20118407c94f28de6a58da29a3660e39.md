# Introduction

Epigenetics is the study of heritable and stable changes in gene expression that occur through alterations in the chromosome rather than in the DNA sequence.

Briefly, negatively charged DNA is packaged around a positively charged histone protein octamer, which contains 2 copies of histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4.

In addition to histone changes, DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism associated with gene silencing when the methylation occurs in CpG islands of promoter sequences.

# Cellular

Epigenetic mechanisms form a layer of control within a cell that regulates gene expression and silencing. This control varies between tissues and plays an important role in cell differentiation.

Three different epigenetic mechanisms have been identified: DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-associated gene silencing. Catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase enzymes, DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group directly to a cytosine nucleotide within a cytosine-guanine sequence (CpG), which are often surrounded by other CpG’s forming a CpG island. CpG islands are common targets for epigenetic DNA methylation, notably the CpG islands within promoter regions. Indeed, it has been reported that around 70% of gene promotor regions lie within CpG islands.

The second epigenetic mechanism is post-translational modifications to histone proteins. These modifications include enzyme-catalyzed acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, each of which alters the DNA-histone interactions in nucleosomes.

The most recently elucidated epigenetic mechanism is non-coding RNA-associated gene silencing. A non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is a functional RNA molecule that is transcribed but not translated into proteins. Once regarded as waste of the genome, recent insight suggests the ncRNA molecules harbor a crucial role in epigenetic gene expression and likely account for the great difference in phenotype between species and within human populations despite such similarity in encoded proteins.

# Clinical Significance

As people age, the largest influence on the epigenome is the environment. Direct influencers such as diet can affect one's epigenome, as determined by the Dutch famine studies. in utero are particularly sensitive as the epigenetic profile of the fetus is forming and developing rapidly during this time. in utero epigenetic changes.

Perhaps the most studied clinical application of epigenetic mechanisms is cancer. One of the first reports of epigenetics involved in cancer reported hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cell genomes, which caused overexpression of genes within that cell.

Epigenetics is a promising field of research because of the potential to regulate gene expression without changing the DNA sequence, which may likely cause safety and ethical concerns if performed in humans. The most promising way to treat diseases through epigenetic regulation has been through pharmacology. Previous clinical trials for drugs formulated to block epigenetic modifications associated with cancers have proved successful. The FDA has approved a number of these drugs which target epigenetic regulators to treat various cancers including azacytidine and decitabine for myelodysplastic syndrome, panobinostat for multiple myeloma, and romidepsin for cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

In addition to cancers, many conditions associated with genomic imprinting are the result of malfunctioning epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms can induce disease, but they are also necessary for normal cell function, specifically in imprinted genes where only one parental chromosome is expressed. For genomic imprinting to successfully occur, the other parental chromosome must be silenced, which occurs through DNA methylation. Noteworthy conditions associated with abnormalities in gene imprinting include Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, and Rubenstein-Taybi syndrome.
