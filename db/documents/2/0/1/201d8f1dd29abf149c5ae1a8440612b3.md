The treatment plan determination uses multiple factors, including the type of rejection, the severity of the histological lesion, the chronicity score, and the recipient's comorbidity. What will be discussed is a general guideline, but tailoring medical treatment of individual characteristics is needed.

**1. Hyperacute Rejection**: No effective therapy usually leads to early allograft nephrectomy, and so prevention is the key by assuring the following:

- ABO compatibility between donor and recipient. Sometimes, it is advisable to address ABO incompatibility under specific criteria, and careful pre-transplant preparation of the recipient with the removal of anti-ABO antibodies by plasmapheresis is an option, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with or without rituximab

- Pre-transplant cross-match (complement cell cytotoxicity test): Recipient serum is added to donor lymphocytes. If the test is positive (which means the recipient has an antibody that reacts with the donor HLA antigens on lymphocytes), one should not proceed with transplant unless these antibodies are removable pre-transplant.

**2. Antibody-Mediated Rejection**:

The treatment of acute antibody-mediated rejection also depends on the level of the antibody levels. Higher antibody levels need plasma exchange for the removal of the antibodies. The following are the different modalities used for AMR:

- Plasma exchange: 3 to 5 sessions daily on every other day are used for antibody removal, followed by IVIG and rituximab

- IVIG: IV immunoglobulin (100 to 200 mg/kg) is used, followed by the last session of plasma exchange when used in combination with plasmapheresis or a higher dose of 2g/kg after the final session of plasmapheresis.

- Rituximab: Anti CD20 cell antibody rituximab (375 mg/m^2) is used in combination with IVIG, followed by plasma exchange

- Bortezomib: Plasma cell inhibitor bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) is also used in combination with plasma exchange and IVIG

- Splenectomy: A splenectomy is very rarely an option, but there are anecdotal reports of successful treatment of refractory rejections

- Optimize the dose and the level of the maintenance immunosuppressive drugs.

**3. T Cell-Mediated rejection**: They receive treatment with the following agents based on the severity of the lesion.

- Methyl prednisone IV (250 to 1000 mg daily) targeting T cells, B cells, and macrophages; given for 3 to 5 days

- rATG - rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin IV (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) targeting T cell receptors. The duration varies among different transplant centers, but in general, it is for 7 to 14 doses based on the response and Cd3 level.

- Optimize the dose and the level of the maintenance immunosuppressive drugs.

**4.  Chronic rejection**: Since the antibody-mediated rejection mechanism is a major cause of chronic rejection, the same therapy as ABMR has been used, but generally, these measures are ineffective when serum creatinine is over 3 mg/dl and/or heavy proteinuria is present.
