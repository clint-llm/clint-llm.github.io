DTs are very common in hospitalized patients and can be quite difficult to manage. DTs also prolong hospital stay and result in a high cost of healthcare. Today, the emphasis is on prevention of DTs. To prevent excessive use of alcohol, there are many screening tools available that should be performed in the emergency room or in primary care settings. The screening tools are carried out by a nurse, social worker or a pharmacist. There is good evidence showing that screening for alcohol use can result in a reduction of alcohol consumption, associated injuries and decreased rate of readmissions to the hospitals.

**Outcomes**

DTs can be associated with a number of complications including respiratory depression, seizures, arrhythmias and aspiration pneumonitis. Even with appropriate therapy, the mortality varies from 5 to 15%. The only way to lower the mortality is aggressive resuscitation and treat any concurrent illness.  Failure to treat or delay in diagnosis always leads to high morbidity and mortality.
