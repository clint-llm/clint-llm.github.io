The appearance of Koplik spots in the mucosa is usually one day before the onset of rash. They appear as bluish-white spots, slightly raised with a diameter of approximately 2 to 3 mm on an erythematous base on the buccal mucosa opposite the first molar.

Reports indicate that Koplik spots appear in 60% to 70% of persons suffering from measles.
