Chronic orchialgia is likely to remain a challenging condition for an interprofessional team of nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians to evaluate and treat due to multiple possible etiologies, limited tools for diagnostic evaluation and the multitude of treatment options. Conservative therapies are often unsuccessful, and diagnostic methods frequently fail to identify a specific etiology. Psychological factors appear to play an important role in this painful syndrome. Physical therapy and pelvic floor trigger point dry needling can be useful and effective non-surgical treatments. Scrotal ultrasound and spermatic cord blocks are the most useful diagnostic tools currently available. an interprofessional approach to this difficult problem is recommended.

When conservative and alternative means are unsuccessful in relieving the pain, surgical intervention is justified. Microsurgical denervation of the spermatic cord appears to be a highly successful surgical means of dealing with idiopathic chronic orchialgia without resorting to more aggressive surgical resections. Orchiectomy remains as the surgical treatment of last resort, but even this drastic procedure is not always successful in relieving chronic testicular pain. Further studies are needed to identify better treatment options and improve long-term patient outcomes.
