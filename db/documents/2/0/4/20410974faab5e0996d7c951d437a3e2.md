Henoch-Schönlein purpura is typically a self-limiting illness; however, patients may develop life-threatening complications such as intussusception, massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and renal failure. An interprofessional approach is necessary for the adequate diagnosis and management of the illness. Patients may present with non-specific symptoms such as malaise, upper respiratory symptoms, or arthralgias before the development of the characteristic rash. This may result in a delayed diagnosis. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians may see patients during different stages of the disease; therefore, it is important for medical staff to communicate and be aware of the potential complications.

A surgical team and radiologist may be required for the diagnosis and management of intussusception.

An important aspect of the disease process is adequate to follow up with frequent urinalyses to screen for potential renal involvement. Patients who are treated with corticosteroids may require assistance from pharmacists with regard to adequate therapeutic dosing and tapering. Patients with severe renal disease will need to see a nephrology team comprised of medical assistants, nurses, physicians, and possibly a transplant team.
