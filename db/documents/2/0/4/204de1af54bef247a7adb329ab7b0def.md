The pacing and CRT are associated with complications. The majority of complications occur in the hospital or during first 6 months. Lead complications are the main reason for the re-implantation of the pacemaker and CRT devices. Other complications include, but are not limited to infections, hematoma formation, pericardial effusion or tamponade, pneumothorax, coronary sinus dissection, or perforation. Some old pacemakers are not MRI safe.
