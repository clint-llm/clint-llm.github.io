Proximal to the popliteal crease, the sciatic nerve branches into the tibial nerve and common peroneal (fibular) nerve. The tibial nerve courses distally to give rise to the medial sural nerve and posterior tibial nerve which primarily covers the posterior leg and plantar surface of the foot. The medial sural nerve travels between the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, penetrates the deep fascia to become superficial approximately midway down the calf, and continues posterior to the lateral malleolus and superficial to the extensor retinaculum.

Importantly, the sural nerve is a sensory nerve only with no motor fibers.

At the level of the ankle, the two-deep nerves are the tibial nerve and deep peroneal (fibular) nerve, whereas the superficial nerves include the superficial peroneal (fibular), sural, and saphenous nerves. All nerves are terminal branches of the sciatic nerve, except the saphenous which is a sensory branch of the femoral nerve.
