Overall, ICVT has a favorable prognosis. One systematic review of 325 cases found that more than 90% of patients had good outcomes upon discharge or follow-up within one year. This included complete recovery with a return to baseline status or partial recovery. It is also important to note that most patients had their clinical symptoms recovery earlier than their findings in the neuroimaging. In the systematic review study, the in-hospital mortality was 3.0%. Patients treated with long-term anticoagulation for up to 6 months do have complete or partial recovery of clinical symptoms.
