The eye is one of the most anatomically complex regions of the body, and often systemic diseases manifest in the eye, sometimes these ophthalmic manifestations predate other systemic manifestations. The cornea is the thin clear covering of the eye. Arcus senilis (cornea senilis) are lipid deposits that appear as rings on the outer region of the cornea. They are usually gray or white and are usually opaque. They often appear denser in the superior and inferior regions. They can grow with time, and can eventually form a ring around the entire cornea. The diagnosis of corneal arcus is made visually by examination with a biomicroscope (slit lamp). The diagnosis of corneal arcus can be confused with limbus sign (calcium deposits in the cornea).
