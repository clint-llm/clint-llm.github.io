The most important step in the initial evaluation of suspected pseudohyponatremia is to exclude true hyponatremia; failure to accurately diagnose true hyponatremia can result in severe iatrogenic complications and even death.

**When to Consider Direct Ion-Selective Electrode Potentiometry (DISE)**

Most cases of pseudohyponatremia do not require the use of DISE to confirm the diagnosis, with few exceptions. In general, DISE merits consideration in situations where the diagnosis is uncertain, and confirmation of pseudohyponatremia is likely to change management significantly; in the absence of these criteria, DISE is likely to be of little diagnostic or prognostic value. If multiple confounders are present, particularly the presence of osmotically active solutes, one should consider DISE to discriminate between hyperosmolar hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia. We recommend measuring a direct serum sodium level with DISE in the following circumstances

- The blood sample is grossly lipemic.

- Measured serum osmolality is significantly different from calculated serum osmolality.

- Hyponatremia in the setting of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia
