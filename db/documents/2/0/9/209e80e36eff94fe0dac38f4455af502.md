**Treatment Summary for Idiopathic Hypercalciuria**First try dietary modifications, such as avoiding excessive dietary calcium intake and lowering dietary animal protein and salt.

**Dent Disease**

Dent disease is a rare, X-linked hereditary disorder that primarily affects the proximal renal tubules resulting in hypercalciuria and proteinuria starting in childhood. It may progress from there, leading to osteomalacia, short stature, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, hypophosphatemia and eventually renal failure. Up to 80% of affected males will develop end-stage renal failure by age 50. Vitamin D levels (1,25 (OH)2 Vit. D) are elevated or in the high normal range while parathyroid hormone levels are low. There are only about 250 families known to carry this disorder, so the incidence is quite low.

Treatment is based on controlling hypercalciuria and preserving renal function. While this can be done with thiazide diuretics, the hypercalciuria almost always responds to dietary therapy. ACE inhibitors and citrate supplements are used in children with the disorder to help preserve renal function, but their effectiveness is unclear.
