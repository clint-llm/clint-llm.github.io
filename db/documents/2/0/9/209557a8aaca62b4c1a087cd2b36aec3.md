While no true absolute contraindications for IVUS exist, extreme vessel tortuosity and angulation that would preclude the ability to deliver an IVUS catheter to the area of interest is a relative contraindication. As with any instrumentation of the coronary arteries, IVUS use is accompanied by systemic anticoagulation during the procedure.  Consequently, an indirect IVUS contraindication would be a patient who is not a suitable candidate for systemic anticoagulation or a patient who is not a candidate for angiography and cardiac catheterization in general.
