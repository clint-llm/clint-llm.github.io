Treatment of Eustachian tube dysfunction is dependent on the likely cause of dysfunction:

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is addressed with lifestyle changes, including losing weight and dietary modifications to reduce acid production. Anti-acid medication, e.g., proton pump inhibitors, may be considered.

Lifestyle changes to avoid potential allergens, if possible, should be tried. Medical interventions include antihistamines and nasal corticosteroid medication.

Treatment of rhinosinusitis should be commenced if indicated. Immunosuppressive agents will be required for granulomatous disease, e.g., sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener disease).

Surgical dilatation of the Eustachian tube is performed using a Eustachian tube balloon catheter, with studies demonstrating improvement of the ETDQ-7 score at 12 months follow-up. ETD from otitis media with effusion is commonly managed with tympanostomy tube insertion

Patients should be considered for adenoidectomy if adenoid hypertrophy is thought to be the main contributing factor to ETD. This is more common in children, who may present with middle ear effusion. The use of auto-inflation devices for reopening the Eustachian tube by raising the pressure in the nose has shown favorable results for correcting middle ear pressure and fluid clearance.
