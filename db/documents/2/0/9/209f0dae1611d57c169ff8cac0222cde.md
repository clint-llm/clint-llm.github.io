The base of the skull has multiple important foramina that allow the passing of vital tissues, primarily blood vessels and nerves. The two jugular foramina exist at the base of the skull lateral to the foramen magnum. Importantly the internal jugular veins, which drain blood from the brain and intracranial tissues, make their way out of the cranium and terminate at the subclavian veins and ultimately join the brachiocephalic vein.
