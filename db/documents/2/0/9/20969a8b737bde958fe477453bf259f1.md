Imaging plays a chief role in the diagnosis and evaluation of the disease extent. Radiography should be utilized first in an evaluation. Advanced imaging such as computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can exclude other bone lesions; evaluate for soft tissue complications occurring from fractures, craniofacial neurovascular complications; and assess lesions for rare malignant transformation.
