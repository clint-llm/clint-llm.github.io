The major etiologies of mesenteric ischemia are as follows:

**Mesenteric Arterial Embolism
**

Emboli generally lodge in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), which supplies the small intestine. This causes an acute onset of pain. Predisposing factors include cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, recent angiography, underlying vasculitis and valvular disorders.

**Mesenteric Arterial Thrombosis**

Acute arterial thrombosis is usually a result of atherosclerosis, either secondary to acute plaque rupture, or gradual build-up until there is critical stenosis. Predisposing factors include patients with atherosclerosis, peripheral arterial disease, hypercoagulability, estrogen therapy, and prolonged hypotension.

**Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis
**

Mesenteric venous thrombosis causes increases in the resistance of mesenteric venous blood flow. Patients who have local intra-abdominal inflammatory processes (such as inflammatory bowel disease) are at higher risk for this. Patients who are hypercoagulable (in other words those with heritable and acquired thrombophilias and malignancies) are also at a higher risk.

**Nonocclusive Mesenteric Ischemia (NOMI)
**

These cases usually involve a “spasm” of the SMA, which can ultimately cause hypoperfusion to the small intestine and colon. Risk factors include peripheral artery disease, septic shock, vasoconstrictive medications (such as digoxin), cocaine abuse, hemodialysis, among many other conditions.
