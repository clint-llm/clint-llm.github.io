The CNS is the site of premonitory signs of overdose in awake patients. Early symptoms are circumoral numbness, tongue paresthesia, and dizziness. Sensory complaints may include tinnitus and blurred vision. Excitatory signs, such as restlessness, agitation, nervousness, or paranoia, may progress to muscle twitches and seizures. Ultimately, with large overdoses, CNS depression, including unconsciousness and coma, can occur. Hypotension and bradycardia can also be side effects of relative local anesthetic overdoses that sometimes occur during neuraxial blockade or nerve blocks performed near the CNS.

Major cardiovascular toxicity usually requires higher lactic acid (LA) concentration in blood than that which produces seizures. Unintentional intravascular injection of local anesthetics during regional anesthesia produces severe cardiotoxic reactions, including hypotension, atrioventricular heart block, idioventricular rhythms, and life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and are usually the presenting signs of local anesthetic toxicity during general anesthesia.
