The most important consideration when preparing to apply the pulse oximeter is placing the monitor where the light will be able to shine through to the detector. Consider multiple factors before placing the pulse oximeter. Patients should remove nail polish and the finger wiped with an alcohol preparation. Examine the finger for other objects, such as excess pigmentation. For example, tattoos may block light as it passes through the tissue.Â High-intensity ambient light has also been shown to interfere with the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings. Before application, the rubber shield should be intact on the pulse oximeter to help reduce ambient light input.
