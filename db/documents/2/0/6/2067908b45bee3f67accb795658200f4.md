The Quincke sign is one of the over 30 reported eponymous signs of severe aortic regurgitation, with flashing carotids being quoted as the 32nd.

Some of the other classically taught physical examination findings in patients with severe aortic regurgitation include head bobbing (de Musset sign), a bounding carotid pulse (Corrigan pulse), pistol shot sounds over the femoral artery with compression (the Duroziez murmur or Traube sign), the presence of visible pulsation of retinal arteries (Becker sign), and pulsation of the uvula (Müller sign).

Traditionally the Hill sign had been one of the other classic findings of aortic regurgitation. The Hill sign has been described as when the difference of greater than 20 mm Hg between arm and foot systolic blood pressure; this is now thought to be an artifact of sphygmomanometric lower limb pressure measurement and its removal from the list of the classic diagnostic signs for aortic regurgitation has been recommended by some authors.
