As mentioned above, usually, autoimmune encephalitis is treatment responsive with immunosuppression and tumor removal, although staging of the cancer is independently associated with adverse outcomes. According to an observational cohort study, 94% received first-line therapy with immunosuppression or tumor removal that resulted in improvement within four weeks (53%), with most of them having good outcomes in the first 24 months. These outcomes continue to improve up to 18 months from symptom onset. Predictors of good outcomes were associated with early treatment and not requiring ICU admission.

Patients need to be followed closely after recovery to look for relapse. As per the recommendations, surveillance imaging at 4 to 6 months intervals for at least four years is suggested. Overall, cell-surface antibodies have a better prognosis than those associated with intracellular antibodies.
