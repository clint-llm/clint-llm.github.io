A cataract is an opacification of the eye's crystalline lens that prevents the light rays from reaching the retina, leading to a visual impairment that significantly affects the patient's quality of life. A complicated cataract refers to the opacification of the crystalline lens secondary to intraocular diseases, mainly intraocular inflammatory conditions that include anterior, intermediate, or posterior uveitis. However, other intraocular conditions have also been identified that lead to the development of complicated cataracts. It is especially disabling in the younger age group because of the visual impairment and need for cataract surgery with its own complications.****

Cataract formation in uveitis occurs due to uncontrolled inflammation and also because of the use of steroids.****Managing the case of a complicated cataract is a challenging task for an ophthalmologist, as it also requires meticulous control of the inflammation and management of the primary intraocular disease. Hence, a multidisciplinary approach is required.
