Evaluation begins with thorough patient history and a physical exam. It is essential to establish a temporal relationship between a chief complaint, presenting symptoms, and the use of the anabolic steroid. It is equally important to determine which specific agent is in use as that information can aid the clinician in obtaining the proper workup. Laboratory testing remains a challenge for clinicians as there are over 170 variants of anabolic steroids and no single rapid test to identify every agent. However, even when there is a high suspicion of the presence of a specific agent, confirmatory analysis is generally gas chromatography. Testing may take a considerable amount of time, depending on the institutional capabilities.
