Stent thrombosis has been associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, often leading to events of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).Â When compared to in-stent restenosis, which leads to anginal type symptoms, stent thrombosis is typically an acute process resulting in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Prognosis improves greatly with early identification and intervention. High clinical suspicion and detailed history taking are crucial for an accurate diagnosis.
