Leydig cells can be found around seminiferous tubules forming groups of up to ten cells. They are generally described as polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and a large round nucleus with a prominent nucleolus. Lipid content is abundant.

Because these cells are responsible for testosterone production, they have features of steroid-secreting cells, including large and well developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, large and numerous lipid droplets, and significant numbers of mitochondria with tubulovesicular cristae. Another common finding in Leydig cells is lipofuscin, which appears as multiple rounded irregular bodies, representing accumulated lipid droplets in lysosomes.

Reinkeâ€™s crystalloids are pale-staining cytoplasmic inclusions found specifically in Leydig cells. These crystals have a rod-like or cylindrical shape and are usually arranged in a linear pattern. No function is yet known for these bodies, but some studies suggest they are by-products of testosterone production and steroid metabolism in testes.
