Drug use in the United States has developed into a problem of epidemic proportion. Drug use affects all age groups, including young and pregnant women. A recent report from 2019 suggests that marijuana (or cannabis) remains one of the most commonly used drugs, and its use has consistently increased between the years 2016 to 2019. It is also the most second most commonly used drug during pregnancy.
