Patient and parent education is a key factor in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases. Awareness of vaccination is low, and individuals depend on their healthcare providers in educating them on recommendations. This is especially true in the fight to close the widening gap in racial and ethnic disparities regarding vaccination coverage. Per the Community Preventive Services Task Force and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee, when health care providers interact with their patients in a clinical setting, a conversation should address the need for and recommendations pertaining to vaccines in general. Along with this conversation, patients should be offered appropriate vaccinations.
