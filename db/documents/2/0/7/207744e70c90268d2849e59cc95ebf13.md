Camper's fascia is the superficial fatty layer of the anterior abdominal wall. This fascia is composed of loose areolar tissue and is found deep in the skin and superficial to Scarpa's fascia. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a 3-dimensional architecture of fibrous septae that functions to provide support to the adipose tissue.

Camper's fascia spans from the xiphoid process to the seventh and 10th costal margins laterally and to the inguinal ligaments inferiorly. It continues inferiorly past the inguinal ligament as the subcutaneous fat of the thigh. Medially, the fascia extends past the pubic symphysis, combining with Scarpa's fascia to form the dartos tunic of the scrotum in males and the fatty tissue of the mons pubis and labia majora in females.

Camper's fascia is important to understand due to its function, its location in surgery, and the role it plays in healing to form a strong barrier over the abdomen.
