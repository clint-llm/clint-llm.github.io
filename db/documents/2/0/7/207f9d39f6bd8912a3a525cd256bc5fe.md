Complications of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome can include the progression of the disease state along the continuum of sepsis (for infectious etiology) to severe sepsis to shock and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Complications can also be related to individual end-organ dysfunction. Some important ones are as below

**Central**- Acute encephalopathy

**Respiratory**- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute aspiration pneumonitis related to encephalopathy

**Cardiac**- Demand perfusion mismatch causing troponin elevation, tachyarrhythmia

**Gastrointestinal**- Stress ulcer, acute transaminitis

**Renal**- Acute tubular necrosis and acute kidney injury, metabolic acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities.

**Hematological**â€“ Thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis, deep venous thrombosis.

**Endocrine**Hyperglycemia, acute adrenal insufficiency
