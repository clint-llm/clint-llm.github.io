A Pecs I block requires an interfascial injection of local anesthetic between the pectoralis major muscle and pectoralis minor muscle at the level of the third rib to block both the medial pectoral nerve and lateral pectoral nerve. Utilizing ultrasound, the major landmarks visualized are the pectoralis major muscle, pectoralis minor muscle, and the thoracoacromial artery (pectoral branch).

The Pecs II block is a modified Pecs I block and can be achieved using a single needle stick. Local anesthetic placement is between the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor as for a Pecs I block and then between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior. The second portion of the procedure will block the anterior cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves 3 to 6, the intercostobrachial nerves, and the long thoracic nerve. The main landmarks to identify under US guidance are the pectoralis major muscle, pectoralis minor muscle, serratus anterior, and the thoracoacromial artery (pectoral branch).
