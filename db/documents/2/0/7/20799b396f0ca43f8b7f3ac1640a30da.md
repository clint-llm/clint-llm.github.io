The internal iliac artery conveys a relatively large volume of blood, and its branches supply numerous visceral and parietal structures in the pelvis, gluteal region, hip, and thigh. As a result, blunt force trauma, penetrating injuries, and pelvic fractures put these vessels at considerable risk with potentially life-threatening consequences.

The internal iliac arteries are at risk of various pathologies that impact the arterial system. Internal iliac artery stenosis is a relatively common occurrence that is often due to atherosclerosis. This condition is typically associated with aortic or common iliac artery stenosis.

Frequently associated with atherosclerosis, isolated internal iliac artery aneurysms are relatively uncommon. They occur in only 20% of individuals presenting with isolated aneurysms of either the common iliac, external iliac, or internal iliac artery.
