Glaucoma represents a spectrum of diseases that culminates in a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by optic disc excavation, loss of the retinal ganglion cells, and eventual visual field loss.

Destruction of the ciliary body secretory epithelium to lower aqueous humor production and treat refractory or uncontrolled glaucoma has been advocated since the early 1930s.
