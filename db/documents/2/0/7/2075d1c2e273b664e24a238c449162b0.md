It is critical to educate the patients about the tumor, its grade, complications, and treatments. It is essential to emphasize follow-up appointments and long-term surveillance in patients with low-grade gliomas. A multidisciplinary approach to patient care is crucial, and any adverse events during treatment should be immediately addressed when necessary. Non-compliance should be discouraged. Referral to a higher center should be pursued if not available locally. Since the patient plays a key role in managing low-grade glioma, it is important to keep them abreast of the condition and the available option with respect to their risk. This would be useful to ultimately make the best decisions to improve the overall outcome and quality of life.
