Unlikely normal pregnancy, B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal proBNP are usually elevated in PPCM.

ECG may show non-specific changes like sinus tachycardia, interventricular delay and sometimes, LBBB pattern.

Chest radiography typically shows pulmonary edema and may show enlarged cardiac silhouette or pleural effusions(or both).

Echocardiography suffices to differentiate it from other causes and usually shows left ventricle dilatation of variable degrees, left ventricle systolic dysfunction, right ventricular and bi-atrial enlargement, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and intracardiac thrombus.

Echocardiography criteria to diagnose PPCM includes ejection fraction less than 45%, end-diastolic diameter greater than 2.7 cm/m2 and/or M-mode fractional shortening less than 30%

Cardiac MRI can also be used to diagnose when an accurate estimation of the ejection fraction (EF) is required.

Cardiac biopsy is generally not indicated, unless another cause of heart failure is suspected, (cardiac sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis etc.)
