Topical corticosteroids play a major role in the treatment of many dermatologic conditions. They are FDA-approved and indicated for the use of inflammatory and pruritic presentations of dermatologic conditions. The well-known indications are for diseases such as psoriasis, limited areas of vitiligo, eczema, atopic dermatitis, phimosis, acute radiation dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen simplex chronicus, discoid lupus erythematosus, and lichen sclerosis. They are effective for conditions involving hyper-proliferation, immunological, and inflammatory properties. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of topical corticosteroids so providers can direct patient therapy where they are indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the three predominant mechanisms of action of topical corticosteroids.
- Review the indications for using topical corticosteroids.
- Summarize the adverse event profile of topical corticosteroids, as well as contraindications to their use.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with topical corticosteroids.
