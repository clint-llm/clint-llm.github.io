Tonsillar herniation is the final stage of an aggressive intracranial process. However, Cushing described four stages of tonsillar herniation, and some studies have suggested surgical intervention early in the process could prevent mortality. One case series looked at early recognition of tonsillar herniation in posterior fossa tumor cases and showed death could be avoided with early surgical decompression.

Tonsillar herniation is typically considered a terminal event if not treated promptly. When it occurs, the chance of recovery is significantly reduced. When a herniation syndrome produces respiratory compromise, as found in Cushing's triad, there is no chance of a meaningful recovery.
