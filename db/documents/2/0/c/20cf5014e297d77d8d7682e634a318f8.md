Orlistat is a medication used in the management of obesity. Orlistat acts by reversibly inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases. The inactivation of lipases prevents the hydrolysis of triglycerides, and thus free fatty acids are not absorbed. The maximum benefit of orlistat occurs when used in conjunction with diet and exercise. This activity reviews the indications, actions, and contraindications of orlistat as a valuable agent in treating obesity. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and relevant interactions) pertinent to members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with obesity.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of orlistat.
- Describe the adverse effects of orlistat.
- Outline the appropriate monitoring of patients treated with orlistat.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for optimizing patient education regarding adverse effects and proper administration of orlistat for maximum efficacy.
