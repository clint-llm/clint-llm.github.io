Splinting and immobilization are crucial skills for prehospital medical providers, as traumatic musculoskeletal injuries are commonly encountered by emergency medical services (EMS). One can achieve the greatest benefit if the splint is applied in the prehospital setting. If a fracture or dislocation is suspected, a splint should be placed - this will stabilize the injury for patient transport, preventing further skeletal, neurologic, and soft tissue damage. Furthermore, injury immobilization can significantly reduce the patient's pain. There are numerous commercial products available for immobilization. The interprofessional team caring for the patients should be familiar with slings, immobilizers, rigid splints, traction splints, air splints, and vacuum splints to help expedite care and improve long-term outcomes. This activity will review the technique and indications for joint immobilization to help achieve this goal.

**Objectives:**
- Review the benefits of prehospital splinting for orthopedic traumatic injuries.
- Summarize different splints and braces commonly used for orthopedic traumatic injuries.
- Explain how to properly place and use commonly used splints and braces in patients with orthopedic traumatic injuries. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance EMS prehospital splinting and improve outcomes.
