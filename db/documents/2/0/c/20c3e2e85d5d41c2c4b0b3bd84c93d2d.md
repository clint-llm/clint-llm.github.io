Although there is no set of labs required for a delusional disorder like most other psychiatric disorders. Imaging or laboratory tests should be considered to rule out any organic causes. Substance-induced conditions should be ruled out by getting a urine drug screen. After an organic cause is ruled out a clinical exam should be completed. A clinician would do an assessment and ask further questions about their delusions. During the assessment, a complete mental status exam should be done. Interviewing family members and friends should be considered because they can provide further details about the delusions and more importantly a timeline of the presenting symptoms.
