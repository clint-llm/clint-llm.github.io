The etiology of eating disorders is heterogeneous, including biological, psychological, developmental, and socio-cultural.

- ****Biological factors****
- **Genetics:**Twin and adoption studies prove the hereditary role for eating disorders. There is a 50% chance of developing eating disorders if the other twin has it.
- **Neurobiology:**Serotonin plays a significant role in appetite and mood regulation. Serotonin may indirectly mediate its effects on the development of eating disorders.

- **Psychological factors:**Perfectionism, impulsivity, novelty-seeking, obsessive-compulsiveness, harm avoidance, and neuroticism are common personality traits often associated with eating disorders.

- **Developmental factors:**The early perturbation in childhood development, like childhood sexual abuse, poses a significant risk in developing eating disorders.

- **Socio-cultural factors-**Cultural preferences for thinness, exposure to western culture that values a slim body for women, and exposure to media promoting such ideas play a major role in increasing eating disorders' prevalence worldwide.
