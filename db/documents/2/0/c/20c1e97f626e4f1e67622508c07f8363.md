Symptoms of an overdose of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists are drowsiness and headache. Aprepitant is associated with serum liver enzyme increases during therapy, but no verified correlation between cases of clinically specific liver injury with jaundice.

Serum aminotransferase elevations during aprepitant therapy occurred in 6% of treated patients versus 4.3% in controls receiving cancer chemotherapy. The aminotransferase elevations were found to be transient, were mild to moderate in severity in some cases, and may not be associated with symptoms or jaundice. There are no convincing published cases of clinically significant liver injury attributable to aprepitant in the literature. Therefore, significant liver injury from aprepitant or fosaprepitant would be exceeding rare.
