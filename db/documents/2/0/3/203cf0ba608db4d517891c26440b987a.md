Ocular neuropathic pain is a diagnosis of exclusion which refers to the heightened perception of pain in response to normally non-painful stimuli. It usually presents without any visible objective exam findings, making it extremely difficult to identify. For this reason, it is often misdiagnosed as dry eye disease. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of ocular neuropathic pain. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of ocular neuropathic pain.
- Review the presentation of a patient with ocular neuropathic pain.
- Describe the current treatment options available for ocular neuropathic pain.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving the outcomes of patients suffering from ocular neuropathic pain.
