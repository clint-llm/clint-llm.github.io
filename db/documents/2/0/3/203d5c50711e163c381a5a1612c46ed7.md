Integrating frailty measures in clinical practice is crucial for developing interventions and individual care plans accounting for age-related conditions (particularly disability) in older persons. Multiple instruments have been developed over the years to capture frailty. The clinical frailty scale is a 9-point scale that quantifies frailty based on function in individual patients. It is complemented by a visual chart to assist with the classification of frailty. Higher scores indicate increased frailty and associated risks. The scale is well validated and has been tested in various clinical settings.[Level 1] This scale can be used by an interprofessional healthcare team of clinicians, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionists, to classify frailty and identify patients at high risk for adverse outcomes.
