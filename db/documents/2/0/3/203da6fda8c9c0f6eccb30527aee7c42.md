The differential diagnosis of oral melanoma is extensive; it needs to be differentiated from focal and diffuse oral pigmentations. Amalgam tattoos most commonly mimic oral melanomas, and dermoscopy may aid in differentiating them.

The following are included in the differential diagnosis of an oral melanoma:

**Focal Oral Pigmentations**

- Amalgam tattoo (exogenous pigment)

- Melanoacanthoma

- Melanotic macules

- Melanocytic nevi

**Diffuse Oral Pigmentations**

- Physiological/racial pigmentations

- Smoker’s melanosis

- Drug-induced hyperpigmentation

- Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation

**Systemic Diseases**

- Peutz–Jeghers syndrome

- Laugier–Hunzikerdisease

- Leopard syndrome

- Carney complex syndrome

- McCune-Albright syndrome

- Adrenal gland diseases
