There was a time when truncal vagotomy was widely done, but today it is rarely performed. The availability of the PPIs has made TV an obsolete procedure. While the procedure is technically relatively simple, it does have a number of serious complications. If the primary care provider or nurse practitioner comes across a patient with peptic ulcer disease, the first step is to use PPIs. Surgery is the last time and should be undertaken after a great deal of consideration. The outcomes for patients who undergo TV are fair as long as they do not develop post-procedure complications.
