Back pain is one of the more common reasons for unplanned emergency department visits, short- and long-term disability. Patients often present for care with a primary desire for pain relief. Imaging is not typically helpful for acute back pain in a patient without the aforementioned “red flag” risk factors. It will not change management for a patient with a neurologically intact exam. When caring for a patient with acute back pain, it is important to emphasize the relative value of imaging and why (or why not) it is indicated.

If a patient is deemed stable for discharge home and a plan for outpatient follow-up, one should review return precautions related to pathological and surgical causes of back pain. Symptoms suggestive of spinal cord compression might include bilateral arm or leg symptoms, weakness, numbness, urinary retention, urinary or stool incontinence, gait difficulty, or worsening midline back pain in a patient with a history of malignancy.
