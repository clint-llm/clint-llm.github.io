The management of patients with ADPKD is optimal with an interprofessional team. The key to management is the control of blood pressure and slow down the progression towards end stage renal disease. Healthcare workers who follow these patients should closely monitor the blood pressure and renal function at regular intervals.

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are the mainstays of therapy, with beta-blockade and calcium-channel blockers as second-line therapy. As third-line therapy, thiazides are preferred in patients with normal renal function, while loop diuretics are preferred in patients with impaired renal function.

These patients also need to be screened for a cerebral aneurysm. Patients should be urged to quit smoking and remain compliant with their antihypertensive medications.

Multiple additional therapies have been studied in the effort to prevent the progression of ADPKD. Dietary sodium restriction, which was part of the HALT-PKD trial, was shown to possibly reduce renal progression, as sodium excretion was associated with an increased risk of kidney growth and eGFR decline.

Statins have shown some benefit in all-cause chronic kidney disease and have suggested benefit in ADPKD patients.  Statins are deployed in chronic kidney disease patients as progressive renal failure is a coronary heart disease equivalent.

For patients who fail to control their blood pressure, the prognosis is poor. (Level V)
