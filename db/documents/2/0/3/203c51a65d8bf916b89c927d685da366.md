The lung is a primary location for a large proportion of human disease. Lung disease further classifies into obstructive and restrictive disease.

Obstructive Disease:

The definition of obstructive disease is lung disease with impaired expiration. It presents with decreased FVC, decreased FEV1, and most notably, a dramatic decrease in FEV1/FVC. In obstructive disease, the air that should be expired is not, which leads to air trapping and an increased FRC. The two major examples of obstructive disease are listed below:

Asthma: a multifactorial disease characterized by chronic bronchial inflammation leading to eventual air trapping. Several key characteristics are as follows.

- Airway disease is mostly reversible (i.e., with the administration of a beta-agonist).

- Can cause chronic cough, wheeze, tachypnea, and dyspnea.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD): a constellation of clinical symptoms that share features of both emphysema and chronic bronchitis leading to expiratory airflow limitation.

- Chronic bronchitis demonstrates long-term airway inflammation causing excessive cough and sputum production.

- Emphysema characteristically shows enlarged airspaces (loss of alveolar elasticity) leading to chronic dyspnea. The overly-distended airspaces prevent the lungs from adequately emptying.

- Smoking is the primary cause of the disease and is directly related to the severity of the disease course.

- Cigarettes induce inflammation in the lungs.

- Airways show small airway disease and parenchymal destruction.

Restrictive Disease:

Restrictive lung disease is lung disease in which restricted lung expansion causes decreased lung volumes. Its characteristics include both a decreased FVC and decreased FEV1; however, the FEV1 is more reduced than FVC, causing FEV1/FVC to increase. Several examples of restrictive lung disease are listed below

- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

- Pneumoconiosis

- Sarcoidosis
