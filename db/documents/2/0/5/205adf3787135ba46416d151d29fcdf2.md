Prior to performing an endometrial ablation, it is important to discuss the patientâ€™s expectations of menstrual bleeding after the procedure. The goal is to decrease the amount of heavy menstrual bleeding, therefore improving the patient's quality of life. Women who desire amenorrhea may not be good candidates for endometrial ablation. Amenorrhea rates were 15% to 72% 12 months after the procedure.
