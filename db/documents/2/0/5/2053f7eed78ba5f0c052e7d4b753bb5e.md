A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of NTG. Whereas IOP is the main driver of progressive visual loss in most patients with POAG, NTG likely represents a heterogeneous or multifactorial group of etiologies, with a common final pathway of retinal ganglion cell loss. Despite IOP in the statistically normal range, there is evidence that an IOP-dependent mechanism plays a role in the etiology in many eyes with NTG.

Proposed IOP-independent mechanisms include vascular insufficiency at the optic nerve head, metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, oxidative stress, and abnormal biomechanics of the lamina cribrosa.
