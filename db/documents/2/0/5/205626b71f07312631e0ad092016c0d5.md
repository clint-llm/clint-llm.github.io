Status epilepticus is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes emergency and neurology nurses. Pharmacists are responsible for making sure medications are readily available. To improve outcomes, clinicians should avoid unnecessary imaging studies or laboratory workup when the patient is having a seizure. Status epilepticus must be addressed quickly and in an organized manner, with simultaneous assessment/management of the airway, breathing, and circulation, while also administering antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The primary goal of management is to definitively abort seizure activity as rapidly as possible while supporting the patientâ€™s cardiovascular and respiratory status.

Once the patient is stable, investigations can begin.
