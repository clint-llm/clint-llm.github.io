Hepatic hemangiomas are benign, hypervascular, venous malformations that occur in the liver. They are the most common benign mesenchymal tumors of the liver. Hemangiomas are lined by endothelial cells with a thin fibrous stroma. They are also known as cavernous or capillary hepatic hemangiomas. They are generally asymptomatic and incidentally found on imaging. They are often found as solitary lesions, but multiple lesions may also be present. They are categorized by size. Small hemangiomas are 1 cm to 2 cm, typical hemangiomas are 2 cm to 10 cm, and giant hemangiomas are greater than 10 cm. This activity describes the presentation of hepatic hemangioma and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the management of patients with this disorder.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the potential etiology of hepatic hemangiomas.
- Review the presentation of a patient with liver hemangioma.
- Describe the management options available for hepatic hemangioma.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of liver hemangioma and improve outcomes.
