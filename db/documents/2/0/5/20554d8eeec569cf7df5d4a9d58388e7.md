The prognosis of holiday heart syndrome varies depending on the presence of any underlying cardiac disease. Chronic alcohol use raises the risk of arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, and chronic liver disease. It should be noted that although the majority (>90%) of alcohol-related atrial fibrillation cases resolve spontaneously, approximately 20% to 30% may recur within 12 months.
