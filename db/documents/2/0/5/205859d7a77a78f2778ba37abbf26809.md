Systemic corticosteroids have had a significant impact on the treatment of pemphigus vulgaris and remain the backbone in the management of PV.

Second-line treatment is in combination with corticosteroids and includes adding either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and ofatumumab, have also been used in conjunction with corticosteroids for first-line treatment in moderate-to-severe pemphigus.

Third-line treatments for PV include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), cyclophosphamide, dapsone, immunoadsorption, and methotrexate.

Most of the emerging therapies that could be effective for PV are monoclonal antibodies, with the cost being a major restriction to large trials. Obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, and veltuzumab are anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies that may be an alternative to rituximab. Other therapies that may offer hope in PV include medicationsÂ that target B-cell derived B-cell activating factor (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), CD19, Bruton kinase (BTK), and interleukin (IL-4).

Future PV research should focus on better understanding the specific pathogenic molecules and cytokines, after which better therapies can be produced.
