An interprofessional team best manages superficial actinic porokeratosis. Primary care providers should refer patients to dermatologists if the diagnosis is in doubt or for some treatments. Oncologists and transplant physicians should be vigilant and have a high level of suspicion for this diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware that superficial actinic porokeratosis is a premalignant lesion, and patients should be advised to avoid the sun and tanning spas. Anytime there is a change in lesion characteristics, a biopsy is recommended.  Pharmacists educate patients about medications, check for drug-drug interactions, and monitor for compliance. [Level 5]
