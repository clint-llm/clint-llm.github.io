The etiology and pathophysiology of TE and TB are only partially understood. TE is derived from epithelial-mesenchymal cells, and multiple TEs may be associated with a familial genetic condition called multiple familial trichoepithelioma (MFT). MFT is a disorder linked to two autosomal dominant mutations affecting tumor suppressor genes. The first gene is on chromosome 9q21.

The second is the cylindromatous tumor suppressor gene (CYLD) on chromosome 16q12-q13, which is also the gene implicated in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome.

Like TE, most cases of TB present sporadically and in isolation. Most solitary TB lesions are associated with 9q22.3 mutations.
