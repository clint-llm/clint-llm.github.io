Endometrial hyperplasia is the result of chronic exposure to estrogen along with a relative deficiency of progesterone. The causes of estrogen excess could be endogenous or exogenous. The risk factors associated with endometrial hyperplasia are as follows

- Age

- Nulliparity

- Obesity

- Genetic

- Diabetes Mellitus

- Anovulatory cycles- PCOS, perimenopause

- Ovarian tumors- granulosa cell tumors

- Hormone replacement therapy- estrogen-only therapy can lead to endometrial hyperplasia at even a minimal dose and is contraindicated in women with a uterus. Over the counter/ herbal preparations may have a high amount of estrogen.

- Immunosuppression (renal graft recipients) and infection may also be involved in the development of endometrial hyperplasia.

- Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Lynch syndrome – women with this condition are at a greatly increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.
