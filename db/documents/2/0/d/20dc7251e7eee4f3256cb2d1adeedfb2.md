Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome is often encountered by the primary care physician, nurse practitioner, or internist. While the diagnosis is relatively simple, the management is unsatisfactory. The disorder is progressive and carries very high morbidity and mortality. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, mental health nurse, psychiatrist, gastroenterologist, ophthalmologist, and an intensivist. The nurse should assist the clinician in inpatient and family education as the need for education is significant and requires reinforcement. Despite optimal treatment, full recovery does not occur. the majority of patients end up in a long term care facility and have a guarded prognosis.
