Lead intoxication is one of the most well-described environmental intoxications worldwide, and it continues to be a commonly encountered disease both in developing nations and in the first world. It was first described by the physician Galen of ancient Greece as early as 200 BC as a disease of the bowels after he observed the effects of drinking water from lead pipes on the GI system.

In first world nations, focuses on the elimination of lead in gasoline and in household paints has significantly decreased the incidence of high dose lead exposures. However, low-dose chronic exposures, as well as higher dose exposures in industrial settings and in developing nations, continues to be an issue. One of the most deadly late-stage complications of lead intoxication is lead encephalopathy.

Mediated primarily by leadâ€™s effects on cerebrovascular endothelium, lead encephalopathy often presents in vague or subtle ways that may also be complicated by other effects of lead toxicity. While uncommon, lead encephalopathy is a life-threatening illness that must be considered, diagnosed, and treated in the appropriate clinical settings.
