It is crucial that the uterus can respond to hormones released from the corpus luteum. In some individuals, a luteal-phase dysfunction can induce a premature regression of the corpus luteum. This state then disrupts the ovulatory cycle. Steroidogenesis of the corpus luteum relies on the availability of cholesterol, achieved by the transference of cholesterol molecules to the site of steroid production. A dysfunction in this rate-limiting step can decrease the amount of steroid made, limiting what can be released. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein is an integral part of this process that plays an important role in progesterone concentrations during the early and mid-luteal phases.
