The transmission of HIV through bite wounds is concerning though exceedingly rare.  HIV prophylaxis is only indicated if the wound is percutaneous and the mouth was contaminated with blood.  Otherwise, the side effect profile of prophylaxis is more dangerous than the risk of transmission.  A thorough discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits is warranted and should be documented with the appropriate outpatient follow up recommended/referred.  For medical professionals, there has been no reported transmission of HIV from any occupational exposure.

Herpetic whitlow is caused by transmission of the herpes virus to the finger and appears as painful grouped vesicles on an erythematous base.  It is most typically from a child sticking fingers into adults’ mouths and should be considered whenever a child presents with lesions on the distal fingers.

There is no post-exposure prophylaxis for Hepatitis C exposure, simply monitoring for signs of infection with outpatient follow-up.  Hepatitis B exposure requires immune globulin only if the person bitten by an infected individual has never been immunized or is a known non-responder to the vaccine.  Anyone who has never had their response to the vaccine measured and is exposed should be tested for the anti-HBs response and treated if negative.
