Distal radius fractures may have either surgical or non-surgical treatment. Non-surgical treatment necessitates acceptable fracture displacement, angulation, and shortening. Should these criteria not be met, surgical treatment is the recommended approach.

Acceptable criteria for distal radius fractures include:

- Radial height: Less than 5 mm shortening

- Radial inclination: Less than 5-degree change

- Articular step off: Less than 2 mm

- Volar tilt: Dorsal angulation less than 5 degrees or within 20 degrees of the contralateral distal radius

Displaced fractures must undergo a closed reduction in an attempt to achieve an anatomic or acceptable reduction. Adequate anesthesia or analgesia, such as conscious sedation or hematoma block, are necessary for closed reduction.

Non-displaced fractures are treated without surgery in a long-arm splint acutely and transitioned to a short-arm cast in the office for a total of 6 weeks with serial radiographs to monitor for fracture displacement and healing.

For fractures that do not meet acceptable alignment, surgical intervention is recommended.
