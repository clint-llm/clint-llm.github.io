Prehospital personnel is the first medical contact for victims involved in MCI. Effectively applying resources and an organized, systemic method of delivering people appropriately to receiving facilities is, in theory, the key to improved outcomes. Effectively applying out-of-hospital treatments, such as basic airway management and bleeding control has the potential to save lives, and the NIMS structure aids in the organization and application of resources.

**Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes**

Interprofessional communication and coordination is imperative to the success of the medical incident command structure and is truly at the heart of the incident command. Joint training among public safety agencies, disaster response teams, and hospitals is key to identifying mistakes and shortcomings of response plans (PMID).

Some large-scale medical incidents require deploying medical care teams for mobile hospitals including physicians and nurses that are required to work with prehospital personnel in an out-of-hospital environment. Fostering understanding of roles of nurses, physicians, and EMS personnel is imperative to successful interprofessional communication in a disaster setting.

Research on mass casualty incidents and disaster is limited to simulated incidents and retrospective reviews of disaster response. One retrospective incident review revealed that many decisions made during the initial evaluation of an incident are made with uncertainty and pressure, and those making decisions are more prone to choose a “workable option” rather than consider all options thoroughly (PMID).
