**Ho and Su classification system**based on clinical signs

- Mild Bursitis: local inflammation with no associated systemic signs.

- Moderate Bursitis: significant local inflammation with or without mild systemic signs.

- Severe Bursitis: intense peri-bursal cellulitis with or without infected wound with systemic signs e.g.Â pyrexia or rigors, or a serum leukocytosis >10,000/mm.

Severity within the classification increases one level if there is a comorbidity that is likely to affect healing or immune response.
