Temporally, pericarditis can be divided into “acute pericarditis” if it lasts for less than 4-6 weeks, “incessant pericarditis” is it lasts for more than 4-6 weeks but less than 3 months, or “chronic pericarditis” if it lasts for more than 3 months. “Recurrent pericarditis” is the term used to denote an episode that occurs after a symptom-free interval of 4-6 weeks in between episodes.

Acute pericarditis accounts for approximately 5% of non-ischemic emergency department chest pain presentations, and for 0.1% of inpatient admissions.

Pericardial pain may be differentiated from ischemic pain, which is worsened by exertion and emotion, and improved with rest or nitroglycerin. The latter is also typically non-positional, non-pleuritic and non-reproducible with palpation. However, atypical presentations of ischemic pain are numerous, and a clinical distinction is frequently difficult.
