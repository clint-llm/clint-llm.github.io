The primary transmission of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in the hospital setting is through the hands of healthcare providers. Enterococcus can persist on hands for as long as 60 minutes after inoculation and as long as four months on inanimate surfaces. Basic infection control prevention practices such as hand hygiene can help. This includes washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rubs before and after patient encounters. Contact precautions such as wearing gowns and gloves also decrease transmission. In addition, infection control measures such as active surveillance cultures for high-risk patients, patient isolation, and terminal cleaning of rooms are effective.
