The primary function of the Eustachian tube is to equalize air pressure between the atmosphere and the middle ear. Yawning and swallowing cause contraction of the muscles connected to the Eustachian tube, enabling the tube to open to small amounts of air. This opening allows for the equalization of pressure between the atmosphere and the middle ear, resulting in a “popping” sound. The equalizing of middle ear pressure is crucial to the proper workings of the eardrum. With equalized air pressure, the eardrum can vibrate appropriately and transmit sound. Additionally, by functioning as microturbinates, mucosal folds in the Eustachian tube lumen work in conjunction with the surface cilia to promote the clearance of secretions from the middle ear to the nasopharynx.

Furthermore, the Eustachian tube functions in the protection of inner ear structures. The ET links the sterile middle ear to the unsterile outside world, performing four additional specific functions.

- Local immune defense

- Mechanical protection against rhinopharyngeal secretions and pathogenic microorganism reflux

- Protection against the retrograde propagation of vocal sounds

- Mucociliary clearance of middle ear secretions into the rhinopharynx

In simple terms, the anteroinferior portion of the Eustachian tubes primarily functions in the mucociliary clearance process. In contrast, the posterosuperior portion of the Eustachian tube primarily functions in gas exchange.
