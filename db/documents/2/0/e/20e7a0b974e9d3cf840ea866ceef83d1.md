The continuous contact between the hard feces and the colonic mucosa can cause an increase in mucus secretion. Fecal impaction also causes an increase in intraluminal pressure in the colon which causes a decrease in perfusion of the colonic mucosa and wall. The resulting localized inflammation can give rise to colitis, ulcerations, and possible perforation. When stercoral perforation occurs, the most frequent site is the sigmoid colon. Stercoral perforation that occurs in the rectosigmoid region is attributed to feces being hardest in the rectosigmoid. Also, the diameter of sigmoid is the narrowest in the colon. These factors lead to an increased intraluminal pressure and result in hypoperfusion of the antimesenteric wall casing perforation. The impacted fecal mass may cause compression of adjacent structures such as urinary bladder, causing urinary retention.
