Abnormally increased eosinophils in lung parenchyma occurs due to infectious and non-infectious causes.

Non-infectious causes include:

- Idiopathic

- Drug (phenytoin, ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, ranitidine, acetaminophen, iodides)

- Toxin-induced

- Environmental triggers

- Malignancy

- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

- Hypereosinophilic syndromes

- Churg-Strauss syndrome

- Smoking

Infectious causes of pulmonary eosinophilia are almost always due to parasitic infections. These include ascariasis, Strongyloides, hookworms, filarial nematodes, Paragonimus, and Toxocara.

Cases of acutely eosinophilic pneumonia are mostly idiopathic. Parasitic infections and drug/toxin can also present acutely.
