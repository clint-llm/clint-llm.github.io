Lymphangiomas are uncommon, benign malformations of the lymphatic system that can occur anywhere on the skin and mucous membranes. Lymphangiomas can be categorized as deep or superficial based on the depth and size of the abnormal lymphatic vessels or as congenital or acquired.

The deep forms of lymphangioma include two specific well defined congenital entities: cavernous lymphangiomas and cystic hygromas**.**
