As previously mentioned, delusions can precipitate in the setting of psychotic spectrum disorders, manic depressive illness, and isolation. Some research indicates that as many as 20% of those who experience a severe mood disorder may experience delusions, most of which are persecutory or derisive. Delusions in affective disorders tend to have more of a mood component and may be slightly more organized than those seen in schizophrenia.

Delusions also occur with some frequency in various dementia syndromes

In a 2006 study, Scarmeas found that approximately 50% of patients with Lewy body dementia experienced delusions and noted these patients were prone to delusional misidentification syndromes such as Capgras or Fregoli syndrome.
