Patients need to understand the ramifications following a splenectomy. After spleen removal, they are more prone to infections. They should discuss vaccines with the primary clinician and report for examination at even the slightest sign of an infection or cold. If they receive antibiotics for an infection, they must be compliant and not vary from the course of treatment. Lastly, they should strongly consider a medical ID bracelet that indicates they have had a splenectomy.
