**Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy**

Patients may initially have normal vision after awakening from anesthesia for as long as a few days, followed by painless, unilateral, or bilateral progressive loss of vision. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) if unilateral or absent pupillary reflexes of involved optic nerves. Visual complaints may include scotoma, absent light perception, or altitudinal field cuts. On early funduscopic examination, there is an edematous optic disc with a background of attenuated vessels and peripapillary hemorrhages. On late funduscopic examination, the edema has resolved, the vessels appear normal, and there is now evidence of optic nerve pallor.

**Posterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy**

In posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, patients experience painless and typically bilateral vision loss present immediately after awakening from anesthesia. RAPD if unilateral or absent pupillary reflexes of involved optic nerves. Visual complaints may include scotoma, absent light perception, or altitudinal field cuts.

**Orbital Compartment Syndrome**

Patients complain of painful visual loss present upon awakening from anesthesia which may progress over the following days. The painful vision loss is associated with acute periocular edema, conjunctival swelling, and proptosis.

**Corneal Abrasion**

Patients complain of painful unilateral or bilateral vision loss present upon awakening from anesthesia accompanied by tearing, the sensation of foreign body, and photophobia. Visible abrasion or a foreign body may be visible on the inspection with fluorescein staining.

**Central Retinal Artery Occlusion**

Patients experience unilateral vision loss present upon awakening from anesthesia—sluggish or absent pupillary light reflex. On early funduscopic examination, patients may have a cherry-red spot at the macula in the background of the whitened ischemic retina. On late funduscopic examination, patients may have optic nerve pallor in the setting of a re-perfused retina.

**Cortical Blindness**

In cortical blindness, vision loss is present upon awakening from anesthesia. If a unilateral cerebral hemisphere is involved, contralateral homonymous hemianopsia may be present with or without macular sparing. If bilateral cerebral hemispheres are involved, expect a complete vision loss with or without macular sparing. In posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), altered consciousness presenting as agitation, confusion, or coma may be present.

**Pituitary Apoplexy**

In pituitary apoplexy, the vision loss, if present, is present upon awakening from anesthesia. The typical pattern is bitemporal hemianopsia or a junctional scotoma. In addition to visual loss, headache, nausea, vomiting, meningeal signs, altered mental status, and ophthalmoplegia may be present.
