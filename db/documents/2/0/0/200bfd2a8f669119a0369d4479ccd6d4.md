An interprofessional team is necessary to make sure that an ETT is placed appropriately, especially in the emergency department setting. As there is not one definitive method to ensure appropriate ETT placement, an interprofessional team working together to confirm several means of tube placement is necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes. For example, after emergent intubation in the emergency department, a respiratory therapist may ensure a good color change of the end-tidal CO2 detector while also securing the ETT. Simultaneously, nursing staff may auscultate over the lung fields and abdomen to ensure good quality, equal breath sounds in the thoracic cavity with absent breath sounds in the abdomen. The physician will be monitoring the pulse ox while ordering a stat portable chest x-ray to confirm placement of the tube. It has become more common and standard of care to have a constant waveform monitor for end tidal CO2 for intubated patients, especially in the OR and ICU.Â  Collaboration, closed-loop communication, and the principles of crisis resource management are necessary for the success of teams working in acute care environments.
