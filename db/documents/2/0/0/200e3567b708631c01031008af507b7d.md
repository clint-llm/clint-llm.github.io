Poroma is a benign tumor with mild clinical symptoms, and rarely it can progress to porocarcinoma. An interprofessional team approach is important. Proper collaboration and communication between dermatologists, histopathologists, and surgical specialists are very important. Skin biopsy for histopathology is indicated in all cases with suspected poroma, in order to eliminate the diagnosis of its malignant variant. Porocarcinoma is a rare malignancy but is curable if accurately diagnosed and properly treated.
