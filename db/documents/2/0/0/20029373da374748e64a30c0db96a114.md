The history and physical examination can help diagnose malignant pleural effusion. In history, attention should be focused on the chief complaint.

**Chief Complaint**

- Weakness

- Malaise

- Fever

- Weight loss

- Dyspnea

- Chest pain

**Physical Signs**

Other physical signs of malignancy-induced pleural effusions are:

- Tachypnea

- Tachycardia

- Diaphoresis

- Neck mass

- Chest mass

**Physical Examination**

Patients should be examined in a position of comfort. Most patients with malignant pleural effusion usually have a mass in the mediastinal cavity that may cause respiratory distress or discomfort. The general appearance of a child with malignant pleural effusion may reveal a diaphoretic, dyspneic patient with mild to moderate respiratory distress.

Auscultation might reveal a pleuritic chest rub in the early stage, which might gradually disappear as the accumulation of pleural fluid increases. Excessive fluid accumulation might cause displacement of the cardiac apex and the trachea to the contralateral side.

Examination of the affected side might show dullness to percussion with decreased tactile fremitus and egophony. This might be a diagnostic challenge in an uncooperative child.
