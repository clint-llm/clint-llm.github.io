The diagnosis of FHH can be easy to make in an asymptomatic hypercalcemic patient with a family his­tory of hypercalcemia, a personal or family history of failed neck exploration, or normal serum PTH

The differentiation between FHH and primary hyperparathyroidism is more difficult in the absence of a family history of hypercalcemia if PTH levels are normal and if the Ca/Cr clearance ratio is greater than 0.01 and less than 0.02. The age at diagnosis of hypercalcemia and family history is important. Detection of asymp­tomatic hypercalcemia before the age of 40 years or so favors the diagnosis of FHH. Obtaining serum calcium values from first-degree relatives in the absence of family history can be helpful.

Other causes of PTH-dependent hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should be ruled out, for example, vitamin D deficiency, very low calcium intake, mild renal insufficiency, and treatment with thiazide diuretics or lithium. Correction of any of these abnormalities will lead to hypercalciuria if the patient has PHPT. Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) may be elevated in patients with PHPT.

Calcium infusion has also been used to distinguish renal calcium handling in FHH from that in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). In PHPT, a rising filtered load of cal­cium increases urinary calcium excretion, whereas this response is absent in FHH
