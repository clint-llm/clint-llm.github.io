It also has several off-label indications. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of modafinil, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with conditions where modafinil has a therapeutic purpose.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of modafinil.
- Review the approved and off-label indications for modafinil.
- Summarize the adverse events to modafinil therapy.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from therapy with modafinil.
