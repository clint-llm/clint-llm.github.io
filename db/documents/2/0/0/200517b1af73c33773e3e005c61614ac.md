Relative nerve enlargement due to increased thinly myelinated fibers, sub-perineural edema, thickened peri-neurieum, and Renaut bodies are likely histopathological findings in entrapment cases. There is likely Wallerian centrofascicular degeneration in large fascicles with sub-perineural lesions in smaller fascicles and denervated Schwann cells adjacent to some of the Renaut bodies suggesting some degree of axonal drop-out. There will be foci of endoneurial edema with the accumulation of fibroblasts, fibrillar substance, and Renaut bodies.
