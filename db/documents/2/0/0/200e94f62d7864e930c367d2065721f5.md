Prognosis for orthostatic syncope depends on the underlying cause of orthostatic hypotension. The prognosis is good in non-neurally mediated orthostatic syncope once the cause of postural hypotension is identified and treated - fluid resuscitation in dehydration or volume depletion, transfusion for blood loss, discontinuation of offending antihypertensive medications. In neurally mediated syncope, prognosis depends on the course of the underlying medical condition. However, in the Framingham heart study, patients with syncope of unknown cause or neurologic syncope had an increased risk of death from any cause in multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of 1.32 and 1.54 respectively.
