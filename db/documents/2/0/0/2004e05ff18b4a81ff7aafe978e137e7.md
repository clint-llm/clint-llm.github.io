Although drug testing can be used to confirm the recent use of a substance, it also has a role in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of addiction. As a tool for monitoring, this type of testing has the potential to measure the performance of a patient’s substance use treatment. Urine drug testing (UDT) remains the most common modality for detecting drugs in the human body, and it is based on immunoassay techniques. Clinicians should understand the value of random drug testing as opposed to scheduled testing, particularly in the context of a suspected or established substance use disorder.

There are several factors that need to be considered when choosing a particular drug test. Using a certain matrix or rotating matrices can reduce the chances of sample tampering. There are also times when a certain matrix may not be appropriate (i.e., using a hair sample with chemically treated hair or using directly observed urine testing when a patient has had sexual trauma). There is also often a tradeoff when choosing one test over another. Some tests may be regarded as “presumptive” while others are regarded as “definitive." Presumptive tests will typically give a faster result, which may aid in timely clinical decision-making. However, the specificity and/or sensitivity may be lower compared to a definitive test. There may be times when the patient will dispute the results of a presumptive test, and a more definitive test can then be done to provide clarification. A clinician may consider going directly to definitive testing if there is no reasonable presumptive test or if the results of the testing will have major implications.

An important consideration in drug testing is establishing a predetermined cutoff concentration. This value determines the concentration of a xenobiotic in a specimen that results in a positive test. This threshold should be sufficiently high to prevent false-positive results due to cross-reactivity and variability in the test itself and be low enough to prevent false negatives in those who regularly use the xenobiotic being tested for. The exact cutoff can vary depending on the specific xenobiotic, the immunoassay being used, or the clinical context.

**Types of Matrices**

Urine testing typically has a detection window of hours to days. It usually takes two hours before a substance can be detected in the urine. Factors like urine pH and fluid intake can have an impact on the results. Urine is the most well-established matrix and is the most commonly used matrix for point-of-care testing (POCT). The detection window can be up to 4 days for some substances. Chronic use can extend this window out to weeks.

Blood testing is primarily done in emergency situations and is typically used to detect ethanol levels. The advantage of blood testing is that it allows for a precise level to be assessed. Additionally, testing for drugs of abuse often requires that samples be sent to an outside lab. The detection window is usually one to two days.

Breath testing is also primarily used for alcohol detection. More precisely, it allows for the assessment of recent alcohol use. The result is called a breath alcohol concentration or BrAC. The BrAC is often used as an estimate of blood alcohol concentration (BAC). However, on an individual basis, the BrAC can either overestimate or underestimate the blood ethanol level. Research has been focusing on the potential use of breath testing for the detection of cocaine, cannabis, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, opioids, methadone, and buprenorphine.

Oral fluid testing (OFT) generally detects concentration that correlates with plasma concentrations. However, the concentration of orally consumed substances will be higher. Oral testing is more likely to detect parent compounds versus urine testing which relies more heavily on metabolite concentrations. The detection window varies but can be up to 48 hours.

Sweat testing is completed through the use of an absorbent pad that is collected. The results of testing this pad give a cumulative concentration that suggests how much of a substance that person consumed over the entire period that the pad was worn. There can be problems with contamination or incomplete adhesion of the patch to the skin. One benefit of sweat testing is that it gives a detection window of hours to weeks.

Hair, as a matrix for the detection of substances, can provide information on cumulative substance use. Similar to sweat testing, hair testing has a long detection window. Scalp hair has a detection window of three months, while slower-growing body hair (such as pubic or axillary hair) has a detection window of up to 12 months. The results of the hair testing can vary based on the individual in regards to the characteristics of their hair. Hair testing can be used for the detection of cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), amphetamines, opioids, and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Potential shortcomings of this matrix include price, environmental cross-contamination, and issues during decontamination prior to testing and establishing cut-off values.

Often, contingency management is paired with drug testing in the treatment of addiction, and behavioral incentives are allowed on the basis of a negative result. These incentives (or “reinforcers”) can be vouchers or prizes that are given to encourage the patient to continue their abstinence from a particular substance. The use of POC testing, in particular, makes the implementation of contingency management easier because of the rapid results that can be achieved.
