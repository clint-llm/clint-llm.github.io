Diagnosis of this disease must be carefully made as its clinical presentation is similar to other vasculitides affecting small or medium-sized vessels and includes:

- ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) associated vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), microscopic polyangiitis.

- IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura)

- Cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis

- Hypersensitivity vasculitis

- Vasculitis associated with a connective tissue disorder (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome)

Including other thrombotic and embolic disorders (e.g., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome) should be considered as well.

Patients affected with chronic hepatitis C virus infection may develop arthralgias membranoproliferative nephritis even without cryoglobulinemia. So further testing is required to reach a definitive diagnosis.
