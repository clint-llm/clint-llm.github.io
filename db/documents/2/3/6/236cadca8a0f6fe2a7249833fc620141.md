Many modern antineoplastic drugs are ototoxic including bleomycin, cis-platinum, methotrexate, and bumetanide. These cause hearing loss and tinnitus that may not be reversible.

- Ethacrynic acid, acetazolamide, are diuretics listed as ototoxic

- Aspirin in higher doses causes tinnitus. Fortunately, this is reversible. Tinnitus has been reported with other NSAID medications.

Caution must be exercised in evaluating tinnitus from a new drug because of the very high incidence of tinnitus in the population. In a double-blind study, tinnitus may be reported as occurring in the placebo group. When anti-neoplastic drugs are used, regular hearing tests are done to watch for the onset of hearing loss or tinnitus so that the drug can be stopped if possible.
