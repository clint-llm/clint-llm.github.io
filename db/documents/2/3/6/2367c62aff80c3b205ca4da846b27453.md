While there is no way to deter the formation of renal cysts it is important to educate patients who develop or inherit them about the nature of their cysts. Patients with incidentally found Bosniak type I or II cysts should be assured there is a minimal chance of malignancy and no scheduled follow-up is required. Patients with Bosniak type IIF cysts should be educated about the need for them to attend their follow-up visits to ensure the cyst is not progressing. Patients with Bosniak type II or IV cysts should be educated about their risk of malignancy and a long-term care plan should be established both for the resection of their cyst and for their postoperative care. The parents of patients with recessive (pediatric) polycystic kidney disease should be educated on their child's lifelong need for dialysis as well as discussing the possibility of a kidney transplant in the future. Likewise, patients with dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease who progress to end-stage renal disease should be educated about dialysis as well as the possibility of a future kidney transplant.
