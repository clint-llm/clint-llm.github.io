Once it has been decided that a patient is a good candidate for reduction mammoplasty, one of the surgical techniques will be selected. The technique chosen needs to result in a minimal chance of serious complications such as wound dehiscence, flap necrosis, overelevation of the nipple, and ischemic loss of the nipple. The procedure needs to fulfill the reconstructive goals of weight reduction, attractive appearing breasts, and minimal scars. Finally, the procedure needs to successfully reduce the breast, so there is minimal risk of revision.
