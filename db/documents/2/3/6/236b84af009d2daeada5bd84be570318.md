A thorough evaluation of elbow trauma by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and the emergency department physician is vital for optimal patient outcomes. Radiographic evaluation of elbow trauma is an essential tool in the acute setting, and a firm understanding of anatomy, radiographic landmarks, and common injury is necessary. For chronic elbow overuse injury, radiography, and MRI are vital tools for diagnostic. Making the right diagnosis and not delaying treatment can reduce unwanted complication.

Elbow trauma management requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, physical therapists, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
