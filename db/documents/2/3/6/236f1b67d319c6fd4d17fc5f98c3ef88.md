Myotonic dystrophy is a rare progressive disorder that universally presents with weakness. In addition to musculoskeletal weakness, cardiac conduction defects and early cataracts are common. There are two distinct forms of myotonic dystrophy: DM1 and DM2. Treatment involves an interprofessional approach managing the medical complications associated with myotonic dystrophy as there is no treatment targeting the disorder itself. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of myotonic dystrophy and highlights the role of the interprofessional teams in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of myotonic dystrophy and its associated medical conditions and management.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the different forms of myotonic dystrophy.
- Review the associated medical comorbidities associated with myotonic dystrophy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and treatment strategies to improve outcomes.
