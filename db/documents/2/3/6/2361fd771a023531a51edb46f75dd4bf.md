Although breast augmentation surgery has a low risk of acute complications, it is imperative to make all attempts to minimize any risks. Over the years, many litigations have resulted primarily due to the lack of informed consent. The pre-operative visit conducted by a nurse can help ensure that all post-operative care instructions are understood and followed. Patients should be instructed to discontinue smoking and make a positive change in lifestyle so that the results of the surgery will last a long time. Patients who follow their given post-operative instructions will likely have a lower rate of complications.  Also, pharmacists can play a role in the care of a breast augmentation patient by ensuring that patients have no allergies to their prescribed medicines and by instructing patients on their proper use.  This may help decrease the rate of infections or assist patients in their postoperative pain control.  Interprofessional care provided to the patient may also help to identify any potential problems earlier. Patients should not be offered unrealistic expectations but also told about the potential for an iatrogenic complication. Earlier awareness of a complication can lead to quicker treatment and a better eventual outcome.

**Outcomes**
