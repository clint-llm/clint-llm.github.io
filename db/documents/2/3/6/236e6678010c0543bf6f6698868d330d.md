Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), for example, dalteparin, enoxaparin, among others, are anticoagulants. These drugs are used in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) on acute or elective admission to the hospital, and they are used in the treatment of deep vein thromboses (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

- DVT prophylaxis in medium and high-risk groups (surgical, orthopedic, and medical patients)

- Treatment of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy

- Treatment of DVT and PE in nonpregnant women (those with both high and low risk of recurrence)

- Treatment of STEMI (in both those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and those not)

- Unstable angina

- Prevention of clotting in extracorporeal circuits

LMWHs are not the sole medications used for these purposes; therefore, a thorough understanding of the variously available anticoagulants and their pros and cons is necessary for an appropriate prescription.
