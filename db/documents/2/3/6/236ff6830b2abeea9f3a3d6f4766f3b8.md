Patients diagnosed with postpartum endometritis should be managed by clinicians experienced in treating this condition. For patients presenting to emergency departments, urgent care clinics, and primary care providers who do not practice obstetrics, referral to an obstetrician is appropriate.

Patients with fertility challenges should be referred to a Reproductive Endocrinologist/Infertility (REI) specialist.
