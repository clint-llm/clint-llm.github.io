A typical patient with microscopic colitis will present with non-bloody, watery diarrhea that has been present for some time. As this condition definitively presents with chronic diarrhea, symptoms should be present with that definition which is three or more loose or watery stools daily lasting more than 4 weeks. Typically, the patient presenting with these symptoms will be middle-aged or older, and female, however, this can present anytime in life and both genders. Symptoms are normally between four to nine watery bowel movements daily, though there have been reports of severe disease with 15 or more bowel movements daily. Associated symptoms can be fecal urgency, incontinence, nocturnal episodes, and half of the patients will have abdominal discomfort or pain. As this is a form of inflammatory bowel disease, there are reports of other manifestations such as arthralgia, arthritis, and/or uveitis. Between the primary two types of microscopic colitis, collagenous colitis seems to be associated with more severe bowel inflammation and lymphocytic colitis appears to occur earlier in life.
