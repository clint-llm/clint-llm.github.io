Branches of the superior and inferior genicular arteries supply the MCL. They enter through the epiligamentous (surface) layer; thus, the surface of the MCL is highly vascular. Its microvasculature branches into smaller neurovascular bundles deeper within the ligament, making deeper levels less vascular. No vessels cross bone, but they doÂ enter the soft tissue of the ligament near the bony interfaces. Thus, the area near the bony insertions is more richly vascularized.
