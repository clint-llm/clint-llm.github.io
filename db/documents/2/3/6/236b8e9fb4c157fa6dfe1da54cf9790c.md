ACO is associated with more severe symptoms, reduced quality of life, and more frequent exacerbations. Also, It is associated with a rapid decrease in lung function.

Moreover, as individuals with frequent exacerbations experience a higher loss of lung function, a reduced FEV1 is linked to worsening disease severity, especially concerning people with ACO.
