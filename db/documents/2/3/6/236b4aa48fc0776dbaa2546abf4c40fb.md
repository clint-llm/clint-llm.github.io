The placenta is a maternal-fetal organ that begins development at implantation of the blastocyst, and it is delivered at birth with the fetus. The fetus relies on the placenta for nutrition and many developmentally essential functions.

Abnormalities range from those anatomically associated with degree or site of implantation, those of structure and placental function, to placenta-maternal effects such as pre-eclampsia and fetal erythroblastosis, and finally to mechanical abnormalities associated with the umbilical cord.

The evaluation of the placenta and cord plays an important role in evaluating the viability of the fetus, and ultimately the infant delivered.
