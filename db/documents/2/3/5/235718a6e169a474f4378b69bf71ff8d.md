Acute injuries to the median nerve where an obvious source of stretch or compression is identified, such as in the case of compartment syndrome or an expanding hematoma often require urgent surgical decompression to prevent permanent damage to the motor endplate units of the muscle. However, as a general rule, most compressive neuropathies of the median nerve should undergo a trial of non-operative treatment.

Night splinting is the first-line treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. Splints should hold the wrist in a neutral position, as hyperextension of the wrist increases the pressure within the carpal tunnel. Corticosteroid injections also may be used in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome and delay time to surgery for up to 1 year but are not without risks such as injecting into the nerve itself.

Pronator syndrome should similarly be treated conservatively after an initial evaluation. Splinting and anti-inflammatory medications are the mainstay of initial treatment.
