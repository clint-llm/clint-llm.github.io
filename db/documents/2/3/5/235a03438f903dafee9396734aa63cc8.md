The sural nerve has its origins within the sciatic nerve, coming from terminal branches of the tibial and common fibular nerves.Â The medial sural cutaneous nerve, a terminal branch from the tibial nerve, joins with the lateral sural cutaneous nerve, a terminal branch from the common fibular nerve, to form the sural nerve in the distal third of the calf. The nerve roots commonly involved are S1 and S2.
