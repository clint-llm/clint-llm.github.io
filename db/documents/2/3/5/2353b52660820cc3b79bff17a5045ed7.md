The sensory system is the portion of the nervous system responsible for processing input from the environment. Beginning with detection through the transfer of stimuli to the central nervous system, the peripheral nerves and their associated receptors rapidly relay information. The peripheral nervous system consists of the somatosensory nervous system and autonomic nervous system. The sensory pathway of the somatosensory system involves spinal nerves which transmit information about the external environment to the spinal cord. The autonomic nervous system has visceral sensory neurons which are responsible for monitoring the internal environment and eliciting appropriate changes in effector organs to maintain homeostasis. This article will address both somatic and visceral sensory neurons with an emphasis on the clinical significance of somatic sensory neuropathy.
