There is no antidote for SGLT-2 inhibitors; additionally, SGLT2 inhibitors are not removed by dialysis. A retrospective review of SGLT2 inhibitors overdoses reported to 13 poison centers in the United States revealed that most cases with mild exposure did not develop hypoglycemia except for pediatric patients. Instead, patients predominantly presented with nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. However, an intentional overdose of SGLT2 inhibitors can lead to hypoglycemia, vomiting, confusion, hypertension, tachycardia, and urinary incontinence.****A case report describes euglycemia despite an ertugliflozin overdose. The patient had accidentally ingested ertugliflozin 150 mg; the maximum recommended dose is 15 mg.

Per standard hypoglycemia protocol, treatment requires immediate reversal of low glucose levels by providing oral glucose if the patient can eat - for patients with impaired consciousness, IV dextrose (25 g) is administered to treat hypoglycemia. If no IV access has been established, provide immediate treatment with glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg SC/IM). For refractory hypoglycemia, subcutaneous/intravenous octreotide has been used.
