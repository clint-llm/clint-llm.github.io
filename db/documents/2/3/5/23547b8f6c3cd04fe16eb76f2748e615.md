**Medical Management**

Glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone, prednisone, dexamethasone, and fludrocortisone)

Hydrocortisone is the preferred steroid of choice in children owing to its balanced mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid effects. However, daily dosing with fludrocortisone might still be needed to provide mineralocorticoid activity. Prednisone and dexamethasone are alternative to hydrocortisone in non-compliant patients. Regular monitoring of linear growth and weight gain is mandatory in patients on prednisone and dexamethasone due to growth suppressing effects and longer duration of action.

In patients with isolated alacrima, regular application of topical ocular lubricants is warranted to avoid the risk of dehydration-induced keratopathy.

**Surgical Management**

Perioperative treatment with stress doses of glucocorticoids is necessary for all patients with Allgrove syndrome undergoing surgery. Pneumatic dilatation is the preferred procedure to relieve the lower esophageal sphincter spasm in patients with isolated achalasia.
