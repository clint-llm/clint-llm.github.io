Metformin overdose induces two distinct metabolic derangements – hyperlactatemia and metabolic acidosis – primarily through inhibition of aerobic respiration.

Hyperlactatemia results from several processes. Supratherapeutic metformin levels cause inhibition of complex 1 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain leading to impaired oxidative phosphorylation.

Another consequence of inhibition of complex 1 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the reduced ability of mitochondria to recycle and intracellularly buffer hydrogen ions produced by ATP hydrolysis. These hydrogen ions are normally used in oxidative phosphorylation to create the energy gradient driving ATP production, but this process is disabled in metformin toxicity. The hydrogen ions accumulate and overcome endogenous buffering systems to produce metabolic acidosis.

The resultant metabolic acidosis can be severe and lead to a shock state with depressed hemodynamics. The acidotic state can lead to impaired myocardial contractility, decreased function of catecholamines, and subsequent multiorgan dysfunction
