Eclamptic seizures are a life-threatening emergency and can occur antepartum (53%), intrapartum (19%), or postpartum (28%). It may be preceded by central nervous system symptoms such as headache (80%) and visual changes (45%). However, seizures can occur without other severe features of preeclampsia and with a normal BP; 15% of women with eclampsia have a diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg. Eclamptic seizures are usually generalized tonic-clonic 60- to 90-second seizures. Postictal confusion, agitation, or combativeness may follow.

The diagnosis of pre-eclampsia is made during routine screening at prenatal appointments as the condition is generally asymptomatic until severe features are present. Hypertension is defined as SBP>140 or DBP>90 on two separate readings. I should screen all women with hypertension during pregnancy for proteinuria it defines which as a 24hr urine protein measurement >0.3g, a protein to creatinine ratio >0.3, or a positive urine protein dipstick of >1+. Generalized edema was once considered the third diagnostic criteria but has now been removed.

Other than early detection of preeclampsia, there are no reliable tests or symptoms for predicting the development of eclampsia.
