As mentioned previously, most patients diagnosed with infantile acne have a moderate course at best, resolving without treatment by 1 to 2 years of age. However, some cases can be severe enough to warrant the initiation of medication. If care is taken by the clinician to ensure an accurate diagnosis, initiation of the appropriate level of treatment when warranted, and active engagement and education of the parent or caregiver, even severe cases of acne can have excellent outcomes. As such, the overall prognosis for infantile acne is still considered excellent.
