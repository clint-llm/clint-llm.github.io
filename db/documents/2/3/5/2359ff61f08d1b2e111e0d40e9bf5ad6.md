Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder involving uncontrolled red blood cell production resulting in elevated red blood cell (RBC) mass. There is often a concurrent stimulation of myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages, leading to increased white blood cell and platelet production. The current understanding of pathophysiology involves increased sensitivity to growth factors due to an abnormal hematopoietic cell clone. Signs and symptoms, including headache, dizziness, claudication, thrombosis, are a consequence of increased blood viscosity.
