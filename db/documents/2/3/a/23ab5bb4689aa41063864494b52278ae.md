The main initial treatment of symptomatic esophageal webs and rings is endoscopic esophageal dilatation. The goal of treatment is relief of dysphagia and prevention of symptom recurrence. It is common for esophageal webs to rupture during a diagnostic EGD. Esophageal dilatation is still an option on esophageal webs that have partially ruptured.

The major problem with dilatation is the high recurrence rate, especially when used for the treatment of esophageal rings. Therapy with a PPI has been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence following dilatation of esophageal rings.
