**Alcohol**

Patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal may have numerous potentially life-threatening medical problems. The administration of intravenous glucose to patients with seizures is controversial because this is thought to precipitate acute Wernicke encephalopathy in chronic alcoholism unless thiamine is also administered. A benzodiazepine can be administered to control seizures. If the patient has hypoglycemia, dextrose 50% in water (D50W) 25 mL to 50 mL and Thiamine 100 mg intravenously (IV) is also indicated. Low doses of clonidine can help reverse central adrenergic discharge, relieving tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension, tremor, and craving for alcohol. In an agitated patient, neuroleptics such as haloperidol 5 mg IV or intramuscularly (IM) may be added to sedative-hypnotic agents as an adjunctive therapy. Caution must be taken because haloperidol may decrease the seizure threshold as well as prolong the QT interval.

**Opioids**

Patients with chronic opioid use disorder need a medication taper with buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist. Withdrawal symptoms should be assessed with the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). COWS is an 11-item scale used to identify withdrawal symptoms and treatment response. Opioid withdrawal is treated with a long-acting opioid agonist, such as methadone or buprenorphine. Clonidine, an alpha agonist, may also decrease the severity of symptoms. Long-acting benzodiazepines may be used to control insomnia and muscle cramps.**Sedative-Hypnotics**

Sedative-hypnotic withdrawal is treated with substituting drugs that have a long duration of action, benzodiazepine or phenobarbital for a few days, followed by a decreasing dose over 2 to 3 weeks.

**GHB**

GHB withdrawal can initially be treated with high doses of benzodiazepines; refractory cases have responded to pentobarbital, chloral hydrate, and baclofen.

**Stimulants**

Stimulant-withdrawal syndrome is treated with observation.
