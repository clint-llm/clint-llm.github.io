This syndrome is a distinct entity that is becoming more prevalent as a cause of profound bradycardia due to the compounding comorbidities of the aging population and the advent of new pharmaceuticals targeting cardiac output. The synergy between AV nodal blockade and renal failure leads to a vicious cycle of profound bradycardia and hyperkalemia. It is hypothesized that although common, it is often unrecognized and therefore misdiagnosed in the ICU.
