Erosive lichen planus (ELP) is a variant of lichen planus which involves chronic and painful ulceration of the skin and mucosal surfaces. ELP is thought to be the result of autoimmune damage of the basal cell layer, which is mediated by activated CD8 T lymphocytes. This activity describes the evaluation and management of erosive lichen planus and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of lichen planus erosive form.
- Describe the common history/physical exam findings of lichen planus erosive form.
- List the management options available for lichen planus erosive form.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance lichen planus erosive form and improve outcomes.
