Mercury toxicity can involve many organs, and initially, the diagnosis can be difficult. Thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a toxicologist, poison control, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, nephrologist, and neurologist. The key is to decontaminate the patient as soon as possible to prevent further absorption of mercury.

The outcomes of patients with mercury poisoning depend on the presence of neurological deficits, which in many cases cannot be reversed.
