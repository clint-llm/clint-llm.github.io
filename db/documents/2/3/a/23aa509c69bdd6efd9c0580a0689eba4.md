Immunogenicity remains an issue of interest when discussing biotherapeutics. Biosimilars may evoke an immune response (immunogenicity) in subjects receiving therapy like their reference products or original biologics.

Assessing the immunogenicity of biosimilars during their clinical development phases and post-marketing monitoring is essential.

Anti-drug antibodies binding to the biologic or biosimilar active site and further repressing their action are known as neutralizing antibodies.

Neutralizing or non-neutralizing anti-drug antibodies formation is frequently understood as the underlying mechanism demonstrating the decreased efficacy or treatment failure of some biologics.
