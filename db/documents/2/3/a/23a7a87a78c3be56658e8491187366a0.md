The most common CT manifestations of amyloidosis involving bony structures include osteopenia, osseous erosions, well-defined lytic lesions, and bone marrow infiltration--all of which can lead to pathologic fractures--as seen in the CT images for patients 3 and 5. Affected joints may exhibit subchondral cysts, adjacent hypertrophy of soft tissues, and osteopenia.

Soft tissues may also demonstrate fine calcification, as seen in the CT images for patient 2. The "shoulder pad" sign can be in hypertrophied shoulder musculature, secondary to myofibrillar amyloid deposition, which is more commonly seen in AL amyloidosis. A CT-guided biopsy is useful for tissue sampling of suspected osseous amyloid. Imaging surveillance of suspected amyloid deposits is also a useful strategy, as seen in the CT images for patient 1. Dual-energy CT is infrequently used to assess for crystal deposition diseases, such as monosodium urate and calcium pyrophosphate, as seen in the CT images for patient 5.
