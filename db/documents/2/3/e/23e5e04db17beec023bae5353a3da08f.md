Due to the rarity of the condition and diverse clinical presentation, primary care clinicians and pediatricians seldom make the diagnosis of endocardial fibroelastosis alone. It is only after referral to a pediatric cardiologist that a diagnosis is formed. Clinical knowledge about EFE and its differential diagnosis can help early detection and intervention lower mortality. Most of the deaths in EFE occur within the first two months of presentation. Frequent follow-up and close monitoring can improve patient outcomes. Better communication among the interprofessional team, including primary clinicians, cardiologists, and healthcare staff, is required. Since the etiology is not yet clear, no preventive measures can be suggested to the public. More studies are required to understand the underlying etiology before the prognosis can be improved.

The American Heart Association, in its latest report (2006), has removed EFE from the classification of cardiomyopathy.
