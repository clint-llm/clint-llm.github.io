Percutaneous local treatment is an attractive new tool for patients with cancer, especially for disease in the liver. There is no effective treatment currently available for the vast majority of patients with metastatic liver disease. Most primary liver tumors are unresectable at diagnosis. In such cases, local treatment preserves uninvolved liver tissue and has potentially fewer systemic complications. It has less morbidity and mortality in comparison to major liver surgery as well. However, it is not a replacement for surgery.

An interprofessional team approach is vital to the care of the oncology patient. Interventional radiologists work closely withÂ surgeons, oncologists, radiation oncologists, and other specialists with the goal of providing the best possible outcome for these patients.
