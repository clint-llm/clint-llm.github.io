In many countries, subcutaneous emicizumab has been cleared to be used in the prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in individuals diagnosed with hemophilia A, regardless of FVIII inhibitor status.

**Use in Specific Patient Population**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**No dose adjustment is necessary for mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, emicizumab has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, emicizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with emicizumab. There is a lack of data on emicizumab use in pregnant women to report a drug-associated risk of congenital disabilities and miscarriage. According to product labeling, using emicizumab in pregnancy is advised only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. Females of childbearing age should consider using contraception while receiving emicizumab.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**No data is available on the clinical use of emicizumab during breastfeeding. Emicizumab is a large protein molecule with high molecular weight; hence the concentration in milk is probably low. Hypothetically absorption of emicizumab is unlikely because it is probably destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract.
