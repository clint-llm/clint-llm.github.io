Clubfoot is a congenital deformity of the foot, otherwise known as congenital talipes equinovarus. It is one of the most common congenital malformations and is characterized across varying degrees and severity of predictable contractures manifesting with four main components: midfoot cavus, forefoot adductus, heel/hindfoot varus and hindfoot equinus. This activity educates the learner on the etiology, epidemiology, and evaluation of a patient with clubfoot. This activity will also discuss the gold standard of treatment via the Ponseti technique, as well as possible complications that can occur during treatment. It will stress the importance of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of clubfoot.
- Explain how to perform an appropriate physical evaluation of a patient with clubfoot.
- Describe the treatment of clubfoot with the Ponseti technique, and when surgical intervention may be required.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving clubfoot treatment and outcomes.
