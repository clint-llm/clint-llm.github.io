Hypersensitivity to fluorescein formulation prevents its application. Furthermore, even though more research is needed to determine side effects on a fetus, pregnancy may be considered a relative contraindication, although based on the drug's pharmacology and limited systemic absorption, no fetal harm is expected.

If the formulation includes an ester anesthetic, as is often the case, hypersensitivity to such agents is also a contraindication. Other conatrinindicaitons include sensitivity to PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid) and prolonged use.
