The standard treatment options for vertebral compression fracture consist of conservative therapies involving analgesics, external orthosis, physical therapy, and bed rest. The majority of patients can be treated with observation and a gradual return to activity. Symptoms typically resolved within 4-6 weeks. Surgical intervention is indicated for certain patients who suffer from significant pain and morbidity after this time period.

In recently published AAOS (American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeon) guidelines for osteoporotic compression fractures, they recommend strongly against the use of vertebroplasty.
