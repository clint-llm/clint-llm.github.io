The rTMS is a brain stimulation technique in which the patient is seated with a large wire coil positioned near to the scalp. It generates rapidly changing magnetic pulses that induce an electric field, having a modulatory effect on cortical excitability. It results in depolarization of the underlying region of the brain. Studies have shown the beneficial effects of rTMS for treatment-resistant depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)Â are by targetting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDPFC).

The treatment dose is reported as a percentage of the motor threshold(MT), and it is individualized for each patient. MT is defined by the visible observed movement of the abductor pollicis brevis.
