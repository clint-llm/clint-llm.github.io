Biloma prognosis varies depending on site, size, and etiology. However, uncomplicated bilomas without underlying ongoing bile leaks have a good prognosis. Small, asymptomatic bilomas with no ongoing bile leak are often treated conservatively to good effect.

In patients with symptomatic bilomas, drainage via interventional radiology is an effective strategy, and patients have a good prognosis.
