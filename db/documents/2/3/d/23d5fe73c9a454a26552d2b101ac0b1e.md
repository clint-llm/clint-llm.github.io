NAC reconstruction is driven by patient preference. Aside from the previously mentioned psychological benefits of NAC reconstruction, the recreation of the nipple and areola are aesthetic procedures.

The correct timing of NAC reconstruction is imperative for the optimal outcome and depends on the type of reconstruction as well as the need for adjuvant treatment(s). NAC reconstruction should only be undertaken after achieving a stable breast mound, typically 3 months after autologous breast reconstruction or 3 months after permanent implant placement in prosthetic-based reconstruction.
