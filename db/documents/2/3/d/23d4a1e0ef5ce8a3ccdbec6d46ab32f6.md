- Alpha agonist toxicity can be associated with severe morbidity and mortality, but with proper management, patients usually do very well. Consultation with a medical toxicologist is advised.

- Central alpha-2 agonist toxicity is associated with CNS depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and miosis.

- The pediatric population is at particular risk due to the prevalence of central alpha-2 agonist prescriptions for children and teens with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

- There is no specific antidote. Naloxone is not a proven antidote.

- Patients are very easily treated with intravenous fluids and if needed, vasopressors. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice.
