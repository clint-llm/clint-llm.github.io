Patients will often present complaining of unilateral lateral hip pain. Suspicion for trochanteric bursitis should be high in the differential if the pain onset is gradual, the patient maintains the ability to ambulate, and pain improves with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication. The patient will often be able to localize the pain focally to the area directly over the greater trochanter of the proximal femur. Younger patients may include a history of repetitive athletics, including running, cycling, or jumping sports. Middle-age and older patients may have a history of direct compression from sustained immobilization or low-energy trauma such as ground-level falls.

Physical examination is the gold standard for the diagnosis of trochanteric bursitis. It is important to rule out a hip fracture on clinical physical examination. Patients should maintain their ability to straight leg raise without pain, and a log roll (internal and external rotation of the leg at the hip joint with the hip flexed to 90 degrees) will also not elicit pain in the hip joint. Patients will have localized pain with deep palpation over the greater trochanter on the lateral aspect of the proximal femur. Pain often worsens with prolonged activity or maneuvers involving stabilization of the pelvis, such as standing on one leg.
