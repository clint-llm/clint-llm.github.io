When administered intravenously, docetaxel's possible dosing schedules have considerable variability. Administration can be a one-time single dose or as regular doses given at increments varying from once weekly to once every five weeks.

Dosing for some approved indications is as follows; these are general guidelines and institutional protocols to verify dosing, pre-medication, and toxicity-related dose adjustments.

- Breast cancer - 75 mg.m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle; give six cycles as part of a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen. 

- For locally advanced or metastatic disease monotherapy: 60 to 100 mg/m^2 on the first day of a 21-day cycle.
- For metastatic disease in combination therapy with capecitabine: 75 mg.m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (for anthracycline-resistant disease.)

- Non-small cell lung cancer (locally or advanced metastatic disease) - 75 mg.m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle; use with cisplatin in treatment-naive patients or as monotherapy for platinum-resistant disease.

- Prostatic cancer - 75 mg.m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle; give up to ten cycles with 5 mg prednisone orally twice daily.

- Off-label dosing for metastatic castration-resistant disease: 75 mg.m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle; give six cycles.

- Advanced gastric cancer - 75 mg.m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle as part of a multi-drug regimen.

- Locally advanced squamous cell head/neck cancer - 75 mg/m^2 IV for a single dose on day 1 of a 21-day cycle; give 3 or 4 cycles as part of a multi-drug chemotherapy regimen.

Renal dosing adjustment is undefined. Hepatic dose adjustments include avoiding the use of docetaxel when bilirubin is above the upper normal limit. Docetaxel use should also be avoided if AST and/or ALT are greater than 1.5 times the upper normal limit and alkaline phosphatase exceeding 2.5 times the upper normal limit.
