Patients should receive monitoring for occurrences of syncope to prevent serious secondary injury to the patient. Health care professionals should monitor patients for presyncope signs and symptoms for 15 minutes when administering 9vHPV. Additionally, standard operating procedures should be in place to avoid serious secondary injuries that could result from the collapse of the patient, such as keeping the patient in a Trendelenburg or supine position to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion. Patients should have monitoring for acute onset of signs and symptoms of anaphylactic reactions such as hypotension, tachycardia, urticaria, and respiratory compromise.
