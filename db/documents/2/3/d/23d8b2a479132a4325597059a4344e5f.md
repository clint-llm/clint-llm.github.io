The posterior thigh compartment, deep to the fascia lata, where the hamstring muscles reside, drains through lymphatic vessels to the deep inguinal lymph nodes along with the popliteal nodes, which drain some additional areas of the distal lower limb. The deep inguinal nodes continue to drain into the external iliac nodes, then to the common iliac nodes, eventually draining into the cisterna chyli/thoracic duct.
