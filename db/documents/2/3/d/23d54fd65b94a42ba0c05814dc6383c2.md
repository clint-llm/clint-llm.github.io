A progressive decrease in the accommodative capacity of the lens is the major cause of presbyopia. Various theories depicting the mechanism involved in presbyopia have been proposed. Helmholtz's theory, Schachar's Theory, and the Catenary theory of Coleman are the most discussed ones.

Helmholtz theory: As per this theory, the ciliary muscle contraction results in the relaxation of zonules and an increase in the convexity of the anterior lens capsule.

Schachar Theory: This theory, in contrast to Helmholtz's theory, says that the ciliary muscle contraction results in increased tension of equatorial zonular fibers with simultaneous relaxation of anterior and posterior zonular fibers. This concept results in the steepening of the anterior central part of the lens with flattening of the lens periphery.

Catenary theory of Coleman: As per this theory, with ciliary muscle contraction, there develops a pressure gradient from vitreous compartment to aqueous compartment, resulting in the steepening of the anterior lens capsule in the center.

Other theories include Tscherning's theory and Baikoff's theory.

To summarize, all these theories depict anterior central lens capsule steepening during accommodation.
