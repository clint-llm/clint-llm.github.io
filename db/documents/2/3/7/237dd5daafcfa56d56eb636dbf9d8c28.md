Exotropia is the most common type of strabismus reported worldwide. Intermittent exotropia is the most common subtype. Exotropia is defined as the outward deviation of either one or alternate eyes, which can be present intermittently or be persistent. The most common pattern of progression in exotropia is exophoria in the initial stages, progressing to intermittent exotropia and finally constant exotropia as the most advanced stage. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with exotropia.
