Complications of keratoconjunctivitis occur from prolonged inflammation, persistent rubbing, and also from some treatment modalities. Though rare, prolonged inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea can result in symblepharon, forniceal shortening, conjunctival scarring, limbal stem cell deficiency, corneal scarring. Prolonged and aggressive eye rubbing can result in acquired eyelid ptosis, early cataract formation, and also correlates with the development of keratoconus. Finally, the healthcare provider must be cognizant of medication side-effects. Topical corticosteroids carry a risk of increasing intraocular pressure leading to steroid-induced glaucoma, an irreversible and vision-threatening condition. Topical and systemic steroids also increase rates of early cataract formation. Topical corticosteroids can also predispose patients to ocular herpes simplex reactivation or allow significant progression of ocular herpetic or bacterial infection; thus, it is important for providers to rule-out herpetic and bacterial infections before initiating topical corticosteroid treatment.
