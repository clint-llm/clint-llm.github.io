Mucolytics divide into two subgroups:

1. Classic Mucolytics

2. Peptide Mucolytics

**Classic Mucolytics:**

Disulfide bonds are building blocks of many complex proteins, including mucus. N-acetyl L-cysteine (NAC), the prototype drug of this class, reserves a reducing ability and works by the thiol-disulfide interchange mechanism. The mucin polymers have cysteine residues throughout their structure. The disulfide bonds are anchored on these residues to yield crosslinking of the polymer. The free thiol group in the structure of NAC hydrolyzes the disulfide bonds attached to cysteine residues. This reaction disturbs the 3-D framework of mucus by reducing the S-S bond to an S-H (sulfhydryl) bond, rendering it incapable of anchoring the complex structure of the protein.

**N - Acetylcysteine**

Along with the above-mentioned mucolytic action, N-acetylcysteine also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. These agents help reduce the reactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediators that cause the insult in respiratory airways.

**Carbocysteine**

Carbocysteine also increases the volume of sputum, therefore producing an additional expectorative effect. It is very safe and effective in asthmatics as it does not irritate the respiratory tract.****

**Erdosteine and Fudosteine**

These are newer drugs that are thiol derivatives and have additional anti-oxidant and anti-tussive actions. They have a sulfhydryl group in their active metabolite, called Met-1, which acts during the respiratory burst of the neutrophils.

**Peptide Mucolytics**

In contrast to classic mucolytics, peptide mucolytics preserve the protective mucins. Peptide mucolytics target DNA polymers and F-actin links that tend to increase in purulent secretions. Therefore, peptide mucolytics, which are meant to reduce mucus viscosity by depolymerizing the DNA polymers or F-actin network that often present in purulent secretions, are very useful in conditions such as cystic fibrosis.

**Dornase Alfa**

Dornase alfa produces a mucolytic effect by depolymerizing DNA polymers. It produces a mild increase in FEV1(forced expiratory volume after 1 second) in patients with cystic fibrosis.

**Thymosin β4**

The mucolytic effect of thymosin β4 is produced through its effect on F-actin. F-actin is produced in a large quantity in purulent secretions and increases viscosity due to its filamentous nature. Thymosin may, therefore, be of value in breaking down airway pus through the depolymerization of these filaments.
