Patients on this drug are receiving treatment in an intensive care setting with concomitant intensive hemodynamic monitoring, including mean arterial pressure. Blood pressure monitoring is especially crucial since hypertension is a potential direct adverse effect of the drug. Angiotensin II has a plasma half-life of less than a minute, so with careful monitoring, hypertension can be quickly reversed.

The drug should be carefully titrated based on blood pressure response to a mean arterial pressure of 75 or greater.

Because of the potential for both arterial and venous thromboembolic events, all treated patients should receive concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Because of the effects of angiotensin II on the kidneys and other parts of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, it is prudent to monitor kidney function with BUN and serum creatinine. Serum potassium requires monitoring, as well. The potential for thrombocytopenia suggests monitoring of complete blood count (CBC), including platelet counts.
