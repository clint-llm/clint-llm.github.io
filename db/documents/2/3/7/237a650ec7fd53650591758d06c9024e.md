Being on a low iodine diet for 1to 2 weeks will be beneficial to maximize the absorption of RAI as high blood pool iodide can compete with RAI.

Desirable TSH levels could be obtained by exogenous administration of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) in patients for whom thyroid hormone cannot be withdrawn due to undesirable effects.

Renal function tests and complete blood count should be checked before therapy. As RAI is mainly excreted through the urinary system, significant renal dysfunction can cause a delay in clearance of radioactivity and exacerbate the possibility of probable bone marrow suppression.

The patient should be fasting at least 2 to 4 hours before and 1 hour after RAI administration. Informed consent should be obtained after explaining the purpose of treatment, possible side effects, the need for additional RAI treatment if required, and the need for hormone replacement therapy.

Radiation safety precautions to reduce exposure to others shall be explained, and a written directive should be signed. There should be a negative serum pregnancy test for females of the reproductive age group. Nursing mothers should completely stop breastfeeding the current infant starting six weeks before treatment. To reduce the absorbed dose to the urinary bladder, patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of water and frequently void it.
