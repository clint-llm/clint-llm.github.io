It is possible, although rare, to develop a corpus luteum cyst or hematoma. These cysts are characterized by intense endocrine activity and often produce excess progesterone.Â They can take up to three months to disappear, but they usually regress. They can enlarge and rupture, causing hemoperitoneum.
