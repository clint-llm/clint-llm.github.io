For clinically suspected melanomas, narrow margin excisional biopsy is recommended; however, it is acknowledged in the recommendations that this may be impractical on an acral site.

If the patient is shown to have the local cutaneous disease and is otherwise asymptomatic, imaging studies and other laboratory tests such as blood work are not recommended.

Radiologic assessment to detect occult nodal disease or distant metastases has a high rate of false positives. However, if imaging is obtained, a chest x-ray should be considered as a cost-effective option. Gratuitous imaging may result in unnecessary invasive procedures. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests yearly skin exam and regional lymph node palpation as sufficient to assess for recurrence.

Sentinel lymph node biopsies have high prognostic value in intermediate and thick melanomas. In patients with intermediate thickness melanomas and sentinel lymph node metastases, the melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was 62.1% when sentinel lymph node biopsy and completion lymphadenectomy were performed, but only 41.5% in the observation group who had a completion lymphadenectomy after clinical nodal metastases were identified.
