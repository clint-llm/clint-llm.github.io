The prognosis of FMF depends mainly on the frequency of the attacks and the development of complications. Generally, the attacks improve with the treatment and decrease in frequency with age. Certain genotypes such as 694V are associated with a higher risk of complications such as renal amyloidosis and more frequent attacks. Hence, they are associated with an adverse prognosis compared to other genotypes.
