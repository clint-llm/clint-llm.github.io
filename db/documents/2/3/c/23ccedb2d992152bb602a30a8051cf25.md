Laryngeal contact granuloma is a common disorder that occurs on the medial surface of the arytenoid cartilage, precisely, around the vocal process. It is currently believed to be primarily caused by gastroesophageal or laryngopharyngeal reflux, intubation injury, and vocal cord abuse or misuse. This anatomic segment is particularly prone to being irritated and then responding with the exaggerated healing that produces inflammatory granulation tissue. Hence, most granulomas occur in this location.

Anterior or posterior arytenoid dislocation subsequent to intubation is repeatedly reported in anesthetic practice. The arytenoids and cricoarytenoid joint are relatively fragile and vulnerable to injury during laryngoscopy. This can result in one of the most frequent post-anesthetic complaints, hoarseness, and also one of the most serious, airway compromise. The diagnosis of arytenoid cartilage dislocation should be considered in all cases of vocal fold hypomobility and immobility using videostroboscopy or even a CT exam to allow an early diagnosis and treatment to reestablish or improve joint mobility.

Erythema of the mucosa over the arytenoid cartilages is a common finding during laryngoscopy often related to chronic inflammatory changes, especially the laryngopharyngeal reflux. However, this finding alone tends to render the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux doubtful because it can vary based on the light source, endoscope type, and video monitor used.
