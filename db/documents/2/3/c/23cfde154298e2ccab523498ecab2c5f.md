Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for localized and locally advanced NETs. Pancreaticoduodenectomy or Whipple surgery and distal pancreatectomy are procedures typically used for pNETs greater than 2 cm, symptomatic disease, and low to intermediate grade. Whereas, surgical removal of pNETs less than 2cm in size, non-functioning, and low grade remains controversial.

When surgical removal of the tumor is not accessible due to tumor size, a debulking surgery is recommended. For midgut NETs, surgery is still the preferred management modality even in patients with small, asymptomatic tumors detected incidentally. For tumors localized in or near the ileocecal valve and small bowel tumors greater than 2 cm, right hemicolectomy and small intestinal resection are usually performed, respectively. For appendiceal tumors less than 1 cm, simple appendectomy is usually curative, but for small intestinal NETs less than 1 cm, typically small intestinal resection is required.
