Patients with chronic constipation should be educated regarding dietary habits to increase the frequency of bowel movements to prevent complications such as stercoral colitis. In patients who do not respond to lifestyle modifications alone, laxatives and other pharmacologic interventions should be considered. Patients who develop complications from chronic constipation such as fecal impaction or stercoral colitis should have regular follow up with a dietician and gastroenterologist. Studies such as colonoscopy, anorectal manometry, barium study, and colonic transit can be used to identify secondary causes of constipation. A review of home medications can also be useful to identify any pharmacologic causes of constipation.
