The median survival of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma patients is approximately five years. About 40% of patients survive for ten years or more. Typically, the cause of death is more due to advance age-associated comorbidities than WM. The International Prognostic Scoring System for WM includes five parameters, giving 1 point to each one, except for age, which receives 2 points. Parameters are: Advance age (Age >65), Hemoglobin ≤ 11.5 g/dl, Platelet count  ≤ 100 x10/L, Serum Bmicroglobulin >3 mg/L and serum monoclonal protein > 70 g/L. Score at the beginning of treatment classifies them into low risk (score ≤ 1), intermediate-risk (score 2), or high risk (score ≥ 3) with 5-year survival rates of 87,68 and 36%respectivley. Increased immunoblasts/transformed cells, deletion 6q, are considered independent adverse factors. The absence of an MYD88 L265P mutation is associated with an adverse outcome. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma may transform to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and is associated with poor survival.
