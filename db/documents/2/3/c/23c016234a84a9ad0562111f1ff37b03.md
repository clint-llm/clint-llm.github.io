Scalp vein catheterization is mostly done by pediatricians or neonatologists. However, nurses trained in NICU are required to know the procedure and its complications. During maintenance of a scalp vein catheter, it is important that the nurses should inspect the site daily and clean it with antiseptics. The child, in whom scalp vein catheterization is done, must be nursed in a Trendelenburg position. It must also be ensured that the hub of the catheter is not kept open and there is no air inside the tubing.
