Etiology is unknown, and the most common cause of the epiretinal membrane (ERM) is idiopathic (IERM). Secondary epiretinal membranes are seen in trauma, intraocular surgery, post-macular lasers, diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, chronic macular edema, chronic intraocular inflammation, retinal detachment, and intraocular tumors. Increasing age, ERM in the other eye, and posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) are other risk factors. Several other names for ERM include cellophane maculopathy, macular pucker, preretinal fibrosis, and preretinal membrane. A systemic review involving 49,000 subjects found that greater age and female gender are significant risk factors for ERM.
