The three treatment options for early pregnancy loss include expectant management, medical management, and surgical treatment. Medical management with misoprostol and surgical treatment is considered more effective in the management of anembryonic pregnancy. Ultimately the decision on considering one of these options is based on an informed conversation between a patient and the provider.

- **Expectant management**
- This constitutes the "watchful waiting" approach
- The patient is closely followed without intervention for spontaneous and complete passage of tissue
- Repeat sonograms and trending hCG levels are employed to confirm complete passage of tissue
- A reasonable determination of a downtrending hCG is sufficient

- **Medical management**

- This employs misoprostol(an analog of prostaglandin), 800 mcg, administered vaginally
- Optimal dosage is an ongoing area of research
- This management option allows for a more predictable treatment course

- **Surgical Treatment**Â 

- Surgical management employs uterine evacuation with a manual vacuum
- Frequently employed in patients with hemodynamic instability
- Uterine aspiration/evacuation is quicker to complete, especially when performed on an outpatient basis
