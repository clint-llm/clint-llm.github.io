A common contraindication to aortic valve repair surgery is a valvular apparatus that is not amenable to repair. Prior to planning on reparation, a careful evaluation of the valvular apparatus should be performed. Some of the factors that may preclude a repair procedure include excessively pliable or densely calcified, sclerotic, and stiff leaflets or valvular leaflet retraction.
