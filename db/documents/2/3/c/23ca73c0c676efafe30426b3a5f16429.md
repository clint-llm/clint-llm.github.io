The basic laparoscopic equipment is required for this operation which will include insufflation with CO2 gas, surgical drapes, monitors, laparoscopic instruments, electrocautery, and trocars. Contrary to conventional laparoscopic procedures, with bariatric patients, you will require longer trocars as well as longer laparoscopic instruments to accommodate for the thicker abdominal wall.

Also required are:

- Three 5 mm trocars and one 15 mm trocar.

- A liver retractor.

- 5 mm 30-degree angled laparoscope

- Endoscopic linear stapler

- 32-40 French bougie

- Flexible endoscope

- Laparoscopic energy device
