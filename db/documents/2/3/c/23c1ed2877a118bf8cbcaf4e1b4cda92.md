Headache is the most common physical complaint following TBI, with a prevalence ranging from 30% to 90%. Of those patients, 18% to 22% of patients reported post-traumatic headaches after 1 year. The wide range of prevalence may be because the majority of TBI cases are defined as mild TBI (mTBI), i.e., concussions, in which patients may not seek immediate medical attention. PTHAÂ appears to be more frequent in patients recovering from mTBI than those who experienced moderate to severe TBI.
