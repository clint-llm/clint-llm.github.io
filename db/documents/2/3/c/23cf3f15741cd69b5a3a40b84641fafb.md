Poly-L-lactic acid is an absorbable, semi-permanent, injectable implant that can gradually restore volume and stimulate collagen formation. It is FDA-approved for correcting facial fat loss associated with antiretroviral therapy-induced lipoatrophy in HIV patients. It is FDA-approved for use in immunocompetent people to correct nasolabial fold deficiencies and other facial wrinkles. It has been used off-label to enhance the cheeks, hands, neck, thighs, gluteal enhancement, and chest wall deformities, such as pectus excavatum or thoracic deformities secondary to surgical procedures. This activity describes the mode of action of poly-L lactic acid, including modes of administration, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, and monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of poly-L lactic acid.
- Summarize the approved and off-label indications for poly-L lactic acid.
- Outline the contraindications and adverse events associated with poly-L lactic acid.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance poly-L lactic acid and improve patient outcomes.
