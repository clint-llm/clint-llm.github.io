The superior petrosal sinus is a part of the dural venous sinus system that drains venous blood and cerebrospinal fluid circulating within the cranial cavity. The dural venous sinus system empties into the internal jugular vein and further flows into the cardiovascular circulation via the superior vena cava. Specifically, the superior petrosal sinus receives blood from the cavernous sinus and superior petrosal venous complex and drains into the transverse sinus. The superior petrosal sinuses are bilateral structures. These sinuses are between the middle and posterior cranial fossa. Because of their proximity to various critical intracranial structures, it is a significant landmark in surgical and interventional approaches to the skull.
