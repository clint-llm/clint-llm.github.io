Overdose with cisatracurium may result in neuromuscular blockade beyond the time needed for surgery and anesthesia. The primary treatment is the maintenance of sedation, a patent airway, and controlled ventilation until recovery of neuromuscular function is assured. It is important to note that there should be no attempt at reversal if there is evidence or suspicion of complete neuromuscular blockade. Once recovery from blockade begins, from the evidence of peripheral nerve stimulation, the neuromuscular blockade may be reversed with an anticholinesterase agent (e.g., neostigmine) in conjunction with an anticholinergic agent (e.g., glycopyrrolate). As in the case of other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more full the neuromuscular blockade at the point of reversal, the longer the time required for recovery of neuromuscular function. A typical dose of neostigmine is 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg, in conjunction with 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate for every 1 mg of neostigmine.
