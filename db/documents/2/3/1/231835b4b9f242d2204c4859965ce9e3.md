The most common adverse drug reactions of vericiguat include hypotension, syncope, and anemia.

Few subjects developed proteinuria, influenza, and nasopharyngitis during the drug trial, but no severe adverse event or death has been reported. Changes in vasoactive hormones for cGMP, plasma renin activity, and noradrenaline have been noted, but no changes in aldosterone activity, urine or serum electrolytes have been observed. Limited but consistent decrease in creatinine, urea, and uric acid was reported.

In contrast, one study reported no significant difference in worsening renal function between vericiguat or placebo use. Therefore, Vericiguat might be beneficial in patients with severe heart failure and does not require decreasing or stopping the dose of vericiguat in patients with a mild increase in serum creatinine or potassium levels.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Administration of omeprazole with vericiguat reduced the absorption of vericiguat. Magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide also decreased the absorption of vericiguat. Drug-drug interaction study indicates that vericiguat is a suitable drug for managing patients with heart failure with multiple comorbidities requiring polypharmacy.
