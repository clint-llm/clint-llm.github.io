Tramadol is contraindicated in patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction to any opioid. Patients under the age of twelve should not use the medication. Patients under the age of eighteen should not be given the medication if they have had a history of tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. Because tramadol can cause respiratory depression, patients with a history of severe respiratory depression, or bronchial asthma with the absence of necessary equipment, should avoid taking tramadol. Patients currently on MOAs or people who have been on MOAs in the past fourteen days should not receive tramadol. Patients on tricyclic antidepressants should also not take tramadol.

Due to the potential side effect of respiratory depression, patients should not use alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants at the same time. Concurrent use of these drugs can exacerbate respiratory depression and can lead to coma and death. Because tramadol is hepatically metabolized, concurrent use of other drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism should be avoided. Genetic variations of CYP2D6 can affect the severity of the drug. Using other drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes can also potentiate the side effects.
