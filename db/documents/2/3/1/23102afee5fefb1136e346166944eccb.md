The complication associated with acute rejection is graft failure if not treated appropriately and timely fashion. Even after the treatment, there is an association between poor graft survival after each episode of rejection.

The treatment of acute rejection, as described above, results in a severely immunocompromised state and puts the recipient at an increased risk from the side effects of the agents. There are many side effects associated with these immunosuppressive agents.

- Increased cardiovascular risk

- Development of post-transplant diabetes mellitus

- Dyslipidemia

- Various malignancies (squamous cell carcinoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease are the more common among them)

- Various opportunistic infections (viral- CMV, BK; fungal- histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, etc., and other atypical organisms)

CMV infection itself is associated with an increased risk of rejection as well. It is always a double-edged sword to manage immunosuppressive agents post-rejection episodes. The clinician has to manage wisely while weighing risks and benefits.
