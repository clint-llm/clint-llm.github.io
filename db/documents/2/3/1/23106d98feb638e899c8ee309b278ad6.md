Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) do not spontaneously resolve. Most remain stable in size, although approximately 25% of PAVMs can enlarge in size at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 mm a year.

Although correct estimates of morbidity and mortality are lacking, PAVMs are known to carry high morbidity and mortality precisely due to the development of serious complications such as stroke and brain abscess. PAVM that remain untreated is associated with a mortality of up to 50% compared to 3% in those that are treated.
