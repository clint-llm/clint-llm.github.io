Cryptosporidium is part of the coccidia group of protozoa, which also includes Isospora and Cyclospora. Coccidian parasites are characterized by the ability to reproduce asexually and sexually. However, in contrast to the other coccidian parasites, Cryptosporidium organisms infect only the brush border of the intestinal epithelium, as opposed to deeper tissue. Human infections have been reported in association with more than 15 species of cryptosporidium. The two main strains of Cryptosporidium that cause disease are Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum. Cryptosporidium parvum is identified more often in rural areas as it associated with cattle and other animals. Cryptosporidium hominis is more common in urban areas, as opped to rural ones. Other species less commonly associated with human disease include Cryptosporidium felis, Cryptosporidium meleagridis, Cryptosporidium canis, and Cryptosporidium muris.
