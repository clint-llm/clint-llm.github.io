Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is considered a debilitating, rapidly progressive disease. This condition causes visceral and cutaneous fibrosis in patients with severe renal insufficiency exposed to GBCAs. Although skin changes associated with NSF may be improved after the restoration of kidney function, especially after recovery from acute kidney injury, this condition does not usually regress spontaneously and almost always progresses relentlessly. Thus, the prognosis depends on the extent of the visceral fibrosis. It is documented that the mortality rate associated with this condition increases as the disease progresses. The high mortality rate does not come from the cutaneous lesions but rather from visceral fibrosis, particularly in the cardiac and respiratory systems.

Todd et al observed that 24-month mortality following examination was 48% in patients with skin changes and 20% in the cases where skin changes were absent.
