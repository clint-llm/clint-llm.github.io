As the lingual nerve travels from the infratemporal fossa to underneath the tongue, it can become entrapped by several structures, including fibers of the lateral pterygoid muscle, pterygospinous or pterygoalar ligaments, and the lateral pterygoid plate. Entrapment of the lingual nerve can cause numbness and loss of taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, loss of sensation from the lingual gingiva, and pain with speech disorders

Smoking can impact the somatosensory function of the lingual nerve, causing degeneration of the nerve fibers. Studies have indicated that smokers have a loss of non-noxious thermal stimuli, but not loss of sensation of mechanical or painful thermal stimuli

**Lingual Nerve Injury during Dental Procedures**

The lingual nerve can be damaged due to dental procedures, nerve blocks, or pathological tooth complications. The most common dental reason for lingual nerve injury is the extraction of mandibular wisdom teeth, followed by the administration of inferior alveolar nerve block and endodontic or periodontal complications

Several reasons are believed to play a role in the lingual nerve's high susceptibility during the IAN block, which is even higher than the inferior alveolar nerve's. The lingual nerve tends to be unifascicular and has a thick perineurium, making it less capable of supporting trauma from edema and hemorrhage

When the lingual nerve is affected during a traumatic incident, the chorda tympani (facial nerve branch) may also be damaged, and dysgeusia and xerostomia may develop
