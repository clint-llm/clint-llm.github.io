Corneal infections often start as epithelial ulceration. This is followed by stromal infiltration by polymorphonuclear (PMN) and lymphomononuclear cells, which in turn causes the destruction of Bowman's layer and then stromal necrosis. In severe cases, there can be perforation of the Descemet's membrane. Suppurative infections lead to infiltrates in the anterior two-thirds of the stroma and abscess formation. Epithelial regeneration, vascularization, edema, giant cell reaction, myofibroblatic transformation and stromal remodeling (scarring), and round cell infiltration can occur with chronic infections.
