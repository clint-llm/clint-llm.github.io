Amenorrhea is a common problem at some pointÂ in the life of most females. After ruling out pregnancy, however, determining the cause can be a challenge. Asides from the gynecologist, the disorder is best managed by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare workers that includes an endocrinologist, dietitian, internist, mental health worker, and fertility expert. The outcomes in women with amenorrhea depend on the cause. Some women with PCOS need lifelong treatment as they are at high risk for adverse cardiac events and metabolic syndrome. Patient education is vital and the patient should be encouraged to pay attention to factors that affect bone density. In addition, these women need to eat a healthy diet fortified with calcium and participate in regular exercise.
