Before 1880, ophthalmia neonatorum was the leading cause of permanent blindness in neonates, mainly caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In 1881 Dr. Crede used 2% of silver nitrate for the first time at the time of birth for ophthalmia prophylaxis. After that time, the epidemiology of this eye disease changed, and the incidence of N. gonorrhoeae as the causal agent of ophthalmia decreased from 10% to 0.3%.

In the United States, ophthalmia neonatorum caused by N. gonorrhoeae has an incidence of 0.3 per 1000 live births, while Chlamydia trachomatis represents 8.2 of 1000 cases.
