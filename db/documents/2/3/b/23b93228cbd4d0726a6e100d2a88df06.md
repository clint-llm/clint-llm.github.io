The mortality in HI is extremely high. A review of 45 cases of HI by Rajpopat et al. showed of the 45 cases, there were 25 survivors and 20 deaths with a mortality rate of 44%.Â The ages of survivors varied from 10 months to 25 years of age. The most common cause of death in the first 3 months was attributed to fulminant sepsis 75%, respiratory failure 25%, and or a combination of both. Early introduction of oral retinoids may improve survivability, 83% that were treated survived when compared to 76% who did not receive retinoids died.
