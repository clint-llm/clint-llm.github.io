The use of ultrasound in the third trimester of pregnancy serves a multitude of general and specialized purposes that include but are not limited to the determination of fetal number and presentation, assessment of growth disorders, and characterization of the placenta and amniotic fluid. Thus, the ultrasonographic applications in the third trimester of pregnancy differ from previous trimesters in both scope and objectives.

Traditionally, the third trimester is defined as the antenatal period between 28 and 42 weeks of gestation. There is currently no universal, standardized protocol for assessing the progression and status of the pregnancy during this period.

Sonographic assessments in the third trimester are not routinely performed unless the patient has had no initial sonographic examination or prior pathological or concerning conditions are identified during the first or second trimesters.

The purpose of the study serves as a guide for what is evaluated during the examination. Further detailed studies about abnormal findings are described more extensively under their respective activities.
