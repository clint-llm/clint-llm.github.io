The primary goal of general anesthesia is to render a patient unconscious and unable to feel painful stimuli while controlling autonomic reflexes. There are five main classes of anesthetic agents: intravenous (IV) anesthetics, inhalational anesthetics, IV sedatives, synthetic opioids, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. Each class has particular strengths and weaknesses, and being familiar with these characteristics, as well as crucial side effects, can prove beneficial for the surgical team. The activity reviews the principles of general anesthesia, focusing on the common medications and equipment utilized and the detection of emergencies in patients who have undergone anesthesia. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing general anesthesia, which requires working knowledge, clear communication, and participation of all operating room personnel.

**Objectives:**
- Contrast the five main classes of anesthetic agents.
- Outline relative contraindications to general anesthesia.
- Describe the equipment commonly required for general anesthesia. 
- Summarize the role of effective and clear communication among the interprofessional team in providing safe and effective anesthesia to optimize patient outcomes.
