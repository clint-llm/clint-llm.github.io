Fine-needle aspiration requires a minimal amount of equipment. If the lesion to be biopsied is superficial, it will require just a small needle, an aspiration device such as a syringe, sterile gloves, and an antiseptic swab or wipe to sterilize the biopsy site. Local anesthesia, such as lidocaine, is typically not needed during the procedure as administering the anesthetic itself may cause more pain than the small-bore needle. If the lesion is within the abdominal cavity, it may undergo fine-needle aspiration with a specialized percutaneous or laparoscopic device. Fine-needle aspiration can also be performed via an endoscope or bronchoscope, again via a specialized device. In addition to the needle and aspiration device, appropriate material to maintain sterile technique is required. If the aspiration is to be image-guided, then imaging equipment such as an ultrasound will also be necessary.
