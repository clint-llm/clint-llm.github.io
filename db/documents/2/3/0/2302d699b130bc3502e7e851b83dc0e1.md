Acute arterial occlusion is synonymous with acute limb ischemia and is considered a vascular emergency. Acute limb ischemia is a sudden loss of limb perfusion for up to 2 weeks after an inciting event. Acute arterial occlusion can occur in any peripheral artery of the upper and lower extremities. A patient with acute arterial occlusion will generally present with pain in the involved muscle group which aggravates on exertion. This phenomenon is also termed intermittent claudication when a patient feels pain in the involved limb on walking. The most typical area of arterial occlusion is the distal superficial femoral artery, resulting in claudication in the calf muscle area. Acute occlusion can lead to a limb or life-threatening ischemia. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of acute arterial occlusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of acute arterial occlusion.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with acute arterial occlusion.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for acute arterial occlusion.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by acute arterial occlusion.
