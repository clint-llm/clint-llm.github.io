Depending on the diagnosis, epinephrine administration can be in various forms. For the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine is preferably injected intramuscularly into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh due to rapid absorption. SubcutaneousÂ injection is also an option. For advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS), patients can receive epinephrine intravenously or intraosseous if needed. Another route of administration is through an endotracheal tube often used in neonatal resuscitation.
