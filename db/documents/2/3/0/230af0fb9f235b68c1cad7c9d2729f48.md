The pathophysiology of TT syndrome is not completely understood; however, it can be caused by various etiologies with different pathophysiological processes. For example, a case of bilateral TT-induced tinnitus in a patient with multiple sclerosis was suspected to be due to the demyelination of innervating nerves, leading to muscle spasms. Alternatively, the myoclonic activity may be due to medullary activity centers no longer receiving inhibitory signals by upper motor neurons. The tinnitus itself is caused by the contraction of the TT, which has been described as a clicking sound. It is possible that the muscle contraction itself, the vibration of the tympanic membrane, the opening and closing of the Eustachian tube, a combination of these mechanisms, or a different unknown mechanism is responsible for the perceived tinnitus.
