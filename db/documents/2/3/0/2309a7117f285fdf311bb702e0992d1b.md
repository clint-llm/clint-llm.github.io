Evaluation of this injury would start with a thorough patient history and physical examination. During the physical examination, the practitioner would assess the involved upper extremity; if neurological findings are present diagnostic imaging would follow. Cervical and thoracic radiographs, along with computed tomography CT or magnetic resonance MR, are all valuable tools. Conventional radiographs will at most rule out and neurological compromise secondary to hard tissue, for example, fracture impeding the nerve roots. With nontraumatic cases, conventional radiographs may also rule out any space-occupying lesions in the superior mediastinum and basal portion of the neck. CT and MR evaluation are more precise when considering a neurological insult.Â CT myelography is a more specific and sensitive evaluation. MR contributes less radiation, but it also has less sensitivity and specificity compared to CT myelography. Other tests could include a histamine injection and nerve conduction velocity (NCV). They use the histamine test to approximate the neurological injury proximal or distal to the dorsal root ganglion; if the injection of histamine causes an intense dermatomal "flare" reaction, the insult is proximal to the dorsal root ganglion. An NCV test measures how fast neurological impulses travel and can locate the injury.
