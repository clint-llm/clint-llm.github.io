La Crosse encephalitis is a viral illness that occurs from the transmission of the La Crosse virus by the Aedes triseriatus mosquito, also known as the treehole mosquito. The transmission cycle of the virus follows both vertical transmission as well as horizontal transmission. Horizontal transmission occurs between adult mosquitoes via venereal transmission as well as to small mammals such squirrels. These serve as reservoir hosts. When humans are infected, they serve as dead-end hosts as they do not develop high enough levels to infect feeding mosquitos. Vertical transmissionÂ occurs from the female adult mosquito directly to offspring mosquitos, which can then further infect other mammals and humans.
