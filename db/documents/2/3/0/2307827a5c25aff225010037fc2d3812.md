Identifying patients with gait disturbances requires a high index of suspicion. A wide range of specialties and professions contribute to the proper diagnosis of gait disturbance. Initially, the caretakers who interact daily with patients should monitor for acute changes in the patientâ€™s gait. Patients need to observe if they lose the ability to perform daily tasks, such as ambulating to the bathroom unassisted. Physicians should observe gait during a physical examination to identify any changes. Nursing staff who may be interacting with patients more directly should observe any gait changes in their patients. Medications should be reviewed by the specialists and nursing staff to ensure there are no interactions between drugs, which can cause a gait disturbance. Patients should engage in open dialogue with their caretakers, noting any specific changes in lifestyle or diet, which may help uncover the etiology for their gait disturbance.
