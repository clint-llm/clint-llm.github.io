The true incidence of AEP is not known, as much of the world literature derives from case reports and case series, which imply a very rare incidence. However, it is much more common in men. CEP is also a rare disease, forming less than 2.5% of ILD cases reported. It is more common in women, who are affected twice as much as men with the majority of them, being non-smokers. The incidence of EGPA is also not known among the ANCA-associated vasculitis; however, it is the least common.
