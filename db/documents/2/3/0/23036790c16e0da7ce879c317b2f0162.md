As discussed above, MODY is an autosomal dominant condition, and different genetic subtypes behave differently. Patient education is important in terms of teaching them that it runs in families, and thus genetic counseling becomes vital. Knowing that this condition runs in families can allow for adequate screening and implementation of treatment, if necessary, early to avoid complications. They mustÂ understand the disease and the need to follow up. Even though certain subtypes may only require dietary intervention, the disease may progress to the point of necessitating pharmacologic intervention. Certain subtypes have a higher propensity of developing complications, and therefore counseling patients on regular appropriate screenings and subspecialist follow-up is important. Women with MODY and the GCK mutation need to be made aware that they may require insulin treatment during pregnancy depending on the fetus genotype, and they should be monitored closely by a specialist during their pregnancies.
