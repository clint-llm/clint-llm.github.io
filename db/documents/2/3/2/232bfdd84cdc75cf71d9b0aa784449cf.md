Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open-angle glaucoma is three times more common than angle-closure glaucoma, although angle closure is responsible for 50% of blindness caused by glaucoma. The primary risk factors for angle-closure include older age, female gender, and Asian or Eskimoan race.
