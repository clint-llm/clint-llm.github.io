Patients are usually asymptomatic for approximately one year after infection. Skin erythema and tenderness can present at the site of the emergence of the worm. When the adult worm emerges from the skin, it can cause blistering and ulceration, edema, pruritus at the location where it comes out. The worms usually emerge atÂ the lower extremities, mainly the feet, in 80 to90% of the cases, although they can emerge from any part of the body. Sometimes more than one worm can emerge from the skin simultaneously. This painful process of emergence of the worm from the skin can last up to 8 weeks or more.

Systemic symptoms like fever, rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can develop. An abscess can occur when the worms migrate to other tissue sites like the lung, pericardium, spinal cord. When the worms pass through the joints, they can cause joint pain and contractures. Occasionally sepsis can occur due to systemic infections. Cellulitis can occur. If the worm breaks before it is wholly extruded, this can lead to severe inflammatory reactions, pain, swelling, and cellulitis. In some cases, the worm can die before it emerges from the skin, and it can become calcified and encapsulated. This causes chronic recurrent pain and swelling.
