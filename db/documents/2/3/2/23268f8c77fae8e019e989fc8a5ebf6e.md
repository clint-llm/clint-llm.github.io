A hiatal hernia is a condition in which the upper part of the stomach or other internal organ bulges through the hiatus of the diaphragm. When there is laxity in this hiatus, gastric content can back up into the esophagus and is the leading cause of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hiatal hernias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hiatal hernias. 
- Describe the appropriate evaluation procedures for assessing potential hiatal hernias.
- Outline the management options available for hiatal hernias.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hiatal hernias.
