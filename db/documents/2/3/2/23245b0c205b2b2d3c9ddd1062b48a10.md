Black piedra results from a particular fungal species calledÂ Piedraia hortae. This fungal disease results from poor personal hygiene. It is commonly seen in people having long hair and with the excessive use of different hair oils. Practices like prolonged wearing of veils or tight hats may contribute to its development and progression. There are also reports of sexual transmission. The incidence of fungal infections is on the rise due to the opportunistic nature of the fungal organisms and the prevalence of immunodeficient conditions.
