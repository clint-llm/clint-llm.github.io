Sialolithiasis is the most frequent cause of salivary gland swelling, affecting the major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The condition predominantly affects individuals of 30 to 60 years old and is more common in males. The most frequent symptom is cyclical gland swelling and pain associated with meals. Initial management is conservative, with various minimally invasive surgical options available for persistent cases. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of sialolithiasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of sialolithiasis.
- Review the evaluation of sialolithiasis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for sialolithiasis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve clinical care and outcomes for patients with sialolithiasis.
