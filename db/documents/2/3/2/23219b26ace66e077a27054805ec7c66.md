The plan for postoperative care is based upon the impact of blood loss on coagulation, acid-base balance, and hemodynamic stability. Most patients who experience uterine rupture will be previously healthy. Accordingly, blood loss is often well tolerated. Patients with ongoing blood loss, an elevated (greater than 2 mmol/L) and rising blood lactate, and vasopressor requirements should be considered for postoperative intensive care unit admission.
