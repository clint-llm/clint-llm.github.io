- CBC: lymphocytosis is seen in influenza and brucellosis, lymphopenia is seen with COVID-19, thrombocytopenia in babesiosis, Coxiella, RMSF and leptospirosis, eosinophilia in trichinellosis.

- Peripheral blood smear: maltese cross appearance is seen in babesiosis

- Kidney function tests, liver function tests

- Imaging as a chest x-ray

- CSF testing: to look for WNV, vCJD, rabies

- EEG: to look for waveform abnormalities as seen with WNV and vCJD

- Cultures (blood, sputum, tissue): to detect plague, anthrax, salmonella, and Capnocytophaga

- Serology: to detect Lyme disease, WNV, psittacosis, Bartonella.

- PCR / RT-PCR: to detect influenza, COVID-19, WNV, psittacosis

- Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-TOF): as in anthrax

- Animal autopsy: for rabies
