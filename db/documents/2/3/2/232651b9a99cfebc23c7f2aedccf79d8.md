The facial nevus is composed of multiple thin-walled vessels that resemble capillaries. The neuropathological finding is an angioma that consists of multiple capillaries and small venous channels and is usually confined to the pia mater. There is a relative lack of superficial cortical veins, and the blood is shunted to the deep venous system by the enlarged medullary veins which result in stasis and ischemic changes.
