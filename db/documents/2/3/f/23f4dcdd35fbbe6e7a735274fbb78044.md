The appendicular artery runs in the mesoappendix of the vermiform appendix. The artery runs very close to the free margin of the mesoappendix and terminates in multiple small branches that supply the appendix. When an appendectomy is performed, the inferior branch of the ileocolic artery needs to be ligated at the base of the appendix. Otherwise, postoperative bleeding can occur. Complete hemostasis must be obtained, and the mesoappendix checked for the absence of bleeding before the patient is closed.Â In a like manner, during Meckel diverticulectomies, care must be taken to ligate branches of the ileocolic artery to ensure hemostasis.
