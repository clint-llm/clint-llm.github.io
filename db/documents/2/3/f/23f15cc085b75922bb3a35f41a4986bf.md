Thrombophlebitis is an inflammatory reaction of the vein accompanied by a thrombus. Migratory thrombophlebitis or thrombophlebitis migrans is characterized by the involvementÂ of one vein group first, then improving and followed by the involvement of other vein groups. Sometimes several veins in different locations can be involved simultaneously. Superficial and deep veins both may be affected.
