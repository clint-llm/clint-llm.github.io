**Endotracheal Intubation for Laser Surgery**

Endotracheal intubation with a cuffed ETT establishes a secure, monitored, and controlled airway, allowing for positive pressure ventilation with effective delivery of respiratory gas mixture and inhalational anesthetic. However, an ideal ETT which does not ignite **and**has a design resembling conventional endotracheal tubes does not exist. The laser-resistant ETTs are commercially available and provide significantly superior protection against ignition compared to conventional PVC endotracheal tubes. These are most commonly used for laser surgery of the airway. Standard endotracheal intubation techniques apply when positioning these devices.

Typically, the smallest acceptable ETT is chosen to maximize the exposure of the surgical field. The tracheal cuff of the laser tube (or both cuffs if dual-cuffed) is filled with normal saline mixed with a biological dye (e.g., methylene blue). This will decrease the risk of ignition and serve as an indicator of cuff rupture if such occurs. The time to full inflation of the cuff may be prolonged when liquid is used as a filler, but this is rarely of clinical significance. The anesthesiologist should then minimize the delivered oxygen concentration to the smallest required concentration, avoid using nitrous oxide, and allow a few minutes for highly concentrated oxidizer gases to disperse before approving the activation of the laser.

The surgeon may request to temporarily deflate the cuff or even remove (and then re-insert) the tube under the direct laryngoscopic view to gain access to structures obscured by the ETT. The anesthesiologist should have a spare endotracheal airway device ready (typically an endotracheal tube of the same or smaller size) in case the existing ETT is damaged by the laser or other manipulation.

**Jet Ventilation**

Jet ventilation utilizes a high-pressure stream of gas delivered into the upper airway. It reduces the degree of stimulation and provides for the minimally obstructed surgical view yet yields no protection to the airway. Respiratory gas is being actively insufflated either supraglottically (via the aligned rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilator adapter positioned above the open vocal cords), transglottically (via a small-caliber transglottic catheter passed below the vocal cords), or using transtracheal approach (for patients with predicted difficult intubation or as a rescue airway utilizing a cricothyroid cannula). The last two methods help push blood and debris out of the trachea with the expiratory flow of gas. During manual jet ventilation, an injector connected to the gas supply insufflates the respiratory mixture into the trachea, but the removal of gas depends on passive exhalation and requires a patent upper airway and adequate time between jet insufflations to avoid barotrauma. The reducing valve provides the inflow pressures of 1 to 4 atmospheres.

Alveolar oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal mostly depend on diffusion to and from the bronchial tree, as there are only small changes in lung volumes during manual jet ventilation. Thus any small-diameter upper airway stenosis that impairs the inflow/outflow of gas creates a risk of air-trapping. Another modality, high-frequency jet ventilation, relies on delivering very small tidal volumes at very high respiratory rates (100 to 150 times a minute) to augment diffusion efficacy. Specialized equipment, properly trained personnel, and an intravenous anesthetic delivery technique (as compared to the inhalational route) are needed, as well as a blood gas monitoring must be established if the procedure is planned to be for an extended time, as inadequate gas exchange (hypoxemia, hypercarbia) is a common consequence. Mucosal dehydration, stomach insufflation, laser burn to the trachea (if no cuff was present to protect areas distal to laser application), pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum are other possible complications of this technique.****

**Intermittent Apnea Technique**

The patient is intubated and extubated intermittently with the airway exposed using the suspension laryngoscopy. When intubated, the patient is hyperventilating, and the ETT is removed to allow for a period of apnea and laser application. The duration of apnea is individually determined, guided by pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide values. In general, periods of apnea up to 5 min are allowed, assuming oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) levels remain reasonable (e.g., SpO2 above 90% and EtCO2 between 40 and 60 mmHg.). The addition of continuous respiratory gas delivery via a high-flow nasal cannula may further increase the apneic period.

Inhalational anesthetics cannot be delivered constantly using this method; thus, total intravenous anesthesia is preferred. This technique is more common in pediatric ENT surgery: although laser-resistant ETTs with small internal diameters are available, their outer diameter is still larger due to the presence of additional insulation layers, thus interfering with the space available in the pediatric airway. Aspiration, laryngospasm, and loss of airway are the feared, yet infrequent, complications of technique.

**Spontaneous Ventilation Technique**

The patient is anesthetized, maintaining spontaneous ventilation, and an oxygen-enriched gas is delivered through a side port of the operating laryngoscope or a catheter. Ventilation cannot be assisted. Inhalational anesthetics are best avoided since these will invariably escape into the OR environment. This technique offers unobstructed access to the larynx, but there is a moving surgical field since muscle relaxants cannot be used. It also provides no protection from pulmonary aspiration or laryngospasm nor prevents pollution of the OR environment with anesthetic gases and laser plumes.
