EMS may initially transport a diver with pulmonary decompression sickness to a hospital that does not have a hyperbaric unit capable of treating a critically ill diver. Emergency department physicians in these facilities should immediately contact a physician trained and experienced in managing diving injuries.

Care of a critically ill diver in the receiving facility requires close collaboration between the emergency medicine team, hyperbaric team, critical care team, inpatient/hospitalist team, respiratory care practitioners, and nursing staff, all operating as a cohesive interprofessional team. The diver should be recompressed as soon as possible after arrival. Post-treatment, the diver should be placed in a care unit appropriate to their condition and expected progression. Pharmacists review drug treatments and check for drug-drug interactions. Hyperbaric nurses monitor patients, provide treatment, educate patients and their families, and provide real-time updates to the team. Aggressive resuscitative and life support measures may be necessary. Hyperbaric treatment may be repeated based on the diver's response to the initial treatment and the care team's assessment of the diver's ability to tolerate additional hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
