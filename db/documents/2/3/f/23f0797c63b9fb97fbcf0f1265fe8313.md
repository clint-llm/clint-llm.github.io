While the goal of simulation-based education is better patient care, the learning experience is also important. The use of video in a debriefing did not appear to change the learner's perception of the importance of the simulation session when compared with a debriefing that had no video review.

Fear (stress/discomfort) may have been one consideration from the learner's perspective. Some learners have described the process of watching themselves in a VAD as an emotional roller coaster. They seemed to have feared the judgment by others and maybe felt defensive. Yet, at the same time, they expressed both desire and appreciation of feedback and appeared satisfied with the overall experience.

Other learners may have had a more positive experience as a result of VAD. Although Ha, et al. found a group of learners whom they classified as having a reluctant view (namely the group that felt VAD made them feel humiliated and tried), they identified two other learner groups with more positive viewpoints. These they classified as holding a strategic view, who felt VAD aided in their self-reflection, or a forward view, who felt VAD improved their self-confidence.
