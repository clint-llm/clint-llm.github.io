With the invention of penicillin by British scientist Alexander Fleming in the 1920s and the subsequent dawn of the antibiotic era, the human body defense system gained a powerful ally in fighting infectious diseases, which were once the leading cause of death globally. However, with the introduction of antibiotics came a reduction in the utilization of interventions and treatment modalities, which were previously used routinely in the management of various infectious diseases. One such intervention is tympanocentesis, which is a minor surgical procedure that involves the puncturing of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) with a small gauge needle for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.

Tympanocentesis was first described in 1768, and it has been utilized in the management of ear infections and other ear diseases ever since. Otitis media (OM) is a principal cause of visits to pediatricians and family physicians; otitis media itself refers to an inflammation within the middle ear, and the common subtypes are:

- Acute otitis media (AOM)

- Adhesive otitis media

- Otitis media with effusion

- Chronic suppurative OM

In current medical practice, tympanocentesis has been advocated for by several guidelines in the treatment of OM unresponsive to traditional antibiotic therapy and also for the treatment of other otological disorders such as:

- Retraction of the tympanic membrane

- Meniere disease

- Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL)
