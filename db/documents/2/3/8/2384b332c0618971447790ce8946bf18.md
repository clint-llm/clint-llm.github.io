The presentation depends on the mechanism, site of the lesions, and associated injuries.

History should include:

- Date and time of injury

- Duration of loss of consciousness (LOC) if present

- Seizure at the time of impact

- Any co-morbidity (if existing)

- Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents used

Initial physical examination includes primary and secondary trauma survey with the evaluation of other distracting injuries. A complete physical examination should be performed including a neurological examination. This should include documentation of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS). The involvement of cranial nerves should be assessed, and motor/sensory examination should be performed. It is important to realize that neurologic injury may be manifest distant to the site of impact. If unable to fully and formally assess cranial nerves secondary to lack of patient cooperation, it is important to, at least, document any findings relevant to the patient’s neurology.
