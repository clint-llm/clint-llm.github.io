A mastocytoma is a tumor of mast cells, which are derived from myeloid stem cells and located in connective tissues, predominantly in the skin and mucosal linings. The cytoplasmic granules of mast cells are filled with histamines, peptides and other cytokines which play an active role in immune responses, especially in allergic and anaphylactic reactions. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of mastocytoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of mastocytoma.
- Describe the presentation of mastocytoma.
- Summarize the treatment of mastocytoma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by mastocytoma.
