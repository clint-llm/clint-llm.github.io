The intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) systems are equipped with all the channels to monitor different modalities of IONM needed for the specific type of surgery. The monitoring system displays continuous trends and raw signals, as well as it can also trigger the stimulation of specific muscle and nerve (peripheral, cranial) and records the signal. The system also records waveforms' time/date, detail waveform data, and the technologist's notes. The system usually has a provision for rejection of artifacts related to electrocautery.
