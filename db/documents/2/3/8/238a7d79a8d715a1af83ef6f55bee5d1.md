Bartter syndrome is difficult to treat and has no complete cure available to date. Untreated cases are associated with significant morbidity and mortality with a major contribution from chronic kidney disease. Overall prognosis depends on the extent of receptor malfunction, and despite these facts, most patients can lead normal lives with strict compliance with their treatment plan. Early recognition and treatment in childhood can prevent growth retardation.

The Bartter-like syndrome associated with aminoglycosides can be seen for 2 to 6 weeks after termination of antibiotics. Close monitoring and prompt replacement of potassium, calcium, and magnesium are recommended.

Fortunately, there is no reported recurrence post-renal transplantation.
