Due to its prominence in the superior thoracic cavity, the innominate artery should always be taken into consideration when operating inside the thoracic cavity, especially in the superior mediastinum.  Because of the innominate artery’s typical anatomic position directly posterior to the manubrium, full exposure usually requires a median sternotomy.  When operating on or adjacent to the innominate artery, the vagus and right recurrent laryngeal nerves should be identified due to their proximity to the artery.

The innominate artery’s position directly anterior to the trachea leaves it particularly vulnerable to injury when performing a tracheostomy. This potential danger can be from direct puncture of the artery during the procedure, as well as erosion of the vessel from prolonged direct contact with the tubing leading to the formation of a tracheoesophageal fistula. The risk of this happening is much greater the lower the tracheostomy site, which is why the typical suggestion is that it be performed no lower than the third or fourth tracheal ring.

In the setting of aortic repair procedures, innominate artery cannulation is becoming an increasingly used method of maintaining cerebral perfusion over the historically more widely used method of axillary artery cannulation. There is no difference in postoperative neurologic complications, and innominate artery cannulation poses several advantages such as decreased operative time, no need for an additional incision, reduced risk of brachial plexus injury, and direct visualization of the artery during the entire procedure.
