Ixekizumab administration is subcutaneous. Storage should be at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit). The ixekizumab dosage form should not be frozen, and it requires protection from light. The patient should discard the unused portion of the dosage. The patient should remove ixekizumab from the refrigerator and let it warm to room temperature, which will take approximately 30 minutes. Next, the patient should visually inspect the ixekizumab liquid, which should be free of particles and a clear to slightly yellow color. The patient should not shake the autoinjector or prefilled syringe. Lastly, the patient should inject ixekizumab subcutaneously at the directed dose. Recommended injection sites are the thighs, upper arms, or abdomen, which the patient should rotate to prevent damage to the skin. The patient should avoid injecting sites that are affected by psoriasis, are bruised, or are damaged.

The recommended dosing is the following (all doses administered subcutaneously).

For moderate to severe plaque psoriasis:

- 160 mg once on week 0, then 80 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks

- 80 mg every four weeks thereafter

For psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis:

- 160 mg once on week 0, then 80 mg every four weeks

For non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis:
