Identification of the specific base-pair mutations within the gene can help healthcare professionals further understand the disease phenotype of the patient. The severity of each disease is dependent on a few factors, such as the function of the protein, how many amino acids are involved with the base-pair mutation, and the type of mutation. For example, a base pair substitution that leads to a silent mutation will not change any part of the amino acid sequence. On the other hand, an insertion or deletion of 1Â or 2 base pairs leads to a frameshift mutation. After the frameshift mutation translates, all codons lead to a different amino acid composition of the polypeptide chain, which normally leads to a nonfunctional protein. A mutated protein with an insertion or deletion of exactly 3 base pairs (or multiples of 3 base pairs) can have varied functionality.
