The airway should be secured in patients with signs of impending respiratory failure including drooling and voice changes. One study showed that 50% of adults with caustic ingestions required intubation.

In terms of caustic injury, current recommendations are to dilute with water, although this has limited benefit due to the damage being determined within the first few minutes of the injury. Activated charcoal and induction of emesis should not be used in these patients.

Patients with suspected evidence of mediastinitis, peritonitis, or hemodynamic instability will require emergency surgery for evaluation of the extent of the injury. If there is scant evidence of these, CECT may be performed of the neck, thorax, and abdomen to determine grades of injury.

- Grade I: Normal-appearing organs

- Grade II: Mucosa is enhanced due to edema, with soft tissue inflammatory change

- Grade III: The absence of postcontrast wall enhancement

Grade I generally indicates no endoscopy and early discharge. Grade II generally indicates non-operative treatment and endoscopy if CECT is non-diagnostic. Intravenous corticosteroids may be indicated for some Grade II burns, however, this is somewhat controversial.

The goal of emergency surgery is to remove all necrotic tissue with laparotomy being the standard approach. What is resected is determined by the extent of injured surfaces with a spectrum ranging from resection of specific spots to major procedures such as pancreaticoduodenectomy.
