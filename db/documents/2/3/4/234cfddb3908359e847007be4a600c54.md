Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a form of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP) that features a chronic, relapsing-remitting bilateral conjunctivitis. Ultimately, patients affected by this autoimmune disease will experience conjunctival cicatrization or scarring, and if unresponsive to treatment or left untreated will develop corneal opacification and permanent vision loss.
