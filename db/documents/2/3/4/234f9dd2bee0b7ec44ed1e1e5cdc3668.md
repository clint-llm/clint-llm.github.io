The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia is dependent on the etiology. This section will discuss the pathophysiology of the major causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

- Gestational thrombocytopenia: The mechanism behind gestation thrombocytopenia remains anecdotal.

- Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP): ITP is a heterogeneous disease that can either be diagnosed during pregnancy or may flare up during pregnancy.

- Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): It is an umbrella of disorders that are united by common clinical and pathological features.
- Pregnancy-related TMA occurs secondary to obstetric complications like PEC, HELLP, and AFLP.
- The non-pregnancy related TMA occurs due to absence/inhibition of ADAMTS-13 (leads to TTP) or due to a mutation in the function or expression of proteins controlling the alternative pathway C3 convertase (leads to atypical HUS).

- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC denotes an imbalance between activated procoagulant pathways and impairment of the internal anticoagulant pathways and fibrinolytic systems.
