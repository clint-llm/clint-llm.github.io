RVT is usually asymptomatic; however, patients are advised to seek medical attention immediately if they experience flank pain, blood in the urine, decrease urine output, or difficulty breathing. Patients who are known to have underlying renal disease, post-renal transplant, or prone to hypercoagulability should be particularly aware of these symptoms.
