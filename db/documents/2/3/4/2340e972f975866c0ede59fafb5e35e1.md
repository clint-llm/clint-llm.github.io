Common tests required to diagnose the condition include the following:

- Complete blood count (CBC) with differential

- Peripheral smear

- Iron indices (iron, ferritin, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation)

- Iron, vitamin B, and folate levels (included in initial workup to rule out other reversible causes of anemia)

- Thyroid function tests (rule out alternate etiology of hypoproliferative normocytic anemia)

Normocytic normochromic anemia and peripheral reticulocytopenia are observable on CBC with a peripheral smear.

Unfortunately, due to high serum ferritin levels secondary to chronic inflammation in CKD, serum iron indices are not accurately indicative of the degree of iron deficiency in dialysis patients, thus raising the standard cutoffs of iron responsiveness.

Measuring serum erythropoietin levels are discouraged in CKD. They are not usable as an indicator of a renal source of the anemia because, in kidney disease, there is 'relative erythropoietin deficiency,' that is, an inappropriate rise in erythropoietin levels for the severity of anemia.

Bone marrow may show erythroid hypoplasia, which correlates to the reports of resistance of bone marrow to erythropoietin.
