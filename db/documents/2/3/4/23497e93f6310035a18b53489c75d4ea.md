Intermittent, localized pain exacerbated at night and relieved by aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) is the most common complaint of a patient suffering from an osteoid osteoma.  Swelling is the next most common symptom and is thought to be due to the increased vascular supply to the tumor from prostaglandin release within the nidus.  Other symptoms include bone deformity, muscle atrophy, and gait disturbances.  If the tumor is intra-articular or located close to a joint, synovitis, effusion, arthritic changes, and contractures may be present.  Osteoid osteomas that affect the femur and tibia have been shown to cause a limb length discrepancy.  In a study of 4 patients, the affected limb was longer than the unaffected limb.  The authors postulated this was likely the result of increased blood supply to a lesion close to an open growth plate.
