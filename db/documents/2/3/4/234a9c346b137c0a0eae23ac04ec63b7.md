Cataract surgery has advanced from simple intracapsular surgery to phacoemulsification and femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with topical anesthesia through a 2.2 mm clear corneal incision that heals rapidly and restores vision within hours after the procedure. However, proper planning from preoperative patient evaluation by the optometrist and the ophthalmologist, followed by clinician evaluation, perioperative monitoring, and post-operative care, involves many medical and allied specialties.

Trained operating room personnel help to ensure operating room (OR) sterility. Engineers ensure the proper functioning of Femto laser machines and phacoemulsification machines. Sterilization of instrumentsÂ is taken care of by the OR staff who also ensure proper humidity and temperature in the operating room, making a cataract surgery procedure a team effort.

Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgeries performed on humans. The interprofessional collaboration makes the current cataract surgery a safe procedure ensuring the best outcomes for the patients.
