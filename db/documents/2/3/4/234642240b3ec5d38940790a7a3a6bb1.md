There is no standard definition of ankyloglossia, and multiple classifications exist. When examined, the ‘free tongue’ length in newborns should be greater than 16 mm. Measurements of less than 11 mm indicate moderate ankyloglossia and less than 7 mm indicates severe ankyloglossia. However, this measurement may not be useful in infants. The term posterior ankyloglossia is used when the frenulum is attached at the middle to the posterior aspect of the undersurface of the tongue. Taking into consideration the anatomy and function, there are many assessment tools for classification.

One of them is the Hazelbaker Assessment for Lingual Frenulum Function. This tool uses a scoring system using anatomy and function.

- Anatomy: Appearance of tongue when lifted, elasticity of frenulum, length of lingual frenulum when tongue lifted, attachment of lingual frenulum to tongue and attachment of lingual frenulum to inferior alveolar ridge

- Function: Lateralization, lift of tongue, extension of the tongue, spread, cupping of tongue, peristalsis, snap-back

It consists of 10 points for frenulum appearance and 14 points for tongue function.
