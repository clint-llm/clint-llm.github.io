Craniosynostosis is a condition where the sutures prematurely close. When the coronal suture closes prematurely, the condition is known as anterior plagiocephaly. When the lambdoidal suture closes prematurely, the condition is called posterior plagiocephaly. This term arises from the ancient Greek word “plagios,” meaning oblique or slanting. The premature closure of the sutures may occur unilaterally or bilaterally. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures may cause the skull to flatten on the affected side. This may lead to deviation of the superior orbital rim on the affected side. Radiographs of the skull may reveal the “harlequin eye deformity.”
