Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adults and as a second-line treatment for narcolepsy in adults. Children diagnosed with ADHD should be at least six years of age or older before being started on this medication. Off-label uses of methylphenidate include treatment for fatigue in patients with cancer, refractory depression in the geriatric population, apathy in Alzheimer's disease, and enhancing cognitive performance (e.g., memory). The efficacy of methylphenidate for its off-label uses varies from limited to moderate. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile/toxicity, pharmacology, monitoring, relevant interactions, and street names of methylphenidate, pertinent for interprofessional team members should they encounter a patient who requires therapy with or has potentially misused this drug.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of methylphenidate.
- Identify the approved and off-label uses of methylphenidate.
- Summarize the contraindications and adverse events associated with methylphenidate.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use methylphenidate to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
