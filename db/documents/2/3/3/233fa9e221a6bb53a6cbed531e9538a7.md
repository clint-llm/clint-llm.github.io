Seventy to eightyÂ percent of CSF production is via a network of modified ependymal cells known as the choroid plexus (CP).

As there is no appreciable barrier between the CSF and the extracellular space of the brain (ECSB), the blood-CSF barrier also serves to regulate the environment of the brain.

When compared to plasma, CSF has a higher concentration of sodium, chloride, and magnesium, but a lower concentration of potassium and calcium.
