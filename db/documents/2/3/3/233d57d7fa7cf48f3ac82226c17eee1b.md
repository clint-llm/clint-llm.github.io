**Pediatric Population**

Many studies have been conducted on both animal and human subjects to evaluate the neurotoxic effects of anesthetic medications. Animal models have demonstrated deleterious effects of anesthetics, particularly in young animals. The mechanisms of damage that have been demonstrated include neuronal apoptosis, decreased density of neuronal cells, decreased neurogenesis, and degeneration of neuronal mitochondria. A study of early anesthetic exposure on neonatal rat pups showed that repeated stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors led to the degeneration of neurons resulting in not only a loss of brain cells but also long-term impaired cognitive function.

The loss of neurons occurs through apoptosis whichÂ is triggered by all regularly used anesthetic medications, including propofol, volatile anesthetics (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane), ketamine, benzodiazepines (midazolam, diazepam), and pentobarbital. These effects have been studied in a wide variety of animal studies, including both primates (monkeys) and non-primates (rats, guinea pigs, chicks, and piglets).

Although many animal studies have demonstrated negative neural effects after early anesthetic exposure, this has not been conclusively shown to translate to humans. One retrospective study evaluated the effects of a single 20-240 minute anesthetic exposure in children younger than three years of age and found no significant differences in IQ scores, memory/learning, motor and processing speeds, attention, language, behavior, and visuospatial function when evaluated at 8-15 years of age.

Some studies had demonstrated evidence of neural cell apoptosis when nitrous oxide and isoflurane were used in combination, but no risk when either nitrous oxide or isoflurane were used as sole anesthetic agents. Other studies demonstrated that the isolated use of isoflurane alone could increase the risk of neural cell apoptosis. Overall, increased length of anesthetic exposure, use of multiple agents, and repeated doses of medications all appear to increase the risk of neural cell apoptosis. While these animal studies have shown evidence of apoptosis, it is not fully understood if this is a true marker of neurotoxicity as apoptosis is a normal physiologic process that occurs in the maturing brain as children grow.

**Elderly Population**

At the other end of the age spectrum, anesthetic agents have been found to have deleterious cognitive effects. Postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) are two separate disorders that can occur in the post-operative period. POD is an acute cognitive disturbance that occurs days to weeks after exposure to anesthesia. There are several subtypes of delirium, including hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed. Hypoactive delirium can present as unresponsiveness, slowed or sparse speech, or reduction in movements and occurs in approximately 50% of delirium cases. Hyperactive delirium occurs in approximately 25% of cases and can present as hallucinations, delusions, agitation, or restlessness. In the other 25% of cases, delirium may present as a mix of hyperactive and hypoactive symptoms.

POCD is defined as neurocognitive changes that occur weeks to months after exposure to anesthesia. As defined by The International Society of Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction (ISPOCD), the diagnosis of POCD is made in the postoperative period when deficits are noted in one or more areas of the mental state, including attention, executive function, memory, concentration, psychomotor speed, and visuospatial ability. One study performed by ISPOCD found that 25% of patients over 60 years old experienced memory dysfunction at one week after non-cardiac surgery and 10% at three months.

The exact pathophysiology responsible for the development of POD and POCD is not clearly defined. It is proposed that disturbances to oxygen and nutrient supplies, and ineffective removal of waste, may lead to neural injuries that lead to postoperative neurologic decline. Such proposed mechanisms are hyperventilation, hypotension, hypoxia, hyperglycemia, cerebral microemboli, and systemic inflammation. Hyperventilation leads to hypocapnia which in turn causes cerebral vasoconstriction decreasing cerebral blood flow (CBF).

Decreased CBF is associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebral microemboli have been found to occur after cardiopulmonary bypass, and it was thought that these microemboli might be responsible for the minor neurocognitive deficits. Several studies were conducted to evaluate cerebral microemboli as a cause of POCD, and there was no correlation found between size or number of emboli with development of neurocognitive deficits postoperatively. In severe systemic inflammatory states such as sepsis, it has been shown that the brain can be damaged as part of multi-organ failure with clinical symptoms ranging from mild cognitive deficits to coma.
