Middle ear disease, like otitis media, have various probable mechanisms; one mechanism, in particular, involves the tensor veli palatini. Because the TVP is effective in opening the nasopharyngeal orifice, it can cause Eustachian tube dysfunction via obstruction if the muscle loses its function.

Because of TVPâ€™s minor role in the palatal function, the TVP is theorized to be dysfunctional in a patient with cleft palates. A recent study found that in these patients with cleft palates, the TVP is positioned more medially, as well as have a decrease in the volume of the muscle and the length.
