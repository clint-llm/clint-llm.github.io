Solar urticaria is an enigmatic disorder that is not well understood. While the diagnosis is simple, its management is difficult. Solar urticaria usually develops in the third decade of life and becomes a chronic disease. The symptoms are managed with a range of treatments, but remission relies on a phenomenon known as "hardening" and is not achieved by all patients. This is the process where continued exposure to ultraviolet radiation decreases the likelihood of attacks. The probability of spontaneous resolution has been estimated as being 15% at 5 years and 25% at 10 years after the onset of the condition.

Overall, the prognosis for patients with severe urticaria is poor. Many patients are restricted indoors and lead a poor quality of life.
