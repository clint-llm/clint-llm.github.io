PXE is characterized by degradation and mineralization of the tissues containing elastin and/or collagen. The Bruch's membrane is hard and fragile in PXE due to calcification.

The histopathological examination in angioid streak reveals:

- Thickening and mineralization (calcification) of the Bruch's membrane

- There are crack-like well-demarcated dehiscence of the Bruch's membrane at the collagenous and elastic region of the Bruch's membrane

- AÂ fibrovascular tissue or neovascular tissue may form at the edge of the dehiscence of Bruch's membrane and grow under the retina or RPE.
