Excessive gingival display, or "gummy smile," is often caused by hyperactivity of the muscles of the upper lip, including but not limited to the levator labii superioris muscle. Correction of a gummy smile can be performed in multiple ways, depending on the severity, the case, and the amount of jaw protrusion. If the cause is hyperactivity of the upper lip muscles, myotomy and lip repositioning followed by orthodontic treatment can be an effective surgical intervention.

Trauma or surgery for cutaneous malignancy can result in soft tissue defects of the nose; a pedicled levator labii superioris alaeque nasi flap has been described for reconstruction of these defects.

Because of the critical role that the levator labii superioris muscle plays in producing a smile, increasing efforts have been made by facial reanimation surgeons to replace this muscle in addition to the zygomaticus major when attempting to rehabilitate a patient's smile. Described methods of reanimating the smile in patients with longstanding flaccid facial paralysis include the use of the sternohyoid and omohyoid muscles, the serratus anterior muscle, and the split gracilis muscle.
