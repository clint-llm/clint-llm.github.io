The bicuspid aortic valve can be sporadic or familial. Evidence supports that mode of inheritance for a familial bicuspid aortic valve is variable but it could be autosomal dominant.

The exact mechanism of the bicuspid aortic valve is still unknown. There are different theories regarding its pathogenesis. One theory suggests that abnormal blood flow across the valve during a development phase results in incomplete separation ofÂ the valve.
