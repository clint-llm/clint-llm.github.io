As the growth and development of the newborn continue, each fontanelle will close within their respective timelines by a process known as intramembranous ossification. The flat bones of the cranium are considered the membranous portion of the neurocranium that consists of mesenchyme. The mesenchyme undergoes a process in which bony needle-like projections called spicules radiate from primary ossification centers towards the periphery. As the infant continues to mature, appositional growth ensues by osteoblasts providing new layers of bone to the outer portion of the cranial bones while osteoclasts resorb the inner framework simultaneously.
