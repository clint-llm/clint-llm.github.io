Subungual melanoma presents as brown-black discolorations of the nail bed. It can present as either a streak of pigment or irregular pigmentation. The discoloration can progress to thickening, splitting, or destruction of the nail with pain and inflammation. A periungual pigmentation (Hutchinson sign) may be present and supports the clinical diagnosis of melanoma.

**Hutchinson sign and pseudo-Hutchinson sign**— The Hutchinson sign is defined as the periungual discoloration of the proximal or lateral nail folds.

The history should include episodes of trauma to consider a subungual hematoma and infection to consider pigmented fungal nail conditions.

Levit et al. described the ABCDEF guidelines that can be utilized to assess for risk of a pigmented nail lesion being a melanoma. These guidelines are:

- Age: 50 to 70 years of age and African, Japanese, Chinese, and Native American heritage

- Brown-black band greater than 3 mm with an irregular border

- Change in size and growth rate

- Digit: thumb, big toe, or index finger

- Extension of discoloration into the skin surrounding the nail (Hutchinson sign)

- Family histology of melanoma
