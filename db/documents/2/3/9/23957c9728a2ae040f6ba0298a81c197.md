The following precautions are necessary before performing a thyroid uptake scan:

- Pregnancy should be ruled out with either serum or urine pregnancy test, and the clinician should ask the patient to avoid pregnancy for six months after radioactive iodine administration.

- The patient should avoid breastfeeding after performing this test as radioactive iodine can be secreted in breast milk.

- This test should be administered by a trained professional.

- The patient should receive counseling regarding physical contact safety measures by avoiding the exposure of his/her urine, stool, saliva, vomit, blood, and body fluids as well as perspiration for 48 hours.

- Patients should also avoid public transportation and sitting close to others.

- Patients should carry documents indicating the date, provider information, and radionuclide used while traveling through port of entry within four months of the procedure.

- Patients should receive counseling on flushing twice after urinating or defecating for 24 to 48 hours after the procedure.
