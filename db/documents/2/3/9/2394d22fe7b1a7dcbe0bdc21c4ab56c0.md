All simulation programs have a mandate to keep patients and learners safe. Healthcare simulation education's primary general goal is to enhance the learner's ability to deliver safe, effective, and evidence-based medical care in a compassionate and empathic manner. Overall, medical training simulation's goal is to enhance individual competence, fulfillment, and confidence while enhancing healthcare outcomes throughout departments and healthcare systems. Effective simulation programs adhere to these basic ethical principles:

- Beneficence: Do good.

- Non-maleficence: Do no harm.

- Justice: Equitable treatment.

- Autonomy: Respect the individual right to choose.

While studies have consistently demonstrated that simulation for procedural skills acquisition is effective and allows more repetition of the skill in a safe environment, the establishment of psychological safety again, is of paramount importance. Simulation is stress-inducing, not unlike the stress some students feel during examinations.
