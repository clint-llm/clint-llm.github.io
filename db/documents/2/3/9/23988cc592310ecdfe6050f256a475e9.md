Pancreatic islet cell transplantation is performed to prevent unrecognized hypoglycemia in type I diabetics. The procedure involves placing Islet cells into the portal vein via ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance; laparoscopic placement has also been described. Indications for Islet cell transplantation include type I diabetics who have attempted to control their hypoglycemic episodes medically but continue to have hypoglycemic episodes without recognizing them. This activity reviews the evaluation and selection of patients suitable for pancreatic islet cell transplantation while also highlighting the role of the inter-professional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures of the pancreas on both the gross anatomic and histologic levels. 
- Review the current and possible future indications for islet cell transplantation. 
- Outline the steps/techniques and identify the equipment used in performing islet cell transplantation. 
- Summarize potential complications in patients receiving islet cell transplantation and review the clinical significance of these complications.
