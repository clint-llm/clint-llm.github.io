The clinician should perform a history and physical exam before conducting a comprehensive psychiatric assessment. As paraphilia is previously known as sexual perversion or sexual deviation, along with the consideration of paraphilia to be a behavior that often leads to stigmatization and legal ramifications, it is not very common for a voluntary medical evaluation sought. Therefore, special attention must be made to use open-ended questions, and avoidance of opinions and/or judgment is crucial throughout the interview or history-taking process. Furthermore, signs of abuse should be monitored. Some paraphilias either involve a personal history of sexual abuse (commonly pedophilic disorder) or involve the subjective endurance of sexual abuse (sexual masochistic disorder).
