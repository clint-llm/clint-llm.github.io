The absence of associated symptoms and a normal physical examination do not exclude a serious etiology of secondary TCH.

Although diagnostic algorithms vary slightly, emergent noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) is the recommended first step after the history and physical, primarily to assess for SAH.

Noncontrast head CT should be performed as soon as possible. Within the first 6 to 12 hours after headache onset, noncontrast head CT has a sensitivity of up to 100% for detecting SAH but decreases to 85-95% on day 2, 75% on day 3, and 50 to 60% after 5 days.

Diagnosis of SAH relies on noncontrast head CT, followed by LP if the CT findings are negative and the clinical suspicion is high. In a recent study, the diagnosis of SAH was 95% sensitive and 100% specific when the Ottawa SAH rule was used when interpreting a CT scan performed within 6 hours of headache onset.

When LP is indicated, it should be performed as soon as possible after the noncontrast head CT. However, the sensitivity of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for detecting SAH is higher if the LP is performed at least 6 hours after symptom onset.

Suppose the noncontrast head CT and CSF analyses are nondiagnostic. In that case, further imaging studies may include contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, head and neck CTA, and head and neck MR angiography.
