Perinatal morbidity and mortality are increased in infants with FGR SGA compared to those appropriate for gestational age (AGA) both in term and preterm newborns.

FGR SGA is a risk factor for death in term infants, as reported in many studies. The death rate has been shown to increase with decreasing birthweight percentiles.
