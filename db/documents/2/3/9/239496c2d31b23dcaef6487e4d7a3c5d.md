The underlying mechanism for AF is related to a complex interaction between triggers and substrate. Triggers are responsible for initiating the event (arrhythmia), and substrate will maintain that arrhythmia. Triggers arise when the action potential induces after-depolarization that is strong enough to overcome recovering repolarization.

The most common site for ectopic foci and trigger origin is the left atrial muscular sleeve extending into the pulmonary vein. Myocardial cells in this region display a shorter refractory period compared to surrounding myocardium and patients without AF. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) performed during catheter ablation for AF aims to isolate this region from the surrounding myocardium dissipating further development of AF. Occasionally, AF can be triggered by other arrhythmias such as AVRT/ Atrial flutter and even premature atrial contractions (PACs). Atrial remodeling arising from electrical, structural, and autonomic changes of the myocardium promotes both trigger and substrate. These changes lead to altered sympathovagal activity, a shorter refractory period, and increased atrial inducibility propagating AF.
