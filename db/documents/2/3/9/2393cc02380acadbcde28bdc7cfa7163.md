The frequency of ocular hypotony in the general population is not known. The risk factors of ocular hypotony include surgery, trauma, and intraocular inflammation. Therefore, the frequency of ocular hypotony has been reported in these at-risk situations. Higashide et al. reported the five-year probability of ocular hypotony in a large series (955 eyes) that had glaucoma filtering surgery with mitomycin C to be 7.7 +/- 0.9 %.

Bohm et al. reported ocular hypotony in 15.6% of juvenile uveitis patients.

A review on hypotony maculopathy put the incidence of this complication after glaucoma filtering surgery with antimetabolite use at 20%.
