Blood vessels form from the mesoderm. During development as the nerve roots that will connect into the spinal cord start to form, they carry a radicular artery along their route to the spinal cord. However, from this point, some of these arteries will grow larger to supply more than just their spinal cord level while other arteries will spontaneously regress and thus why we do not have 31 theoretical radicular arteries.

The vertebral arteries initially start as seven longitudinally connected intersegmental cervical arteries. Â The first six of these arteries eventually resorb leaving a single long anterior spinal artery which connects to the seven intersegmental cervical arteries that will ultimately become the subclavian artery, producing the normal anatomical structure of the vertebral artery.
