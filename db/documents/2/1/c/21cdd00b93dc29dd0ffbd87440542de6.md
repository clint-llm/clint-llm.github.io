A Gene-editing approach using CRISPR-associated protein 9 is under development for treating hATTR. This approach hypothesizes that target DNA can be permanently modified. Thus, silencing mutated TTR permanently may treat hATTR.

PRX-004 is being studied to treat ATTR amyloidosis. It is hypothesized to work by removing ATTR deposits from the myocardium.
