Stereotactic radiosurgery requires the involvement of both the surgical and radiation oncology teams who collaborate effectively to evaluate and treat each patient. Effective implementation of stereotactic radiosurgery involves the use of the interprofessional team, including neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, neuroradiologists, medical physicists, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, nurse specialists, and the patient.

Radiation oncology nurses are vital for patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery. These nurses need to work collaboratively with physicians and specialists to coordinate care for optimal patient outcomes. Pre-procedurally, they assess the patient and provide a point of contact and information to the patient and their family. Proper communication and education of the patient, regarding the procedure and risks involved, is of paramount importance. On the day of treatment,Â the nurse's roles include assisting the clinician with set-up, head ring placement, positioning, maintaining patient immobilization during the treatment session, patient monitoring, maintaining comfort, and discharge planning.
