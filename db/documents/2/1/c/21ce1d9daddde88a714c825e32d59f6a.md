Multiple strategies may be useful in the treatment of CCl4 toxicity.

- Endotracheal intubation should take place before the intended gastrointestinal lavage after evaluation for the risk of aspiration.

- Toxin should be eliminated by gastrointestinal lavage in the intubated patient.

- CO2-induced hyperventilation therapy may be useful to accelerate toxin removal by exhalation and maintained up to the normalization of hepatic and renal parameters.

- Central venous access should be a consideration.

- Intravenous cimetidine may be an option. It acts by inhibiting cytochrome P450, and subsequently diminishing CCl4 metabolism to other toxic metabolites.

- Intravenous glucose to downregulate cytochrome P450 to reduce CCl4 degradation is also a potential intervention.

- Electrolytes require correction according to the blood level.

- Furosemide may be used for forced diuresis to prevent renal failure.

- Clinicians may consider heparin to minimize the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

- S-adenosylmethionine administration leading to increased glutathione level, which reduces the CCl4-induced liver damage.

- After discharge, the patient should follow absolute alcohol abstinence for three months.
