The prognosis for this spectrum of diseases is overall good, provided the disease is identified efficiently, and treatment started promptly—overall survival and renal recovery track along with the degree of renal impairment on presentation.

Recurrence is rare but possible, and patients typically do well with recurrent episodes. This is most likely due to heightened clinical suspicion. Treatment in recurrent cases is identical to the initial episode.

Patients that do not recover renal function and remain dependent on renal replacement therapy may qualify for renal transplantation. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody titers should be negative for at least six months before transplantation.
