Peripheral neuropathies stem from a variety of origins, including metabolic, systemic, and toxic causes. Underlying etiologies to consider include:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Chronic alcoholism

- Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., B1, B6, B12, and vitamin E)

- Inflammatory conditions (e.g., vasculitis)

- Hypothyroidism

- Autoimmune disease (e.g., Sjogren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)

- Infections (e.g.,  Lyme disease, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C, shingles, leprosy, HIV)

- Guillain-Barre syndrome

- Toxins (heavy metals, chemicals)

- Chemotherapy agents

- Medications (antibiotics, cardiovascular medications)

- Tumors (secondary to compression or associated paraneoplastic syndromes)

- Inherited conditions (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, familial amyloidosis)

- Trauma/injury

- Multiple myeloma and its treatments

- Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)

In some cases, a direct cause may not be apparent.
