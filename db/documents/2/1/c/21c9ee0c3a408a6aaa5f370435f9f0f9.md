Chronic primary hypertension is a common and prevalent disease affecting a large percentage of the United States population. Over long periods, chronic systemic hypertension can result in structural and functional changes to the heart muscle wall. Due to chronic increases in afterload, the pressure in which the left ventricular muscle must contract against increased mean arterial pressure, and the heart muscle responds with compensatory cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The ventricular muscle wall thickens to reduce wall stress with resulting increase in the wall thickness to the chamber diameter ratio.

Normal aging processes alter heart muscle structurally and physiologically. Arteries become less compliant and stiffen over time, and in older years, this results in an increase in afterload due to greater pressure against which the heart muscle must contract. As a compensatory response, left ventricular thickness increases from cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Over time, cardiomyocytes diminish with age from apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy leading to an overall decrease in cardiomyocyte number in aged heart muscle.
