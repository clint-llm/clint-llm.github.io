Unfolded and misfolded protein aggregates formed are toxic for a variety of reasons. Studies suggest that small aggregates can impair the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and even sequester transcription factors like CREB-binding protein and TATA-binding protein.

Concerning ALS, mutant superoxide dismutase-1 forms aggregates in the ER, which leads to an increase in BiP expression and activates caspase-12, leading to neuronal cell death. This mechanism provides support of how ER stress is inducable and how it contributes to the selective motor neuronal degeneration in ALS.
