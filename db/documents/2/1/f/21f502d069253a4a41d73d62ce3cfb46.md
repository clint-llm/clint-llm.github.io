Named after Abraham Colles, who first described a distal radius fracture in 1814 at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, the Colles fracture is one of the most common fractures encountered in orthopedic practice representing 17.5 % (one-sixth) of all adult fractures presenting to the emergency department.

**Anatomy**

The distal radius bears 80% of the axial load. It has the following articulations; scaphoid ( scaphoid fossa), lunate ( lunate fossa), and distal ulna ( ulnar or sigmoid notch).

**The distal radius has three columns; radial, intermediate and ulnar columns.**

T**he radial column ( radial styloid + scaphoid fossa):**

- It has the attachment of the brachioradialis tendon, long radiolunate ligament, and radioscaphocapitate ligament, which prevents ulnar translation of the carpus.

- It works as a buttress for radial translation of the carpus and holds it to length radially for even load distribution across the scaphoid and lunate fossae.

- It acts as a load-bearingÂ strut for wrist ulnar deviation.

**The intermediate column (Lunate fossa):**is responsible for load transmission from the carpus to the forearm.

**The ulnar column ( TFCC + Distal ulna):**Stabilizes the DRUJ and forearm rotation.
