**Cobalamin, the passenger:**

Cbl is the most complex water-soluble vitamin, made by microorganisms mostly anaerobes, present only in animal products, plus negligible amounts produced by colonic flora. Therefore, strict vegetarians are at a high risk of Cbl deficiency. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of Cbl is 2.4 micrograms/day for adults.

The organometallic compound Cbl consists of cobalt (Co) atom positioned in the center of six coordination sites. Four of the coordination sites formed by corrin rings (four reduced pyrrole rings), resembling the structure of heme (iron atom in the center of porphyrin ring). The fifth site (lower ligand) forms from the alpha 5,6-dimethylbinzimidazol (DMB) covalently attached to the corrin rings through a ribo-phosphate group. In addition to a variable region (R-group) at the sixth site (upper ligand). The upper ligand is characteristic for each form of Cbl. For example, a hydroxyl group in (OH-Cbl) and cyanide in (Cyano-Cbl).

Two forms of cobalamin are biologically active in the human body. 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (Ado-Cbl) and methylcobalamin (Met-Cbl), sharing in fatty acid catabolism and methionine synthesis, respectively. Cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) is convenient for medical use based on its chemical stability and will undergo conversion reaction to be active inside the body.

**The molecular bases of Cbl-binding proteins:**

In its journey, three binding proteins transport Cbl until it reaches the final destination, haptocorrin, intrinsic factor, and transcobalamin II (TC-II). Haptocorrin encoded in the TCN1 gene located on chromosome 11 with the intrinsic factor gene (GIF).

All three Cbl-binding proteins are sharing the primary protein structure. N-terminal domain (alpha-domain) consists of alpha-helices linked by a single flexible linker to the C-terminal domain (beta domain) consists of beta-helices. The beta domain side chains composition is determinant of the specificity of ligand binding.

**Intrinsic factor structure:**

Intrinsic factor present in gastric juice is highly specific for genuine Cbl. Intrinsic factor has two binding sites, one for binding Cbl and the other for the ileal cubilin receptor. The glycoprotein organized as a 30 kDa N-terminal peptide fragment (alpha-domain) and a 20 kDa C-terminal glycopeptide fragment (beta domain), linked by a protease-sensitive linker.

**Haptocorrin structure:**

Haptocorrin glycoprotein has a molecular mass of 60 to 70 kDa attributed mainly to glycans.

Functionally, haptocorrin plays an essential rule in Cbl transport within the GI tract and through the circulation, in addition to the excretion of Cbl analogs that compete with Cbl binding sites in the enzymes.

**Trascobalamin structure:**

TC-II is a 45 kDa non-glycosylated protein
