Here are some important points about primary bone cancer:

- PBC is a rare form of malignancy derived from primitive mesenchymal cells.

- All patients presenting with unresolved bone pain should be assessed, and orthogonal plain film radiographs organized.

- MRI is the gold standard for assessment of local tumor extent.

- PBC should be managed by a multidisciplinary team in a specialist bone cancer center.

- Surgical excision remains the mainstay of treatment for PBC, with chemotherapy and radiotherapy often used as adjuncts.
