Baricitinib is generally considered safe and well-tolerated, but it can increase the risk of serious infections as it is an immunosuppressive drug. The most common infections are upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, but there is also an increased incidence of herpes zoster infections. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, pneumocystosis, candidiasis, BK virus infection, and cytomegalovirus infections have been reported.

Baricitinib is reportedly associated with bone marrow suppression and hematological abnormalities, including anemia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia, and requires regular lab monitoring. Another side effect that has typically been observed after 12 weeks of use of baricitinib is an increase in mean cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels without elevation of LDL to HDL ratio. A rise in CPK levels has also been observed in some patients.

In clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were also observed.

Among gastrointestinal side effects, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain have been commonly reported. However, serious side effects such as GI perforation are rare but have been reported in patients with prior history of diverticulitis. Transient elevation in liver enzymes has been observed with baricitinib as compared to placebo.

Baricitinib use in human pregnancy is not well studied yet.
