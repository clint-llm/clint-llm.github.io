The lumbosacral trunk consists of aÂ combination of ventral rami of the fourth and fifth lumbar nerve roots that join with S1 nerve fibers contributing to the sacral plexus. The lumbosacral trunk contributes the innervation to the muscles of the posterior thigh, lower leg, and foot via the sciatic nerve, superior gluteal nerve, inferior gluteal nerve, nerve to obturator internus and superior gemellus muscles, and the nerve to quadratus femoris and inferior gemellus muscles.
