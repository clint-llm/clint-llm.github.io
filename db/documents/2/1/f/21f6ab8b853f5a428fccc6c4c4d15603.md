Managing patients with acute spontaneous coronary artery dissection requires an interprofessional team of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, nursing staff, and ancillary staff, working collaboratively and communicating case details between various disciplines.

The patients with acute SCAD usually present with ACS in the emergency department to emergency physicians or hospitalists. An interventional cardiologist should be consulted for urgent cardiac catheterization. The cardiothoracic surgeon should be available if CABG is needed. Once admitted and stabilized, a general cardiologist follows the patient in a coronary care unit and after discharge. Psychiatrists are involved in the management of post-SCAD mental illnesses.

Pregnant patients who have a history of spontaneous coronary artery dissection should be followed by a specialized interprofessional team comprised of a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and obstetric anesthesiologist.

Nurses are essential healthcare team members as they medicate and monitor patients while in the telemetry unit and during cardiac rehabilitation sessions after discharge reporting concerns to the team. Pharmacists make sure patients receive the correct medications and assist the team by evaluating the patients for adverse side effects.

An urgent initial consult with an interventional cardiologist followed by coordinated care among different services and subspecialties is vital to improving patient outcomes.
