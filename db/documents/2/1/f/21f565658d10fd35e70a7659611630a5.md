No specific preparation is needed for the patient to have a scintimammogram. A nuclear medicine technologist will be an asset to assist in the explanation and execution of the examination. It should be ensured that the patient is capable of lying prone on a hard surface with the arms extended above the head before the procedure is started. The patient should wear a hospital gown and remove all clothing and jewelry.

Quality control should be performed according to the general guidelines issued by the Society of Nuclear Medicine for the scintillation camera.
