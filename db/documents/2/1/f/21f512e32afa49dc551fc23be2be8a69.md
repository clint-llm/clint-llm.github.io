One of the key steps in interpreting an electrocardiogram (EKG) is determining the electrical axis of the heart. Being able to determine the electrical axis can provide insight into underlying disease states and help steer the differential diagnosis towards or away from certain diagnoses. This activity describes what makes up the electrical axis, ventricular (QRS) axis classifications, various approaches to determining the electrical axis, and causes of axis deviation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical benefits of interpreting the axis on an EKG.
- Describe the issues of concern regarding the interpretation of the electrical axis on an ECG.
- Summarize the causes of electrical axis deviation.
- Review the role of an interprofessional team in improving care coordination in patients with electrical axis deviation.
