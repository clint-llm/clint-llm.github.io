- Endometritis is an inflammation and infection of the uterus.

- Postpartum endometritis is the most common postpartum infection.

- Endometritis should be suspected in any postpartum patient with fever and abdominal/pelvic pain. Purulent or foul-smelling lochia supports the diagnosis. Early identification and obstetric consultation are essential.

- Acute endometritis is considered part of PID, and usually coexists with salpingitis and/or cervicitis.

- Chronic endometritis is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, repeated implantation failure, and infertility.

- Treatment in all cases is with appropriate antibiotics.

- The severity of the disease can vary. If necessary, resuscitation, including early antibiotic administration, should be the primary focus.
