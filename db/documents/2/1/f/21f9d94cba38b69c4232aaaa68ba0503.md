Initially, extracellular ice crystals form in exposed tissue. Continued cold exposure can cause intracellular ice crystals to form. Cell membrane damage results in electrolyte imbalances. As the transmembrane osmolarity gradient increases, cell membranes can rupture, resulting in cell death. Should tissue thawing occur, a reperfusion-associated inflammatory response through proinflammatory cytokines may cause additional tissue damage. Even more dangerous, additional cycles of thaw-refreeze can cause progressively worsening tissue ischemia and subsequent thrombosis.
