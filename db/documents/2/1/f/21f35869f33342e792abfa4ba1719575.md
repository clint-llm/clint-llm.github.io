Hookworms are nematode parasites that usually get transmitted through infested soil. They usually affect the poorest individuals in tropical and subtropical areas. Two species are mainly responsible for human infections, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. They can cause chronic infection of the intestinal tract, suck their host blood, leading to iron deficiency anemia in most cases. Moreover, pulmonary manifestations might occur by the effect of larval migration. While multiple medications are available to treat hookworm infections, prevention is still vital to fight complications.
