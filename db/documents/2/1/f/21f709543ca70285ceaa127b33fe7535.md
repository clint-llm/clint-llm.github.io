Malignant mesothelioma is a system disorder that requires an interprofessional team of doctors including an oncologist, thoracic surgeon, pulmonary specialist, radiation oncologist, and pain specialist. The cancer is difficult to diagnose and all the currently available treatments have not had any major impact on life expectancy. Using National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, treatment depends upon tumor staging for the feasibility of surgical resection with Stage III-IV malignant pleural mesothelioma being considered unresectable. Ultimately less than a third of patients are candidates for definitive resection. It is recommended that mesothelioma be treated by an interprofessional team at a high volume center. These patients may benefit from palliative or hospice care as most are frail and have only months to live at the time of diagnosis. Even though surgery is done, it is associated with severe life-threatening complications. Most patients with this cancer are dead within 12 months.
