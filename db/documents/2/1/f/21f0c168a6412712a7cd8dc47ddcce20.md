The Moro reflex is a normal reaction to stimuli of an infant, and it is essential for the entire healthcare team to understand what a normal reaction looks like and when to be concerned. Often families will have questions and concerns about their developing child. While a physician can comfort and address concerns, it is often the front line nursing staff in the hospital or a clinic environment that are first available to address parental concerns and recognize concerning finding. Identifying abnormalities early can then lead to the inclusion of physical therapy, occupational therapy, neurology, and developmental specialist into the care of a child.

It is crucial to the entire interprofessional team, including the nurses, recognize that an asymmetric Moro reflex at birth can be indicative of neuronal damage or a clavicular fracture.
