The interprofessional health care team, such as physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, play an essential role in monitoring patients on hydroquinone. It is important to monitor patients to ensure that they only use the medication as prescribed for no more than 5 to 6 months to limit side effects. Nursing staff can play a significant role in monitoring the patient and evaluating compliance, as it is important to follow instructions for the medication application, its frequency, keep a watchful eye for any adverse effect, which should be clearly explained to the patient. Patients should be instructed to cease using the medication if any irritation, hypersensitivity, or allergic reaction occurs. Pharmacists can review the use and adverse events when dispensing the drug, and monitor when the patient comes in for refills, alerting the prescribing clinician regarding any concerns. The rare, yet most potentially harmful, side effect ofÂ ochronosis needs to be explained to patients using hydroquinone, and they should be instructed to discontinue this medication immediately if this occurs. A collaborative interprofessional team approach to hydroquinone therapy will guide outcomes most effectively. [Level 5]
