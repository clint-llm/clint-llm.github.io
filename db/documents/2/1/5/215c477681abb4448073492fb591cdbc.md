Only 10-15% of patients infected with HCV have a self-limited infection; in all others, the infection is progressive. About 20% will develop cirrhosis within two decades, and another 1Â to 5% will develop liver cancer within three decades. The progression of the disease is more common in heavy users of alcohol, cirrhotics, and those with a coexisting HBV infection. Individuals who have an undetectable viral load generally have a decreased risk of developing cirrhosis and death.
