Carotid artery dissection is a condition whereby the layers of the carotid artery are spontaneously separated. This potentially compromises blood flow to certain areas of the brain and can lead to a stroke. Furthermore, it can occur extracranially or intracranially and can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage or brain ischemia. It is the most common cause of strokes in younger patients, and the importance of making a timely diagnosis is paramount to minimize potential morbidity and mortality of the disease.
