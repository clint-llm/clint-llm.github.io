Anesthetic neurotoxicity affects patients at the extremes of age, including the pediatric and elderly populations. Risk factors must be identified by the healthcare team, including the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and nursing staff, to decrease exposure to anesthetic as much as possible. Risk factors that must be identified include age less than three or over 65, repeated anesthetic exposures, increased length of anesthetic exposure, baseline cognitive dysfunction, or dementia.

In the pediatric population, methods to decrease the incidence of anesthetic neurotoxicity include delaying elective surgery and using xenon or dexmedetomidine infusions to limit the exposure to anesthetic agents, which have been shown to cause anesthetic neurotoxicity.

In the elderly population, methods to prevent the development of postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) and postoperative delirium (POD) include maintaining cerebral perfusion, limiting volatile anesthetic administration by using age-adjusted MAC, and intraoperative EEG monitoring.
