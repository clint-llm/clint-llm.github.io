# Continuing Education Activity

Lymphoma of the central nervous system, both primary and secondary, represents a rare subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma refers to those cases confined to the CNS parenchyma, dura, leptomeninges, cranial nerves, and spinal cord or the intraocular compartment in immunocompetent patients. On the other hand, secondary CNS lymphoma refers to systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has disseminated to the CNS. Historically, the prognosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma has been very dismal, with overall survival of 1.5 months when untreated, and a 5-year survival rate of 30%. This activity describes the pathophysiology of CNS lymphoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of central nervous system lymphoma.
- Review the evaluation of central nervous system lymphoma.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for central nervous system lymphoma.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance central nervous system lymphoma and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS), both primary and secondary, represents a rare but highly aggressive subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

CNS lymphoma consists of 2 major subtypes:

- Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), and

- Secondary CNS involvement by systemic lymphoma.

PCNSL is a rare variant of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which involves the neuraxis including the orbit, brain, leptomeninges, and spinal cord.

# Etiology

Immunodeficiency, both primary and acquired, is a significant risk factor for lymphoma of the central nervous system.

# Epidemiology

Primary CNS lymphoma has an annual incidence of approximately 1500 cases in the United States.

# Pathophysiology

The exact pathogenesis of their neurotropism is debatable.

- Acquiring new surface markers to “home” inside the CNS, and

- Getting transformed during their intravascular transit to the CNS.

Systemic lymphoma spreads to the CNS via hematogenous dissemination.

The most commonly involved sites of primary central nervous system lymphoma are the frontal lobe and basal ganglia, with the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord less commonly affected. Up to 25% of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma develop intraocular lymphoma, and primary intraocular lymphoma ultimately disseminates to the CNS more than 80% of the time. Concurrent involvement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and orbit occur in up to 20% of cases respectively.

The hallmark gene “signatures” of PCNSL comprise:

- Germinal center B-cell

- Activated B-cell, and

- Type 3 large B-cell.****

They mirror the post-germinal center or an activated B-cell (ABC) immuno-phenotype (CD10–, BCL-6+, MUM1/IRF4+).

Several mutations in tumor suppressor and proto-oncogenes involved in B cell activation, differentiation, and apoptosis are believed to contribute to the development of primary CNS lymphoma. Somatic hypermutations in proto-oncogenes such as MYC, PAX5, Rho/TTF, and PIM1 as well as the tumor suppressor genes such as PRDM1 have been demonstrated in primary CNS lymphoma cases. NF-KB signaling is believed to play a role in disease pathogenesis. The up-regulation of activators within the NF-KB pathway such as MYD88, CADR11, and CD79 as well as suppression of NF-KB inhibitors such as TNFAIP3 have presented in individuals with primary CNS lymphoma.

**The salient phenotypical alterations**occurring in CNS lymphomas can be summarized as:

- Interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling pathways with mediators such as X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) ****

- NFκB mutations in MYD88 and CD79B.

- Programmed death ligand 1/programmed death ligand 2 locus suggests the role of immune evasion.

- Alterations in copy number and translocations in 9p24.1.

- Up-regulation of the programmed cell death 1 receptor (PD-1) ligand.

- Loss of human leukocyte (HLA) class I or II surface antigens.

- Differential expression of MUM1.

# Histopathology

About 95% of primary CNS lymphomas belong to the diffuse large B cell (DLBC) category, with low-grade B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma accounting for the rest.

Primary CNS lymphoma is a highly cellular and infiltrative tumor. Histology often displays a perivascular growth pattern called angiotropism (angiocentric patterns of lymphoid clustering).

# History and Physical

Up to 80% of patients with primary CNS lymphoma present with focal neurologic deficits and symptoms often correlate with the location of the lesion.

They present as focal mass lesions in almost 50% of cases and present predominantly with:

- Neuropsychiatric signs

- Features of raised intracranial pressure

- Seizures

- Ocular symptoms (pain, decreased visual acuity, photophobia, blurry vision, floaters), and

- Rarely with B symptoms.****

The predominant anatomical locations of involvement include:

- Cerebral hemisphere

- Thalamus/basal ganglia

- Corpus callosum

- The periventricular region, and

- Cerebellum.

Neurologic signs and symptoms develop acutely with the following patterns of cranial and extra-cranial involvements:

- Frontoparietal lobes (39%)

- Eyes (15% to 25%)

- CSF (7% to 42%) and

- Rarely the spinal cord.

# Evaluation

Most immunocompetent patients have solitary brain mass, with multiple lesions observed in 20–40% of cases.

MRI has a low sensitivity for detecting intraocular lymphoma, so a thin section protocol is required to reveal any nodular enhancing lesions on the macula or uvea.

CT is not as sensitive as MRI but usually shows iso or hyperattenuating lesions owing to hyper-cellularity and high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio.

Additionally, CNS lymphomas are usually more hypermetabolic than gliomas, resulting in increased uptake on metabolic imaging such as Positron emission tomography (PET) as well as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans. The uptake area on PET imaging is often larger than the corresponding areas on conventional imaging, which reflects the infiltration of the tumor beyond the areas depicted on MR imaging. On the other hand, infectious lesions are generally hypometabolic, corresponding to lower thallium-201 uptake on SPECT and SPET as well as lower FDG uptake on PET imaging. This aids in the differentiation of primary central nervous system lymphomas in immunocompromised individuals from infectious etiologies. In patients without systemic involvement in contrast-enhanced CT, F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET revealed systemic PCNSL in 8%.

The salient radiological characteristics of these lesions include:

- High cellularity which is observed as restricted in DWI and decreased ADC)

- Blood-brain barrier disruption in Dynamic susceptibility and contrast-enhanced images (DSC)

- High glycolytic metabolism in PET scan, and

- Absent angiogenesis is observed as normal cerebral blood volume (CBV) in DSC.

The stereotactic biopsy is the mainstay of diagnosis.

When a biopsy is not possible, a diagnosis can be supported by the:

- MRI findings

- Clinical features

- Clonal B cells expansion in CSF or vitreous fluid flow cytometry, and

- IGHV gene rearrangements in PCR.

Radiomics and liquid biopsy are emerging new modalities for diagnosis.

The International PCNSL Collaborative Group has advocated the following recommendations during diagnostic evaluation for PCNSL:

- Lymph nodes as well as testicular examination

- Contrast-enhanced MRI or computed tomography brain of the complete neuraxis

- Lumbar puncture

- Ophthalmologic examination

- Contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

- Bone marrow biopsy, and

- Testicular ultrasonography in older age groups.

# Treatment / Management

**The dictum of management**in CNS lymphoma is:

- Prolonging remission

- Reducing refractory cases

- Increasing management strategies for recurrent PCNSL.

**The management strategies**should take into consideration:

- Physiological fitness

- Performance status

- Neurocognitive function

- Previous therapy and patterns of response, and

- Patient choice.

Management strategies during remission and consolidation phases include:

- Corticosteroids

- Chemotherapy, and

- Whole brain Radiotherapy (WBRT).

The mainstay of management and the most time-critical step is to reduce the diagnostic delay.

Complete surgical resection is not amenable due to its infiltrative nature, multifocality, and microscopic seedlings protected by the intact blood-brain barrier.****

The gold standard for diagnosis is a stereotactic biopsy.

Corticosteroids can lead to marked shrinkage or even the disappearance of such tumors. D/d- sarcoidosis or multiple sclerosis. Histopathological diagnosis is hindered by corticosteroid therapy (CST).

- Neurosarcoidosis

- Multiple sclerosis

- Glioblastoma, and

- Vasculitis.

There is an odds ratio of 3.3 for inconclusive biopsy after CST and therefore CST should not be administered before surgery.

High-dose Methotrexate (HD-MTX), a folate antagonist, is the backbone of multimodal chemotherapy.

Due to its high sensitivity to radiation, patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system lymphomas have traditionally received treatment with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). While the initial responses were high, early relapse, as well as radiation-associated neurotoxicity, was common among survivors.

Currently, the mainstay of treatment for individuals with CNS lymphoma is induction chemotherapy that aims for a complete radiographic response (CR), followed by consolidative therapy. The goal of consolidative therapy is to eradicate residual disease and improve overall survival.

In one study, cytarabine was added to HD-MTX for induction, followed by WBRT for consolidation, with the overall survival at 3 years 46% compared to 32% with HD-MTX monotherapy. In another, thiotepa and rituximab were added to HD-MTX during induction followed by WBRT for consolidation and overall survival was 69% vs. 42% with HD-MTX alone. When using HD-MTX along with procarbazine, vincristine, and rituximab for induction followed by cytarabine and reduced-dose consolidative radiotherapy, the overall survival rate at 3 years was 87% in patients who achieved a complete response (CR) to induction. Also, the median overall survival was not reached at 6 years.

Myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplant are also options for consolidation. In one study, HD-MTX along with cytarabine, thiotepa, and rituximab for induction was followed by myeloablative therapy with high-dose carmustine and thiotepa with autologous stem cell transplant. The overall survival rate at 2 years was 87%. In a similar study, after an HD-MTX-based induction regimen, conditioning therapy was achieved with thiotepa, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide followed by a stem cell transplant. The overall survival rate at 2 years was 81%, and the progression-free survival rate was 79%. At 10 years, the overall survival rate in a similar study was 35%, suggesting that this might be an effective consolidative option, especially for younger patients.

Unfortunately, more than half of patients with CNS lymphoma experience a relapse, with an average survival of 2 months at that time.

For the treatment of intraocular lymphoma, one study recommended an HD-MTX and rituximab-based induction, followed by consolidation with cytarabine and etoposide. Intraocular lymphoma also responds well to binocular external beam radiation. Intravitreal rituximab and MTX remains effective option in unilateral disease. But, systemic chemotherapy is the recommendation if the disease is suspected elsewhere within the neuraxis.

Prophylaxis with HD-MTX can be considered for those patients with high-risk systemic non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma to prevent CNS dissemination. High-risk features in these patients include a high international prognostic index score and the presence of extranodal disease, particularly in the testes.

The outcome of the remission can be categorized into the:

- CR-complete response

- Cru-unconfirmed complete response

- PR-partial response

- SD-stable disease, and

- PD-progressive disease.

**Current recommendations for the Remission phase of management of PCNSL include:**

- **If the patient is physiologically fit for intensive therapy-**four cycles of MATRix (HD-MTX, cytarabine, thiotepa, rituximab) are recommended.

- **If unfit for HD-MTX**, options include:

- Regimen incorporating rituximab and an oral alkylating agent such as R-MP [rituximab, MTX, procarbazine]

- Oral chemotherapy (temozolomide)

- Whole-brain radiotherapy, and

- Corticosteroids (dexamethasone).

- Intrathecal chemotherapy is recommended for leptomeningeal disease unfit for systemic therapy.

**Consolidation therapy**is ideally commenced within 6–8 weeks of the first day of the final induction cycle.****Thiotepa/ carmustine with autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has a 3- to 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 70–81%.****High-dose thiotepa-based chemotherapy with ASCT as first-line consolidation should be considered for all eligible patients.

- Patients ineligible for HDT-ASCT, and

- Patients with residual disease after thiotepa-based ASCT.

Consolidation phase chemotherapy plus WBRT had no improvement in OS compared with chemotherapy alone during the treatment in the consolidation phase.

**Recommendations for follow-up**of the patients:

- At the completion of the therapy then every 3 months for the initial two years.

- Every 6 monthly for the next 3-5 years, and

- Then annually for a total of 10 years.

**Mandatory assessments during each follow-up**should encompass:

- Thorough medical history and clinical examination

- Cognitive evaluation

- Contrast CT/ MRI brain, and

- Ophthalmologic examination and lumbar puncture if indicated.

Relapsed PCNSL should undergo complete re-staging. Re-staging is not necessary for lesions refractory to first-line therapy.

In systemic non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, combination chemotherapy is substantially more effective than single-agent therapy.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of CNS lymphoma includes:

- High-grade gliomas

- Metastatic lesions

- Demyelinating diseases

- Granulomatous lesions, and

- Cerebral toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients, especially those with AIDs.

# Toxicity and Adverse Effect Management

Up to 5% of patients develop nephropathy related to high-dose methotrexate use. Adequate hydration, urinary alkalinization, avoidance of penicillin, and other drugs that interact with methotrexate are ways to mitigate this toxicity. Recommendations are to observe a two-day gap between iodinated contrast use for imaging and high-dose methotrexate administration. Leucovorin rescue with escalated dosing strategies, as well as the use of the enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 to facilitate methotrexate clearance via the kidneys, are also effective options.

Leuco-encephalopathy following WBRT is due to the involvement of the neural progenitor cells and is observed in up to 24% of cases and can present as subcortical dementia, gait ataxia, and incontinence.

Complications of systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma includes:

- Infectious-due to immunosuppressive agents

- Toxic-metabolic- encephalopathy

- Cerebrovascular-strokes

- Paraneoplastic- motor neuronopathy and necrotizing myelopathy, and

- Treatment-related complications-radiation myelopathy, or cognitive impairment.

# Staging

Approximately 4% to 12% of patients originally thought to have primary CNS lymphoma are found to have systemic disease. MRI spine, CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis, bone marrow biopsy, PET imaging, and testis ultrasound in select cases, can be done in the staging process.

# Prognosis

The 5-year survival rate is almost 40% in recent studies.

Two scoring systems have prognostic implications:

- **International Extra-nodal Lymphoma Study Group**(IELSG)- observed Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status higher than 1; age more than  60 years; elevated serum LDH; elevated CSF protein; and deep cortical lesions as variables prognosticating poor OS.

- **Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's**(MSKCC) prognostic score includes age and Karnofsky performance status (KPS).

- Patients less than 50 years- median survival of around 9 years

- Patients more or equal to 50 years and KPS more than 70- median survival of around 3 years.

- Patients at least 50 years old with a KPS less than 70 median- survival of around 1 year.

The positive response to the initial steroid therapy is a good survival marker (117 months vs. 5.5 months in non-responders).

BCL-6 expression confers poor survival outcomes.versus 58.5%).

WBRT alone has shown a median survival of 12 to 18 months and 5-year survival of 18% to 35%.

Primary CNS lymphomas usually show rapid and durable responses to Methotrexate. Intravenous MTX alone has shown a CR of 52% and a median overall survival of 55.4 months.

- HD-MTX re-challenge

- High-dose chemotherapy alongside ASCT, or

- WBRT.

Patients with refractory, relapsed, or progressive PCNSL have a median survival of only 4.5 months.

Microscopic tumor seedlings residing behind an intact blood-brain barrier account for poor results seen following chemotherapy regimens such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone or dexamethasone (CHOP or CHOD).

# Complications

Several neuropsychological complications, such as gait impairments, memory loss, as well as incontinence, can arise in patients treated with WBRT. These most commonly occur in individuals older than 60 years.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients require education regarding their disease process as well as potential pitfalls to avoid while undergoing therapy. Methotrexate, when given in high doses, can precipitate in renal tubules as well as cause direct tubular injury. This risk is increased in volume-depleted states as well as with acidic urine. Adequate hydration is of paramount importance. Also, certain drugs such as NSAIDs, penicillins, probenecid, phenytoin, ciprofloxacin, proton-pump inhibitors, and levetiracetam interfere with methotrexate renal clearance, and so should be avoided when possible. Ideally, WBRT should be avoided and if required, low-dose therapy is recommended.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Prompt diagnosis and treatment are pivotal.

Successful treatment of central nervous system lymphomas requires a collaborative and interprofessional team approach to enhance the patient’s quality of life before, during, and after treatment; this often includes a team of experts in various subspecialties such as:

- Medical oncologists

- Neurologists

- Neuroradiologists

- Pain management specialists

- Physical and occupational therapists

- Psychiatrists

- Neurosurgeons

- Neuropathologists

- Radiation oncologists

- Ophthalmologist

- Social workers

- Spiritual care leaders

- Oncology nurses, and

- Palliative care specialists.

In addition to those listed above, nursing and pharmacy will play crucial roles in managing CNS lymphoma. Nursing will be administering the chemotherapy, which should have input from an oncology specialist pharmacist, who will verify agent selections and verify all dosing while checking against drug-drug interactions, many of which can later therapeutic results, as has been discussed. The nurse should be alert to adverse reactions, as well as noting therapeutic efficacy, and reporting any concerns to the ordering physician. In this way, all these various disciplines can contribute to the collaborative interprofessional team approach to disease management to optimize outcomes. [Level V]

CNS lymphoma has a guarded prognosis; every treatment has significant side effects which add to the morbidity. Even in patients who do respond to treatment, relapse is common. Because of the grim prognosis, a palliative team should have involvement early in the care of these patients. Comfort care and quality of life should not be sacrificed with exhaustive tests and procedures that do not change the prognosis.
