Contraindications to a fluoroscopic exam of the Lisfranc ligament include obvious ligament disruption and/or fractures. If either is present, no further diagnostic exam is needed.

For fluoroscopic guided injections, a contraindication would be any local sign of infection such as erythema or abscess. This could lead to the spread of superficial infection to a joint. Another contraindication is any patient allergies to the steroid or local anesthetic being injected.
