Enucleation is undertaken in patients with end-stage ocular disease, often with no visual potential and in pain. ItÂ can be a life-saving procedure in intraocular malignancy and vision-sparing in cases of sympathetic ophthalmia. However, the decision to proceed to enucleation is often a difficult one to make for the patient and the healthcare team. There are many differences in techniques and implant materials, which can affect the incidence and location of any postoperative orbital and adnexal complications.
