The intercostal nerves supply the ribs by sensory and motor branches. They run between the innermost and internal intercostal muscles; inferior to the blood vessels in the costal groove. They exit the groove when they branch. Their branches are:

- Lateral cutaneous branches: these innervate the skin of the lateral thoracic wall. They pierce the external intercostal muscle and divide into anterior and posterior branches.

- Anterior cutaneous branches: provide innervation to the skin of the anterior thorax. It reaches the skin near the midline.

- Pleural sensory branches: innervate the parietal pleura.

- Peritoneal sensory branches: run in the parietal peritoneum on the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh intercostal nerves.

- The collateral branch: runs on the upper border of the rib below its corresponding number.

- Muscular branches: innervate the intercostal muscles.

- Rami communicantes: connect the intercostal nerves to a sympathetic ganglion.
