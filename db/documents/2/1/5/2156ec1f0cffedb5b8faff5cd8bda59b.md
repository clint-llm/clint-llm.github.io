Common complications after EA and TEF repair in a series of 227 cases included anastomotic leak (16%), esophageal stricture (35%), and recurrent fistulae (3%).

Esophageal dysmotility is an expected finding and can be visualized on manometry in 75% to 100% of children after primary repair.

Motility disorders and respiratory function abnormalities are common after EA and TEF repair and warrant monitoring. A systematic review of long-term outcomes in adulthood after EA repair during infancy reported the following pooled estimated prevalences

- Dysphagia: 50.3%

- GERD with esophagitis: 40.2%

- GERD without esophagitis: 56.5%

- Respiratory tract infections: 24.1%

- Asthma: 22.3%

- Wheeze: 34.7%

- Persistent cough: 14.6%

- Barrett esophagus: 6.4%

- Squamous cell esophageal cancer: 1.4%

The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in adulthood was four times that of the general population and is a recognized risk factor for esophageal cancer.
