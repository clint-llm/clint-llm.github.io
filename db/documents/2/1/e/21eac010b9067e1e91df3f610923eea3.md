To date, there has been no epidemiological study to determine the true incidence of osteitis pubis. The incidence in athletes has been reported as 0.5% to 8%, with a higher incidence in distance runners and athletes in kicking sports, in particular, male soccer players who account for 10% to 18% of injuries per year.

More recently, the relationship between femoroacetabular impingement and athletic pubalgia has been of interest. Eighty-six percent of those diagnosed with osteitis pubis undergoing operative intervention had FAI on radiographs.

Regarding urological procedures resulting in osteitis pubis, in the literature review, the Marachall-Marchetti-Kranz (MMK) urethropexy has an incidence of 2.5%. Overall it occurs in less than 1% of those undergoing urologic procedures.
