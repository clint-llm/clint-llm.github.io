The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve (from L1-L2) is given off as it lies on psoas major.Â It then runs inferiorly under the inguinal ligament, accompanying the femoral artery in the lateral compartment of the femoral sheath, before piercing it anteriorly to innervate the skin over the femoral triangle.

The femoral nerve proper (from L2-L4) travels in the muscular compartment of the retro-inguinal space, lateral to the vascular compartment lined by the femoral sheath.
