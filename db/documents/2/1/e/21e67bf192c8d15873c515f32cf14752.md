Patients must be counseled before the procedure that some complications are definitely expected, such as postoperative bruising. The following are some common complications that the patient and the team should be mindful about:

- The most common complication of liposuction is the presence of bruising and contour deformities. Patients should know that postoperative bruising is certainly expected and may take 1 to 2 weeks to resolve; however, post-procedural edema may take up to several weeks to dissipate, and thus the final shape and contour may not be evident until such swelling has resolved.

- Seroma

- Temporary weight gain

- Paresthesias

- The most disastrous but also least common complications of liposuction include fat emboli (present with shortness of breath and dyspnea), DVT (pain in the calf area and swelling of the legs), and pulmonary embolism (signs of dyspnea and tachycardia).

- Emergent medical care for these conditions is of tantamount importance because a fatal result may be the outcome.

- Lidocaine toxicity: It has been demonstrated in the literature that when used in wetting solutions, the inclusion of the local anesthetic of lidocaine can safely be used above commonly recommended doses approaching 35 mg/kg.
- The management of local anesthetic toxicity includes cessation of local anesthetic, and administration of oxygenation, medication to prevent and/or control seizures (e.g., benzodiazepines), and 20% lipid emulsion infusion starting with a 100 mL bolus over 2 to 3 minutes and then 200 to 250 mL infused over the next 15 to 20 minutes.
