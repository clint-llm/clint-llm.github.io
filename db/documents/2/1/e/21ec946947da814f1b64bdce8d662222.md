**GnRH secretion and pulsatility:**

The secretion of GnRH into hypophyseal blood occurs in two modes:

- Surge mode: refers to the high frequency or continuous release of GnRH in the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.

- Pulsatile mode: refers to the release of GnRH after regular intervals and occurs both in males and females, but the frequency of release is different in men and women. In women, the frequency of GnRH release changes throughout the menstrual cycle. One pulse every 1 to 2 hours in the follicular phase, continuous in the preovulatory phase, and then decreasing to 1 pulse every 4 hours in the secretory phase.

The actual location and source of GnRH pulsatile release are not entirely understood. Episodic multi-unit electrical activity in the medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) is correlated with LH release, suggesting that ‘GnRH pulse generator’ is anatomically located in the MBH or closely linked to it neuro hormonally. GnRH neurons themselves show intrinsic neuronal activity. Physiologically, the pulsatile release of GnRH depends upon a complex interaction between Glutaminergic neurons, GnRH neurons, and KNDy neurons.

**Regulation of GnRH release:**

GnRH neurons respond to sex steroids, glucocorticoids, inflammation, stress, Drugs, body metabolism, and nutrition modulating their release in response to these stimuli. GnRH neurons do not directly respond to these stimuli. Instead, another set of neurons called KNDy neurons acting as a bridge between GnRH neurons and environmental and Internal stimuli are mainly responsible for this communication and thus regulation of GnRH release. The discovery of KNDy neurons has led to a new understanding of GnRH release regulation.

**KNDy Neuronal System:**

KNDy neuron is a combination of neurons secreting kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. These neurons are afferent to GnRH neurons and act as a bridge between various modulators of GnRH release and GnRH neurons. Input fed by KNDy neurons to GnRH neurons is physiologically essential for the adequate functioning of GnRH neurons.

- **Kisspeptin:**is a polypeptide (145 amino acids) that binds to G-protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54). Approximately 50 to 75% of GnRH neurons express the kisspeptin receptor. Neurons that secrete kisspeptin are in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) nuclei of the hypothalamus. AVPV neurons are more abundant than arcuate kisspeptin neurons. However, the arcuate neurons are closer in proximity to the GnRH neurons located in the median eminence. Kisspeptin acts at the level of the hypothalamus, which stimulates GnRH secretion. In recent studies, it is also shown that kisspeptin can also bind to Pituitary cells to cause an increase in LH release.

Kisspeptin neurons also have receptors for sex steroids and thus modulate GnRH release from the hypothalamus. A very interesting phenomenon shown by kisspeptin neurons is sexual dimorphism, Expression of KISS-1 gene is under the control of both estrogen and androgens.  A male’s arcuate nuclei contain more kisspeptin neurons and are under the influence of androgens, while a female’s AVPV has more kisspeptin neurons and is mainly under the influence of estrogen. It is the reason mainly responsible for the inability of estrogen to cause a GnRH surge in males.

- **Neurokinin B:**Neurokinin B belongs to the tachykinin family of peptides and stimulates TACR3 receptors, neurokinin stimulates kisspeptin neurons and further leading to GnRH release. This neurotransmitter is also physiologically important as some patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have shown missense mutation involving TAC3 (gene encoding neurokinin B) and TACR3 (Gene encoding neurokinin B receptor).

- **Dynorphin**: Opioids are involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as they inhibit kisspeptin neurons and thus modulate GnRH release.

All three neurons communicate via neuron-neuron and neuron-glia gap junctions to modulate the release of GnRH release. Kisspeptin neurons have receptors for neurokinin (stimulatory) and dynorphin (inhibitory). While kisspeptin receptors are located on GnRH neurons, stimulation of these receptors results in the release of GnRH. However, continuous stimulation of GnRH neurons by kisspeptin results in desensitization and down-regulation of kisspeptin receptors.
