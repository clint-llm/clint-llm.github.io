As accommodation is lost due to cycloplegia, the patient will complain of blurred vision, photophobia, and difficulty focusing near objects. The patient must rest for at least 3Â to 6 hours until accommodation reverses. This will hamper the routine activities of the patient. Sometimes the cycloplegic refraction of the patient doesn't match with that of subjective refraction or non-cycloplegic refraction. Hence, post mydriatic test should be done in these cases****before the final spectacle prescription.
