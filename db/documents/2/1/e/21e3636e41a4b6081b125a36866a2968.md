The therapeutic index for each class of cholinesterase inhibitors varies. Physostigmine has a short half-life with a small therapeutic index and is known to cause adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhea; it is not currently recommended to treat dementia. Donepezil, which can also be used in Alzheimer disease, is well absorbed and relatively tolerated but produces adverse effects at higher dosages.  The oral capsule form of rivastigmine was known to cause gastrointestinal upset. However, research led to developing a transdermal version, which was proven well-tolerated in many studies. Donepezil and rivastigmine are FDA approved and associated with fewer adverse effects than older generations of cholinesterase inhibitors. The efficacy and adverse effects of newer generations of cholinesterase inhibitors such as metrifonate are currently under investigation. Blood can be drawn to measure RBC cholinesterase activity if there is difficulty confirming the diagnosis.
