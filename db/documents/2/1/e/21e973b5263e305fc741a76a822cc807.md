High altitude oxygenation is improving oxygenation or enriching the body with additional oxygen at high altitudes.

According to the Society of Mountain Medicine (Effects of high altitude on humans), there are three altitude regions:

- High altitude = 1500 to 3500 meters above sea level (4900-11500 ft.)

- Very high altitude = 3500 to 5500 meters above sea level (11500 to 18000 ft.)

- Extreme altitude = above 5500 meters above sea level (18000 ft.)

Mount Everest, the highest mountain on earth, is at 29029 feet above sea level. It is in the extreme altitude region. These three altitude regions correspond with different levels of low oxygen in the atmosphere. At Mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure is around 228 mmHg, but the percent of fraction of inspired oxygen is the same as sea level, where the atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg.
