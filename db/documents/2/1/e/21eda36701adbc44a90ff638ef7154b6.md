The accessory nerve injury most likely occurs due to iatrogenic causes, such as posterior and lateral cervical triangle surgeries. The high likelihood of SAN injury with posterior and lateral neck surgeries led to exploring the various options with neck dissections such as radical, selective, and modified neck dissections in different studies.

Iatrogenic SAN injury is most commonly seen following lymph node biopsies for diagnostic purposes in the posterior cervical triangle. These procedures reportedly result in 3 to 8% injury rates. Severe dysfunction of the upper extremity has been observed in up to 60-80% of radical neck dissections.

Clinical evidence of accessory nerve injury has been observed to be 30% in selective neck dissections where cervical zones 2 through 4 and 5 were included. If zones 2 through 4 are dissected, and zone 5 is spared, this incidence decreases significantly.
