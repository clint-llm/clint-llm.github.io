Anterior elbow dislocations, like all elbow dislocations, occur after a traumatic event. Patients will typically have a history of some mechanism, causing them to fall onto their outstretched arm or more severe trauma to the arm like a motor vehicle accident. Patients will complain of severe pain to the injured extremity and will be unable to move the injured elbow. Also, patients may complain of a noticeable deformity of the affected elbow depending on body habitus and the nature of the dislocation.

While obtaining the history, it is important to ask the patient if they have previously dislocated or had any history of injury to the dislocated elbow. The provider should also ask the patient if they are having any new onset of numbness, tingling, or weakness in the injured extremity as damage to neurovascular structures can be associated with anterior elbow dislocations. Neurovascular compromise can affect the urgency of reduction and operative fixation. Another important aspect before moving on to the physical evaluation is to ask if the patient has had any head trauma, loss of consciousness, or have any other areas of pain as this will influence what further workup will need to be done. Finally, each patient should be asked to provide their complete medical history, congenital deformities, and medications that can affect their diagnosis and treatment moving forward.
