The deep peroneal (fibular) nerve supplies the muscles on the dorsum of the foot and gives off a lateral branch and two dorsal digital nerves. The lateral branch aids in supplying the intertarsal joints and two dorsal digital nerves supply the great and the second toe. Autonomic innervation by postganglionic sympathetic nerves travels along the peripheral nerves and supplies the vascular smooth muscle of the foot. These nerve fibers cause vasoconstriction while hormones and local mediators regulate vasodilation.
