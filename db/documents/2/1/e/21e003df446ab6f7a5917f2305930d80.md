There is no well-known cause of cherry angiomas. Some of the associations and possible etiologies of these lesions are as follows.

- Aging: Since these lesions are seen mostly in old age, the aging process can be a cause of their development.

- Genetic mutation: Some studies have seen somatic missense mutations in GNAQ (Q209H, Q209R, R183G) and GNA11 (Q209H) genes in these lesions.

- Pregnancy

Eruptive cherry angiomas: This term indicates the sudden development of multiple and extensive cherry angiomas. They may be seen in the following conditions:

- A side effect of topical nitrogen mustard used for the treatment of vitiligo

- A side effect of cyclosporine

- Chronic graft-host disease

- Lymphoproliferative diseases and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD): The possible mechanism is hypersecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor in response to elevated interleukin 6 levels. Therefore, it is suggested that if the patient presents with sudden multiple cherry angiomas along with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy, the patient should be evaluated for multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) and other lymphoproliferative disorders.

- A side effect of ramucirumab: The underlying mechanism for this is ramucirumab-induced somatic activating VEGFR2 mutation.

- Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV8): It is frequently found in eruptive cherry hemangiomas (52.9%)
