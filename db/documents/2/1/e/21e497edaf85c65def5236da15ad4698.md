Neurological insults, such as cerebral palsy and post-cerebrovascular accident (CVA), damage the nervous system's sensorimotor integration, manifested with the reemergence and disinhibition of primitive stereotyped reflexes. In one study, the presence and the seemingly exaggerated response of ATNR due to the relative dominance of the primitive reflexes with loss of higher-level reactions in spastic hemiplegic patients were investigated and compared with neurologically intact adults. ATNR is elicited through several voluntary resisted active rotation of the head. These primitive reflexes serve as an indicator of the reversal of the central nervous system's motor control. Also, the antagonistic actions between tonic labyrinthine reflex and ATNRÂ still manifest in these patients.

The persistence of primitive reflexes, such as tonic neck reflexes and spinal Galant reflex, is also studied in the development of muscle tone asymmetry, faulty posture, and spinal deformities. This process occurs by measuring the angle of trunk rotation (ATR) to evaluate scoliosis and prevent its progression. This angle is an early objective assessment of trunk rotation, which appears to be influenced by ATNR, in the growing spine of children.
