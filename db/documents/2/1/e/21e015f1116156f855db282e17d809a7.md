The usual dose of thallium-201 used for SPECT scans is small; thus, it is safe for use.

Different studies have shown that the mother can pump breast milk before the procedure and freeze it for storage. After the scan, she can pump the breast milk and either throw it away or freeze it for about 30 days before use. Another option is to measure the radioactivity level of breast milk before commencing breastfeeding again to ensure safety.
