The latissimus dorsi muscle is supplied predominantly by the thoracodorsal artery, a continuation of the subscapular artery, which is a branch of the third part of the axillary artery. The thoracodorsal artery and its venae comitantes enter the muscle at a single point on the anterior surface of the muscle, 6 cm to 12 cm from the bifurcation of the subscapular artery and 1 cm to 4 cm medial to the lateral margin of the muscle. In addition to the thoracodorsal artery, the latissimus dorsi also receives blood supply from the dorsal perforating branches of the inferior three posterior intercostal arteries and the superior three lumbar arteries.

The lymphatic drainage of this muscle follows the typical pattern of lymphatic drainage with superficial and deep lymphatics, which will drain into the posterior group of six to seven axillary lymph nodes positioned along the subscapular vessels on the inferior edge of the posterior axillary wall. The afferent lymphatic vessels to these nodes drain the skin and superficial muscles from the inferior portion of the neck to the iliac crest. Efferent vessels from these nodes drain into the apical and central axillary nodes.
