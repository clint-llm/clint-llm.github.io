Epidemiology differs for each foot deformity.

**Clubfoot:**Clubfoot is the most commonly reported congenital defect of the limbs, with a reported incidence rate of approximately 1 case per 1000 live births.

**Planovalgus:**The epidemiology in children is unknown; in adults the incidence ranges from 13.6% to 37%.

**Cavovarus:**The incidence of the deformity is largely unknown. Japas et al reported a 10% prevalence in the general population.

**Congenital vertical talus:**CVT is rare, occurring in almost 1 in 10,000 live births.

**Congenital oblique talus:**The epidemiology of COT is unknown.

**Metatarsus adductus:**1 to 2 cases in 1,000 births. There is an increased rate in women, and bilateral involvement is present in about 50% of cases.

**Skew foot:**The epidemiology is largely unknown. However, the prevalence is calculated at around 0.5% in the general pediatric population.
