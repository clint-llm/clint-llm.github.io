For many years, amylase has been primarily used for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Amylase can be measured with a blood test or urine test. The urine test may be performed by a clean catch or 24-hour urine collection.

The lipase-to-amylase ratio may help to distinguish gallstone-induced pancreatitis from alcoholic pancreatitis. Gallstones cause higher increases in amylase, and alcohol causes higher increases in lipase. A lipase-to-amylase ratio > 2 has 91% sensitivity and 76% specificity for alcoholic pancreatitis, and a ratio > 5 has 31% sensitivity and close to 100% specificity for alcoholic pancreatitis.
