Healthcare providers widely prescribe loperamide for different types of diarrhea. Even though it is available as an over-the-counter medication, its use still requires the attention and oversight of an interprofessional healthcare team. Pharmacists and clinicians need to survey the potential for abuse and educate the patient of its potential toxicity in large doses. Nurses can also provide monitoring and counseling in this area. In September 2019, the FDA approved a new package size limitations and unit-dose packaging for certain over-the-counter loperamide products in an effort to improve patient safety. When prescribing or recommending loperamide,Â the clinician should have the nurse and/or pharmacist reiterate all safety and dosing issues to ensure proper medication use and optimize patient safety, as patients may think that because of its OTC availability, it does not represent any potential for misuse. Interprofessional management of loperamide therapy will result in better patient outcomes with fewer adverse effects. [Level 5]
