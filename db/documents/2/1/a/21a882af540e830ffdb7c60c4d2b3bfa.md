The most common symptom patients report is a feeling of fullness or a bulge protruding from the vagina. This usually occurs gradually and is noticed over time. Sometimes it is incidentally diagnosed on a physical exam at annually gynecological exams. Patients that have prolapse should also undergo assessment for any other urogynecological issues. Among those with prolapse, 40% will have concurrent stress urinary incontinence, 37% will have overactive bladder, and 50% will have fecal incontinence. Patients may report a dynamic change in their symptoms throughout the day. Most prolapse symptoms are less noticeable to the patient upon first rising, but after various levels of activity such as lifting, straining, or standing the bulging sensation may worsen. When procidentia occurs with complete uterine prolapse, chafing and epithelial erosions are also sometimes noted as the internal vaginal mucosa is now excessively exposed to friction.
