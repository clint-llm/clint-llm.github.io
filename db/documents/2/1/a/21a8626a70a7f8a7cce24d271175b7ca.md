Vasodilators are useful in treating a variety of medical conditions, most commonly systemic hypertension.

Several different vasodilators have undergone development over the years, as mentioned below.

- Direct-acting vasodilators (hydralazine, minoxidil, nitrates, nitroprusside)

- Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, amlodipine)

- An antagonist of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors)

- Beta-2 receptor agonist (salbutamol, terbutaline)

- Postsynaptic alpha-1 receptor antagonist (prazosin, phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine)

- Centrally acting alpha-2 receptor agonist (clonidine, α-methyldopa)

- Endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan, ambrisentan)

- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil)

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs are first-line of the treatment in patients with heart failure, history of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, diabetes, or proteinuria. Both groups of medications have cardioprotective and renoprotective effects.

Clinicians can use many vasodilators in preeclampsia, which is a condition seen in the pregnancy characterized by severe hypertension and proteinuria. If not treated quickly, patients can develop seizures. ACE Inhibitors and ARBs are contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenicity. Hydralazine and calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, nifedipine) are safe to use in these circumstances.

Many vasodilators are used in hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Hypertensive emergency is defined as an elevation of systolic blood pressure over 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure exceeding 120 mmHg with the presence of acute target organ damage (such as kidney insult, encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhage, aortic dissection, subarachnoid hemorrhage). Hypertensive urgencies are defined as an elevation of systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure over 120 mmHg without any clinical or laboratory evidence of acute end-organ damage. In hypertensive emergency following drugs are the first choice depending on systemic involvement.

- Aortic dissection: intravenous esmolol, intravenous nitroprusside, or nitroglycerine

- Acute pulmonary edema: intravenous nitroglycerine, nitroprusside, or clevidipine

- Acute myocardial infarction/unstable angina: intravenous esmolol or nitroglycerine

- Acute renal failure: intravenous fenoldopam, clevidipine, or nicardipine

- Eclampsia: intravenous hydralazine, nicardipine, or labetalol

- Pheochromocytoma/hyperadrenergic state secondary to amphetamine or cocaine: intravenous clevidipine, phentolamine, or nicardipine

This review will focus more on direct-acting vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists as these classes of medications are more commonly used in the current practice.
