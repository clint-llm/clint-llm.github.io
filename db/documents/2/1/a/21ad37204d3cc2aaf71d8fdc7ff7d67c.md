Overall the prognosis for chronic suppurative otitis media is good if treatment is provided and complications are avoided. Some refractory cases can be found, and these require more extensive evaluation and treatment. Because chronic suppurative otitis media is most of the time followed by acute otitis media, it's important to diagnose and treat the bacterial cause of acute otitis media to prevent chronic suppurative otitis media. The introduction of the Pneumococcus vaccine has shown a positive effect in decreasing the incidence of acute otitis media, which leads to a reduction of cases presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media.
