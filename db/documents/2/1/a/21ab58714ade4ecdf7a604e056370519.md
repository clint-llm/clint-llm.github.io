Addison disease is an acquired primary adrenal insufficiency. A primary adrenal insufficiency is termed Addison disease when an autoimmune process causes the condition. It is a rare but potentially life-threatening emergency condition. It results from bilateral adrenal cortex destruction leading to decreased adrenocortical hormones, which may include cortisol, aldosterone, and androgens. Addison disease's insidious course of action usually presents with glucocorticoid deficiency followed by mineralocorticoid. However, it can also present acutely, often triggered by intercurrent illness. The presentation of adrenal insufficiency depends on the rate and extent of adrenal function involvement. The most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency is autoimmune adrenalitis (Addison disease), associated with increased levels of 21-hydroxylase antibodies.
