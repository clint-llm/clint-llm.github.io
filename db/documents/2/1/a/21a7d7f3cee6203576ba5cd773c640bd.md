The aorta develops during the third gestational week concurrently with the endocardial tube. During this early developmental stage, the primitive aorta demonstrates dorsal and ventral segments which are continuous through the first aortic arch. The first aortic arch will disappear during a subsequent developmental stage. The ventral segments of the primitive aorta will join and form the aortic sac while the dorsal segments will merge and create the midline descending aorta. Six paired aortic arches will develop between the ventral and dorsal aortae, and are known as the branchial arch arteries. Towards the end of aortic development, regression of the right dorsal aortic root along with the right ductus arteriosus will result in the formation of the physiologically normal left aortic arch.
