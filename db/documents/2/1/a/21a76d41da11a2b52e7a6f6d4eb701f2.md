Patients will often complain of pleuritic chest pain, which is sudden, intense, and worse with movement, such as respiration. If the underlying cause of the pleural rub is pleural effusion, patients may experience some relief from leaning forward and supporting their upper body with hands placed on the knees or another surface.

Upon palpation of the chest, the clinician may note a sandpaper-rubbing type of sensation. This sensation is suggestive of a pleural rub. The patient may complain of local tenderness with palpation, depending on the underlying etiology.

On auscultation, pleural friction rub is a non-musical, short explosive sound, described as creaking or grating and likened to walking on fresh snow. The sound may be intermittent or continuous. A typical description of the sound is that it “sounds like walking on fresh snow.” The pleural friction rub is biphasic (heard on inspiration and expiration), usually localized to a small area of the chest, and may be accentuated by increasing the pressure on the stethoscope.

Additional findings on history and physical exam will be suggestive of the underlying pathology. Important factors in the history of the patient include accompanying symptoms, history of infection, and occupational history.
