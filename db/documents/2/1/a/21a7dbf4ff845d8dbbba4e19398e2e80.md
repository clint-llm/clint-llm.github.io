Amikacin binds to the 30 S bacterial ribosome subunit, resulting in interference with a reading of the genetic code and inhibition of protein synthesis, e.g., elicits premature protein termination and incorporation of incorrect amino acid.  Amikacin, as well as the rest of the aminoglycosides, are generally bacteriocidal and probably have an additional mechanism of action, which as yet remains undetermined. Aminoglycosides demonstrate bacterial killing that is concentration-dependent and also have a post-antibiotic effect.

Amikacin, when combined with penicillins, can have an additive effect on specific microorganisms.

Amikacin, when combined with carbapenems, can have a synergistic effect against some gram-positive organisms.

Amikacin may retain activity against tobramycin- and gentamicin-resistant strains because of reduced inactivation by bacterial acetylase, adenylase, and phosphorylase. Thus, its routine clinical use should be reserved for difficult to treat serious nosocomial infections.
