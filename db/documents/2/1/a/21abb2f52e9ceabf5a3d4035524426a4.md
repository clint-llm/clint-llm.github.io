AssessmentÂ of uterine anatomy through imaging is a priority when Mullerian abnormalities are suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be highly sensitive and specific. Therefore it is considered the gold standard for these pathologies. Additionally to its diagnostic accuracy, more often than not, Mullerian remnants are present. MRI permits the identification of endometrial activity within the Mullerian structures. This imaging technique can also demonstrate urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and skeletal abnormalities that can accompany these entities. Regarding treatment decisions, MRI can aid in the differentiation between surgically correctable abnormalities and inoperable forms.
