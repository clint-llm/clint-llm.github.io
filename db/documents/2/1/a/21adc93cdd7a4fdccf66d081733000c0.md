The management of hemolytic uremic syndrome begins with good supportive care. The patients are often fluid depleted and thus benefit from several fluid boluses. It is important to have a careful assessment of the patient’s overall kidney function so as to avoid giving too much fluid in the setting of kidney failure. A subset of patients will go on to develop oliguric renal failure (<0.5 ml/kg/hr x 72 hr) and require dialysis. Most experts do not recommend antibiotics and antiperistaltic agents to treat diarrheal illness. They believe that this will increase the complications associated with E. coli infection.

Patients should have their anemia corrected with packed RBCs when hemoglobin reaches 7 to 8 g/dl or hematocrit less than 18%. The treatment of thrombocytopenia is often unnecessary, given the continued consumption during the disease. Furthermore, there is concern that platelet transfusion leads to worsening thrombosis. Exceptions to this are those with active bleeding or before a surgical procedure.

Patients diagnosed with HUS should be admitted to the hospital for further monitoring. Those with encephalopathy or need for dialysis should be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Once identified, familial atypical HUS requires consultation with hematology for possible plasmapheresis.
