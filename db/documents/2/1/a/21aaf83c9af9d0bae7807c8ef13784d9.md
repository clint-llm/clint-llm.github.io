Diagnosing esophageal candidiasis is via upper endoscopic evaluation. Visualizing the candida on the esophageal mucosa as white plaques or exudates confirms the diagnosis.Â  Plaques and exudates are adherent to the mucosa and do not wash off with water irrigation. There may also be mucosal breaks or ulcerations. Biopsies or brushings of the plaques can undergo testing for histologic confirmation of the infection.
