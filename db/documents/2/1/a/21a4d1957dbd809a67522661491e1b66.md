**Alcohol use.**Alcohol, or more specifically, ethanol, is a CNS depressant that works by potentiating the GABA-A receptor, inhibiting glutamate-binding NMDA receptors, and inhibiting VDCCs.

**Fetal alcohol syndrome.**The pathophysiology in fetal alcohol syndrome is mediated by ethanol binding to the GABA-A and NMDA receptors in the developing CNS.

**Anxiety disorders.**Anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder are associated with decreased levels of GABA.

**Depression.**Although depression is primarily associated with alterations in dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, GABA signaling deficits also play a role in depression.

**Epileptic disorders and tremors.**Epileptic seizures are thought to be paroxysmal hypersynchronous electrical discharges due to overexcitation of neurons in the brain.

**Huntington's disease.**The protein involved in Huntington disease, Huntingtin, inhibits the transcription and transport of GABA-A receptors and KCC2, causes neuroinflammation that weakens the inhibitory response and disruption of astrocytic glutamate transporters.

**Diseases involving excessive GABA.**Excessive GABA release can also be pathologic and manifests as idiopathic hypersomnia (IH), a condition that manifests as daytime sleepiness with excessive, unrefreshing sleep.
