Complications related to catheter placement are similar to the placement of central catheter placement

Pneumothorax or hemothorax can be a complication after insertion when the catheter is placed in the subclavian vein.

Air embolism caused by entrainment of air from the infusion ports.

Complications related to catheter insertion include the occurrences of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias due to irritation or contact of the catheter with the cardiac walls

Valve rupture or cardiac wall perforation can occur but it is rare.

Misplacement of the catheter can occur due to looping of the catheter in the right chambers. This can be prevented with the placement of the catheter under fluoroscopy and paying attention to the waveforms in the monitor.

Vessel rupture can happen at the moment of balloon inflation into the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery perforation, pseudoaneurysm formation, and rupture can develop and has a 30% to 70% mortality

Pulmonary infarction can occur when the balloon is inflated for long period or migration to the catheter to the distal branches.

Thromboembolism can also occur secondary to inflammation or infection of the catheter that acts as a nidus for thrombus.
