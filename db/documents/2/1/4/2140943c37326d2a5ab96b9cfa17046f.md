Acquired partial lipodystrophy- Misra et al demonstrated that the prognosis of acquired partial dystrophy is dependent on renal dysfunction. The age of onset of lipodystrophy is significantly lower in the patients with APL having membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Patients on average developed MPGN 8 years from diagnosis though the clinical course is variable. The incidence of MPGN is reported to be as high as 22%.

Acquired generalized dystrophy- Panniculitis associated generalized lipodystrophy is generally less severe than the other forms of this disorder. Autoimmune associated generalized lipodystrophy causes greater susceptibility to autoimmune diseases in these individuals.

Lipodystrophy can be associated with difficult to control type 2 DM requiring high doses of insulin. Uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia can lead to recurrent pancreatitis. Fat deposition in the liver can cause cirrhosis of the liver leading to cirrhosis.

Loss of fat tissue in patients with acquired lipodystrophy cannot be reversed and patients might require cosmetic procedures.
