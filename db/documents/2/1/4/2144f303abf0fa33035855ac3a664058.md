With improved screening and diagnostic techniques, the incidence and prevalence of breast cancer are rising worldwide. In 2018 alone, there were 2.2 million cases of breast cancer diagnosed worldwide, and most were discovered by imaging. However, there are limitations to breast imaging evaluation. The majority of suspicious breast lesions require further diagnostic workup with a biopsy and pathological diagnosis to determine management. This activity describes how to perform an ultrasound, mammographic stereotactic, and magnetic resonance (MR) guided breast biopsy and explains the role of the machines, interprofessional team, and techniques used in evaluating and managing suspicious breast masses in patients who undergo imaging-guided biopsies.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomical structures of the breast and the embryologic origin of breast parenchyma.
- Review the equipment and technique required to perform a breast biopsy.
- Identify the potential complications of a breast biopsy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance breast biopsy procedures and improve patient outcomes.
