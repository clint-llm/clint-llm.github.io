Gastric acid is the fluid secreted by the stomach. It is composed of hydrochloric acid, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. Hydrochloric acid plays an integral part in the digestion of food and protects our body against pathogens ingested with food or water. The parietal cells lining the stomach are mainly involved in its production. Achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria refers to conditions in which the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach is respectively absent or reduced. It is usually secondary to an underlying medical condition.
