Bedside examination of a patient with suspected aphasia includes assessments of fluency, the ability to name objects, repeat short phrases, follow simple and complex commands, read, and write. Formal neuropsychological testing may be helpful in determining the type and severity of the language deficit. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI, fMRI, PET or SPECT) may be required to localize and diagnose the cause of aphasia. Patients should also be screened for depression as this is also common in Broca's aphasia.
