As mentioned before, a small degree of kyphosis is normal, given the structure and shape of the vertebral bodies and disc. However, when the angle of kyphosis is more than 40 degrees, which is the 95th percentile for young adults, we then call this hyperkyphosis.

The gold standard for the objective assessment of kyphosis is obtaining a standing lateral spine X-ray.Â  Of note, the patient can be supine instead for comfort in the elderly population. When analyzing the lateral spinal X-ray, to make the diagnosis of kyphosis, the Cobb's angle must be calculated. To do this, find the superior endplate of the vertebra that forms the beginning of the curve and the inferior endplate of the vertebra that forms the end of the curve. Draw a straight line through both the superior and inferior endplates, and the Cobb's angle will be the measured angle of these intersected lines.

There are, however, alternatives if radiographs are unable to be obtained. The Debrunner kyphometer, as well as the flexicurve ruler, are two acceptable alternatives in place of radiographs for assessing hyperkyphosis.
