**Clinical Studies**

Phenazopyridine was marketed before the regulations required pre-clinical studies to prove a drug's safety and effectiveness. As a result, large and robust studies are not available, and the drug’s role in treating UTIs is primarily based on clinical observations. A critical analysis of the available studies has been published. One study involved 118 patients, 64% of which had cystitis or pyelonephritis. All subjects received phenazopyridine 200 mg three times a day for two weeks, a longer duration than what is currently recommended. The study was open-label and had one treatment arm. The authors reported improved symptomatic response dysuria (95.3%), burning (93.6%), frequency (85.6%), and nocturia (83.7%).

Another investigation involved 49 subjects with acute UTIs who received phenazopyridine 200 mg three times a day. Patients were assessed after 24 and 72 hours for nocturia, burning, and urgency. Mean symptom scores were reported as slight (3 or 4 symptoms) after 24 hours and none (1 or 2 symptoms) after 72 hours.

Phenazopyridine was compared to flavoxate, an antispasmodic drug, in 392 subjects with UTI symptoms, incontinence, and/or suprapubic pain. The subjects received either phenazopyridine 200 mg three times a day or flavoxate 100 mg four times a day. The differences in clinical response were not statistically significant. In a separate analysis of men with prostatitis, the subjects were treated with phenazopyridine 200 mg three times a day. Satisfactory alleviation of symptoms was reported in only 31% of the subjects.

**Use in Adults**

Phenazopyridine is usually dosed with 100 to 200 mg three times a day in healthy adults. Over-the-counter (OTC) tablets are available in lower strengths, ranging from 50 mg to 99.5 mg. The OTC tablets are frequently taken two pills at a time and three times a day, effectively matching the prescription regimen. The OTC formulation is helpful for temporary symptom relief pending further medical care. Phenazopyridine is best taken with or after meals to avoid stomach upset.

The recommended treatment duration is two days, and this short period alleviates discomfort until antibiotics can control the infection and protects the patient from potentially severe adverse effects. Some clinicians advocate that patients with uncomplicated UTI symptoms take OTC phenazopyridine alone for five days hoping that the infection will resolve spontaneously. However, most patients prefer a more certain resolution, the practice is not yet validated, and five days of therapy is longer than currently recommended.

The drug is commonly used in outpatients with uncomplicated UTIs to improve their comfort. However, it is not routinely used in treating complicated UTIs or inpatient settings when treating acute pyelonephritis in patients with risk factors for developing a more severe infection.

**Diagnostic Uses**

One study indicates that using oral phenazopyridine with dextrose instillation is effective in visualizing ureteral patency during intraoperative cystoscopy.****A single 200 mg dose the evening before an operation helps identify the urethral orifice.

**Use in Cystoscopy**

In a randomized controlled study, 97 cystoscopy patients received either phenazopyridine 200 mg twenty minutes before the procedure and then every eight hours for three total doses and lidocaine gel or only lidocaine gel. Subjects who received the phenazopyridine and lidocaine gel reported less discomfort and lower heart rates than the lidocaine gel control group. The authors concluded that phenazopyridine reduces pain intensity associated with both cystoscopy and during the first urination.

**Post Operative Use**

In a randomized controlled study of 152 women undergoing prolapse surgery, administration of a single phenazopyridine 200 mg dose postoperatively did not improve postoperative voiding compared to the control group.

**Supportive Care**

Phenazopyridine has been used safely for up to two months as supportive care in radiation-induced cystitis.

**Pediatrics Considerations**

Dosing for children ages 6 to 12 is 12 mg/kg/day in three equally divided doses. A pediatric formulation is not commercially available and requires compounding.

**Patients with Renal Insufficiency**

In mild renal failure (glomerular filtration rate over 50 mL/min), the recommended dosing frequency is every 8 to 16 hours. Phenazopyridine should not use in patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 50 mL/min.

**Pregnancy/Lactation Considerations**

Phenazopyridine is FDA class B and is known to cross the placenta.
