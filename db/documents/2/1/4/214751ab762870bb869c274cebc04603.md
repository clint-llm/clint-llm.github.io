The International Network for Simulation-Based Pediatric Innovation, Research & Education (INSPIRE), a research network focused on the transferability of simulation skills to clinical practice, is an organization to watch in the future as the application of simulation evolves and its prevalence in EMS education expands.

Goals going forward within the EMS simulation community include increasing educator familiarity with simulation tools to encourage utilization, as well as further investigation into how simulation training translates to real-world skills.
