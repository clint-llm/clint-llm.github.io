Shoulder pain is a common clinical complaint with an annual incidence of 14.7 per 1000 patients per year. Lifetime prevalence is reportedly as high as 70%. Rotator cuff pathology, acromioclavicular and glenohumeral joint disorders constitute the most common causes of shoulder pain. The shoulder can also be a site of inflammatory conditions. Intra-articular steroid injection for management of adhesive capsulitis is well studied and an important cornerstone of management for patients with this disorder. This activity outlines and explains the role of the fluoroscopic and proper technique in performing shoulder joint injections for patients.
