Coadministration of CYP3A4 substrate statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) with medications that are potent 3A4 inhibitors (diltiazem, erythromycin, -azoles) may result in increased serum concentrations with an increased risk of side effects. A reduced dose may be appropriate, or a selection of an alternative statin that does not undergo metabolism via the 3A4 pathway. Administration with other drugs associated with myopathy requires caution. Simvastatin and gemfibrozil coadministration is contraindicated because of the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Dose restrictions are recommended with the coadministration of gemfibrozil or other fibrates with statins, and using more than one statin is not recommended.

Statins are contraindicated for use by patients with active hepatic disease or unexplained persistent elevations in aminotransferase levels. Statins are now relatively contraindicated during pregnancy.
