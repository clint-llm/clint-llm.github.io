The currently accepted model for swallowing describes three main stages: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. While solids and liquids share common pharyngeal and esophageal phases, they differ slightly in the processing and transport of boluses into the oropharynx during the oral phase. These phases work in a sequential and coordinated fashion that serves to pass a bolus into the stomach and protect the airway from aspiration.
