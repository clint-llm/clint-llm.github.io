Apocrine glands are larger than eccrine glands, with a 10-fold greater diameter. They are made up of 2 primary parts: a coiled secretory structure and an accompanying straight duct. The coiled secretory structure, which is the gland itself, is located in the lower dermis or the subcutaneous fat and is composed only of secretory cells. The gland contains multiple large granules. The accompanying straight duct enters the infundibulum. Apocrine glands originate from the hair germ and therefore generally enter the pilosebaceous follicle at its infundibulum; however, occasionally the duct will open directly on the skin surface in proximity to the pilosebaceous follicle.

The gland, or coiled secretory structure, is made up of a single layer of cuboidal or columnar cells, which rest on a layer of myoepithelial cells. The ductal portion is made up of a double layer of basophilic cells, with a periluminal eosinophilic cuticle.
