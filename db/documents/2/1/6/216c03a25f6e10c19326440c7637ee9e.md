Laser devices are powerful tools that have an expanding array of indications, but these devices also have the potential to cause significant harm to patients and healthcare providers if not employed correctly. Lasers should be used by trained medical professionals in medical settings, providing higher quality care with a lower risk of adverse effects and subsequent litigation.

Physicians and other clinicians should be aware of the risks of complications of laser procedures and knowledgeable about the management of these complications. Early recognition and treatment of complications can help decrease long-term morbidity and the need for additional treatment. Every healthcare team member is responsible for the safety of the patient and their colleagues. Critical to that safety is that everyone in the procedure room should use proper eye protection and personal protective equipment and that there should be water and a fire extinguisher close at hand.
