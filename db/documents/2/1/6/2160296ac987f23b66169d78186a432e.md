The disease syndrome that occurs after macro aspiration of gastric and oropharyngeal contents leading to acute pulmonary infection is aspiration pneumonia. It is important to understand and distinguish between aspiration pneumonitis, an inflammatory process that occurs post-aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia for guiding treatment. Since the major complication of this disease syndrome results in ARDS, prompt treatment with supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, and measures to prevent further aspiration has to be undertaken. Close monitoring of the patient for hypoxia is mandated, and if present, the patient should be intubated and mechanically ventilated. In a meta-analysis conducted by Kosaku K. et al., it is found that aspiration pneumonia is associated with high-30-day and in-hospital, but outside the intensive care setting,Â mortality rates in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
