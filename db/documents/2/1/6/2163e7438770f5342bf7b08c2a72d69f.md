Cocaine hydrochloride topical solution contains 4% cocaine and the following inactive ingredients: citric acid, D and C Yellow No. 10, FD and C Green No. 3, sodium benzoate, and water. It is not FDA-approved but allowed for only the following indications: topical anesthesia of the mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal, and nasal cavities. Its vasoconstrictive properties also make it useful for the temporary treatment of epistaxis before cauterization or packing, which is considered off-label use. Based on a recent systematic review, cocaine is the most commonly used agent by ENT physicians in preparation for diagnostic and therapeutic nasal procedures.

Cocaine is otherwise an illegal drug of abuse listed on DEA Schedule II because of its 1) high potential for misuse; 2) accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; 3) abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. People who misuse cocaine ingest it by snorting it in powder form, injecting it, and smoking it in its "crack" formulation (by processing it with sodium bicarbonate). Cocaine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, creating euphoria with increased energy and motor activity and enhancing feelings of competence and sexuality. The drug's effects generally last between 15 minutes and one hour. Cocaine's effects and duration depend on the dose and administration route.
