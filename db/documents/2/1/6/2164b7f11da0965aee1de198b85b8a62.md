Several complications are notable with PLD patients.  These complications can be broken down into intra-cystic complications and liver volume complications.

**Intra-cystic Complications**

**Hepatic cyst hemorrhage**

It typically manifests as acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain that progresses in the first few days and resolves spontaneously.

**Hepatic Cyst Infections**

Hepatic cyst infections are rare (1%) complications in patients with PLD and are believed to result from the translocation of bacteria from the intestines. It is typically present as right upper quadrant pain, fever, and malaise.Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. A fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can be used to identify the infected cysts, as the epithelia of these cysts will accumulate the FDG. Unfortunately, it is not the gold standard, as the accuracy only seems to improve in the later stages of the infection.CA) 19-9 levels were found in patients with hepatic cyst infection and declining during recovery.

**Hepatic Cyst Ruptures**

Hepatic cyst rupture is an extremely rare complication and has only been published in case reports.

**Liver Volume Complications**

Liver volume-related complications are another rare occurrence. This refers to complications arising from the cyst putting pressure on adjacent organs or by an enlarged liver. This has only been reported in case reports. Patients can develop obstructive jaundice, portal vein occlusion, portal hypertension with splenic varices, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and compression of the inferior vena cava, leading to edema and ascites. Treatments are individualized and based on the complications.

The last rare complication that can develop in patients with isolated PLD is cystic carcinoma. This typically presents with abdominal pain and weight loss. The patient usually has the advanced liver disease at this point.
