Alteration in the gastrocolic reflex has been a suspected etiology in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients withÂ IBS have demonstrated a stronger colonic response to the gastrocolic reflex. These patients may experience a strong urge to defecate following ingestion of a meal and may experience symptoms like abdominal distension, flatulence, pain, and tenesmus.

Profound gastrocolic reflex has been implicated in the idiopathic variant of dumping syndrome (DS). Although abdominal pain is present in both DS and IBS, systemic signs including palpitations, hypotension, dizziness, diaphoresis often accompany DS. Another key difference in the presentation of DS is that they often present with protein-calorie malnutrition due to increased excess nutritional loss in diarrhea.

Both IBS and DS are caused by profound gastrocolic reflex, whereas poor gastrocolic reflex results in constipation. Neuronal dysfunction may lead to impaired gastrocolic reflex and poor gut motility. Diabetic patients with neuropathy often have gastroparesis resulting in delayed gastric emptying and also impaired gastrocolic reflex leading to constipation.
