The etiology of seizures varies widely across different age groups. Throughout the years, the influence of a genetic component in the development of partial seizures has become more prevalent.

Mesial temporal lobe epilepsies (MTLE) are identified as the most common form of partial epilepsy. The etiology of MTLE is linked to hippocampal sclerosis. Hippocampal sclerosis is caused by the disruption of normal mRNA transcription leading to various malfunctions of healthy cells and ultimately resulting in permanent sclerotic changes.
