HP is characterized by bronchiolocentric lung inflammation in response to a repetitive insult by sensitized inhaled antigen. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and clinical course isÂ highly variable. Prompt diagnosis and antigen avoidance is key to management. Corticosteroids hasten recovery. Progression to fibrosis portends a poor prognosis.
