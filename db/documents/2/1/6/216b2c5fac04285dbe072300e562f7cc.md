Between 1990 and 2013, 29747 cases of adverse effects (AEs) following administration of the Hib vaccine were reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). No attempt at describing the causality of adverse effects was made from these reports. Adverse effects are classified as either serious or non-serious. Serious AEs are defined as those which result in death, life-threatening illness, require an extended hospital stay, or permanent disability. 17% of the AEs classified as being serious. In descending order of frequency, the ten most common, serious AEs were fever, vomiting, convulsions, irritability, intussusception, diarrhea, crying, hypotonia, lethargy, and apnea. In descending order of frequency, the ten most common, non-serious AE’s were fever, erythema at the injection site, crying, rash, irritability, screaming, hives, swelling of the injection site, agitation, and erythema.

One day after vaccine administration was the median time for onset of AEs reported to VAERS. There were fifty-six reported cases of anaphylaxis. Most occurred within one day of vaccine administration, with a range of 0 to 3 days. Eight hundred ninety-six deaths occurred after the administration of the Hib vaccine. According to the death certificate, the most common cause of death was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Importantly, there is abundant evidence that vaccines, in general, are not causally related to SIDS.
