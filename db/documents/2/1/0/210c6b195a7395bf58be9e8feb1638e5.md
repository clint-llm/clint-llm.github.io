Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) is a skeletal disorder caused by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone from the overactive parathyroid glands. Osteitis fibrosa cystica is the late manifestation of the hyperparathyroidism. The incidence of bone lesions has decreased from 80% in the past to 15% in the present. This may be attributable to biochemical monitoring of serum calcium levels leading to earlier diagnoses in frequently asymptomatic patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of osteitis fibrosa cystica and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in early diagnosis hyperparathyroidism by performing routine blood work and prevention of skeletal complications of hyperparathyroidism.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common cause of the osteitis fibrosa cystica.
- Summarize the epidemiology of the osteitis fibrosa cystica. 
- Outline the treatment and management options available for osteitis fibrosa cystica.
- Review the importance of an interprofessional team approach to the evaluation and treatment of hyperparathyroidism that will provide the best outcome.
