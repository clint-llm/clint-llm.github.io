The overall prognosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is good, with a 10-year survival rate of 99.1%. As metastasis is rare, morbidity due to local recurrence is a more common issue. Age older than 50 is a risk factor for local recurrence. Patients with metastatic disease live on average about 2 years after the time of diagnosis. A high mitotic index, increased cellularity, black race, male sex, and location on the head, neck, or limb are risk factors for higher mortality rates.
