A diagnosis of Kohler disease does not require a bone biopsy, and a biopsy is not recommended for the diagnosis unless there is a need to rule out infection or malignancy. Kohler disease looks similar to other forms of avascular necrosis histologically. The primary histologic feature of avascular necrosis is dead trabeculae with empty lacunae that will stain deeper than healthy bone. The lacunae will be enlarged and with cystic changes. Bone marrow is noted to be a more sensitive indicator for AVN than the bone itself and will show fat necrosis and calcium deposits.
