Given the variety of valves on the market, it was recognized early that a common language was needed to compare products and outcomes. The American Association of Thoracic Surgeons (AATS) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) maintain an Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for Standardizing Definitions of Prosthetic Heart Valve Morbidity, which updated its latest definition in terms in 1996.****

The guidelines recognize hospital mortality before a patientâ€™s discharge as distinct from 30-day mortality, also known as operative mortality. Valve-related mortality is mortality due to one of the below morbid categories not related to progressive heart failure.

The recognized morbid categories are as follows. Structural valve deterioration (SVD) is stipulated as any change intrinsic to the valve leading to stenosis or insufficiency, including calcification, fracture, tear, and suture disruption but excludes prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) and thrombotic dysfunction, which comprise their own mutually exclusive categories. Nonstructural dysfunction is not intrinsic to the valve leading to stenosis or insufficiency, including obstruction from improper placement, a leak from improper sizing, and hemolytic anemia (an indicator of the leak). A bleeding event is an event that leads to hospitalization, transfusion, or death, but does not require taking anticoagulation.

An old study reporting ten years follow up of one particular mechanical valve now unavailable gives representative rates of these complications for the aortic valve position.

- Structural valve deterioration 0 events/patient years

- Nonstructural dysfunction 0.2 to 0.8 events/patient years

- Thrombotic events 0.0 to 0.2 events/patient years

- Embolic events 1.4 to 2.5 events/patient years

- Bleeding events 0.8 to 2.5 events/patient years

- Endocarditis events 0.4 to 0.7 events/patient years

- Reoperation 0.3 to 1.8 events/patient years

By comparison, representative statistics for bioprosthetic valves at twelve years in the aortic position include 87% freedom from valve-related mortality, 84% freedom from reoperation, 93% freedom from SVD explantation for patients over 60 years old, and 76% freedom from SVD explantation for patients under 60 years old.
