Although no randomized controlled trials exist for the treatment of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, empiric treatment has been suggested based on expert opinion and reported case series. There are reports that RCVS can occur after exposure to certain medications of agents such as serotonergic agents, sympathomimetics, and recreational drugs (THC). Offending agents should be discontinued.

Calcium channel blockers, such as nimodipine, nifedipine, or verapamil, have been used as treatment with different degrees of success. Nimodipine, at a rate of 1 to 2 mg/hour, followed by an oral regimen of 30 to 60 mg every 4 hours for 4 to 8 weeks, has been commonly reported. The optimal duration is unclear.

Endovascular intervention, such as balloon angioplasty and direct intra-arterial vasodilator administration, have been used. In patients with RCVS, the use of intra-arterial vasodilators, such as nicardipine, papaverine, milrinone, and nimodipine, has shown to promptly reverse vasoconstriction in multiple intracerebral arteries. This response does not occur in patients with RCVS mimics, such as vasculitis or cerebral vessel atherosclerosis. Given that RCVS is generally self-limiting, the suggestion is that intra-arterial vasodilators serve as a diagnostic tool for patients with suspected RCVS.
