Uremic encephalopathy is a clinical syndrome with no established diagnostic criteria. The clinical presentation is variable and is determined by the rate of progression of the underlying kidney disease. In patients with a slow decline in eGFR, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and nausea are the signs. Cognitive dysfunction is slow, progressive, and subtle in such patients.

At the other end of the spectrum are patients with a rapid decline in eGFR. These patients can present with more severe features of uremic encephalopathy, such as confusion, delirium, seizures, disorientation, emotional volatility, and coma.

A physical exam reveals cognitive dysfunction in the form of abnormalities in memory, judgment, and ability to perform calculations. Hyperreflexia, asterixis, papilledema, and nystagmus are frequently present. In addition, neuropathy and myopathy may be present.
