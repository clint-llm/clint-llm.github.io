While some patients with OHS present with acute chronic exacerbation of respiratory failure with acute respiratory acidosis, others remain clinically stable at diagnosis. The majority of patients have classic symptoms of OSA, including loud snoring, nocturnal choking episodes with witnessed apneas, excessive daytime sleepiness, and morning headaches, as well as hypoxemia during wake and more severeÂ hypoxemia during sleep. Patients often exhibit dyspnea and may have signs of cor pulmonale. Classical physical examination findings include an enlarged neck circumference, a crowded oropharynx, a prominent pulmonic component of the second heart sound on cardiac auscultation, and lower extremity edema.
