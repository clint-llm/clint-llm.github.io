Sodium nitroprusside is a water-soluble salt comprised of ferrous iron complexed with nitric oxide (NO) and five cyanide ions. Acting as a prodrug, SNP reacts with sulfhydryl groups on erythrocytes (as well as albumin and other proteins) to produce nitric oxide (NO). Upon binding to vascular smooth muscle, NO triggers intracellular cGMP-mediated activation of protein kinase G and subsequent inactivation of myosin light chains, resulting in relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. The result of this signaling cascade is peripheral vasodilation of both arteries and veins (with slightly more selectivity for veins).

From a hemodynamic perspective, the net result is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (afterload), ventricular filling pressures, and systemic blood pressure with an increase in cardiac output.Â Onset is rapid (within 2 minutes), and the duration of its hypotensive effect is roughly 10 minutes; these properties make nitroprusside useful in situations requiring an immediate reduction in preload or afterload. In contrast to nitroglycerin, nitroprusside causes a more balanced vasodilatory effect between arteries and veins.
