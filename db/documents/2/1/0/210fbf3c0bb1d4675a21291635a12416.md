Bloom syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of chromosomal instability. It is due to mutations in the BLM gene located at 15q26.1. The BLM gene encodes a BLM helicase, which forms a complex with two other proteins, DNA topoisomerase IIIα and RMI. Mutations in the BLM gene generate errors during DNA replication and lead to more numerous chromosomal rearrangements and breakages. As a result of the high rate of genomic instability, individuals with Bloom syndrome are at increased risk of developing malignancies.
