The external auditory canal (EAC) is the most common location to encounter a foreign body, particularly in children, accounting for 44% of cases, with nasal, pharyngeal, esophageal, and laryngobronchial locations representing 25%, 23%, 5%, and 2% of cases, respectively.

While more common in pediatric patients, adults may also present with EAC foreign bodies, ranging from insects to hearing aid pieces and cotton balls. The most commonly removed foreign bodies include beads (most common), paper or tissue paper, and popcorn kernels.
