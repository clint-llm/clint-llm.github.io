There are several different classifications of zygomycosis: rhinocerebral, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and disseminated. Rhinocerebral is the most common form and initially resembles sinusitis with congestion, sinus pain, and drainage. The exam will vary depending on how advanced the infection is. Patients may present with erythema, periorbital swelling, and black necrotic eschars. History and physical will also vary depending on the underlying immunosuppressive disorder. For example, a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis may present with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
