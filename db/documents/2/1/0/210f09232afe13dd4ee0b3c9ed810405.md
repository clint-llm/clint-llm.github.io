Hartnup disease has a genetic etiology. SLC6A19 is a gene located on the short arm of chromosome 5 that encodes transport protein B0AT1 present at the apical cell surface of the small intestine and kidney. Immunohistochemical studies showed maximum expression of B0AT1 in early proximal convoluted tubule in kidney and jejunum in the small intestine.

Mutation in the SLC6A19 gene is responsible for Hartnup disease. The mutations noted to cause the disease are missense, splice site, frameshift, and nonsense.

Hartnup disease has a wide range of clinical symptoms as it can result from a mutation in the transport protein B0AT1, or co-receptors collectrin and ACE2.
