After excluding dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, one should consider other diagnoses that can present with similar features. Thus, it is essential to distinguish left ventricular non-compaction from acquired changes seen in pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, layered mural thrombus in the left ventricle, mycotic invasion of the heart, intramyocardial hematoma, or Fabry's disease.

MOGE(S) classification of cardiomyopathies has considered LVNC as a distinct entity; this will hopefully improve knowledge and awareness of the disease.
