Dental caries and poor dental health are quite common in the United States. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2012  conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics for dental caries and tooth loss report that 91% of adults aged 20 to 64 had dental caries. These rates were lower for Hispanic, non-Hispanic black Americans, and non-Hispanic Asian adults when compared with non-Hispanic white adults (Dye et al. 2012). Approximately, 27% of adults aged 20 to 64 have untreated tooth decay. Rates of untreated tooth decay were higher in Hispanics at 36% and non-Hispanic Black Americans at 42% (Dye et al. 2012). In adults over age 65, approximately 19% had untreated dental caries (Dye et al. 2012).

A dental abscess and dental-related hospital emergency room (ER) visits are quite common. One study found that dental infection admissions in hospitals occurred at the rate of 1 per 2600 per population in the United States (Wang et al., 2005). The rates for pediatric ER visits are significantly higher for a dental abscess at 47 % (Graham et al., 2000).

This data is not only suggestive of the very high prevalence of poor dental health which is a major predisposing factor to developing a dental abscess, but it also shows that there are racial and likely socioeconomic factors at play. Provider practices may shift because of the population, racial distribution, and socioeconomic demographics of the community.
