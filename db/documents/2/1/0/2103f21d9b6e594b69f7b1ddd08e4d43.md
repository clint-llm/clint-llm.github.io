Transrectal prostate ultrasound is a key tool for diagnosing many prostatic diseases, such as prostate cancer, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Besides traditional grayscale imaging, multiple additional technologies may aid in the diagnosis. This activity outlines the transrectal ultrasonographic evaluation of the prostate and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for patients with prostatic disease.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for a transrectal prostate ultrasound.
- Describe the typical imaging findings of prostate cancer, prostatitis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- Identify the most common anatomical zones for prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
- Explain the importance of the added technologies for diagnosing prostatic disease with transrectal prostate ultrasound.
