Genetic mutation is the root cause of SCID.  Specifically, the genes which are responsible for the function of T and B cells are affected in SCID.  Profound T-cell abnormalities can prevent B cells from functioning normally because the B cells require signals from T cells to produce appropriate antibodies.  Therefore, in some instances, SCID may be present with only T cell dysfunction.  Natural killer (NK) cells develop separately from T and B cells and can provide a degree of protection in individuals with T and B cell dysfunction.  Assessing for the presence of NK cells helps determine the severity and prognosis of the SCID.
