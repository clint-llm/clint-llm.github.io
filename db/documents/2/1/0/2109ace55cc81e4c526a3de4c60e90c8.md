The forearm is a vital structure in the human body that is essential for completing activities of daily living. It is designed to help maximize versatility by allowing pronation and supination of the hand. Forearm fractures can lead to significant short-term and long-term disability, particularly if treated incorrectly. Originally described by Giovanni Battista Monteggia in 1814, the Monteggia fracture is a fracture of the proximal ulna associated with a dislocation of the radial head. Technological advances in radiography and fracture research have helped to better define, classify, and guide operative management.
