At this time, are no proposed methods by which to reduce a patient's risk of the Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) pattern as it is theorized to be secondary to anatomical variation. Clinicians should counsel patients regarding the presence ofÂ an accessory pathway that has the potential to create arrhythmias via partially or entirely bypassing the atrioventricular (AV) node resulting in the direct activation of the bundle of His by the sinoatrial (SA) node. The diagnosis of LGL requires the use of a resting EKG, where these patients typically display a pattern of short PR interval but normal QRS complex duration; however, electrophysiology should be consulted to evaluate for the presence of a bypass tract within the conduction system.
