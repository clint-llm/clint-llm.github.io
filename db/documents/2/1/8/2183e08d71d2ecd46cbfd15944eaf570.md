Sternal fractures most commonly result from blunt, anterior chest-wall trauma, and deceleration injuries, with a reported incidence of 3% to 6.8% in motor vehicle collisions. Athletic injuries, falls, and assaults are the frequent causes of the remaining cases. Clinicians frequently diagnose sternal fracturesABBA using a lateral chest X-rayÂ or CT scan of the chest. Sternal fractures increase the risk of and are commonly associated with other injuries. The disposition of patients with a sternal fracture is dependent upon several variables, including potentially significant associated injuries, comorbidities, and inadequate pain control.
