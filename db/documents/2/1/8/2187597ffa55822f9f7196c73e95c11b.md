Pseudocysts can occur after pancreatitis in any age group. The incidence of pseudocysts is higher in males as it follows the incidence of pancreatitis, which is slightly male predominant. In acute pancreatitis, the incidence of pseudocysts ranges from 5% to 16%. Pseudocysts tend to be more common in the setting of chronic pancreatitis, with incidence rates between 20% to 40%. This can be explained by its long course posing an increased risk of damaging the pancreatic ducts with fibrosis, calculi, or protein plug formation. Data collected from over 357 admissions at Wayne University Hospital in Detroit for pancreatic pseudocyst recognized that the majority of the cases were alcohol-induced (70%) followed by biliary tract disease (8%), trauma (6%), and the remaining attributed to the idiopathic cause.
