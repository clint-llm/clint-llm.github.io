The lower lid blepharoplasty is challenging as compared to upper lid blepharoplasty. Meticulous patient selection, preoperative evaluation, and surgical planning are important. The blepharoplasties are performed by multiple specialties, including ophthalmologists, oculoplastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, plastic surgeons, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and otorhinolaryngologists. A thorough anatomical and physiological understanding of eyelid structure are necessary before attempting lower blepharoplasty. The interprofessional team for blepharoplasty is comprised of the operating surgeon, anesthesiologist, surgical assistants, and nursing staff. A well-coordinated team will lead to the best surgical outcome. Managing intraoperative and postoperative complication majorly depend on all team members. Postoperative wound care by trained nursing staff and proper counseling by surgeons have key importanceÂ for patient management.
