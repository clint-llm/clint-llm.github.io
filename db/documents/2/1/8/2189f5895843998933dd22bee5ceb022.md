Given that the clinical presentation of PAP is nonspecific, diagnosis of this disease demands appropriate serological, radiological, and bronchoscopic evaluation.

**Radiography**

Chest radiography may demonstrate bilateral alveolar opacities in a peri-hilar and basilar distribution without air-bronchograms

**Biomarkers**

Several biomarkers have been studied in PAP, including surfactant protein A, B, and D levels, cytokeratin 19, serum carcinoembryonic antigen, serum lactate dehydrogenase, GM-CSF levels, anti-GM-CSF antibodies, and KL-6

**Pulmonary Function Testing**

Pulmonary function testing is not necessary for diagnosis, nor is it specific for PAP; however, the most common pattern on spirometry is a restrictive pattern

**Bronchoscopy**

When PAP is suspected, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is the gold standard for diagnosis

**Lung Biopsy**

Biopsies are not necessary for aÂ diagnosis of PAP but can be helpful
