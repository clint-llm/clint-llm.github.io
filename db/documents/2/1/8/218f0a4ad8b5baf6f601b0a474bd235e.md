Required materials include casting material (fiberglass, pre-padded casting material with fiberglass, plaster, etc), web roll (2” to 4”), elastic wrap (3”), stockinette (optional), shears or large scissors, sheets/chuck pads for draping, sling (if performing sugar tong splint), and a table/stand for supplies. If the splinting area does not have a sink available, one will also need a bucket or emesis basin.

Note: plaster and Ortho-Glass™ undergo an exothermic chemical reaction (heat release) when in contact with water. Using hot water will cause the material to harden faster while using cold water will cause the material to harden slower. Using warm water will give adequate time (approximately 10 minutes) to mold the splint while not causing you to stand for extended periods of time waiting for it to harden.
