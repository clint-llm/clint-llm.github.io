There are two different models of substrate binding to the active site of an enzyme. The first model called the lock and key model, proposes that the shape and chemistry of the substrate are complementary to the shape and chemistry of the active site on the enzyme. This means when the substrate enters the active site, it fits perfectly, and the two binds together, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. The other model is called the induced fit model, and it hypothesizes that the enzyme and the substrate don’t initially have the precise complementary shape/chemistry or alignment, but rather, this alignment becomes induced at the active site by substrate binding. Substrate binding to an enzyme is generally stabilized by local molecular interactions with the amino acid residues on the polypeptide chain. There are four common mechanisms by which most of these interactions are formed and alter the active site to create the enzyme-substrate complex: covalent catalysis, general acid-base catalysis, catalysis by approximation, and metal ion catalysis.

- Covalent catalysis occurs when one or multiple amino acids in the active site transiently form a covalent bond with the substrate. This reaction usually takes the form of an intermediate through a nucleophilic attack of the catalytic residues, which helps stabilize later transition states.

- General acid-base catalysis takes place when a molecule other than water acts as a proton donor or acceptor. Water can be one of the proton donors or acceptors in the reaction, but it cannot be the only one. This characteristic can sometimes help make catalytic residues better nucleophiles, so they will more easily attack substrate amino acids.

- Catalysis by approximation happens when two different substrates work together in the active site to form the enzyme-substrate complex. A common example of this involves water entering the active site to donate or receive a proton after a substrate has already bound to form better nucleophiles that can form and break bonds easier.

- Metal ion catalysis involves the participation of a metal ion at the active site of the enzyme, which can help make the attacking residue a better nucleophile and stabilize any negative charge in the active site.

Enzymes can be either be a single subunit or comprised of multiple subunits. The subunits in a multisubunit enzyme can sometimes work together in a mechanism called “cooperativity,” in which one subunit influences another for either positive, activity boosting effects or negative, inhibiting effects. Through cooperativity between subunits, an enzyme can either take on a T-state or an R-state. The T-state, or “tense” state, results in less affinity for binding substrate than regular state enzyme would. The R-state, or “relaxed” state, results in higher affinity and increased substrate binding for the enzyme as a whole. There are also two different models for the relationship between these two states of a multisubunit enzyme. The concerted model states that when an enzyme is in the T-state, if one subunit changes to the R-state, then all of the other subunits will change to the R-state at the same time, resulting in increased binding and affinity for other effectors. This model is also reversible, for if all subunits are in the R-state and an effector dissociates, then they will all go towards the T-state. On the other hand, the sequential model states that once one effector binds to one of the subunits, the rest of the subunit’s affinity for the effector increases, but they all do not necessarily change from one state to the other. They are merely more likely to change as well.
