Oxygen toxicity stimulates the development of histological changes in the lung.  This consists of pulmonary edema, congestion, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary injury.  Tissue examination reveals that surfactant interruption and epithelial injury initiate the expanded expression of cytokines that activate inflammatory cells.  The heightened release of oxygen free radicals modifies normal endothelial function. Microscopic examination at high magnification display the alveoli in the lung filled with smooth to slight floccular pink material characteristic of pulmonary edema and congestion.  The capillaries in the alveolar walls are congested with many red blood cells.
