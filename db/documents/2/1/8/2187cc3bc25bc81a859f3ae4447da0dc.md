Freiberg disease is an uncommon condition that may severely affect patients in regards to the quality of life and their level of activities, especially due to the young age of onset during the second or third decades of life. The etiology exact etiology is unknown but felt to be related to a multitude of factors. The diagnosis is made on clinical exam and confirmed with imaging, most commonly being radiographs.

An interprofessional team approach can be helpful for accurate and timely diagnosis, especially in the early stages. Most patients will initially seek care from primary care and be referred to a podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon. Foot and nail care and orthopedic nurses provide education and assist in the coordination of care. They report changes in status to the team. Radiologists can assist with the interpretation of radiographs, MRIs, or bone scans. Conservative therapy is the first line of treatment, and if the patient does not respond, then operative intervention may be considered. In the operative setting, anesthesiologists and registered nurses will also play a role in the patient's care. Ultimately, the goals of therapy are to prevent or slow progression to arthritis and clinical disability.
