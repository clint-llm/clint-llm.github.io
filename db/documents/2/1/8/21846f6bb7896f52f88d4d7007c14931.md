Many of the adverse effects of EDTA appear to occur in patients given high doses or with preexisting renal disease. Administration of calcium disodium edetate to patients requires monitoring of renal and hepatic function. These should be monitored before, during, and after administration. If patients become anuric or develop increasing creatinine levels, EDTA should be immediately discontinued. Additional urinalysis may be performed to assess for the presence of hematuria or proteinuria. It is also important to monitor zinc levels asÂ EDTA strongly binds to zinc.
