In addition to the history and physical exam, general lab tests will typically demonstrate signs of intravascular volume depletion from gastrointestinal volume losses along with extensive liver and renal lab abnormalities. Indirect identification of viral particles, proteins or RNA from blood, serum or plasma is used for diagnosis of filovirus infection with RNA nucleic acid amplification testing being the preferred method.  These tests confer a significant risk of lab-acquired infections and patient samples are an extreme biohazard risk and require special laboratory procedures. Definitive confirmation of infection is only by virus isolation. IgM testing can be diagnostic during the convalescent phase of illness and IgG is generally only monitored for epidemiologic surveillance. Rapid diagnostic tests were developed as a result of the 2016 Ebola outbreak with five tests approved for Ebola virus.  These tests utilize the same antibody/antigen capture as an ELISA test but are done in a lateral flow strip allowing faster results with less processing.  Rapid testing is critical in controlling outbreaks and preventing the spread of the virus.
