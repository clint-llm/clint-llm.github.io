Endometriomas are cystic lesions that stem from the disease process of endometriosis. Endometriomas are most commonly found in the ovaries. They are filled with dark brown endometrial fluid and are sometimes referred to as "chocolate cysts." The presence of endometriomas indicates a more severe stage of endometriosis. Endometriomas can lead to chronic pelvic pain and infertility and often require surgery for treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of endometriomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
