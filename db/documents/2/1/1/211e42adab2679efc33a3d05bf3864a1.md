The evaluation of papilledema points towards identifying the underlying etiology however initial workup should at least include contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits as well as magnetic resonance venography to respectively search for mass or venous sinus thrombosis.  If deemed safe after imaging to assess the risk of herniation, a lumbar puncture may be performed to document ICP by measuring opening pressure (in left lateral decubitus position: normal less than 25 cm H20). Cerebrospinal fluid studies to analyze protein, glucose, cell count and differential, and cultures are also diagnostic.

Formal perimetry should be performed to document and monitor for potential visual field loss.  Fluorescein angiography and B-scan ultrasound can also be utilized to identify other causes for disc edema or conditions which may resemble papilledema.
