Infection of C. psittaci begins with inhalation of aerosolized bacteria when exposed to secretions from infected birds. The infection begins in the upper respiratory tract and may persist as a prolonged asymptomatic condition of the mucosal surfaces. Infection of the mucosal membrane causes these cells to expose outer membrane proteins, which may promote a host immune response, leading to an autoimmune reaction and manifesting as atypical pneumonia.
