The differential diagnosis has been organized based on tissue types of the eyelid tissue.

**Epithelium**

**Pre-malignant Lesions**

- Actinic or solar keratosis (pre-malignant)

- Seborrheic keratosis

- Keratoacanthoma

- Cutaneous horn

**Malignant Lesions**

- Carcinoma in situ - Bowen disease (stage 0, non-invasive malignancy)

- Basal cell carcinoma

- 
              
- Nodular
              
              
- Noduloulcerative
              
              
- Pigmented
              
              
- Infiltrating

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Merkel cell carcinoma

**Melanocytes**

**Pre-malignant Lesions**

- Dysplastic nevus

- Large congenital nevi (over 20 cm in size) have an estimated 4 to 20% risk of malignant transformation.

- Blue nevus variants: Blue nevi in their pure histopathological form are benign. However, similar variants have transformation potential, as is the case in blue nevus-like melanoma.

- Oculodermal melanocytosis requires semi-annual monitoring for glaucoma and melanoma of the skin, iris, and choroid.

**Malignant Lesions**

- Melanoma

**Adnexal Lesions**

**Hair follicles**

- Malignant hair follicle tumor (a variant of BCC)

**Sweat glands**

- Malignant syringoma

- Mucinous sweat gland adenocarcinoma

- Gland of Moll adenosarcoma

**Sebaceous glands**

- Â Sebaceous carcinoma
