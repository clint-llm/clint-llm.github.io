HFI is caused by the deficiency of aldolase B, an isoenzyme that is expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestinal tissue, which is important in fructose metabolism. The enzyme catalyzes different reactions including cleavage of fructose-1-phosphate and reversible cleavage of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) into glyceraldehyde phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP).

The aldolase B gene is located on chromosome 9q22, and various mutations have been identified.
