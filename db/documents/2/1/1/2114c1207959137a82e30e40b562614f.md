While primary care physicians and nurse practitioners may prescribe physical therapy or a home exercise program for the treatment of back pain, the McKenzie method of Mechanical Diagnosis and therapy allows for the physical therapist to specifically target such back pain according to the classification obtained in their assessment. Although McKenzie exercises have become synonymous with spinal extension exercises, clinicians should be aware that the McKenzie method may involve exercises in any plane, depending on the patient's directional preference. This is very important because the goal of centralization depends on the directional preference of the individual. Although most patients favor spinal extension, there are, however, patients who favor spinal flexion instead. For these types of patients, the repetitive extension based exercises can possibly lead to peripheralization which is the worsening of distal referred pain from repetitive motion. In contrast to centralization, peripheralization does not carry a good prognosis and is to be avoided. It is thus vital for clinicians to form an accurate assessment of the directional preference rather than assuming a patient will favor extension and thereby proceeding with therapy based on that assumption. Overall, nurses and physicians should work in an interprofessional team with therapists to educate patients using these exercises to obtain the best outcomes. [Level V]
