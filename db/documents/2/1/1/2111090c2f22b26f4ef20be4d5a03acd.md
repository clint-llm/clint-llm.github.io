Homocysteine is an amino acid not supplied by the diet that can be converted into cysteine or recycled into methionine, an essential amino acid, with the aid of specific B vitamins. Homocysteine levels vary between men and women, with a normal range typically between 5 to 15 micromol/L. Hyperhomocysteinemia is when levels exceed 15 micromol/L.

When homocysteine levels are greater than normal limits, it signifies a disruption in the metabolism of homocysteine.

Homocysteine levels are generally categorized into three groups: moderate (16 to 30 micromol/L), intermediate (31 to 100 micromol/L), and severe (over 100 micromol/L).
