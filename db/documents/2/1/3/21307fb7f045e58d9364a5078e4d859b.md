Understanding the shoulder joint anatomy and biomechanics is essential for selecting the suitable prosthesis for shoulder arthroplasty and successful outcomes. The Shoulder joint complex includes four combined articulations: the acromioclavicular joint, the glenohumeral joint (GH), the sternoclavicular joint, and the scapulothoracic joint.

**The Glenohumeral (GH) Joint**

GH joint is a synovial multiaxial ball and socket articulation between the humeral head and the bony glenoid that permits a wide range of motion.

**Reverse Total Arthroplasty Biomechanics**

In the RTSA, the shoulder center of rotation is displaced inferiorly and medially. This modification in the center of rotation allows the deltoid muscle to work on a longer lever arm. This mechanical advantage allows more deltoid muscle fibers to act on shoulder abduction**.**Also, the downward humerus displacement increases the deltoid muscle tension.
