Patients should be given information on the components of the testing before the examination day. They should be instructed to take their medications and eat as they normally would on the examination day. Patients should bathe or cleanse skin before the examination and avoid applying any lotions or creams to the extremities.

On the day of the examination, the patient may dress in loose clothing or be asked to change into a gown to allow for better access to the proximal musculature. Attention to the room temperature and the temperature of the limbs are important as cool limbs can cause waveform changes that may lead to an incorrect diagnosis. A decrease in temperature can temporarily affect the protein configuration of the sodium channels on the nerve, causing a delay in the opening and closing of the channels. This can artificially increase the amplitude and decrease conduction velocity. Focal cooling of the extremities can cause delayed latency, decreased conduction velocity, and abnormally high amplitude, while a generalized cooling of limbs may cause prolonged latency and decreased conduction velocity with a normal amplitude. When this occurs, the clinician should adjust the room thermostat, warm the extremities with heat packs for several minutes, and repeat the examination.
