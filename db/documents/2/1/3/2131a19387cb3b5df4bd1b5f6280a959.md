Patients may experience similar symptoms after having meals in post-prandial hypotension.

Carotid sinus syndrome has carotid sinus hypersensitivity causing syncope, near-syncope, or unexplained falls. Like orthostatic hypotension, it is commoner in older peopleÂ and is hard to distinguish clinically. The two conditions may coexist as well. Tilt-table testing could help in distinguishing. This is carried out in a cardiology setting for patients having syncope of uncertain origin. Following is a concise list of differential diagnoses to be considered when suspecting orthostatic hypotension in a patient:

- Anemia

- Adrenal insufficient

- Cardiac arrhythmia

- Congestive heart failure

- Diabetes insipidus

- Hyperglycemia

- Hypokalemia

- Myocardial infarction

- myocarditis

- Pheochromocytoma
