SLAP lesions first gained recognition in the 1980s.  Over the last two decades, our knowledge and appreciation of SLAP tear recognition, diagnosis, treatment, and potential surgical management has evolved dramatically. There is an increasing body of literature evidence now recognizing that appropriate patient selection is critical. Management must consider a multitude of factors, including the patient’s age, activity level, sport-specific requirements, occupational demands, and expectations of a good to excellent outcome. An interprofessional team approach involving clinicians (including PAs and NPs), therapists, and orthopedically-trained nurses will provide the best results. [Level 2-3]
