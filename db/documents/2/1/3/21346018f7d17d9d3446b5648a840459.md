Simulation programs differ concerning resources, mission, and needs. However, there is a common set of core components needed in curricular development for the successful implementation of simulation.

Table 1. Essentials Elements of Curricular Design

- Perform a needs assessment and integrate interprofessional learning outcomes

- Incorporate learning models of each health care profession involved
- Gather data from all professions about practice or accreditation standards and performance gaps.
- Create mutual learning objectives, involving all professions, that are measurable and achievable
- Include one objective linked to teamwork

- Create appropriate interprofessional teams by aligning the level of the learners

- Provide appropriate balance as the learners interact
- Enhance communication and role clarity between each group
- Align the objectives with the content to which all learners have been exposed

- Integrate team concepts into simulation scenarios

- Utilize evidence-based teamwork tools to provide a framework
- Map each Sim-IPE activity to an IPEC competency.)
- Create scenarios where teamwork concepts are integral to successful patient care

- Develop Sim-IPE as a formative assessment to reinforce a collegial environment
- Avoid Sim-IPE as a high stakes summative assessment; this helps promote a safe learning environment.
- Focus on clinical and communication objectives instead of completing extensive checklists of summative assessments
