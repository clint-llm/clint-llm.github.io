Bupivacaine is offered in three different concentrations: 0.25%, 0.5%, and 0.75%.

Administration is by local infiltration (post-surgical analgesia), peripheral nerve blocks (dental or other minor surgical procedures, orthopedic surgery), spinal anesthesia (injected into the CSF to produce anesthesia for orthopedic surgery, abdominal surgery, or cesarean delivery), epidural anesthesia/analgesia for labor pain, and a caudal block (anesthesia and analgesia below the umbilicus, usually for pediatric surgery).

Adjuvants are often added to local anesthetics for nerve blocks to prolong the anesthetic effects compared to LA alone. Alpha 2 agonists such as clonidine or dexmedetomidine combined with the LA have been shown to increase the duration of anesthesia significantly.  Additionally, dexamethasone, when mixed with the local anesthetic for nerve blocks, has also been shown to increase the duration of anesthesia, although the mechanism is unclear as to whether it is a direct neural effect or simply the systemic effect of the steroid anti-inflammatory processes. With its N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist effects, magnesium has also been associated with a prolonged duration of action of local anesthetics for nerve blocks.  Studies are ongoing evaluating the effects of these and other potential adjuvants to LAs to prolong effectiveness while minimizing the risk of toxicity.

In the last decade, it has been shown that ultrasound-guided nerve blocks are associated with a decreased risk of local anesthetic toxicity.  Presumably, visualization of the nerve and surrounding structures decreases the likelihood of injection into a vascular structure and increases the early recognition of this occurrence, thereby lessening the possibility of reaching toxic levels of bupivacaine in the bloodstream.
