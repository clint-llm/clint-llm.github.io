Fascial dehiscence is a significant complication of abdominal surgery, particularly cases done in an emergent setting. Associated bowel obstructions and strangulation, or evisceration, present a considerable morbidity and mortality burden on the post-operative patient. This activity reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of fascial dehiscence, highlights the evaluation of suspected dehiscence, describes the management of confirmed dehiscence, and identifies interprofessional opportunity to enhance patient outcomes through early detection and intervention.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of fascial dehiscence.
- Review the evaluation of wound issues and drainage concerning possible dehiscence in the postoperative patient. 
- Describe the operative and nonoperative treatment modalities for patients following fascial dehiscence.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients experience fascial dehiscence.
