There are no specific laboratory blood tests that are ordered to diagnose subvalvular aortic stenosis.

Subaortic stenosis is diagnosed and confirmed using an echocardiogram.

The echocardiogram helps characterize and assess the following:

- The extent of the involvement of the left ventricular outflow tract

- The integrity of the aortic and mitral valves

- Definition and location of the subaortic valve stenosis

- The degree of left ventricular hypertrophy

- Post-stenotic aortic dilatation

- Filling characteristics

- Associated congenital heart defects

- The function of the left ventricle

However, the degree of obstruction of outflow in subvalvular aortic stenosis on a 2-dimensional echocardiogram is difficult to assess, and for this reason, Doppler imaging is indicated.

Two-dimensional echocardiography and three-dimensional echocardiography helps in evaluating the positions of the lesions, the extent of involvement of the left ventricular outflow tract and the associated defects

In some cases, the hypertrophied ventricular septum obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract may conceal the presence of the subaortic membrane. In such cases, transesophageal echocardiography is more reliable for the accurate diagnosis of the subaortic membrane and to distinguish subvalvular aortic stenosis from the hypertrophied ventricular septum.

**Other Tests**

Electrocardiogram:  ECG reveals a varying degree of left ventricular hypertrophy in 50% to 80% of patients. The presence of a prominent Q wave in the left precordial leads may indicate septal hypertrophy. ECG findings may be normal in patients with severe subvalvular aortic stenosis.

Chest radiograph: The chest radiograph is often normal. Some patients, including those with mild stenosis, have mild cardiomegaly or LV prominence.

Cardiac catheterization: Cardiac catheterization is not routinely indicated in isolated subvalvular aortic stenosis. If multiple levels of obstruction are suspected, it is frequently performed to interpret the extent of subaortic obstruction further. Catheterization provides both hemodynamic and anatomic data, such as the measurement of cardiac output, the gradient across the valve, and estimates of the degree of aortic regurgitation. Associated lesions, such as aortic coarctation, can be observed. It is not indicated in the diagnosis of subvalvular aortic stenosis but can be utilized as a part of a preoperative workup to rule out significant coronary artery disease.
