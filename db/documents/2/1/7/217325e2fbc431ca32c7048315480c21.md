A range of empirically supported exposure-based treatment options is available in the management of school refusal. Treatments include cognitive behavior therapy, educational-support therapy, pharmacotherapy, and sometimes parent-teacher interventions. Providers may provide psychoeducational support for the child and parents, monitor medications, and help with a referral to more intensive psychotherapy. A younger child may display minor symptoms of fear, anxiety, and depression and may work directly with parents, the school personnel may help the child get over their fears, and there may not be a need for other intervention. Child therapy with parents and school staff may be indicated if the child's difficulties include comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, prolonged school absence, or deficits in social skills. Behavior treatments include relaxation training, systematic desensitization (that is graded exposure to the school environment), emotive imagery, social skills training, and contingency management. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a very structured strategy where a therapist offers specific instructions for children to enable and gradually increase their exposure to the school environment. In CBT, children are encouraged to confront their fears, and they are taught how to modify negative thoughts.

The provider may choose to focus on a psychologist who practices CBT. CBT provides solutions to current problems and provides tools to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. The treating physician may also consider a therapist who is trained in exposure-response therapy (ERP). ERP focuses on gradual exposures to anxiety-inducing stimuli and situations. It is usually performed in the most anxiety-producing situations so that the individual can confidently proceed in the therapy. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is also effective in treating anxiety and school refusal. It is based on 4 skill modules which include 2 sets of acceptance-oriented skills (mindfulness and distress tolerance) and 2 sets of change-oriented skills (emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness). Treatment addresses comorbid psychiatric problems, family dysfunction, and other contributing problems. If a child who refuses to go to school has presented with physical symptoms, the physician should explain that signs of physical illnesses are the manifestation of psychological distress rather than a physical illness. A collaborative team approach with multimodal facilities which include the physician, child, parents, school staff, and other mental health professionals should be applied. Physicians should avoid writing a non-judicial excuse note for children to stay out of school unless a medical condition makes it mandatory for them to stay home.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have replaced tricyclic antidepressants as the first-line pharmacologic treatment for anxiety disorders in children. Although there are few controlled, double-blind studies of SSRI use in children; the data suggest that SSRIs are effective and safe in the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. Clinically, SSRIs are used frequently used to treat school refusal. Sertraline can be started at an initial dose of 12.5 to 25 mg per day for a minimum of 7 days and titrated up to 50 mg per day in increments of 12.5 mg (child) or 25 to 50 mg (adolescent) per week. If adequate clinical response is not seen after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment, subsequent trials should be tried following dose increases of 12.5 mg per day for children and 25 to 50 mg per day for adolescents to a maximum of 200 mg per day.

Benzodiazepines can be used on a short-term basis for children with severe school refusal. Benzodiazepine may be added with an SSRI to target acute symptoms of anxiety. It should be discontinued once the SSRI has had time to produce beneficial effects as there is a risk for addiction and side effects. There are many side effects of benzodiazepines such as sedation, behavior disinhibition, crankiness, and cognitive impairment that should keep in mind. Clonazepam can be started at 0.25 mg per day. The dose can then be increased to 0.5 mg per day if well-tolerated; further increases are based on response and tolerability. Lorazepam can be started at 0.25 mg per day. Maintenance daily dose can be increased to 8 mg per day if well-tolerated. Because of the side effects and risk of dependence, benzodiazepines, if used, should be used for only a few weeks.
