The first human larynx can be traced to the primitive pharyngeal floor, in the first four weeks of intrauterine life, as a longitudinal notch, known as the laryngotracheal groove. This groove will eventually form the esophagotracheal septum around the fifth week of embryonic life, with the respiratory system anteriorly and the esophagus lying on the dorsal side.

The connective tissue, smooth muscles, and cartilages that will form the larynx arise from splanchnic mesenchyme located ventral to the foregut. The larynx cartilages develop from the third, fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches. In this period, primitive glottis has a T-shaped form, as a result of some paired arytenoid swellings, produced by the proliferation of the mesenchyme, that will reduce the laryngeal lumen to a small opening. The laryngeal epithelium quickly develops, and temporary obliterates the laryngeal lumen, and become re-canalized in the tenth week when the epithelium breaks up. The future vocal cords from by a pair lateral depressions joined to the anterioposterior folds of the mucous membrane.
