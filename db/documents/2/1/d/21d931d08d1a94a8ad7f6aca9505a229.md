Riboflavin, vitamin B2, is a heat-stable, water-soluble vitamin that the body uses to metabolize carbohydrates, fats, and protein into glucose for energy. In addition to boosting energy, this vitamin functions as an antioxidant for the proper functioning of the immune system, healthy skin, and hair. In riboflavin deficiency, macronutrients like fats, carbohydrates, and proteins cannot be digested to maintain the body. Riboflavin is necessary for normal development, lactation, physical performance, and reproduction. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of riboflavin deficiency and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of riboflavin deficiency.
- Describe the workup of a patient with riboflavin deficiency.
- Summarize the treatment options for riboflavin deficiency.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to educate the patients on the importance of riboflavin for normal development, lactation, physical performance, and reproduction to enhance the delivery of care for those with riboflavin deficiency.
