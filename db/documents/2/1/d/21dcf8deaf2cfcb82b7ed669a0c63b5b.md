In a myelogram, megaloblastosis presents as large red blood cells (megaloblasts) and hypersegmented neutrophils, which are detectable in a peripheral blood smear.  Poikilocytosis and anisocytosis are common due to ineffective erythropoiesis. The bone marrow evaluation shows hypercellularity with abnormal maturation and proliferation of red cell precursors. Erythroblasts show a failure of nuclei maturation, maintaining open or lax chromatin and normal mature cytoplasm.
