G-protein coupled receptors and G-proteins are prevalent throughout the human body and are involved in a wide range of physiological functions. Mutations in these proteins can lead to a variety of diseases including retinitis pigmentosa and cholera. Retinitis pigmentosa, caused by a mutation in a GPCR, is an eye disease in which the retina is damaged. People with this disease have blurred vision and.or difficulty seeing in low light conditions. This eye disease is an inherited disorder, and there is no treatment. Wearing sunglasses can protect the vision that remains. There are over one thousand different GPCRs in the human body.

The G-protein itself can also be affected, and it need not be genetic. Cholera is caused by a bacteria that multiplies within the human intestine and secretes a protein called cholera toxin. This toxin penetrates the cells that line the intestine and modifies the G protein. The alpha subunit, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase, is the subunit modified. This modification prevents GTP hydrolysis and locks the G-protein in the active state. The constant stimulation of adenylyl cyclase results in a prolonged and excessive outflow of chloride ions and water into the gut. This leads to severe diarrhea and dehydration. This can quickly lead to death, so water and ions should be replenished as fast as possible. Treatment consists of rehydration and antibiotics.
