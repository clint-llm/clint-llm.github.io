Fournier gangrene, a relatively rare form of necrotizing fasciitis, is a rapidly progressive disease that affects the deep and superficial tissues of the perineal, anal, scrotal, and genital regions. The disease is one of the few urological emergencies and requires prompt surgical debridement as well as antibiotic therapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

- Identify the etiology of Fournier gangrene.
- Describe the typical presentation of patients suffering from Fournier gangrene.
- Identify the treatment and management of Fournier gangrene.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Fournier gangrene and improve outcomes.
