Laboratory evaluation rarely helps in guiding the diagnosis or treatment of dyspareunia. However, It is better to rule out other abnormalities to reach the exact diagnosis. Since the pain in the vulvodynia is similar to dyspareunia, it is better to rule this out by performing a cotton swab test during the vulvar examination.

Further tests can include pelvic cultures for gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, Candida, and Gardnerella are indicated when women present with vaginal or cervical discharge. Genital ulcers can be testing performed for herpes simplex, syphilis, or appropriate culture. Women with associated dysuria, urgency, frequency or suprapubic discomfort should receive a urinalysis. Visible lesions noted on physical exam should undergo tissue biopsy.
