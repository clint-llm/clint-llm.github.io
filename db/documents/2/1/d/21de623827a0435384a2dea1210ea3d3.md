A patient who has retrognathia from mandibular AP hypoplasia will enter the treatment planning phase of their case during the first visit with the orthodontist. The orthodontist because will plan treatment years into the future and make movement and teeth extraction decisions based on skeletal growth and facial characteristics. Once the patient is ready for surgical correction, they will be referred to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. A full series of photos and dental models are generally taken along with radiographs and a full workup completed and discussed with the treatment team, orthodontist, and patient. At this point, the surgical options are presented to the patient, and a surgical course decided upon. The standard workup and planning involving all proposed surgeries be completed on dental models and precise movements documented. Acrylic splints are then fabricated for use in the stabilization of the teeth and bones for rigid internal fixation during surgery. More common over the last decade is virtual surgical planning, where a computed tomography (CT) scan and patient models are digitally merged, and the operation is virtually planned within 0.01 mm; final surgical splints are custom printed on a 3D printer.
