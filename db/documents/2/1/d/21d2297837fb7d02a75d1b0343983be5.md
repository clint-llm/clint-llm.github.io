Many patients with DAAÂ have earlier presentations as compared to patients with other types of Vascular rings, most of them presenting in early infancy and almost all of them before three years of age.

In patients with a RAA with aberrant (retro-esophageal) left subclavian artery, it is considered a "looser ring" than a DAA. These patients usually have more problems with dysphagia. When they are babies, they can take milk easily. However, once they start taking solid foods, that is where the symptoms arrive. Many of these patients are not diagnosed until the teenage years when the guardians complain that the patient is the last to leave the dinner table. This is because the patient is chewing their food so that they can swallow without it hurting. Most do not realize that they are doing that.
