Post-mortem examination discloses extensive inflammation and necrosis predominantly involving roots and cords in patients with HIV-associated polyradiculopathy. Focal congestion, edema, and polymorphonuclear cell infiltrates are seen in necrotic regions. Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies are evident in the cells of necrotic lesions in the subarachnoid spaces and Schwann cells due to CMV infection in HIV-positive patients.
