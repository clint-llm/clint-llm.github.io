**Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES)**

The upper esophageal sphincter is a high-pressure area that lies between the pharynx and the upper part of the esophagus. It consists of a mixture of cartilages and muscles that give the sphincter high elastic and tonic properties. The unique composition also allows the sphincter to maintain the capacity to open wide in response to a stimulus. The UES functions to block food from regurgitating back into the airways. It also prevents air from reaching the gastrointestinal tract in significant amounts. The cricoid cartilage and the arytenoid and inter arytenoid muscles make up the anterior parts of the sphincter. The thyropharyngeus and the cricopharyngeus muscles form the majority of the sphincter's posterior and lateral walls, with the former accounting for the upper two-thirds of the sphincter and the latter occupying the lower one-third. Contraction of the hyoid muscle that pulls the larynx forwards, combined with the relaxation of the cricopharyngeus and the thyropharyngeus, causes the sphincter to open wide.

Once the food bolus reaches the oropharynx, it stimulates sensory receptors there. The receptors then transmit the signal to the swallowing center in the brainstem via afferent nerve fibers. In turn, the brainstem processes the message and sends efferent fibers to smooth muscle cells in the UES. The cricopharyngeus and the thyropharyngeus muscles relax in return, and the food bolus passes the UES.

Efferent signals also stimulate the hyoid muscle to contract, leading to elevation of the hyoid. Hyoid muscle contraction happens almost simultaneously with the relaxation of the UES. Together, with the propulsion force of the bolus, these three forces allow the food bolus to overcome the pressure in the UES region and pass into the esophagus.

The volume of the bolus also plays an essential role in mediating the physiology of the UES. It dictates the duration between UES opening and pharyngeal movement. A higher volume results in a faster onset of pharyngeal movements. Additionally, increasing the thickness of the bolus increases the time differential between the opening of the UES and pharyngeal movements.

**Peristalsis**

Once the bolus passes through the UES, it reaches the esophagus. The upper portion of the esophagus mainly consists of striated muscles and is under the control of central control mechanisms. The lower part of the esophagus consists primarily of smooth muscle and is under the control of both central and intrinsic control mechanisms. Central control mechanisms refer to peristaltic movements originating from the brainstem, as in the case of the swallowing reflex. In contrast, peripheral control mechanisms refer to peristaltic movements originating from the esophagus itself and are intrinsic to the smooth muscles owing to their rich nerve plexuses.

The esophagus consists of four different layers: the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and serosa. The muscle layer, also known as the muscularis propria, further divides into an outer longitudinal and an inner circular muscular layer. The exact role of longitudinal muscles in esophageal physiology is not entirely understood. Recent studies have shown that longitudinal muscles help in reducing the tension associated with circular muscle contractions, which serves to augment peristaltic movements. In contrast, the role of circular muscle fibers in esophageal physiology is well defined. Circular muscles contract radially to provide peristaltic propulsion of the bolus in the distal direction.

As the food bolus enters the esophagus, it triggers primary peristalsis. Primary peristalsis refers to bolus-induced esophageal contractions. In contrast, secondary peristalsis refers to distension-induced contractions. In peristalsis, the area ahead of the bolus relaxes, and the area behind it contracts, enabling the bolus to propel forward. A series of nervous inputs allow for coordinated action between contractions and relaxations, leading to a smooth movement of food along the esophagus.

Primary peristalsis in the esophagus is a complex process mediated by central control mechanisms originating from the brainstem. Upon swallowing, striated muscles in the upper esophagus respond in a slightly different manner than smooth muscles in the lower esophagus. In striated muscles, lower motor neurons in the nucleus ambiguous of the brainstem get activated sequentially to create a peristaltic wave. In smooth muscles, though, inhibitory neurons from the caudal dorsal motor nucleus (cDMN) get activated and cause simultaneous inhibition of all parts of the esophagus. This simultaneous inhibition in the smooth muscle of the esophagus is termed "deglutitive inhibition" and is the first step to generating a peristaltic wave. The inhibition lasts longer in the lower portion of the esophagus than the upper parts. As the inhibition ends, sequential activation of excitatory neurons in the rostral dorsal motor nucleus (rDMN) elicits peristaltic contraction.

The excitatory pathway in smooth muscles originates from vagal preganglionic neurons of the rostral part of the DMN (rDMN). The DMN is a vagal nerve nucleus located in the medulla that lies ventral to the floor of the fourth ventricle. The rDMN preganglionic neurons attach to the excitatory postganglionic neurons that release acetylcholine (ACh) and substance P. The inhibitory pathway, on the other hand, includes preganglionic vagal fibers in the cDMN. These fibers project to postganglionic inhibitory neurons that contain nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and substance P (SP).

Interestingly, the esophagus can also undergo secondary peristalsis, which is a process orchestrated by the intrinsic nervous system and vaso-vagal responses when there is leftover food in the esophagus. Secondary peristalsis usually occurs in the absence of a swallow. It can have the same strength and speed as the primary peristalsis.

**LES**

Once the bolus arrives at the end of the esophagus, it must pass through the LES to reach the stomach. The LES and the crural diaphragm constitute a high-pressure zone separating the esophagus from the stomach. They function as an anti-reflux barrier that protects the esophagus from the acidity and digestive properties of gastric juice. They also allow for the passage of the bolus into the stomach.

The LES consists of smooth muscles that help keep the sphincter tightly closed. In response to direct inhibitory signals, the smooth muscles in the LES relax, allowing the sphincter to open, and the food bolus to pass. The LES does not posses any dilator muscles, though, and opening relies solely on the relaxation of the smooth muscles.

The pressure in the LES depends on a combination of three factors: the myogenic tone of the smooth muscles, the inhibitory nitrergic nerves, and the excitatory cholinergic nerves. The myogenic tone is an intrinsic property of the smooth muscle cells in the LES and is responsible for the tonic contraction of the sphincter. It happens because the LES smooth muscle cells have more depolarized resting membrane potentials, resulting in spontaneous spike-like action potentials and generation of a basal tone. Excitatory cholinergic nerves (ACh) release acetylcholine to activate smooth muscle contraction. As such, they enhance the tonic, myogenic property of the LES, and favor contraction. In contrast, the inhibitory nitrergic (NO) pathway releases NO and favors inhibition. Therefore, it opposes the contractile properties of the LES. The combination of these forces favors contraction over relaxation. Thus, the LES remains contracted even when entirely denervated owing to its myogenic property.

The presence of a bolus in the pharynx induces esophageal peristalsis and LES relaxation by stimulating pharyngeal receptors that relay signals to the brainstem. The sensory stimulus travels to the nucleus tractus solitarius, which connects with the DMN. The vagal efferent nerves from the DMN do not innervate the smooth muscles directly. Instead, they signal the myenteric plexus, which mediates LES relaxation through nitric oxide (NO). The myenteric plexus consists of inhibitory and excitatory motor neurons. The location of the stimulus dictates whether an inhibitory or excitatory action takes place. The inhibitory pathway neurons arise from the caudal DMN, while the excitatory pathway neurons arise from the rostral DMN. Nitric oxide (NO) is the most critical inhibitory postganglionic neurotransmitter. In contrast, ACh and tachykinin are crucial excitatory ones.

In addition to its stimulus-triggered relaxation, the LES also relaxes transiently to allow for gas venting from the stomach. Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (TLESR) is an essential physiological mechanism the LES possesses.

As mentioned earlier, the high-pressure zone between the esophagus and the stomach consists of a combination of smooth muscles of the LES and the crural diaphragm. The crural diaphragm plays an essential role in allowing for the passage of a food bolus into the stomach just as smooth muscle relaxation does. It also helps in regulating the rate of reflux into the esophagus. It connects to the LES by the phrenoesophageal ligament, meaning that the two structures move together during breathing but can separate during peristalsis and transient LES relaxation.
