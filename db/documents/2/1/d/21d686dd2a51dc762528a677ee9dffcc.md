Studies in populations without diabetes have shown that blood glucose, and plasma insulin levels remain steady through the night, with only a small increase in insulin secretion before dawn, which serves to achieve supression of the hepatic glucose production. Hyperglycemia is prevented by this physiologic surge of insulin. Hence, the dawn phenomenon does not occur in patients without diabetes because they can secrete normal amounts of insulin to prevent it. In patients without diabetes growth hormone exerts insulin-antagonistic effects.
