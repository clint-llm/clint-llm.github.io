The most common manifestation of Kaposi sarcoma is the skin lesion; however, in some cases, it can affect multiple organs and systems of the body. Hence the presentation depends on the system involved.**Skin:**Lesions that are usually colored (red, brown, or purple) and have a variety of dermatological presentations described as a patch, plaque, or a nodule. Ulcerated skin lesions can be painful and, however, high risk of cellulitis, given the vascular obstruction that can also occur from the lesions. Edema is a common complication; lesions around the eye may cause periorbital and facial swelling as well as the destruction of vision in severe cases.**Gastrointestinal:**Intestinal lesions may be asymptomatic, cause abdominal discomfort, bloody stools, weight loss, constipation, and intestinal obstruction.**Pulmonary:**lesions will be associated with respiratory symptoms like cough, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis.
