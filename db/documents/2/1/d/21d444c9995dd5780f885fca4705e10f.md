Delirium may be due to exacerbation of a primary injury or insult, or a potential new secondary insult or injury. Several studies have tried to identify risk factors predisposing to the development of delirium postoperatively.

DSM-5 categorizes delirium as:

- Substance Intoxication delirium

- Substance withdrawal delirium

- Medication-induced delirium

- Delirium because of other medical conditions

- Delirium because of other etiologies

POD should be considered a separate category. The post-operative period is the time period right after surgery until the patient is discharged from the hospital. POD should not be diagnosed separately from emergence delirium although any lucid interval after emergence delirium should be noted.

Factors that can predispose or precipitate post-operative delirium can be broadly divided into preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative causes.

**Pre-Operative Factors**

- Age over 65 years

- Male gender

- Baseline cognitive dysfunction

- Dementia

- Preoperative memory complaint

- Anxiety

- Depression

- Benzodiazepine use

- Intracranial stenosis

- Carotid stenosis

- Peripheral vascular disease

- Prior stroke/transient ischemic attacks

- Sensory impairments

- Diabetes mellitus

- Hypertension

- Atrial fibrillation

- Electrolyte abnormalities

- Alcohol abuse

- Sleep deprivation

- Smoking

**Intraoperative Factors**

- Hip surgery

- Cardiac surgery

- Vascular surgery

- Open greater than endovascular surgery

- Emergency surgery

- Increased Surgical duration

- Hypotension

- Shock

- Arrhythmias

- Hypothermia/hyperthermia

- Blood Transfusion

**Postoperative Factors**

- Low hemoglobin

- Hypoxemia

- Prolonged intubation

- Pain

- Hypoalbuminemia

- Liver failure

- Renal failure (BUN/Cr greater than 18)

- Sleep-wake disturbances

Alcohol and benzodiazepine withdrawal have also been known to cause POD.
