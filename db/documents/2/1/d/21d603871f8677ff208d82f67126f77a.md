# Definition/Introduction

Obesity is a complex medical disease and a significant public health issue in the United States as it has become a worsening epidemic. Obesity is defined by the body mass index (BMI), which is calculated using one’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of one’s height (in meters). According to the BMI classification, a BMI equal to or greater than 25 is overweight, and a value equal to or greater than 30 is obese.

# Issues of Concern

Disease stigmas result from misconceptions and biases that exacerbate suffering on individuals with diseases, such as HIV and AIDs. The weight stigma is prevalent among the media, schools, workplaces, and even healthcare settings.

# Clinical Significance

The stigma and prejudice towards obese persons have significant implications for adverse physical and psychological outcomes.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Healthcare professionals need to address the weight stigma and need to be adequately educated about obesity, ensuring biological and environmental factors are evaluated as factors hindering an individual's weight loss.

In conclusion, it is essential the obesity stigma is addressed by all domains of society, but particularly by health care professionals, to ensure the health care of obese individuals is not negatively impacted by weight discrimination.
