Hydroxyapatite deposition disease is a common clinical entity that sometimes presents with joint pain. Shoulder pain is one of the most common causes of presentations in the primary care setting. This activity outlines and explains the role of ultrasound-guided barbotage in treating hydroxyapatite deposition in the rotator cuff tendons. This activity also highlights the steps involved in this procedure and elaborates on some of the interprofessional team's technical factors involved in procedural success.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the steps involved in performing an ultrasound-guided barbotage procedure of the rotator cuff tendons in patients with crystalline-related shoulder pain.

- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with hydroxyapatite deposition disease in various imaging modalities.

- Explain and elaborate the steps involved in proper technique when performing an ultrasound-guided shoulder barbotage.
- Review basic knowledge and general expectations of an ultrasound-guided barbotage to help in the appropriate management of patients by an interprofessional team.
