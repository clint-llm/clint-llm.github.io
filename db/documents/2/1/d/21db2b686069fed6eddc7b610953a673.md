Famciclovir first converts into its active antiviral agent, penciclovir. The viral thymidine kinase (TK) present in cells infected with HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella-zoster virus, phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form. Penciclovir is unable to be phosphorylated in uninfected cells and is thus selective towards virally infected cells. Further, the host cellular enzymes subsequently convert penciclovir monophosphate to triphosphate form. The penciclovir triphosphate competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate; this inhibits the herpes virus DNA polymerase and results in chain termination, and ultimately terminates viral replication.
