Choking or foreign body airway obstruction occurs when an object partially or completely obstructs the passage of air exchange between the upper airway and the trachea. Choking can be seen in individuals of any age, however, it tends to occur with the greatest frequency in either the very young or the elderly population. In the very young, the foreign body is often food, a toy, a coin, or even a battery, whereas in the elderly it is almost always food.
