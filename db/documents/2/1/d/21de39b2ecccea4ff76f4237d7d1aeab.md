As discussed above, complications following an SCI with prolonged neurological deficits can have multiple systemic complications. They include pressure sores, VTE, sepsis, pneumonia, urinary complications, bowel complications, and cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular complications are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both acute and chronic stages of SCI.

Aside from systemic vascular complications of spinal shock, functional disability as a result of spinal injury is a major complication of spinal shock and is a primary determinant of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The data regarding motor axonal excitability is limited, and clear prognostic indicators of functional recovery have not been identified as yet. Some studies reported the existence of significant deterioration in peripheral motor axonal excitability and function in early spinal shock.
