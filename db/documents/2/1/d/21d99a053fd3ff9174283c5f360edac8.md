Patients should be informed that sialolithiasis has an excellent prognosis and resolve with conservative management in most cases. Patients require education on common initial symptoms such as glandular swelling and pain with meals that suggest they have formed a new sialolith. While sialolithiasis is usually idiopathic, the formation of stones can be secondary to an obstructing process such as ductal stenosis or neoplasm. Patients should be educated about the need to inform their clinician of recurrent or worsening symptoms that would indicate a need for a more advanced imaging workup or referral to a head and neck specialist.
