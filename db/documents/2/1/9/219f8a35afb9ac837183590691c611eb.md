Although hamartomas are usually benign, they should be monitored continuously for malignant potential. The interprofessional healthcare team is generally necessary due to the complex and diverse presentation of patients. This interprofessional team includes primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs) who might first discover the hamartoma incidentally during an examination for other problems or as a chief complaint, an oncologist to verify the diagnosis and determine the prognosis, and the nursing staff who can assist in patient evaluation, counsel the patient, and serve as liaisons between the various healthcare disciplines involved in the case. All interprofessional team members must maintain meticulous records of each interaction or intervention with the patient.

A screening program should be in place for earlier detection to achieve better outcomes. Good communication, along with detailed and smooth information sharing, are essential components for better outcomes. Interprofessional care must involve an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluating these cases.
