Hyphema is the collection of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye.

The most common cause of hyphema is blunt trauma, though spontaneous hyphemas can occur in the setting of sickle cell disease or other increased bleeding states.

Hyphemas are graded based on the degree ofÂ blood obscuring the cornea.

Once an open globe has been ruled out, intraocular pressure should be checked and treated if greater than 21 mm Hg.

All patients with hyphema require ophthalmology consultation.

Any patient with greater than grade II hyphema, elevated intraocular pressure, sickle cell disease, bleeding dyscrasias, coagulopathy, or unable to comply with daily ophthalmology evaluations should be admitted.

Re-bleeding will occur in about 30% of patients and may require surgical clot evacuation.
