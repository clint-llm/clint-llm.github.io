Patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery should be informed that adhesions are a possible consequence and can have an association with long-term complications. Patients should be educated on the signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction and told to present for evaluation if any of these are present - particularly obstipation, nausea/vomiting, abdominal distension, and abdominal pain.
