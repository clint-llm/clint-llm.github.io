The most common scenario is one where the patient is outside, in the yard or the woods, and is standing on or near an ant nest. Disrupting the nest causes a large number of ants to swarm and attack. However, the imported fire ant can attack with little warning. The ants will swarm and repeatedly sting the lower body. The most common reaction is a wheal and flare, which is a lesion that has resembles a hive but also is surrounded by erythema. The stings are very painful and cause intense itching. A second lesion that can result is a sterile pustule that develops within the first 24 hours and is filled with yellow fluid. They are sterile and are the result of the venom alkaloids lasting for about one week. A large, local reaction, typically over 10cm in diameter, may occur which has a pustule on top of a painful inflamed and swollen area. Lastly, anaphylaxis is possible. However, these reactions typically occur in those who have been stung by an ant or a yellow jacket once before as its venom is known to cross-react with the Solenopsis venom in vitro.
