Labyrinthitis is often secondary to another infection, such as otitis media or meningitis. Therefore early diagnosis and effective management of these should prevent the development of labyrinthitis or at least minimize the risk of long-term complications. It is also key that populations are up to date with their vaccinations to reduce the risk of contracting measles, mumps, or rubella. Patients with vertigo should be encouraged to attempt mobilizing as soon as possible, as this is believed to help with vestibular compensation and prognosis.

Ménière disease is suspected if the patient experiences loss of hearing in one ear with attacks of vertigo which last from several minutes to several hours, and tinnitus. Patients who experience these symptoms must seek consultation with their general practitioner or the emergency department.

In the cases of BPPV, it is best to explain that it is a non-life-threatening condition. Its favorable prognosis reassures patients that it is not a severe condition. Patients should also be warned that recurrences are very common even after successful management with repositioning maneuvers so that further treatment may be necessary.
