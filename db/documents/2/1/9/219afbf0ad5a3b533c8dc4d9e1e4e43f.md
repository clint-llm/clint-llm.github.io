There is no consensus on how to best treat an already formed neuroma.

For an already formed neuroma, there is also a  range of treatments. There are simple methods such as ice packs, elevation, and rest to reduce swelling. A variety of pharmacological therapies would include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local anesthetic creams or injections, or intralesional steroid injections. Unfortunately, often, the pain is resistant to most pharmacological analgetic methods.

The neuroma can be injected with phenol or dehydrated alcohol under ultrasound guidance sclerosing the lesion.
