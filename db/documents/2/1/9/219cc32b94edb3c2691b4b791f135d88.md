Most commonly, SIADH occurs secondary to another disease process elsewhere in the body. Hereditary SIADH, also known as nephrogenic SIADH, has been ascribed to the gain of function mutation in vasopressin 2 (V2) receptors in the kidneys.

**Conditions Frequently Leading to SIADH**

**Central nervous system disturbances:**Any central nervous system (CNS) abnormality can enhance ADH-release from the pituitary gland, leading to SIADH. These disorders include stroke, hemorrhage, infection, trauma, mental illness, and psychosis.

**Malignancies:**Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common tumor leading to ectopic ADH production. Less commonly, extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, head and neck cancers, and olfactory neuroblastomas also cause ectopic ADH release.

**Drugs:** A number of drugs associated with SIADH act by enhancing the release or effect of ADH. The most common drugs include carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, chlorpropamide, cyclophosphamide, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine act in part by increasing the sensitivity to ADH. Chlorpropamide increases the number of V2 receptors in collecting tubules. As high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide is given with a fluid load to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, SIADH in such patients is a particular problem, leading to potentially fatal hyponatremia. SSRIs cause SIADH by an unknown mechanism, but people above 65 years of age are more at risk. "Ecstasy" (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a drug of abuse, is particularly associated with the direct release of ADH. (It also stimulates thirst, which further worsens hyponatremia.) Less commonly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opiates, interferons, methotrexate, vincristine, vinblastine, ciprofloxacin, haloperidol, and high dose imatinib have been linked with SIADH.

**Surgery:**Surgical procedures are often associated with hypersecretion of ADH, a response that is probably mediated by pain afferents.

**Pulmonary disease:**Pulmonary diseases, particularly pneumonia (viral, bacterial, tuberculous), can lead to SIADH by unknown mechanisms. A similar response has infrequently been seen in patients with asthma, atelectasis, acute respiratory failure, and pneumothorax.

**Hormone deficiency:**Both hypopituitarism and hypothyroidism may be accompanied by hyponatremia and a SIADH picture that can be corrected by hormone replacement.

**Hormone administration**: SIADH can be induced by exogenous hormone administration, as with vasopressin (to control gastrointestinal bleeding), desmopressin (dDAVP, to treat von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, or platelet dysfunction), and oxytocin (to induce labor). All three act by increasing the activity of the vasopressin-2 (V2; antidiuretic) receptors.

**Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection:**A common laboratory manifestation seen in HIV infection, either with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or early symptomatic HIV infection, is hyponatremia. It can be due to SIADH, or it can be due to volume depletion, secondary to adrenal insufficiency or gastrointestinal losses. Pneumonia, due to Pneumocystis carinii or other organisms and CNS infections by opportunistic pathogens, is also responsible for SIADH.

**Hereditary SIADH:**A gain of function mutation in the gene for the renal V2 receptors (located on the X chromosome) is responsible for hereditary SIADH. Such mutation locks the renal V2 receptors in a continuous active state, leading to excessive water absorption and hyponatremia, which in turn is resistant to vasopressin receptor antagonists.
