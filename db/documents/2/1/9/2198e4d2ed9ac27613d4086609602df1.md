Klippel Trenaunay syndromeÂ has a wide spectrum of clinical findings, and the prognosis is related to the severity of vascular malformations. The malformations progress over time with ongoing overgrowth and worsening venous insufficiency. Acute bleeding from GI malformation can lead to exsanguinating blood loss with mortality risk if not promptly treated. Recurrent deep venous thrombosis leads to the risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be massive and fatal.
