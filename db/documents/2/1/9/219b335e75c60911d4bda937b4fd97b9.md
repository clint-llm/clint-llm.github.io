The SMAS (superficial musculoaponeurotic system) plication face lifting technique evolved to provide an effective means of suspending the soft tissues of the face beyond simply tightening the skin. Developed by Swedish plastic surgeon Tord Skoog in the 1970s, it has become increasingly popular as a facial rejuvenation option. Several variations of the technique have been described. Plication is the folding of the SMAS with subsequent suturing to apply tension; imbrication is the removal of a segment of SMAS with overlapping of the cut edges and closure of the defect serving to resuspend the tissue. SMAS flap facelift techniques are generally performed as outpatient procedures and are easily taught to trainees. This activity reviews the SMAS plication facelift procedure, its indications, and contraindications and highlights the interprofessional team's role in patient selection and management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of the SMAS plication facelift.
- Summarize the indications for SMAS plication facelifting.
- Review the complications of SMAS plication facelifting.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination within the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients undergoing SMAS plication facelifting.
