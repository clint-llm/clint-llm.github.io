The exact etiological cause of Morton neuroma is not known, but four major hypotheses have been described. The chronic trauma theory, the most widely accepted hypothesis, states that the mechanical effects of walking cause chronic micro-traumas to the intermetatarsal plantar digital nerves, which become compressed between two metatarsal heads and the metatarsophalangeal joints.

The entrapment theory, one of the earliest proposed theories, states that interdigital neuromas occur due to compression of the interdigital nerve against the anterior end of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament and plantar soft tissue structures. The intermetatarsal bursa theory states that bursitis in the intermetatarsal region causes compression and inflammation with subsequent fibrosis of the affected common plantar digital nerve. Interestingly, bursae are close to the neurovascular bundle in the second and third intermetatarsal spaces where Morton neuromas are most common, but Morton neuromas are rare in the fourth intermetatarsal space where the bursa rarely ever contacts the neurovascular bundle.
