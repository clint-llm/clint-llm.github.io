Differential diagnoses of angioid streaks include:

- Normal retinal vessels

- Lacquer's cracks- A degenerative finding noted in pathological myopia, also characterized by breaks in the Bruch's membrane. It may be associated with subretinal hemorrhage without evidence of CNV.

- Reticular dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)- It is characterized by RPE changes that cause pigmentation in 'fishnet with knot' pattern. The changes are located at the posterior pole and may cause a round circle similar to angioid streaks.

- Subretinal tracks due to ophthalmomyiasis interna are smooth and may cross each other multiple times.

- Subretinal bands may be noted in long-standing retinal detachment or operated retinal detachment cases, which may simulate angioid streaks.

- Bilateral disciform scars may be seen in wAMD.

- Peripheral punched out scars may simulate POHS.
