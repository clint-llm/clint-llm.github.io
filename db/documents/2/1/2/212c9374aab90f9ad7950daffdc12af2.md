There is no specific laboratory or radiographic test that can help in the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. An imaging test, including a CT scan or MRI, is needed to stage the disease. Whereas CT is better at retroperitoneal and visceral lesions, MRI is better at evaluating tumors arising in the extremities and head and neck.
