Neonatal sepsis has a varied presentation. The neonate could have hypo or hyperthermia, irritability or lethargy, apnea or tachypnea, bradycardia or tachycardia, poor feeding, excessive sleepiness, or being fussy. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infection are common in premature infants. The physical examination could be normal or may reveal signs that are suggestive of neonatal sepsis.

A careful history is very important. History should include both maternal and infant risk factors. Maternal risk factors are lack of or delayed prenatal care, maternal GBS colonization, intrapartum antibiotic use, maternal medical history including diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disease, and maternal drug abuse. Infant risk factors are prematurity, low birth weight, post-neonatal course, **detailed history of NICU stay, prolonged rupture of membranes, and sick contacts.**
