Epidemiological data about the incidence and prevalence of Plummer-Vinson syndrome are not widely available due to the rarity of this syndrome, as noted in the literature, with most cases focusing on case reports. Although this syndrome appeared to be more common in temperate northern countries during the previous century, improvements in nutrition and subsequent correction of iron deficiency have led to a decline in its prevalence. In addition, although webs may be identified in barium studies or esophagogastroduodenoscopy, these webs may be symptomatic in only a minority of patients, and their presence alone does not meet the criteria for diagnosing Plummer-Vinson syndrome. However, an interesting single population-based study conducted in the 1960s in South Wales reported that the prevalence of post-cricoid webs in women was between 0.3% and 1.1% and 8.4% and 22.4% in women with dysphagia. In contrast, no webs were identified in men.

PVS was commoner in the earlier half of the 20th century, particularly in middle-aged Scandinavian women. The rapid decline in the prevalence of the syndrome in the second half of the 20th century is attributable to an improvement in nutritional awareness, including the widespread fortification of flour with iron.
