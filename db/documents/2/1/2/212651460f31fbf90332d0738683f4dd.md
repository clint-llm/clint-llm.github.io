In infants and children, the most common causes of altered mental status include infection, trauma, metabolic changes, and toxic ingestion. Young adults most often present with altered mental status secondary to toxic ingestion or trauma. The elderly most commonly will present with altered mental status due to stroke, infection, drug-drug interactions, or alterations in the living environment. In the elderly, nearly 10% to 25% of hospitalized patients will have delirium at the time of admission
