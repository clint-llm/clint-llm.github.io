Niacin deficiency can occur from a lack of consuming dietary sources containing niacin.

Drugs, alcoholism, gastrointestinal tract diseases, and malignancies are the common causes of secondary pellagra.

Also, some medications, such as isoniazid, may cause an increase in the risk of niacin deficiency. Isoniazid binds with vitamin B6 and reduces PLP-dependent kynureninase activity, a required substance for niacin synthesis.

There have been reports of the development of pellagra in patients taking second-line anti-TB drugs, such as ethionamide.

In patients with carcinoid tumors, there is excessive serotonin production. Increased serotonin production utilizes more tryptophan resulting in the deficiency of substrate left for niacin synthesis.
