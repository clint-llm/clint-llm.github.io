- History: A thorough maternal and family history is necessary to screen for conditions associated with oligohydramnios: medication use, past medical history, and rupture of membranes.

- Physical Exam: Target physical exam to determine etiology: measure fundal height, speculum examination, tests for ruptured membranes (pH, nitrazine test, rupture of fetal membranes test).
