The management of AIN is interprofessional because of the huge number of disorders that can cause renal dysfunction. AIN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with worsening renal function. A thorough laboratory workup with a complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic profile, urine eosinophils, and urinalysis with microscopy is indicated. If clinically warranted, a renal biopsy may be considered to make a definitive diagnosis. There is no imaging test to evaluate for AIN. The outlook for AIN depends on the cause, and when treatment is instituted. Patients with renal fibrosis, granulomas, and tubular atrophy usually have a poor prognosis. Further, AIN with renal failure for greater than three weeks portends a worse prognosis, likely due to the development of advanced fibrotic features on biopsy. NSAID-related AIN also is associated with a worse prognosis. Close to 50% of patients may require short term hemodialysis, while about 4% may require permanent dialysis.
