Distinguishing between variant (normal or abnormal) and artifact can be challenging. Knowledge and recognition allow for identification and possible correction to avoid errors in interpreting an imaging study. Along with the above categories (instrumental, technical, radiopharmaceutical, patient, and treatment-related), variants and the radionucleotide study used must be considered in the correct contexts.

Awareness of the potential artifacts is crucial to identify them.
