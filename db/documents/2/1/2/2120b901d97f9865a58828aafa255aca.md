The management of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia requires the services of an interprofessional team. After the diagnosis in the antenatal period, parents should be allowed to discuss the care with a group, including maternal-fetal medicine, pediatric surgery, neonatology, and social work as appropriate. Genetic evaluation and counseling are recommended for the identification of risk in future pregnancies. Following the repair in the postnatal period, a standardized and interprofessional follow-up to provide surveillance, screening, and clinical care is recommended to improve outcomes.
