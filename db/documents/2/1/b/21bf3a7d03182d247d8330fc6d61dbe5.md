Patients present with a history of trauma to the affected ear, usually during contact sports like wrestling, boxing, rugby, or increasingly, mixed martial arts. The ear appears red due to hematoma, swollen, and warm, while the patient may describe any combination of difficulty hearing, tinnitus, vision changes, pain,Â and/or a headache. If there is no concern for more underlying severe cranial pathology, then the practitioner should continue directly to treatment. If there has been any loss of consciousness or other neurologic symptoms, the workup of these may take precedence over the auricular hematoma depending on the individual scenario.

The strong relationship between trauma causing auricular hematomas should make practitioners suspicious of those individuals presenting with the signs described above, but who deny having undergone any reported trauma. Especially where children and the elderly are concerned, it is crucial that the possibility of abuse be entertained and screened for through a careful history and exam.
