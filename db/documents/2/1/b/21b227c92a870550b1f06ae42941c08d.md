Nurses are especially crucial in postoperative patient safety involving hemodynamical monitoring, fluid balance, and electrolyte measurement. In particular, nurses must be aware of potential postoperative complications, including signs of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, signs of hypocalcemia, neck hematoma. If the patient is discharged with medication, especially opioids, the nurse needs to review these medications with the patient for safety purposes.
