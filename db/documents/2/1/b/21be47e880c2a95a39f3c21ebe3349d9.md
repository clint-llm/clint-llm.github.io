Protein intolerance is caused by the inability to digest or effectively break down amino acids. When food proteins are not digested well, they can act as antigens resulting in food protein allergies. Most frequently, cow's milk proteins are the cause of food intolerance during infancy.

Protein intolerance can be seen in the following conditions:

Immunological food protein intolerance: It can be IgE mediated or non-IgE mediated.

IgE mediated conditions include:

- Cow's milk allergy

- Oral allergy syndrome

- Immediate GI hypersensitivity

- Eosinophilic esophagitis

- Eosinophilic gastritis

- Eosinophilic gastroenteritis

Non-IgE mediated conditions include:

- Food protein-induced enterocolitis

- Food protein-induced enteropathy

- Food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis

Autoimmune reaction: Autoimmune reaction to gluten proteins is found in celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis.

Enzyme deficiency: Enterokinase (enteropeptidase) deficiency

Metabolic disorders:

- Phenylketonuria (PKU)

- Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)

- Tyrosinemia

- Homocystinuria

Genetic/inherited disorder: Urea cycle disorders, lysinuric protein intolerance

Pharmacological: Chronic use of medications to suppress gastric acid production

Toxic reactions to biogenic amines:

- Tyramine in aged cheeses

- Histamine

Undefined: Irritable bowel syndrome
