Treatment is typically tailored to the patient’s presentation, the type, extent of the rupture, the time to diagnosis, and the viability of the esophageal wall. Early perforations, those diagnosed within 12 to 24 hours, have the best outcomes. Three common treatment options include conservative, endoscopic, or surgical. The mainstay of treatment includes volume replacement, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and surgical evaluation. Surgical intervention includes primary esophageal repair through open thoracotomy vs. VATS with fundic reinforcement, which is the gold standard within the first twenty-four hours. Endoscopic placement of stents has been used to prevent fistula formations or seal esophageal leaks both in patients with delayed diagnoses and those with early diagnosis without widespread contamination. Conservative measurements are usually reserved for small or contained ruptures. Controversy occurs when a late perforation, those diagnosed after 24 hours, is diagnosed, as the wound edges are typically edematous, stiff, or friable, rendering primary repair risky. Taking this into consideration, many manage late perforations through debridement of pleural cavity and mediastinum, esophagostomy, and feeding gastrostomy.  Esophageal replacement is usually done after 6 weeks. Nutritional supplementation is required if prolonged NPO status is necessary.
