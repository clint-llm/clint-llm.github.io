Obtaining a detailed historyÂ is critical for early diagnosis as a history of rodent exposure will trigger an evaluation for rodent-borne infections.

Clinical Phases:

- Prodrome - After the incubation period, patients may present with fevers, chills, deep muscle aches, and shortness of breath. The disease progresses rapidly during this phase and may lead to symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

- Cardiopulmonary phase - Characterized by capillary leak which leads to decreased cardiac output and a state of shock. This phase is also marked by pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and coagulopathy.

- Convalescent phase - Resolution of cardiopulmonary symptoms occurs following the oliguria and diuretic phases of the disease.
