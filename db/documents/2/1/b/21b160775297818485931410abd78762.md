A care team approach is vital to facilitate the preparation, procedure, and follow-up care required for corneal foreign body (FB) procedures. Obtaining a detailed history is indispensable. If the patient is unable to maintain a stable position at the biomicroscope, it is appropriate to seek nursing assistance to manage the patient's movements throughout the procedure. Team members may include physicians, nurses, ophthalmic technicians, and nursing or ophthalmic assistants.
