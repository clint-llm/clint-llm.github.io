Osteofibrous dysplasia is mostly asymptomatic and presents with a painless swelling on the anterior or anterolateral part of the tibia. The physical exam may reveal local tenderness over the tibia. Patients initially present with lower leg swelling, which may be painless, or with anterior bowing. Rarely, patients may present with a pathological fracture. Occasionally, the lesion is noted incidentally on x-rays taken for other reasons, often after trauma.

OFD and adamantinoma may both present with pain, swelling, and deformity. Anterior bowing of the tibia is the most common symptom. Both typically occur in the tibial diaphysis, with OFD being limited to the cortex. OFD has also been reported in the fibula, ulna, and radius. However, adamantinoma may also occur in the fibula and has been reported in the calcaneum, femur, ulna, radius, humerus, olecranon, ischium, rib, spine, metatarsals, and capitate. Pathological fracture is more common than swelling or deformity in patients with OFD.
