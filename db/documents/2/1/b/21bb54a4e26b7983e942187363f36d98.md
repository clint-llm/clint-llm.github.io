Tracheal stenosis requiring reconstruction is a rare anomaly that requires a dedicated multidisciplinary team in order to achieve success for the patient. While the surgeons (Otolaryngology, Cardiothoracic) are ultimately responsible for the surgical reconstruction, their success is dependent upon a team. These patients require an extensive workup preoperatively, and their clinical status must be optimized prior to undergoing surgery. Also, postoperative care is extensive. Critical care physicians, pulmonologists, gastroenterologists, anesthesiologists, speech and language pathologists, nursing support, and care coordinators must work tirelessly to ensure the safety and well-being of the patient. Communication is key and this is why these patients should be managed exclusively through a multidisciplinary aerodigestive clinic where all of these services are available.
