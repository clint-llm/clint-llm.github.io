Myopia, colloquially referred to as shortsightedness or nearsightedness, is one of the most common global eye diseases. It occurs when the optical power of the eye is too high for the corresponding axial length of the eye, resulting in images of distant objects being focused in front of the retina. Myopia can be corrected by wearing glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. However, pathologic myopia (PM) refers to a subset of ocular conditions associated with high myopia. The exact diagnostic criteria of PM have not been established. Some have defined PM based on an absolute cutoff value of refractive power (-6 to -8D) or axial length (26.5mm), while others have based it on the presence of myopic maculopathy.
