**Lifestyle Modification and Strategies to Reduce the Risk of Out Flares and Progression of Gout**

- Lifestyle changes are encouraged in gout patients, including weight loss, limiting alcohol intake, and avoiding certain foods. These changes will complement medical therapy but often are not enoughÂ by themselves to combat or reverse gout.

- Weight gain and increased adiposity are risk factors for gout, while in overweight patients with established gout, weight loss likely benefits in reducing serum urate and gout symptoms.

- The diet composition optimum for gout is likely to be one with adequate protein intake, especially from plant sources and low-fat dairy sources, with reduced intake from animal sources of purine such as shellfish or red meat; decreased saturated fat; and replacement of simple sugars with complex carbohydrates.

- Avoid or minimize the frequency of sugar-sweetened juices and alcohol-containing beverages or beverages containing high-fructose corn syrup.
