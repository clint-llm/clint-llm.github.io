Several loop diuretics come in IV and oral forms.

- Furosemide comes in oral tablet form in 20, 40, and 80 mg dosages. Injectable solutions come in 10 mg/mL doses. Oral solutions come in either 8 or 10 mg/mL doses.

- Torsemide comes in tablet form in 5, 10, 20, or 100 mg doses. Injectable solution is 10 mg/mL dosing.

- Bumetanide comes in oral tablets of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg doses. IV solution is 0.25 mg/mL.

- Ethacrynic acid is available with oral tablets of 25 mg and in a powder form for injections at 50 mg.

Bioavailability varies between each member of the loop diuretics. Furosemide has an average bioavailability of 50%, while bumetanide and torsemide are closer to 80%.

The half-life for furosemide is 1.5 to 2 hours but can be up to 2.6 hours in those with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. Bumetanide has a half-life of 1 hour and can be near 1.3 to 1.6 hours in those with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. Lastly, torsemide is known to have the longest half-life at 3 to 4 hours and can be as long as 5 to 6 hours in patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction or heart failure. All three loops typically have a similar onset of action. Oral administration between the three averages at 30 to 60 minutes.

Torsemide provides the longest duration of action and can give even greater diuretic effects in patients with hepatic dysfunction or heart failure.
