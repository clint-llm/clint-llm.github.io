Hyperglycemia is less common than hypoglycemia among neonates, but it is essential to address it because it increases mortality and morbidity among neonates. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with neonatal hyperglycemia, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of neonatal hyperglycemia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of neonatal hyperglycemia.
- Summarize the management approach for neonatal hyperglycemia.
- Review the complications of neonatal hyperglycemia.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that can improve outcomes for patients with neonatal hypoglycemia.
