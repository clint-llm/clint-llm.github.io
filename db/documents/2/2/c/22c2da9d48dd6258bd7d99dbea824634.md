As with most complex fractures, floating knee injuries are associated with high-velocity mechanisms and often accompanied by other injuries to other parts of the body, including severe soft tissue injury.  These high-velocity mechanisms include: motor vehicle accidents, falls from an extreme height, pedestrian vs. auto accidents, cyclist vs. auto accidents, and other mechanisms that involve blunt trauma to the area.
