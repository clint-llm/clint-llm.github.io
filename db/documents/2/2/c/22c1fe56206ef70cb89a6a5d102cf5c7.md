Breast cancer ranks as the most common malignancy in women. Annual screening mammography is recommended to every woman starting at age 40. MRI of the breast is an ideal complementary imaging study to mammography and ultrasound for the evaluation of breast disease. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner must be aware of the screening recommendations and indications for breast MRI. The interpreting radiologists must be aware of the commonly encountered artifacts of breast MRI, to prevent them and improve the quality of the scan. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is the most sensitive non-invasive imaging modality to differentiate benign and malignant breast lesions. The malignant lesions are small and often node-negative when identified with MRI compared to mammography alone. This diagnostic modality leads to early detection of breast cancer, better patient management, and outcome. Overall, the mortality rate for breast cancer has been decreasing due to screening and improved management, which is best accomplished with an interprofessional team approach using the various physician specialties (radiology, oncology, and the PCP) along with the nursing staff and radiology techs.
