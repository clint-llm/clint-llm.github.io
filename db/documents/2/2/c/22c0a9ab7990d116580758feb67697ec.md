Given the non-specific findings of arthralgia, high fever, and rash, the differential diagnosis for the acute and chronic manifestations of Chikungunya fever can be extensive. As mentioned above, DENV and ZK share not only clinical findings but also identical vectors with CHIKV, which prompts serology testing for all 3 viruses when a patient presents with the above symptoms.

- Malaria

- Yellow fever

- Leptospirosis

- Measles

- Mononucleosis

- African tick bite fever

Chronic arthralgia caused by Chikungunya fever can be easily confused with other more common causes. Furthermore, worse outcomes and increased morbidity has been demonstrated for patients with underlying joint disease and are super-infected with CHIKV.

- Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis

- Reiter arthritis

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Hepatitis C

- Systemic lLupus erythematosus
