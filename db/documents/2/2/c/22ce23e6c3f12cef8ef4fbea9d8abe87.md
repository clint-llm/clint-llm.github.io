In conclusion, the main presentation of vulvar hematoma is perineal pain and unilateral swelling of the vulva. If the hematoma is not large or acutely expanding, conservative management can be considered. A serious case of vulvar hematoma can lead to hemodynamic instability and should be recognized and treated early. Surgical intervention may be necessary when the hematoma is expanding, larger than 10 cm in size, causing pressure necrosis, hemodynamic instability, or suspicion for another associated pelvic injury.
