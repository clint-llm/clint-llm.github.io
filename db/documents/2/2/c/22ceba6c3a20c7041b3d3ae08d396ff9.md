Following diagnosis by physical examination, work up to identify the etiology and to guide the treatment plan is necessary.

A standardized approach for micropenis evaluation consists of:

- Hormonal level measurement (testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHS), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)

- hCG stimulation test to evaluate gonadal function ( measure testosterone hormone before and after hCG administration) testosterone levels below 300 ng/dL is suggestive of gonadal dysfunction

- Underverlization form of CAH evaluation to rule out the rare types associated with undervirilized male (progesterone, 17-OH progesterone, androstenedione, and 17-OH pregnenolone)

- Pelvic ultrasound to evaluate the gonads and internal genital structures.

- MRI brain to evaluate the pituitary gland
