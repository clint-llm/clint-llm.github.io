It is challenging to determine the actual incidence of hemorrhoidal disease as many patients do not seek medical attention for their symptoms. Estimates are that hemorrhoidal disease is the third most common outpatient gastrointestinal diagnosis in the United States with about 4 million office and emergency department visits every year. About 75% of Americans will experience hemorrhoidal symptoms at some point in their lives. The true prevalence of hemorrhoidal disease is unknown with various studies reporting a prevalence between 4% and 40%. The prevalence is highest in Caucasian patients between the ages of 45 and 65 and patients of high socioeconomic status. However, this observation can be attributed to selection bias as this group has the greatest access to care.
