There is a general assumption among healthcare workers that fresh frozen plasma is free of adverse effects and complications; nothing can be further from the truth. All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, and pharmacists, should know the indications for fresh frozen plasma administration and the monitoring process. The adverse effects of fresh frozen plasma are monitored like any other blood product administration. The patient’s vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure) are monitored before, during, and after administration. If a reaction is noted based on signs and symptomology, treatment is guided by the type of transfusion reaction. Usually, the administration of the product should immediately cease. Life-threatening reactions like TRALI and TACO may require aggressive respiratory support and often mechanical ventilation.

Proper administration and management of fresh frozen plasma require the efforts of an entire interprofessional team. Through proper knowledge and training, open information sharing and communication, and empowerment of each team member to contribute from their individual specialties, patients can achieve the best possible outcomes where fresh frozen plasma is indicated while having minimal adverse events.
