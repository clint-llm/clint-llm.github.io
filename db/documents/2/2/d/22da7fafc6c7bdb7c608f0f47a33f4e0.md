Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa. Transmission is primarily via Aedes and Haemagogus species of mosquito. It can present with varying clinical features ranging from a self-limited, mild febrile illness to severe hemorrhage and liver disease. The “yellow” comes from jaundice that affects some patients with severe disease. The disease is diagnosed by history travel to an endemic area, exposure to infected mosquitoes, vaccination history, symptoms, and laboratory findings. Most cases are self-limited and resemble many other common viral infections. Of those who develop severe disease mortality can approach 50%. Unlike many other mosquito-transmitted viruses, infected humans are not dead-end hosts and may infect mosquitoes during periods of viremia and spread the virus. There is no specific antiviral therapy, but there is an effective vaccine recommended for travelers to endemic areas. Other than vaccination, prevention of mosquito bites is the best way to avoid contracting the virus.
