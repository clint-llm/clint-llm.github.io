Researchers have extensively studied deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities. With the increased use of central venous catheters, cardiac pacemakers/defibrillators, and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines. DVTs in the upper extremities have become more commonplace and require a heightened index of suspicion from clinicians. Patients can be otherwise asymptomatic but commonly present with limb swelling. The most serious complication associated with any DVT, including upper extremity DVT, is a pulmonary embolus (PE). Recognition and appropriate intervention may prevent significant patient morbidity and mortality.
