The differential diagnosis includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma, lymphoma, and metastases. HCC can appear similar to the macrotrabecular subtype of hepatoblastoma, however, usually affects an adult patient population with risk factors such as metabolic disorders, liver cirrhosis, or childhood hepatitis B infection. Focal nodular hyperplasia usually affects older children and adults. Hepatic adenoma can resemble pure fetal hepatoblastomas; however, these rarely occur in persons under 5 years of age unless they have an underlying metabolic disorder.
