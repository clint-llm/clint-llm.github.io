Parkinson-plus syndrome presents with parkinsonism as well as a variety of other clinical features that can be elicited by obtaining a focused history and physical along with close neurological monitoring. As in classical PD, there is apraxia, rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability.

Depending on the specific PPS, other possible clinical features include dementia, hallucinations, dysautonomia, symmetrical onset, myoclonus, pyramidal tract signs, supranuclear gaze palsy, and alien limb phenomenon.

**Lewy Body Dementia**

LBD consists of dementia characterized by deficits in attention, cognition, and visuospatial function. Other notable features include visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), repeated falls, autonomic dysfunction, antipsychotic drug sensitivity, delusions, and depression. LBD consists of two clinical entities: dementia with Lewy bodies and PD dementia. Dementia with Lewy bodies is classified as dementia occurring first or within one year of the movement disorder. PD dementia occurs in a patient first receiving the diagnosis of PD and then developing dementia symptoms after one year or more of the diagnosis.

**Multiple System Atrophy**

The cardinal features of MSA are akinetic-rigid parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, autonomic failure, urogenital dysfunction, and pyramidal signs. There are two clinical subtypes of MSA based on motor presentation: MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C).

The predominant motor feature may also change as the disease progresses. MSA-P is associated with bradykinesia, postural instability, rigidity, and a jerky postural and action tremor. MSA-C is characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and eye movement disturbances. Dysautonomia in both motor subtypes is standard and includes early-onset erectile dysfunction, urinary frequency, incontinence, and late-appearing orthostatic hypotension.

**Corticobasal Degeneration**

CBD presents as an asymmetric movement disorder, with symptoms affecting one limb initially. Akinesia features include extreme rigidity, focal myoclonus, dystonia, alien limb phenomenon, and apraxia.

**Progressive Supranuclear Palsy**

PSP presents a variety of unique phenotypes. The most common and classic form of PSP is known as Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS). PSP-RS initially presents with gait dysfunction that leads to frequent falls. Supranuclear palsy is the hallmark of PSP, as patients cannot move the eyes vertically, focus on objects, or control eyelid movements. Ophthalmoparesis usually appears within four years but may take up to 10 years to develop.

PSP patients are described as having axial rigidity and standing with an extended posture as opposed to the flexed posture in PD. Patients tend to pivot quickly and often fall backward. Other common symptoms include dysphagia, dysarthria, rigidity, frontal cognitive dysfunction, and sleep abnormalities.

Phenotypes of PSP include PSP with predominant oculomotor dysfunction (PSP-OM), postural instability (PSP-PI), frontal presentation (PSP-F), speech/language disorder (PSP-SL), corticobasal syndrome (PSP-CBS), and progressive gait freezing (PSP-PGF).
