As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a manifestation of the disease, rather than a disease itself, the potential etiologies listed below serve as possible differential diagnoses as well.

Following etiologies can affect any age group, but are more commonly observed in adult patients:

**Extrahepatic**

- Cholelithiasis

- Pancreatitis (chronic and acute)

- Pancreatic or biliary malignancies

- Portal adenopathy

- Biliary strictures following an invasive procedure

- Primary sclerosing cholangitis

- AIDS cholangiopathy

- Choledochal cyst

- Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction

- Parasites

- Eosinophilic granuloma

- Periampullary diverticulum

- Mirizzi syndrome

**Intrahepatic**

- Viral Hepatitis: Hepatitis A-E, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus

- Alcoholic hepatitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

- Cirrhosis

- Ischemic hepatopathy (shock liver)

- Drugs and toxins

- Primary sclerosing and biliary cholangitis

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- Systemic infection

- Total parenteral nutrition

- Postoperative jaundice

- Sickle cell disease

- Budd-Chiari syndrome

- Parasites

- Liver infiltration

- Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy

- Organ transplantation (e.g., bone marrow and liver)

- Sarcoidosis and amyloidosis

- Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolisms (e.g., Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome, benign recurrent cholestasis, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, Caroli disease)

- Paraneoplastic syndromes, e.g., Hodkin, Stauffer syndrome, prostate, etc

Following unique etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia affecting infants:

- Extrahepatic biliary atresia

- Choledochal cyst

- Idiopathic neonatal hepatitis

- Caroli disease

- Metabolic diseases (tyrosinemia, Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick disease, galactosemia)

- Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency

- Sepsis

- TORCH infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, syphilis)

- Budd-Chiari syndrome

Following unique etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia affecting older children and adolescents:

- Choledochal cyst

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- Primary biliary cirrhosis

- Primary sclerosing cholangitis

- Wilson disease

- Sepsis
