There are several other tumors that could present in a similar fashion and need to be distinguished. Following are some important differentials with their distinguishing features:

- **Clear Cell Carcinoma**: stains positive for cytokeratin, cytokeratin 7, and epithelial membrane antigen while stains negative for glypican-3 and alpha-fetoprotein. Yolk sac tumors stain negative for both cytokeratin 7 and epithelial membrane antigen.

- **Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumor**: positive for inhibin, calretinin, and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), negative for AFP, and glypican 3.

- **Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumor**: it has morphological similarities with the yolk sac tumor, but the juvenile granulosa cell tumor is positive for inhibin and negative for SALL4, AFP, and glypican 3.

- **Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma**: consider in conjunction with clinical history, negative for (Sal-like protein 4) SALL4, while strongly positive in yolk sac tumors.

- **Dysgerminoma/Seminoma**: stains positive for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), CD117, and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4).

- **Embryonal Carcinoma**: stains positive for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), cytokeratin, CD30, and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4).

- **Granulocytic Sarcoma**: stains positive for CD117, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO).

- **Melanoma**: stains positive for S-100.

- **Lymphoma**: stains positive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA).

- While yolk sac tumors stain negative for CD117, CD30, S-100, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4).
