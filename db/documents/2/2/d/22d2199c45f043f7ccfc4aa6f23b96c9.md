Heightened levels of interprofessional communication are of utmost importance in the care of patients with TS. As mentioned in the consultations section above, this severe cancer-predisposing condition involves many organ systems and thus many specialists. Screening and treatment guidelines have been developed mostly by Level V evidence. Therefore, having each specialist communicate about its choice of screening and treatment plans allows for a coherent plan of action without placing an unnecessary burden on the patient. These patients are young, so communication with the patient and parents is imperative. Having organized plans of action that are coordinated in anÂ interprofessional fashion will allow for greater compliance and better outcomes for the patient.
