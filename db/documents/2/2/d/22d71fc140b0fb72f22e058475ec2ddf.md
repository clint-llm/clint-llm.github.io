There are no required labs or imaging for all patients struck by lightning, but certain tests and studies are recommended for certain subsets of patients.

Select "high-risk" patients, those with a direct strike, chest pain, dyspnea, status post-arrest, should have an ECG and echocardiogram and be monitored on telemetry for 24 hours with other imaging and labs guided by history and physical exam.  Many would advocate for an ECG in all victims of lightning strike/injury, but the data on this is mixed as many individuals will have transient and benign ECG changes. Cardiac markers commonly are elevated but are not prognostic, and routine screening is of limited utility.

All lightning strike patients should have a thorough exam for signs of trauma with appropriate workup and imaging to be guided by history and exam. Any patient with loss of consciousness, burns to the head, or abnormal neurologic examination should have a CT of the head due to increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

Labs and other imaging may be ordered upon the discretion of the provider, but as mentioned, are not mandatory for all victims.
