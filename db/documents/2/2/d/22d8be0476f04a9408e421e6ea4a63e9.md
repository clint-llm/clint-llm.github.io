After 1960, the Fresnel principle, which existed for more than 150 years, was used for the first time to manage strabismus. In 1970, the optical scientific group from San Rafael of California designed a combination of a series of Fresnel press on prisms.

Initially, they were intended for use in lighthouse beacons. Prisms have been used extensively in the field of ophthalmology, especially related to neuro-ophthalmology and strabismus.

The angle of refraction of a prism depends upon the angle of the surface and the refractive index of the material of which the prism is made.

Fresnel prisms are most commonly used as stuck-on prisms. Traditionally, prisms have also been used in patients with stroke and homonymous hemianopia. The aim is to shift the peripheral image towards the central retinal meridian.
