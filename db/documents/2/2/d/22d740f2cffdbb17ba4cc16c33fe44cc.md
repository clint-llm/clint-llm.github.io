After appropriate management, patients should be educated properly regarding the causes of myoglobinuria. They should be given specific instructions to prevent any such incidence in the future, depending on their respective underlying diagnoses.

Firstly, the patients should be educated that it can happen in the future as well. If something like this happens in the future, like they experience dark urine or muscle pain, they should make an appointment with their doctor. Myoglobinuria can be easily checked by a urine sample.

If the patient is having myoglobinuria due to the prescription medications, they should be given proper education about it, and if possible, the culprit drug should be changed.

If it has occurred due to rigorous exercise, the patients should be educated to modify their exercise routine and intensity. They should also be advised to maintain proper hydration during their activities.

And if it is related to some recreational drug use or excessive alcohol consumption, they should be comprehensively counseled about it and should be given proper information about rehabilitation centers if they want to get rid of the use of such substances. They should be given the contact information of such centers as well.
