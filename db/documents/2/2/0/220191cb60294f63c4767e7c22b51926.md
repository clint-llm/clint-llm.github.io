Isoniazid (INH) is an antibiotic indicated in the first-line treatment of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection. Active TB infection can present as fever, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, and/or weight loss. There are four CDC-recommended multiple-drug regimens that involve INH for drug-susceptible strains. The regimens consist of an initial phase of 2 months followed by a continuation phase of either 4 or 7 months.

Isoniazid can also be used to treat latent tuberculosis infection, but rifampin-based regimens have recently replaced isoniazid as the recommendation. Rifampin-based regimens have demonstrated similar efficacy with a shorter treatment course and better completion rates.
