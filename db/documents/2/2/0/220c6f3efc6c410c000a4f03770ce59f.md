Metformin overdose correlates with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. If the clinician suspects lactic acidosis due to toxic metformin levels, they should immediately discontinue the medication and start hemodialysis. Metformin is an easily dialyzable medication due to its small molecular weight and lack of protein binding. Supportive care is used in the treatment of metformin toxicity, as there is no antidote used.
