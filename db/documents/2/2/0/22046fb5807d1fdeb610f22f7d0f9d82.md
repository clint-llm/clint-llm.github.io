Follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are typically elevated in prepubertal females as their immature bodies are developing. However, the onset of puberty increases levels of estrogen, leading to new luteinizing hormone (LH) surges just before ovulation. LH concentrations then become resultingly higher than FSH.
