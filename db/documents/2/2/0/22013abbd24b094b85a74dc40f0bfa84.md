Most antifungal medications work through the inhibition of fungal membrane production and ergosterol synthesis. Terbinafine is an allylamine that works early in the pathway as a non-competitive inhibitor of the enzyme squalene epoxidase and subsequent conversion of squalene to squalene epoxide.

Although not directly fungicidal, the intracellular accumulation of squalene results in fungal cell death.
