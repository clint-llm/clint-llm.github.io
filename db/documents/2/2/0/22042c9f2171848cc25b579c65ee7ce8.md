It is very important to distinguish whether the episode of TVL is due to a high-risk cause or a low-risk cause. Management of TVL due to embolism is directed to the underlying cause. In patients with a cardiac source, treatment is anticoagulation and proper management of the underlying cardiac cause. Internal carotid artery stenosis may be managed with antiplatelet therapy, management of systemic risk factors, carotid endarterectomy, or stenting if indicated. Giant cell arteritis is managed with corticosteroid therapy. Retinal vasospasm could be treated with Aspirin or Calcium channel blockers. A retinal migraine is controlled by conventional migraine treatments. Angle-closure glaucoma is also treated as per standard therapies for the condition.
