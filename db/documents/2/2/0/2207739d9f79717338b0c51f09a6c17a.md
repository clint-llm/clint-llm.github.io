About 5 million Americans require a blood transfusion each year, needed for acute blood loss, surgery, hemophilia or cancer. Transfusion transmitted-diseases (TTD) comprise several pathologies that are transmitted by blood transfusions. The various biological agents involved are mainly viruses and parasites. For example, microorganisms such as hepatitis B virus and HIV-1 can be transmitted by a contaminated blood transfusion from an infected individual to a recipient and cause disease that can lead to chronic hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome respectively. A list of TTD includes infections caused by human T-lymphotropic virus 1, cytomegalovirus and West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), malaria, Chagas disease, babesiosis, leishmaniasis, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Zika, Dengue, Chikungunya, and anaplasmosis.
