Failure of proper closure of the optic fissure can lead to the following defects:

- Coloboma: A coloboma is a hole or defect in either the eyelid, cornea, iris, lens, ciliary body, zonules, retina, choroid, or optic nerve as a result of incomplete closure of the optic fissure.

- Optic pits: An optic pit is a depression within the optic nerve as a result of incomplete closure of the optic fissure.
