Absolute contraindications for using carvedilol include severe hypotension, second or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia in the absence of a functional pacemaker, severe decompensated heart failure requiring inotropic support, and a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction. Clinicians should use caution in patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease; the recommendation is to avoid use in patients with active wheezing due to its beta-blocking properties.
