Cardiac arrest is divided into out-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). However, the incidence of cardiopulmonary arrest worldwide is not well described. In the U.S, more than 290,000 IHCA occur in adults annually, whilst 326,000 cases of OHCA among adults occur yearly. Half of these are unwitnessed.

Men and women in middle-age have different susceptibilities to cardiopulmonary arrest; however, the sex differences decrease with increasing age. The difference in risk for cardiopulmonary arrest collateral the variations in age-related risks for other features of coronary heart disease (CHD) between males and females. As the gender gap for signs of coronary heart disease closes in the 6th to 8th decades, the excess risk of arrest in males progressively narrows. In spite of the lower incidence among younger women, CHD risk factors such as diabetes (DM), cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension (HTN) are very highly influential.
