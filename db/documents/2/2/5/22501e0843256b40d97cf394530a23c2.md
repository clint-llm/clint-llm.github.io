The World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA) recommends continuous ECG in evaluating cardiac function and consistent monitoring of blood pressure and pulse oximetry for proper tissue oxygenation in the body. It is also vital to assess carbon dioxide levels in the body to prevent any neurological side effects. Intermittent monitoring of urine output (renal function) is essential in determining the proper clearance of benzocaine out of the body. In addition to the above, a routine CBC is necessary to evaluate for any hemolysis in cases of suspected underlying methemoglobinemia.
