TCAs are rapidly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. However, following an overdose, owing to the inherent anticholinergic effects, TCAs may decrease the gastrointestinal motility and cause delayed absorption and toxicity. Coingestion of other anticholinergic medications may cause more erratic absorption. TCAs have a long elimination half-life as these drugs are largely bound to the plasma protein and highly lipid-soluble. Renal excretion occurs after significant first-pass hepatic metabolism. TCAs are primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, and the enzyme inducers and inhibitors of this pathway may alter their metabolism. Toxicity may occur because of the primary compound or its metabolite. Respiratory or metabolic acidosis may increase the unbound fraction of TCA and may potentiate the harmful effects. Signs of toxicity usually appear within 2 hoursâ€™ post-ingestion. If 6 hours post-ingestion, there are no signs of toxicity seen both clinically and on the electrocardiogram, and the patient has normal bowel sounds, then most likely, the patient has not taken a significant overdose and can be medically cleared for psychiatric evaluation if needed. Once significant toxicity occurs, it usually lasts for 24-48 hours. However, there are case reports of significant toxicity due to Amitriptyline that lasted up to 5 days post-ingestion.
