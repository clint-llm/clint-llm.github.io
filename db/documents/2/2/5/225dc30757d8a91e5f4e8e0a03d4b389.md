A study evaluating pregnancies between 35Â to 37 weeks demonstrated that biochemical markers provide a poor estimation of stillbirth in both small for gestational age and non-small for gestational age fetuses.

However, placental growth factor level (PIGF) when low in late pregnancy is strongly associated with small for gestational age fetuses, preeclampsia, fetal compromise, NICU admissions, and stillbirth. This angiogenic protein is produced in the placenta and contributes to the development of a low resistance circulation in the placenta. Normally, the level peaks at 30 weeks and then falls toward term. A low level in the first and second trimesters negatively impacts placental development. The ability to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes based on a low level in the third trimester is under evaluation. Many studies use the ratio of fms-soluble tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)/ PlGF ratio instead of just the PlGF level. The screening performance of these measurements is being evaluated to predict adverse pregnancy outcomes. At this time, a preferred assay is not recommended.

Induction of labor at or beyond 39 weeks to reduce the stillbirth rate is being evaluated. Induction of labor after 39 weeks is associated with fewer perinatal deaths, fewer cesarean sections, fewer NICU admissions, and low Apgar scores. A value of 426 inductions at or beyond 39 weeks is estimated to prevent one perinatal death. The optimal timing for induction requires further research.
