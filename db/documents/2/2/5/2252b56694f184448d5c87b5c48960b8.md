Other etiologies ofÂ bradycardia and syncope should be part of the differential diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity, neurocardiogenic syncope with a predominant cardioinhibitory component, sinus bradycardia in conditioned athletes (although does not cause syncope but they do have sinus pauses). Sinus node dysfunction and carotid sinus hypersensitivity can often occur together.
