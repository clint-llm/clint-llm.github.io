Endometriosis remains a disease with high comorbidity, even though extensive research has been conducted and new medical treatments have been developed. Health care professionals need to join hands and work collectively when they need to work with patients with suspected cases of endometriosis. It is not random that the mean delay of a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is approximately ten years. Public health interventions should be introduced and promote awareness among females of childbearing age for signs and symptoms of endometriosis; thus, they could seek medical care in an earlier stage of the disease.

Clinicians should work as a team regarding the management of endometriosis to achieve the most effective treatment and avoid surgical complications. Additionally, health care professionals engaged with the management of endometriosis should be up to date informed about new drugs, their indications or adverse effects to implement a successful treatment, and their attention should be drawn to the fact that the symptomatology of the disease has no direct relationship with the extent of disease.
