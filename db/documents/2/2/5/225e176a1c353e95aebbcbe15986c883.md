SPS is contraindicated in the following conditions:

- Hypokalemia

- Previous history of hypersensitivity to polystyrene sulfonate resins

- Bowel Obstruction

- Neonates with reduced gut motility

**Cautions**

SPS can contribute to sodium overload and lead to fluid retention. Hence, SPS use requires caution in certain conditions such as congestive heart failure, severe hypertension, and marked edema. Clinicians should not use SPS in patients with abnormal bowel functions, such as bowel obstruction, Ileus, and postoperative patients. Using SPS in these patients may increase the risk of bowel ischemia, necrosis, and serious constipation.

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

SPS does not get absorbed systemically; thus, maternal use of SPS is not expected to cause harm to the fetus. Similarly, as it is not secreted through breast milk, breastfeeding is not expected to result in any particular risk to the newborn.
