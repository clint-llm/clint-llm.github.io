The parotid gland is one of the salivary glands enclosed within a fascial capsule. It comprises a superficial lobe and a deep lobe separated by the facial nerve. It is an exocrine gland that secretes saliva into the oral cavity after parasympathetic stimulation. The Stensen canal is the primary excretory duct for the parotid gland, passing through the masseter muscles, penetrating the buccinator, and then into the oral mucosa lateral to the second maxillary molar. The saliva secreted aids in chewing, swallowing, digestion, and phonation. In addition, saliva contains electrolytes, mucin, and digestive enzymes like amylase.

Parotitis is inflammation of the parotid glands and is the most common inflammation of the major salivary glands. Parotitis can present as a local process or a manifestation of systemic illness.

Predisposing factors include dehydration, malnutrition, immunosuppression, sialolithiasis, oral neoplasms, and medications, causing decreased salivation. Rare complications of parotitis or parotid procedures include osteomyelitis, Lemierre syndrome, sepsis, organ failure, and facial paralysis.
