Epicondylitis is primarily considered a chronic tendinosis as opposed to an acute inflammatory process. Along with the degenerative changes associated with overuse, there are findings of angiofibroblastic hyperplasia or tendinosis. Nirshel has previously proposed four stages of epicondylar tendinosis:

- Generalized inflammation

- Angiofibroblastic degeneration

- Structural failure

- Fibrosis and calcification

Throughout these four stages, the overarching theme is repetitive micro-tearing at the tendon origin with a failed reparative process. The pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis are the most commonly affected tendons, but studies have shown that all flexor tendons can be affected equally.
