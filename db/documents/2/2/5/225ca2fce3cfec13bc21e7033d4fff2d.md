Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a small opening between the top two chambers of the heart. However, it is one of the most common cardiac defects. Several large, population-based studies estimated no differences in incidence (at about 9.2%) among patients with stroke and patients without a stroke.

Data exists showing that PFO closure for cryptogenic stroke can be cost-effective.
