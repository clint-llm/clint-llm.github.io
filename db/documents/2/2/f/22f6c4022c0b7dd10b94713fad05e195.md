Most cases of acute bacterial pharyngitis are self-limiting. If GABHS infection is confirmed and treated with an appropriate antibiotic, the prognosis is good. Rarely, a patient may develop one of the complications.

Sexually transmitted pharyngeal infections are easily treated and most commonly asymptomatic.

The rare infections of diphtheria and Yersinia pestis are quite treatableÂ when basic medical resources are available, though they may be associated with poor prognosis since most cases would develop in highly under-resourced settings.
