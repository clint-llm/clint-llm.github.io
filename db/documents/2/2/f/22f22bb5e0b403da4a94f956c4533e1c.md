Testing for heavy metal exposure can be done indirectly or directly. For example, a blood smear with basophilic stippling for a patient with blue lines at the base of the gums would raise clinical suspicion for chronic lead toxicity. However, the direct, and thus, a confirmatory test for heavy metals is an analysis of the suspected metal concentration in the body.

Samples for testing can include blood, urine, hair, and nails. The specimen collected depends on the type of metal being tested and the onset of exposure.Â Most, but not all, heavy metals can be analyzed using a 24-hour urine collection for acute, chronic, and prior exposure. A urine spot test can be used, but creatinine concentrations should also be ordered.

Since metal concentrations are normally in the nano and microgram range, careful consideration needs to be taken to prevent contamination.
