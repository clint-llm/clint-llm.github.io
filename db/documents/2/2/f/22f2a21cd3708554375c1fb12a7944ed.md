In vulvar cancer, the lymphatic spread is initially to homolateral superficial inguinal lymph nodes and then to deep femoroinguinal lymph nodes. Lymph node status is the most powerful prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with vulvar cancer. Survival rates are significantly lower for patients with lymph node metastasis; 65% vs 91% at 10 years, 52.5% vs 87.5% at 5 years and 56.2% vs 90.2% at 3 years. Progression-free survival is better in node-positive patients who receive adjuvant radiotherapy. Overall, the recurrence rate of vulvar cancer is 37% at five years. Patients diagnosed with distant metastasis have a poor prognosis.

Vulvar melanoma prognosis is poor, with an estimated 5-year survival of between 10% to 63%.

Vulvar Paget disease has a favorable prognosis despite a frequent recurrence rate. In patients with vulvar Paget’s disease and an underlying adenocarcinoma, the prognosis depends on the type of and treatment outcomes for the associated adenocarcinoma. Local recurrence of vulvar sarcoma is common. The most predictive factor for recurrence is inadequate resection margins and tumor diameter greater than 5mm, infiltrating margins, and high mitotic rate. Bartholin gland carcinoma is similar to vulvar SCC in that the prognosis is stage-dependent.

HPV status is also relevant for prognosis as HPV-positive vulvar cancers have more favorable outcomes than HPV-negative and may be exploited to allow for more conservative treatment, and post-treatment follow up.
