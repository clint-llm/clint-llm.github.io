Local anesthesia is used to clean and repair lacerations appropriately. Selection of the anesthetic, as stated previously, will depend on patient allergies and accessibility at the care facility. Several steps can be taken to reduce patient discomfort while administering the local anesthetic, such as:

- Buffering the solution at a rate of 9 mL of lidocaine to 1 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.

- Warming the anesthetic to body temperature.

- Utilizing small needles (greater than 27 gauge) for the administration of the anesthetic.

- Infusing the anesthetic slowly.

- Injecting through the edges of clean wounds vs. new punctures.

- Utilizing topical anesthetics such as EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream or TAC solutions (tetracaine, adrenaline, and cocaine) before infiltration with a local anesthetic.

- Placing ice contained within a sterile glove over the injection site for 2 minutes before injection has been found to reduce pain from the local anesthetic.

After local anesthesia, the next step is irrigation of the wound to remove any foreign objects and clotted blood, allowing for complete visualization of the laceration. Most commonly performed utilizing a saline solution, some research has shown that in simple lacerations on healthy immunocompetent patients, tap water can be utilized to irrigate the wound.

Following irrigation, the laceration can now be closed using whichever method best suits its location and size. If suturing, there is no specific guide for which technique to use, but general technique recommendations are as follows:

- Simple interrupted sutures are versatile and the right choice for most wounds.

- Horizontal/ Vertical mattress sutures are both utilized to evert wound edges but have an increased risk of scar formation.

- Deep sutures can be employed to reduce tension on the superficial sutures and help reduce future scarring, but care must be taken to ensure the wound is clean before placing deep sutures due to the increased risk of infection.

Following primary closure, placement of either antibiotic ointment or petroleum-infused gauze over the sutures with overlying gauze affixed by tape is advised.

- General suture removal timelines:

- Face: 3 to 5 days
- Scalp and arms: 7 to 10 days
- Trunk, Legs, hands, and feet: 10 to 14 days
- Palms or soles: 14 to 21 days
