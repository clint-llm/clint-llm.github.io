Distinguishing between IEDCS and barotrauma can be difficult. An accurate report from the dive site, including dive profile, the onset of symptoms, untoward events, or sudden changes of depth or gas mixture, can all provide clues to distinguish DCS from barotrauma. Therefore input from diving companions, a divemaster, EMS personnel, and others in contact with the patient is essential. The care of these patients can include an interprofessional team including otologists, audiologists, neurologists, hyperbaric physicians, and specialty-trained nurses.
