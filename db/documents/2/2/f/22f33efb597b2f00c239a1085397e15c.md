The two commonly utilized histological stains to observe the male urethra are the hematoxylin and eosin stain and the trichrome stain.

The hematoxylin and eosin stain contains an acidic and basic dye, which allows for a general visualization of the cell and its different cellular components like the nucleus, cytoplasmic granules, and proteins. In regards to general observation of the male urethra, this stain is useful in determining the type of epithelium in a particular cross-section.

The trichrome stain, as its name implies, contains three different dyes. This stain is able to differentiate muscle, especially smooth muscle, from connective tissues like collagen. This is beneficial when looking at cross-sections and trying to determine which portion of the urethra you are observing. Depending on the muscular and connective tissue environment surrounding the urethra, you can get a good idea of where in the male urethra the cross section was taken. For example, if there was suspicion of fibrosis involving the smooth muscle layers of the urethra, a trichrome stain would be well suited to observe and contrast the proportion of smooth muscle to connective tissue.
