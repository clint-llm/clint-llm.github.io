Iris cysts may often first be detected by an optometrist or general ophthalmologist.  Adequate documentation in the early stages of diagnosis is vital to monitor progression by their eye care provider or by a specialist over time. Documentation should include both written and photo documentation to allow for comparison as needed.  Secure storage of digital information such as photographs, UBM, and OCT is recommended.
