For the majority of patients with first-degree AV block, there is no need for treatment. The American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines do not recommend permanent pacemaker placement for patients with first-degree AV block, with the exception of patients with PR interval greater than 0.30 seconds who are experiencing symptoms believed to be due to the AV block.

In patients with AV block related to myocardial infarction (MI), pacemaker placement may be indicated, but is often delayed to determine if the AV block is transient as the patient recovers from the MI. There is no indication for antiarrhythmic medication for first-degree AV block. In the absence of symptoms, patients do not require treatment beyond surveillance to assess for worsening AV block. This surveillance may be done with routine ECGs, and further investigation is rarely indicated if there is no worsening of the PR interval prolongation. Although generallyÂ believed to be a benign condition, cohort studies have shown that patients with first-degree AV block have a higher incidence of atrial fibrillation, pacemaker placement, and all-cause mortality than patients with normal PR intervals. At this time it is unknown if this is because first-degree AV block is more common in patients with organic heart disease or if first-degree AV block is a pathologic condition, prone to progress to higher-grade blocks, even in the absence of concomitant heart disease.
