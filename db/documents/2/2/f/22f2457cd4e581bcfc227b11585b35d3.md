A thorough patient history, physical examination in conjunction with preoperative assessment. Careful consideration of the patient’s dominant extremity and prior interventions or injuries possibly affect the potential access site. A physical examination with a tourniquet in place is used to inspect the arm for visible cephalic and basilic veins. A thorough pulse examination including Allen’s test should be done to assess arterial flow distally to the hand. Extensive collateral vessels, edema and a history of a prior central venous catheter (CVC) may hint at central stenosis and potential problems with planned AV access in the extremity. A venous duplex scan is used to assess for adequate venous diameter and lack of arterial stenosis peripherally. It is accepted that a minimum of 2.5 mm with a tourniquet is required to achieve a functional mature fistula. Once adequate vascular is identified in preoperative planning, surgery may be planned.
