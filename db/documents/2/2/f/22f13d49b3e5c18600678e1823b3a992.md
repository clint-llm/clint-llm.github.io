Coronary artery anomalies are rare entities that are usually incidental and benign. The key to identifying a flow-limiting anomaly is the analysis of the vessel shape, in particular, ostial narrowing and vessel cross-section.

Some anomalies, such as intramyocardial course, subendocardial course, as well as pre-pulmonic, retro-aortic, and transseptal anomalies, are almost always benign based on course alone. ALCAPA and coronary artery fistula cause a steal phenomenon, which may induce myocardial ischemia.
