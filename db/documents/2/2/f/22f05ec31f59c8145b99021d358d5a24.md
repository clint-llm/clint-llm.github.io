In general, the treatment of ocular tuberculosis is the same as for pulmonary TB. Treatment consists of a four-drug regimen, administered in two phases: rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol daily for two months, followed by rifampicin and isoniazid for four months. If the patient fails to respond in three to four weeks, consider multidrug resistance, TB, and management should continue in conjunction with an infectious disease specialist.

Steroids are given to reverse insult from granulomatous inflammation and to help prevent a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to TB antigens.

Paradoxical worsening after initiation of ATT has been reported. This phenomenon is thought to result from a Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction as the immune system gains increased exposure to bacterial antigens after treatment, and results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In addition to ATT, TB delayed hypersensitivity retinal vasculitis (Eales disease), also benefits from treatment with peripheral scatter retinal laser treatment to decrease the ischemic drive for retinal neovascularization.
