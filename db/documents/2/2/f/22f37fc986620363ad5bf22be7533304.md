Mandibular dislocation is rare, and there is no overall gender or age-related predilection. As facial trauma is more prevalent overall in men, traumatic causes may show a slight male predilection. Anterior dislocations are the most common type of mandibular dislocation, usually secondary to atraumatic causes. Posterior, lateral, and superior dislocations are much rarer. Bilateral TMJ dislocations occur more often than unilateral dislocation.
