Tuberculous meningitis can cause a myriad of neurologic sequela that can be present at initial presentation and can produce residual effects even after successful treatment.

Some significant complications to remember include the following:

- Hydrocephalus due to obstruction of CSF outflow causing raised intracranial pressure

- Hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion is seen in 40 to 50% of patients with TBM.

- Tuberculomas can occur independently of TBM and have not been shown to be affected by adjunctive steroid treatment.

- Vasculitis and stroke occur in 15 to 57% of patients with TBM depending on which diagnostic modalities are used in diagnosis, with MRI being diagnostically superior in diagnosis to CT.

- Seizures, generally focal, result from hyponatremia, infarction, and meningeal irritation

- Loss of vision that could be permanent due to compression of the optic chiasma by the dilated third ventricle as the optic chiasma and optic nerve are encased by thick tuberculous exudates

- Transverse myelitis manifests as paraparesis or quadriparesis, sensory symptoms, and urinary retention in the lower limbs.
