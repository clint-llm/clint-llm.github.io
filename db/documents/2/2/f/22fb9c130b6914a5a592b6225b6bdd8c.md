The aorta is known for certain pathology including aortic aneurysms, dissection, coarctation, aortitis, and atherosclerotic disease. **Ascending aortic aneurysms**and dissections involve surgical management. Descending thoracic and abdominal aneurysms involve medical management until the vessel reaches a size greater than 50% of its baseline diameter at which point they require surgical placement of stents or grafts. Smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are strong risk factors.**Aortic coarctation**is often diagnosed within the first few years of life. Blood pressures are often higher in the upper limbs as opposed to the lower limbs. Severe cases can lead to lower limb cyanosis. Collateral flow via the intercostal arteries provides nutrient-rich blood to the abdomen and distal extremities. This condition is usually managed surgically.**Aortitis**may result from an infectious etiology such as syphilis or an autoimmune origin such as arteritis. Depending on the cause, the aorta may dilate or narrow.**AtheroscleroticÂ disease**may lead to peripheral artery disease and predispose individuals to dissection or aneurysm. However, plaques may simply decrease the luminal radius, leading to distal ischemia. Leriche syndrome, or aortoiliac occlusive disease, is a notable atherosclerotic disease affecting the distal abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.
