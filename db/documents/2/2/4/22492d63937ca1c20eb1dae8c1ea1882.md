Testosterone has many biologic effects as it can act as three hormones. Testosterone can act directly on the androgen receptor or operate in tissues via conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. Finally, testosterone can act as an estrogen following conversion by aromatase to estradiol. In many tissues, the activity of testosterone depends on its reduction to DHT, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. When transported to the nucleus, this steroid-receptor complex initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action. These three actions are crucial to understanding the therapeutic indications and adverse effects of androgen replacement therapy.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Testosterone cypionate injected IM is absorbed slowly, and hence it can be given every two to four-week intervals. The majority of (98%) of testosterone in plasma is bound to globulin. The distribution between free and bound forms is dependent on the amount of this testosterone-estradiol binding globulin in the plasma. The half-life is directly proportional to the free testosterone concentration in plasma. The half-life of IM testosterone cypionate is approximately eight days. A majority (90 percent) of testosterone is excreted in the urine as glucuronic or sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone, and it is converted into an inactive form by the liver.
