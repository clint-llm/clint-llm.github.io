There is no specific equipment needed for performing the McRobert’s maneuver.  The McRobert's maneuver is performed by two people simultaneously.  Two stools should be available on either side of the patient's bed for the labor room personnel.  An assistant may also help aid in the performance of suprapubic pressure if performed along with McRobert's maneuver.
