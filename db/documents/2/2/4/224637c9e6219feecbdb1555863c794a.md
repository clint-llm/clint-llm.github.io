Chest trauma can be a result of penetrating or blunt trauma. While blunt trauma is more common, penetrating trauma can be acutely life-threatening.Â It is important to know the mechanism of injury as management may vary. Additionally, the directionality of penetration will dictate the investigation and intervention. Depending on the penetrating trauma, immediate operative intervention may be needed, making early diagnosis integral to survival. The penetrating injury should also be taken into consideration; for example, stab versus missile injury to the chest can result in different patterns of injury. Gunshot and stabbing account for 10% and 9.5% of penetrating chest injuries, making these the most common etiology of penetrating trauma.
