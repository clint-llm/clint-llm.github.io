Consultation with a vascular surgeon may be sought in patients with Superficial thrombophlebitis who require anticoagulation but have contraindications to anticoagulation. It may also be an option in those with recurrent SVT in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency.

Hematology/oncology consultation may also be considered in patients with underlying thrombophilias or malignancies.
