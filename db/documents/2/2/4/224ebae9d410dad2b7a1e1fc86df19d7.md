Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) cryoprecipitate can help refurbish clotting factors and fibrin, depending upon availability and patient comorbidities. For the fibrinolytic agents' reversal of action, aminocaproic acid is useful because of its specific action. Aminocaproic acid should not be introduced unless there is a life-threatening hemorrhage. It inhibits intrinsic physiologic fibrinolytic activity, which may precipitate widespread thrombosis with potential end-organ damage at many sites. The drug may worsen disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.****Platelet transfusion is indicated if the platelet count is <100,000/microL.
