The clinical indications for using OCT-A have not been determined by the field as a whole, but its capabilities open a vast array of possibilities for research into the pathogenesis of diseases, disease quantification, and treatment evaluation. Below is a not all-inclusive list based on research investigating the utility of OCT-A:

- Isolate locations of vascular pathology.

- Analyze each retinal vascular plexus separately.

- Evaluate the foveal avascular zone.

- Examine the perifoveal endocapillary area.

- Examine retinal microcirculation.

- Evaluate response to anti-VEGF therapy.

**Comparing OCT-A to Fluorescein Angiography and Indocyanine Green Angiography**

Fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) require administration of intravenous dye. FA has been used in clinical practice for over 50 years and is the gold standard for the detection of retinal neovascularization, neovascularization of the disc, and choroidal neovascularization. Both FA and ICGA supply a 2D image with visualization of dynamic blood flow, such as patterns of dye leakage, pooling of dye, staining of structures.
