The equipment required for ONS include

- Electrodes and leads: There are two types of leads; percutaneous (thin and cylindrical), and surgical or paddle (broad and flat). The percutaneous leads can be inserted using a needle, while paddle leads require a surgical method. The electric field around the percutaneous lead is circumferential; it gets directed towards one side in the case of paddle leads, which helps to stimulate even at low amperage, thereby prolonging battery life.

- Anchors: These help to attach leads and extensions to connective tissue.

- Extensions: These cables come in various lengths and are used to connect leads to the power source.

- A power source (battery or internal pulse generator, IPG): It is usually implanted in a subcutaneous pocket away from the lead. The battery life depends on the amplitude and number of hours of use the device has in a day. Usually, a lithium battery lasts for 3 to 5 years, and rechargeable batteries require replacement after 7 to 9 years.
