The treatment of calcified lesions during PCI is dependent on the severity of calcium. An OCT-based scoring system, known as the calcium-volume index or rule of 5's, helps to stratify the likelihood a calcified plaque would correlate with stent under-expansion if not treated with a lesion preparation strategy. Calcified lesions involving an arc of calcium more than 50% of the vessel (greater than 180 degrees), with a thickness exceeding 0.5mm and over 5 mm in length, are most strongly associated with stent under-expansion and should be treated with atherectomy when appropriate.

The two primary atheroablative modalities for lesion preparation of severely calcified lesions before stent implantation include rotational atherectomy (RA) and orbital atherectomy (OA). Rotational atherectomy was developed by David Auth and has been in clinical use since 1988.

Orbital atherectomy is a newer modality that utilizes an eccentrically mounted, diamond-coated crown that orbits bi-directionally.

A new tool for lesion preparation of severely calcified coronary plaque is intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), which incorporates emitters that release sonic pressure waves to modify calcified plaque and fracture calcium.
