Additional attention is needed to prevent any secondary brain injury which may include advanced respiratory and cardiovascular support. Instrumentation for assessment of intracranial pressure and interventions for increased intracranial pressure may be indicated. Basic support such as bladder care and skin assessment with decubiti preventative actions should not be neglected.
