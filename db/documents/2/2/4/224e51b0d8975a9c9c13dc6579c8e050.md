Consultations in cases of suspected sarcocystosis should involve the microbiologist or tropical medicine physician trained in parasitology to identify the oocysts and sarcocysts in feces samples. In muscular sarcocystosis, a pathologist can identify the cyst with bradyzoites in the histopathology of a muscle biopsy. Treatment should be tailored, and patient-specific in the absence of standardized treatment regimens, and infectious diseases or tropical medicine clinicians may be consulted. Gastroenterologists and rheumatologists should keep the possibility of sarcocystosis in mind when treating gastroenteritis and myositis in patients with an unclear etiology.
