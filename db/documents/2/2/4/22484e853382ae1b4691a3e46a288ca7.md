Allergy to medications is the primary contraindication to the use of medications to facilitate intubation. Other contraindications include disease states and conditions that may make some drugs typically used contraindicated. NAEMSP also offers a consensus recommendation that benzodiazepines and opioids not be used as induction agents in sedation-facilitated intubation, as their safety profile is less than ideal. Etomidate is more promising, but more studies are needed.
