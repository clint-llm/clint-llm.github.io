Glucagon is the first-line treatment for beta-blocker overdose. Glucagon is only effective initially for a short time. Prolonged use of glucagon can cause tachyphylaxis, and therapy can be ineffective. Glucagon is administered intravenously (IV) as a slow bolus followed by a continuous infusion. Initial bolus doses include a 5 mg IV dose administered over one minute. Constant heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) monitoring is required. If HR and BP do not increase after 10 to 15 minutes, administer another bolus. Glucagon starts working within 1 to 3 minutes, with a peak response at 5 to 7 minutes. If there is no notable effect in 10 minutes, followed by a second bolus, then it is doubtful that an infusion would benefit the patient. If there is an increase in HR and BP, an infusion can start. The rate of the infusion is between 2 to 5 mg/hour. The goal is a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mm of Hg. If unable to achieve a MAP of 60 mmHg, the patient might require additional therapies such as calcium salts.

Treatment of anaphylaxis in the settings of beta-blocker administration is challenging. If epinephrine is ineffective, then glucagon should be administered as glucagon can reverse refractory hypotension and bronchospasm during anaphylaxis in patients on beta-blockers by activating adenyl cyclase directly.
