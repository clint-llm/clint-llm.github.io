Basilar invagination is a rare neurological disorder that may be found in isolation and poses significant treatment challenges. Because of the complexity of management, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, neurosurgeon, ICU nurses, therapists, and a radiologist. Before any treatments specific to the invagination, practitioners should screen for other associated conditions and try to avoid compromising potential surgical treatment for the invagination. Advancements in diagnostic techniques have assisted with the management of this condition. Patients with reducible invaginations potentially can avoid a combined anterior and posterior approach, requiring only posterior decompression and stabilization. The most appropriate surgical approach and fixation choices will likely remain controversial until high-level randomized trials can elucidate the most effective treatment course.

Irrespective of the type of surgery, some rehabilitation is required in most patients. Besides the physical therapist, the speech and occupational therapist are necessary to regain the function of the muscles. The social worker should be involved to ensure that the patient's home environment is safe and support systems are available. A neurology nurse should follow the patient to ensure that the patient is not worsening. Open communication between interprofessional team members is vital to improving outcomes.
