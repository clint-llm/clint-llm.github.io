Patients in respiratory distress or failure are at increased risk of requiring airway management. Therefore, airway assessment and evaluation for signs of respiratory distress or failure are essential. Patients with hypoventilation and hypoxia can present with altered mental status; patients may be anxious, confused, or obtunded. Patients in respiratory distress may have increased work of breathing characterized by dyspnea, tachypnea, hyperpnea or hypopnea, accessory muscle use, and cyanosis.
