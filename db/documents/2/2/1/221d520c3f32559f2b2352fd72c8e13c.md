**Views in recent literature:**

The term urogenital diaphragm is the term in current use for the urethral sphincter complex that is packed by a superior fascia and an inferior fascia in many of the descriptions, but this description has come under scrutiny by some authors. Some studies questioned the existence of the superior fascia as the striated sphincter urethrae are not confined to only to the deep perineal space, it even extends upwards along the urethra. The tough fibrous inferior fascia existence is undisputedly acknowledged.   The term "perineal membrane" introduced by Oelrich (1983) is in current use as a replacement for the urogenital diaphragm. The fibromuscular layer complex below the pelvic diaphragm is now called by many as perineal membrane.

The perineal membrane divides into two parts, a ventral portion, and a dorsal portion. The dorsal portion has a transverse fibrous sheet attached to the perineal body and lateral wall of the vagina. The ventral portion has many structures that are the sphincter complex of the ureter. It is a 3-dimensional complex structure rather than the previous description of the urogenital diaphragm sandwiched between two fasciae.
