The initial Holter monitor was about the size of a briefcase and comprised of an amplifier, tape recorder, electrodes attached to the individual's chest, playback unit and analyzing unit. It consisted of ten electrocardiograms leads including six standard precordial electrodes and four torso electrodes. The function of torso leads is to prevent signal disturbances. However, torso leads can show variations. To overcome these variations, investigators proposed mathematical algorithms

After continuous improvement and progress, the Holter is now the size of a small cell phone and gives two types of primary data to analyze. One is the QRS complex, and the other is the R-R interval. It continuously records until it is detached from the patient or it runs out of power, although it is usually used for 24-48Hrs. The power supply lasts 80-100 hours with a tape recording capacity of ten hours.
