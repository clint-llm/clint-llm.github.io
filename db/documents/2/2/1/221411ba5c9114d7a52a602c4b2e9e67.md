Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most common complication of myoglobinuria. Studies suggest that up to 50 % of the cases of rhabdomyolysis can cause AKI depending on the cause.

The other most common complication is electrolyte disturbance, especially hyperkalemia due to the spillage of intracellular contents from the damaged myocytes.
