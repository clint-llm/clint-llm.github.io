About 95% of primary CNS lymphomas belong to the diffuse large B cell (DLBC) category, with low-grade B cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma accounting for the rest.

Primary CNS lymphoma is a highly cellular and infiltrative tumor. Histology often displays a perivascular growth pattern called angiotropism (angiocentric patterns of lymphoid clustering).
