Vascular supply to the lumbricals arises from four different vessels. The superficial palmar arch provides the primary supply to the lumbricals, with deep palmar arch, dorsal digital arteries, and palmar digital arteries also contributing.

Lymphatic drainage of the upper limbs divides into superficial and deep lymphatic drainage. Lymphatic plexuses of the skin of the palm and dorsum of the hand ascend with the cephalic and basilic veins towards the axillary and cubital lymph nodes, respectively. Deep lymphatic vessels follow the primary deep veins and eventually terminate in the humeral lymph nodes.
