The abdominal wall surrounds the anterolateral aspect of the abdominal cavity, where many important organs are located.

Chief layers of the abdominal wall include:

- Skin,

- Superficial fascia (the subcutaneous tissue which forms the thin, single layer above the umbilicus. Below the umbilicus, it is divided into two layers (1) the fatty superficial layer called Camperâ€™s fascia and (2) the deep layer called Scarpa's fascia. Blood vessels and nerves run between these two layers.)

- Muscle,

- Fascia,

- Parietal peritoneum.
