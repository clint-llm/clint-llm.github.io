GnRH is a central regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The neurons that produce GnRH are in the hypothalamus, specifically in the infundibular nucleus. Once secreted, GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary where follicle-stimulatingÂ hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are secreted and modulate sex steroid production from the gonads.
