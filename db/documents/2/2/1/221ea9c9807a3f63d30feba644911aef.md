BRASH syndrome shares many clinical signs and symptoms with both AV nodal blocker toxicity secondary to overdose as well as hyperkalemia alone. These are important to keep on the differential as definitive management will vary. Clinical history provides clues that will help differentiate these two from BRASH syndrome. As noted above, these patients are often taking their medications as prescribed. Fingerstick glucose can help differentiate BRASH syndrome from overdose since beta-blocker toxicity often results in hypoglycemia, while hyperglycemia is common with calcium channel blocker toxicity. Potassium derangements are also not typically noted in the overdose setting.

It is well known that hyperkalemia can independently cause bradycardia. However, this is not typically seen unless the potassium levels exceed 7 mEq/L. EKG changes associated with potassium levels of 5.5 to 6.5 mEq/L include peaked T waves, while moderate hyperkalemia (6.5 to 7.0 mEq/L) is associated with a flattening of P waves and PR prolongation. It is not until serum potassium levels reach >7.0 mEq/L that there are QRS widening and bradycardia. This progression of EKG findings is common in hyperkalemia-induced bradycardia however are often absent in BRASH syndrome.
