QA and quality improvement efforts and multidimensional and successful efforts involve an industry-wide contribution from players at all levels of care delivery. The most successful efforts originate from initiatives supported at the very top of an organization. When individuals involved in all levels of an organization and all phases of quality improvement receive training in QA, each position more effectively interacts and communicates with other professionals and efforts to achieve the best results. QA training should be a priority for all allied health professionals committed to safe and efficient patient care.
