Transplant is a multidisciplinary practice. Their nephrologists and hepatologists initially see the patients before referral to a transplant surgeon. Once a referral is made, and the patient is placed on a transplant list, there are many more steps before an organ is allocated. When an organ becomes available, the transplant coordinators help with matching and allocating. The patient is then admitted for surgery, which involves the surgeons, anesthesiologists, operating room technicians, and afterward, the intensive care unit doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers. This large team of healthcare professionals, each specialized in their field, working together, and communicating effectively is the only way transplantation is a reality.
