Microscopic polyangiitis is associated with MPO-ANCA in 58% of cases and with PR3-ANCA in 26% of cases.

As explained above, the clinical manifestations of MPA stem from the activation of primed neutrophils and MPO-ANCA with receptors present on the endothelial surface.

Renal manifestations are most common, and up to 80% to 100% of individuals have some form of glomerulonephritis at onset or with disease progression. The most common manifestation is a "pauci-immune" form of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). Clinical presentation may vary from asymptomatic hematuria, sub-nephrotic proteinuria, a rise in serum creatinine, or overt renal failure. Pulmonary manifestations may be in the form of alveolar hemorrhage, which is sometimes the first presenting symptom of the disease.
