Cholangiocarcinomas demonstrate delayed persistent enhancement on CT and MRI; however, they tend to be heterogeneous on CT/MRI and less hyperintense on T2 weighted images. Additionally, they often invade and/or obstruct vasculature and bile ducts.

Hypervascular metastases should be considered in the setting of extra-hepatic malignancy. These tend to be multiple at the time of presentation and show contrast washout on delayed phase images.

Hepatic angiosarcomas also tend to be multiple at the time of presentation, demonstrate vascular invasion and are more aggressive. These also tend to show contrast washout on delayed phase imaging. Lesions may also be present within the spleen.
