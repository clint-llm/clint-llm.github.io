Spasticity is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses, pharmacists and therapists. When considering treatment for spasticity, the clinician must take into account the etiology of the spasticity, the timing of onset, medical comorbidities, the patientâ€™s support system, and the overall goals of management. As with other conditions, treatment options follow a stepwise approach, starting with more conservative routes and extending to more invasive surgical procedures.

The outcomes in chronic cases are guarded.
