Cryosurgery has a number of indications for both malignant and benign lesions.

Benign lesions that can be treated with cryosurgery include seborrheic keratosis, verruca, skin tags, molluscum contagiosum, solar lentigo and hypertrophic/keloid scars. Most of the entities can be treated with a single round of cryosurgery, but for larger or thicker lesions treatments can be repeated at 3 to 4-week intervals until the lesions have resolved. This is especially true in verruca which typically take anywhere from 2 to 6 treatments to resolve.

Pre-malignantÂ and malignant lesions that can be treated with cryosurgery include actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, and non invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Cryosurgery has been used to treat lentigo maligna melanoma with variable efficacy and recurrence rates. Actinic keratosis is commonly treated with cryosurgery. However, the treatment of malignant lesions with cryotherapy is not a first-line therapy and is typically reserved for patients who are not good candidates for excision. Large lesions that would be very disfiguring if excised or elderly patient who cannot tolerate excision are examples where cryosurgery may be indicated.
