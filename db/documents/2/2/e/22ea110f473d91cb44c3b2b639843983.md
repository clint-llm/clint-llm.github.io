The airway comprises all anatomical spaces from the nares and oral aperture down to the end of the alveolar tree in the lungs. It includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, all of which are lined internally with mucous membranes. The vocal cords in the larynx mark the transition point between the upper airway and the lower airway.

The nose consists of the external nose and the nasal cavity. The external nose is the most superficial part, made up of cartilage and bone. It continues posteriorly into the nasal cavity, which is divided in two by a septum in the midline. Each half of the cavity is bounded by a roof (formed of nasal, frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones), a floor (formed of palatine and maxilla bones), and the nasal septum (formed of ethmoid and vomer bones as well as cartilage). The nose may be used as a conduit for delivering oxygen to the patient via a nasal cannula; alternatively, tracheal tubes or nasopharyngeal airways may be passed through the nares.

The mouth consists of the mouth cavity and the vestibule. The mouth cavity is bounded by the maxilla, mandible, and teeth anteriorly; the hard and soft palate superiorly; the mandible and anterior tongue inferiorly; and the oropharyngeal isthmus posteriorly. The vestibule is the space surrounding this between the lips and cheeks on the outside and the teeth and gums on the inside.

From superior to inferior, the pharynx consists of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx. The nasopharynx is directly posterior to the nasal cavity, starting at the level of the base of the skull and continuing down to the soft palate; it contains the adenoids (nasopharyngeal tonsils). The oropharynx extends from the level of the soft palate down to the level of the tip of the epiglottis, lying behind the oropharyngeal isthmus; it contains the palatine tonsils at the sides. The laryngopharynx continues from the epiglottis down to the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra. The prevertebral fascia and the cervical vertebrae lie directly behind the pharynx along its whole length. Its walls are made of several layers of muscles with a complex neurovascular supply. Supraglottic devices such as laryngeal mask airways terminate at this level, resting at the level of the epiglottis.

The larynx is a tightly interlocked structure made up of cartilages, ligaments, and muscles. The largest structure at the front is the thyroid cartilage; its notch forms the prominent “Adam’s apple.” The ring-shaped cricoid cartilage is below this. The narrow space between them is spanned in the front by the cricothyroid ligament. The thyrohyoid ligament stretches from the upper border of the thyroid cartilage superiorly to the hyoid bone, deep in the neck. Posterior to the thyroid cartilage is the laryngeal cavity, a space that contains the upper (false) and lower (true) vocal cords. Definitive airway management requires passage of an airway device below the level of the vocal cords with a good seal, protecting the respiratory exchange zone in the lower airways from vomitus or other debris while allowing goal-directed oxygenation and positive-pressure ventilation if required.
