The typhoid vaccine is not for routine administration in the United States. Healthcare workers who offer this vaccine should be aware that, in most cases, it is recommended for the traveler who is going to part of the globe where typhoid is common. In rare situations, it may be administered to laboratory workers who work with the Salmonella typhi bacteria and those who are in close contact with a typhoid carrier. The nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and primary care provider who frequently prescribe this vaccine should educate the patients on the type of typhoid vaccine available and who should not receive it. The patient should also understand that the effectiveness of the typhoid vaccines is about 80%. Hence, they should also maintain good sanitary practices, including frequent hand washing and not drinking the local water.
