The absolute contraindication to performing fetal ultrasonography is patient refusal. Ultrasonography is generally safe during pregnancy and should only be used when indicated with the physicianâ€™s order under the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle. M-mode imaging should be used for documentation of cardiac activity, and pulse doppler is discouraged if it will not add valuable information to the examination.
