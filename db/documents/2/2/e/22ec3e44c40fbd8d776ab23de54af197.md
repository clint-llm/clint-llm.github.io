The incidence of congenital heart defects is approximately 8 per 1000 live births. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstructive lesions account for approximately 6% of congenital heart disease. SVAS accounts for less than 0.05% of all congenital heart defects. SVAS accounts for 8% to 14% of all congenital aortic stenosis. The sporadic form of SVAS is a more common than the autosomal dominant form.
