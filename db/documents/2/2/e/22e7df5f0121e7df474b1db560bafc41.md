Given the full range of clinical applications of GABA receptor antagonists, interprofessional communication, and care coordination is essential when using these medications. For example, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals all must be knowledgeable about treating benzodiazepine overdoses with flumazenil. However, flumazenilâ€™s effects are inconsistent, and not all patients may respond. Additionally, anesthesiologists carry a significant responsibility to be well-versed with GABA receptor antagonists as they may be used to reverse the effects of anesthesia. Further, as research into different GABA receptor antagonists continues to expand their clinical utility, all health professionals must keep up to date on the literature to provide the highest quality of care to their patients. An interprofessional team that prioritizes communication, collaboration, and shared decision-making through an integrated, patient-centered approach can enhance outcomes and team performance, which leads to improved patient safety. Each member of the interprofessional team is responsible for identifying complications with the treatment of GABA receptor antagonists and responding appropriately and promptly to ensure the best possible prognosis and outcome.
