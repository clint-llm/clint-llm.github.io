The standardization of SP training in SBE serves to improve patient outcomes to more fully prepare future healthcare providers. For high-frequency learning such as an OSCE, it provides students with a consistent learning experience and a venue for deliberate practice to obtain skill mastery.

To meet the demand for healthcare professionals to provide quality care to persons with disabilities, some forward-thinking SBE programs actively seek SPs with disabilities themselves to routinely integrate disability awareness throughout a curriculum.

A final point of clinical significance for SBE programs occurred with the surge in telehealth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, medical providers quickly navigated onto the telehealth platform to meet non-urgent patient needs. When students were no longer allowed to participate in clinical rotations to preserve personal protective equipment, medical educators quickly incorporated the use of telehealth with SPs to meet learner objectives.
