Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index. The recommended serum levels stand between 0.8Â to 2 ng/mL.

Electrocardiogram changes seen with digoxin demonstrate a downsloping ST-segment depression, also known as a "reverse check" sign. The ST segments may appear "scooped" without abnormal Q waves or T wave inversions.
