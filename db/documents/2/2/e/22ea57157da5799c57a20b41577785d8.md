- The terms delirium and dementia are different entities yet are used interchangeably due to their overlapping features.

- Delirium is an abrupt onset of reduced orientation to the environment in contrast to dementia, a gradual neurodegenerative process leading to the disturbance in the core features, and attention is affected much later in the disease course.

- Some exceptions to point #2 are sudden-onset cognitive decline with vascular dementia and gradual onset delirium with chronic aspirin exposure.

- Dementia is a precipitating factor for the development of delirium in elderly patients, and also delirium is an independent risk factor for the development of dementia.

- Delirium can be preventable and reversible, whereas dementia is not reversible except in normal pressure hydrocephalus and in the case of pseudodementia resulting from B12 deficiency, thyroid disorders, syphilis, and depression.

- Delirium can be superimposed on dementia due to multiple etiologies. Therefore it requires a thorough workup for the diagnosis.

- Unlike delirium, patients with dementia tend to have a state of wakefulness, and the baseline deficits tend to be fixed.

- Delirium can signify some serious underlying medical condition and can be fatal in the elderly population. Early recognition and risk stratification can help improve the outcome.

- The fluctuation in cognition is one of the core features of Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), which can mimic a delirious state. Delirium and LBD have many similarities. Parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, neuroleptic sensitivity, and other supportive neuroimaging features can help with the accurate diagnosis.

-  DSD ranges from 22% to 89% in hospital and community-dwelling individuals. DSD is underdiagnosed due to a lack of proper evaluation. Failure to recognize DSD is associated with $38 to$152 billion annually.
