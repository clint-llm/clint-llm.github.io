Pharmaceutical formulation is the multistep process where the active drug is mixed with all other components by considering the factors of particle size, polymorphism, pH, and solubility and becomes the final beneficial medicinal product. Benefits and constraints of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), valuable excipients, associated interactions, and manufacturing procedure are the four basic components for a successful pharmaceutical formulation.Â The formulation often functions in a way that includes different dosage forms. The dosage form is the pharmaceutical drug product as marketed for use with a specific mixture of active ingredients and inactive components. It has to be a particular configuration(capsule shell, for example) and distributed into a particular dose.

Pharmaceutical formulation is the formation of a pharmaceutical product, including a drug's chemical properties, formulation, and details of the treatment protocol to be implemented in the clinical application.
