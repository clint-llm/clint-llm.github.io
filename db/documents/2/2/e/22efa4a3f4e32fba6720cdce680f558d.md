Etomidate is an ultrashort-acting, non-barbiturate hypnotic intravenous anesthetic agent. It is administered only by intravenous route. Etomidate has a favorable hemodynamic profile on induction, with minimal blood pressure depression, making it ideal for shock trauma, hypovolemic patients, or patients with significant cardiovascular disease. Etomidate has been approved for use during induction of general anesthesia, rapid sequence intubation, and other indications where short-term anesthesia is warranted. In addition, etomidate is indicated for procedural sedation, maintenance of anesthesia, and short operative procedures such as reducing dislocated joints, tracheal intubation, cardioversion, dilation, curettage, or cervical conization. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) of etomidate so that providers can use it appropriately.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of etomidate that gives it its anesthetic properties.
- Review the indication for using etomidate, both on and off label.
- Describe the appropriate monitoring parameters for etomidate.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using etomidate as an anesthesia agent.
