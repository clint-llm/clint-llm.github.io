Having a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity is important to all the health professionals involved in curbing obesity. To manage and prevent obesity requires an interprofessional healthcare team to be involved in patient management, such as physicians, nurses, nutritionists, dieticians, and exercise physiologists.

As is known, obesity is an autoimmune disease and a chronic low-grade inflammation, and the inflammatory markers secreted by adipose tissue in an obese person lead to other chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cancer or worsen them, prevention is better than cure. To prevent obesity, the interprofessional team needs to educate patients regarding diet and exercise as a lifestyle change. To make it happen, every interprofessional team member, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, dieticians, and pharmacists, needs to understand the pathophysiology of obesity and its consequences to contribute from their specialties and drive better patient outcomes.
