In 2020, there are approximately 21,750 new ovarian cancer cases, which comprises 1.2% of all cancer cases. The estimated number of deaths related to it are 13,940. The 5-year relative survival rate is expected to be 48.6%. Around 15.7% of the ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed at the local stage, and about 58% at the metastasized stage, where the 5-year survival dips down to 30.2% instead of 92.6% if detected at an early stage of local spread. An average incidence rate per 100,000, age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population is 11.1 in 2012-2016. The incidence is highest in non-Hispanic whites (11.6 per 100,000), followed by American Indians and Alaska Natives (10.3 per 100,000), Hispanics (10.1 per 00,000), non-Hispanic blacks, and Asian and Pacific Islanders. Ninety percent of ovarian cancers are epithelial, with the serous subtype being the most common. Age-adjusted rates of new ovarian cancer cases are on a reducing trend based on statistical models of analysis.
