If it is the cause of ulnar entrapment, surgeons can excise the Osborne ligament to decompress the ulnar nerve. This procedure involves exposing the nerve at the elbow and noting its area of compression. At that point, a surgeon will simply cut the ligament where it lies over the nerve.  In his discovery of the band of tissue, Osborne did this by making a small incision parallel to the ulnar nerve. He then replaced the fatty tissue over the nerve before closing.  Experience shows that patients experience relief of sensorimotor symptoms, most notably numbness, immediately following decompression of this structure, with motor functions recovering completely by one week after the operation. A case report of a woman receiving this procedure after one year of symptoms revealed substantial recovery and regeneration of the compressed ulnar nerve as shown on control electroneuromyographic studies one month after the operation.
