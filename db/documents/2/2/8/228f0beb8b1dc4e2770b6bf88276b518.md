**Incidence = (New Cases) / (Population x Timeframe)**

An example will help demonstrate this equation and is provided below.

You watch a group of the 5,000 people in your town. During a five-year period, 25 individuals are newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. What is the annual incidence of diabetes mellitus for your town?

- (25 new cases diabetes mellitus)/(5,000 people x 5 years) =

- (25 new cases) / (25,000 people-year) =

- 0.001 cases/people-year =

- 1 case / 1000 people-year

The above can be interpreted as "If we watch 1,000 people in the town for one year we would expect one person, on average, to be newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus during the year of observation."

Sometimes the period of observation may be given as fractions of a year.  If the incidence can be assumed to be stable over the short term, then we can use multiplication to calculate the person-year incidence. Below is a calculation using fractionals of a year for the time period and multiplication to calculate the annual incidence as person-years:

A health worker finds that over the past three months there have been four new diagnoses of lead poisoning in children in her community.  She estimates there are 60,000 children in her community at risk for lead poisoning. If we assume a stable incidence of lead poisoning in children what is the annual person-year incidence of lead poisoning for the children at risk?

- (4 new cases/(60,000 people x 3 months)

There are two ways to solve this problem.  One method is to solve for people-months then convert the final answer into people-years.  Alternatively, we can first convert to people-years before solving.  Either method should provide the same result.  We will perform both calculations to show we get the same answer.  We will first do the approach of calculating people-months then convert to people-years.

- (4 new cases)/(60,000 people x 3 months) =

- (4 new cases)/(180,000 people-months) =

- 0.00002 cases/people-months

Now to convert from cases/people-months to cases/people-years

- (0.000022 cases/people-months) x (12 months / year) =

- 0.00026 cases/people-year =

- 0.26 cases/1,000 people-year

Let us now try the other approach of first converting people-months to people-years and calculating the incidence to show we arrive at the same answer as above.  First, we start with what we know:

- (4 new cases)/(60,000 people x 3 months)

Now we convert from people-months to people-years

- [(4 new cases)/(60,000 people x 3 months)] x (12 months / year) =

- [(4 new cases)/(60,000 people)] x ((1 / 3 months) x (12 months / year)) =

- [(4 new cases)/(60,000 people)] x (4 / year) =

- (16 new cases/(60,000 people-year) =

- 0.00026 cases/people-year =

- 0.26 cases/1000 people-year

We can see then that with either method we arrive at the same answer of 0.26 cases/1,000 people-year.  The important thing to keep in mind is that the units for all parts have the correct units.
