All members of the dental team contribute towards successful exodontia and management of the patient. The operator is responsible for thorough preparation, patient consent, and performing the required treatment. The dental assistant plays a vital role throughout this process, including retraction and suction during the treatment and provision of post-operative instructions.

The dental assistant is also crucial in being vigilant and stopping the operator should it appear that there is a risk of wrong-site surgery being performed. The whole team is important in providing reassurance to a patient throughout their treatment and making the environment feel comfortable to the patient. Overall, the entire team is crucial to a successful patient outcome.
