The clinical presentation of basophilia is diverse and related to the underlying cause. If splenomegaly is present, a myeloproliferative syndrome may be suspected. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, itching, and fatigue may be present. Right upper quadrant pain may be present. In polycythemia vera, often erythromelalgia, or burning of the palms and soles, is common. Pruritus post warm shower can be a symptom as well.

For examination of splenomegaly, a patient should be in the supine position with a relaxed abdomen. The examiner should try and insert 3 fingers into Traube's space (underneath the left side of the rib cage) during inspiration. Another technique which is also sensitive is an ultrasound examination which can lead to the same results.

If there is concurrent eosinophilia greater than 1500 cells/uL, hypereosinophilic syndrome may be considered. Symptomatology and other systemic manifestations will be related to skin or pulmonary involvement.
