The ischemia-reperfusion inflammatory reaction occurs with any injury that involves ischemic interruption of vascular flow. This includes many injuries involving crushing force, myocardial ischemia, and stroke. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment is not only an adjunctive treatment aimed at reducing ischemic tissue damage but, when used early enough post-injury, may actually mitigate the ischemia-reperfusion response altogether. By initiating hyperbaric treatment early, outcomes may be improved. [Level 5]
