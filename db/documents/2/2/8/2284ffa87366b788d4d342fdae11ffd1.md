The patient's parents need to be educated about the etiology, clinical presentation, and prognosis of hypothalamic hamartomas. As several treatment modalities are available, they have to be informed about the risks and benefits of each treatment modality, allowing them to make informed decisions. Invasive treatments provide the most excellent option for seizure prevention, and they are highly recommended.

Hypothalamic hamartomas are benign lesions, and parents must beÂ informed to avoid concerns for any potential malignant transformation or metastasis. Puberty will typically occur even after the use of GnRH agonists, and children will develop normally after surgical or ablative procedures. If any particular treatment modality fails, patients will continue with disabling seizures, declining neurocognitive behavior, and progressive neuropsychological difficulties; therefore, a combination of treatment modalities should be attempted.
