The natural history of incisional hernia is progressive enlargement over a variable time period. It can be asymptomatic or produce one or a combination of symptoms as discussed above. Possible complications include:

- Incarceration. Incarceration can be chronic nonsymptomatic as in large defect hernias, or acute and likely symptomatic incarceration

- Obstruction. Luminal obstruction of the bowel is an acute complication that may lead to more serious complications like strangulation or perforation

- Strangulation. Incarceration or obstruction can lead to strangulation, a more serious and acute complication. Strangulation should be relieved emergently.
