Usually, patients present complaining of a confined burning, tender swelling on one eyelid. Either the upper or lower lid may be involved. In some cases, the complaint may start as generalized edema and erythema of the lid that later becomes localized. Patients will frequently have a history of similar prior lesions of the eyelid. With external hordeolum, pain, edema, and swelling are localized to a discrete area of the eyelid that is tender to palpation. The stye generally appears as a pustule with mild erythema of the lid margin. Pustular exudate may be present.

Patients with internal hordeolum present with more diffuse tenderness and erythema of the lid given the relatively larger meibomian gland. Diagnosis may be made by everting the lid to reveal a small pustule of the conjunctival surface. The physical exam may appear very similar to an external hordeolum in cases when the gland is infected but without obstruction. Treatment for both internal and external hordeolum is the same, so differentiation of the two is not of significant clinical importance.

In contrast to hordeola, chalazion will have a more indolent and chronic presentation. Patients complain of non-tender nodules of the eyelid with minimal to no surrounding erythema. For persistent chalazion, chronic skin changes can develop around the underlying nodule.
