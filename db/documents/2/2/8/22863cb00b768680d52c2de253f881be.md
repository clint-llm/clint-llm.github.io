Proper specimens must be obtained to analyze fibroblasts microscopically.  The specific type of tissue is obtained by methods dependent on the organ and depth required for an accurate tissue sample. Excisional surgical specimens, punch biopsies, shave biopsies, and core biopsies are common approaches. Tissue specimens are delicate requiring preservation to allow for thin slices. The first preservation method can be through the utilization of a cryostat which rapidly freezes the tissues and slices frozen sections. The second method involves initially fixing or preserving the tissue in formalin to maintain it in a “life-like” state, processing the tissue (commonly through the addition of alcohol to dehydrate the specimen), embedding the specimen in paraffin wax, and lastly slicing sections (often with a microtome machine).
