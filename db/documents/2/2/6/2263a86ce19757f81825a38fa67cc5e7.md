**Talonavicular Ligament Injury**

Acute ankle injury is one of the leading causes of emergency department attendance; however, talonavicular ligament (TNL) injuries often remain unnoticed compared to the other ligaments causing ankle injuries (lateral ligamentous complex, anterior talofibular ligament, and calcaneofibular ligament). In 2016, a study conducted by Dea showed that TNL injury is surprisingly common, with a prevalence of 21% when someone experienced an acute ankle sprain. To date, the proven consequences of TNL injury remain unknown, but the suspicion is that the damage could alter the biomechanics of the foot and eventually leads to degenerative changes that most likely require surgical interventions.

**Tarsal Coalition**

Tarsal coalition is a condition of fused tarsal bones that leads to a rigid flat foot and foot pain. This condition resulted from an embryology anomaly caused by the failure of mesenchymal segmentation and development of fibrous, cartilage, or bone, forming coalitions of the tarsal bones. 50% of the case happens bilaterally, and 20% are multiple coalitions. Calcaneonavicular coalition is the most common type, while talocalcaneal and talonavicular types are much less common. The talonavicular coalition only represents 1% of all tarsal coalition. An elongated anterior process of the calcaneus, also known as the anteater sign, is a classic radiology indication of a calcaneonavicular coalition.Â Non-operative management includes anti-inflammatories, activity modification, and immobilization by a cast. Surgical intervention could be an option if conservative treatments did not meet a satisfying outcome. Coalition resection with interposition graft relieves the pain in most tarsal coalition cases. Subtalar arthrodesis and triple arthrodesis are indicated in more severe cases.
