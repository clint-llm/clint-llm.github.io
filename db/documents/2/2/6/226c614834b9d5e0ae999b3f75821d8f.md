The radiation of back pain associated with disc disease is thought to be due to the compression of the nerve roots in the spinal canal from either one or a combination of the following elements.

- **Disc herniation material  (i.e., herniated nucleus pulposus, HNP)**
- Varying degrees of HNP are recognized, from disc protrusion (annulus remains intact), extrusion (annular compromise, but herniated material remains continuous with disc space), to sequestered (free) fragments.
- HNP material predictably is resorbed over time, with the sequestered fragment demonstrating the highest degree of resorption potential
- In general, 90% of patients will have a symptomatic improvement in radicular symptoms within 3 months following nonoperative protocols alone.

- **Hypertrophy/expansion of degenerative tissues**
- Common sources include ligamentum flavum and the facet joint.  The facet joint itself undergoes degenerative changes (just like any other joint in the body), and synovial hypertrophy and/or associated cysts can compromise surrounding nerve roots.

In a 2010 study by Suri et al., 66.2% of 154 consecutive patients presenting with a new lumbar disk herniation noted spontaneous symptoms compared to just 26% who reported the symptoms starting after a specific household task or seemingly common non-lifting activity. Contrary to popular belief, fewer than 8% reported acute sciatica after heavy lifting or physical trauma.
