The introduction of Rho (D) immune globulin has significantly decreased the incidence rate of Rh-hemolytic disease. According to a study, the incidence rate of this hemolytic disease declined from 40.5% to 14.3% per 10,000 births during the first decade of the IVIG introduction.

The availability of advanced antenatal screening, modern diagnostic modalities, and state-of-the-art intensive healthcare facilities, especially in developed countries like the United States, have reduced the prevalence of Rh-hemolytic disease, and its associated mortality rate to a minimal level. However, as mentioned earlier, rates are still relatively higher in developing countries involving around 276 infants and neonates/100,000 live births. The mortality rate in infants with hydropic features is relatively greater than in non-hydropic newborns.
