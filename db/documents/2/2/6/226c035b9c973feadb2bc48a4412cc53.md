Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is associated with different etiologies. It is most commonly associated with connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, and antiphospholipid syndrome.

Drugs, such as antimigraine medications, interferon alpha and beta, cyclosporine, and nonselective beta blockers, can cause secondary Raynaud phenomenon.

Occupations that result in overt vibrational exposure from vibrating machinery mostly affect males. This is known as hand-arm vibration syndrome. Exposure to polyvinyl chloride, cold injury from work, or ammunition work are other occupational-associated causes of secondary Raynaud phenomenon.

In the population of patients older than 60 years, the obstructive vascular disease is a frequent cause of Raynaud phenomenon. Obstructive vascular disease causes include thromboangiitis obliterans, microemboli, diabetic angiopathy, or atherosclerosis.

Infections associated with secondary Raynaud phenomenon include parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.

Other causes of secondary Raynaud phenomenon include fibromyalgia, polycythemia, arteriovenous fistula, myalgic encephalitis, or malignancy.
