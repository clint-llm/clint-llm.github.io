Clinicians who manage overdose patients should establish the need for ongoing treatment of their substance use disorder. In the absence of acute medical and psychiatric complications, the patient can be discharged from the hospital and referred for addiction care. This can include outpatient counseling and maintenance treatment with methadone or buprenorphine, or naltrexone.
