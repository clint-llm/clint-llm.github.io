Malunion of supracondylar fractures often leads to cubitus varus, or "gunstock deformity." This condition is a triplanar malalignment of the elbow, characterized by varus angulation in the coronal plane, extension in the sagittal plane, and internal rotation in the transverse plane. This activity covers the presentation, diagnosis, and management of cubitus varus, enabling clinicians to address this condition when it presents in practice.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical presentation of cubitus varus.
- Describe the steps required to evaluate cases of suspect cubitus varus.
- Summarize the management options available for cubitus varus.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and rehabilitation for patients with cubitus varus.
