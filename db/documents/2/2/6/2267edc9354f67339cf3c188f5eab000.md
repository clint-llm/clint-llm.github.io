Heart disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States and throughout the entire world.

As heart failure is seen worldwide, it is of clinical importance to understand the physiology and management of this disease. Symptomatic heart failure is typically managed with vasodilators, diuretics, positive inotropes, or digoxin. The ideal therapy would consist of a diuretic and a vasodilator, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or hydralazine plus isosorbide dinitrate. Depending on the patient's presentation, this therapy would occur with or without digoxin.

As a clinician, it is crucial to talk with each patient about the importance of cardiovascular health. Simply put, the stronger the heart muscles are, the more efficient they become. Regular aerobic exercise is of great importance in the overall health of cardiac muscles and helps strengthen muscle tissue, lowering the risk of stroke and heart attack. Examples of aerobic exercise include running or walking, swimming, cycling, dancing, and climbing stairs.
