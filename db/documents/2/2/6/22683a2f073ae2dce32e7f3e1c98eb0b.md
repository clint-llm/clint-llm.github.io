Foville syndrome is one of many stroke syndromes that localizes to the pons. Table 1 outlines additional pontine stroke syndromes regarding the location of infarction. Blood supply to the pons derives from branches of the vertebrobasilar system. After the formation of the basilar artery via the merging of vertebral arteries, smaller paramedian perforating branches of the basilar artery supply each side of the paramedian caudal pons, an area that has critical structures, affected in Foville syndrome.
