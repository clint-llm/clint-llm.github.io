Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was first described by Dr. Petersdorf and Dr. Beesom in 1961. FUO was defined as a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Centigrade) or higher with a minimum duration of three weeks without an established diagnosis after an intensive one-week investigation in the hospital. Today, due to technological advances allowing for sophisticated outpatient evaluations, the one-week inpatient investigation is no longer required. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of fever of unknown origin and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the workup of a patient with a fever of unknown origin.
- Outline the causes for fever of unknown origin.
- Summarize the treatment of patients with fever of unknown origin.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by fever of unknown origin.
