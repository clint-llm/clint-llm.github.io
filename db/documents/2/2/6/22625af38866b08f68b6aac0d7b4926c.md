Renal oncocytomas are common benign renal neoplasms that account for 3% to 7% of all renal neoplasms.

Oncocytomas have classic gross features of a well-circumscribed tan or mahogany colored mass with a central stellate scar.

Histologically they are classically well-circumscribed lesions with nested architecture, bland cytology, regular nuclei with prominent central nuclei, and eosinophilic cytoplasm.
