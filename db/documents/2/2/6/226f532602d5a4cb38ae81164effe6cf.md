Minimum detectable visual acuityÂ measures the ability to differentiate between the intensity of the object and the background. In other words, it is a threshold of minimum detectable changes in contrast.

Minimum resolvable acuity and minimum recognizable acuity are limited by the spatial distance between the photoreceptors, aberrations, and pupil size (diffraction). When an object made of repeating black and white stripes is used to test visual acuity, there is a maximum spatial frequency beyond which the human visual system either sees a gray field or aliasing happens.

Minimum discriminable visual acuity is called hyperacuity, as it is much finer than what can be explained by the spatial separation between the photoreceptors. This threshold is smaller than the foveal cone size (2.5 microns or 30 seconds of arc); the foveal cone size is considered a limiting factor for visual acuity.
