The incidence of sensorineural hearing loss varies in different countries. In the United States, sudden SNHL affects between 5-27 per 100,000 people each year, with approximately 66,000 new annual cases.

Congenital hearing loss is nearly always sensorineural in nature, and can have various etiologies. In patients with robust prenatal care, congenital infectious causes such as cytomegalovirus are rare and the most common causes are genetic. There are many genetic syndromes with hearing loss as a component, and SNHL developing in childhood warrants a thorough workup.
