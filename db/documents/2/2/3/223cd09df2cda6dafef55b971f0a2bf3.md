An underlying assumption is that an ICP reading at one point is equivocal, and the mirror reflects the global pressure throughout the brain. However, it is confounded by the pressure gradient within the ventricular system as well as the parenchyma brain interface. The accuracy and precision over time (drift) and in vivo calibration of different ICP measurement systems are also a concern.

Difficulties in catheter placement in severe brain edema with slit ventricles can complicate intraventricular monitoring of ICP.

**Complications of Ventricular Catheter-based ICP Monitoring**

- Intracranial and tract hemorrhage - 10%

- Infection (ventriculitis) - 20%

- Technical failure (failure to tap ventricle or misplacement) - 5%

- The cost for placing an external ventricular drain (EVD) amounts to around $200, with transducers costing an extra $400 to 600

- Over drainage can lead to aneurysmal rebleed and complicate the upward transtentorial herniation in cases of hydrocephalus

- Kinks and blockage by air, blood, and debris are also frequent, leading to the poor and false recording of the ICP

- There can be localized elevations of ICP due to compartmentalization from mass lesions.
