Treatment of dissociated vertical deviation can vary from observation, non-surgical or surgical.

- Observation – This might be sufficient in patients with latent DVD, especially more than 8 years of age, when the risk of amblyopia is not of concern, small degrees of anomalous head postures, not a significant cosmetic blemish.

- Non-surgical – Conservative therapy, in the form of changing the fixation pattern or encouraging fusion, can be useful for small deviations. A slight optical blur induced in the fixating eye example by adding a +2D lens shifts the fixation preference to the other eye, and thus, DVD is avoided.

- Surgical – This is indicated when there is greater than +2 deviation, large DVD frequently manifests, anomalous head posture, or a significant cosmetic blemish. Several surgical options for DVD have been described in the literature. Important ones among these include:

- Inferior oblique weakening

- Anteriorization of the inferior oblique

- Anteriorization of inferior oblique with resection

- Superior rectus large recession (7 to 10 mm)

- Faden operation with superior rectus recession of 3 to 5 mm

- Inferior rectus resection – 4 mm for small deviations, 6 mm for intermediate deviations, and 8mm for large deviations

- Anteronasal transposition of inferior oblique

- Inferior rectus tucking

- Four muscle oblique surgery

The surgical treatment can be planned based on the grade of the DVD and the presence or absence of inferior oblique (IO) overaction.

- DVD with no IO overaction - Superior rectus recession + inferior rectus resection

- Moderate DVD with IO overaction - Recession with anteropositioning of IO

- Severe DVD with IO overaction - Recession with anteropositioning of IO + superior rectus recession (7 to 10 mm)
