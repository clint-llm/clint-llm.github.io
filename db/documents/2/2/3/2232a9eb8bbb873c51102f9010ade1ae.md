# Introduction

Pseudocholinesterase is a serine hydrolase enzyme primarily produced in the liver that catalyzes the hydrolysis of choline esters, most prominently succinylcholine and mivacurium.

In addition to possessing multiple names, the enzyme exists in many pharmacogenetic variations, with butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) operating as the primary human cholinesterase form. When comparing concentrations within the human plasma, the ratio of pseudocholinesterase (BuChE) to true cholinesterase (AChE) overwhelmingly favors BuChE by a ratio of 1000 to 1.

# Fundamentals

Butyrylcholinesterase functions primarily as a serine hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of choline and non-choline esters and maintains active as aryl acrylamide, amplifying the action of trypsin and other proteases within the body.

# Issues of Concern

Pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholine esterase) deficiency causes increased sensitivity to choline ester muscle relaxant medications: succinylcholine and mivacurium. In correlation to the level/variant of BuChE deficiency, patients exposed to these neuromuscular blockade agents may experience an amplified duration of apnea and paralysis ranging from mild to extreme.

Should persistent respiratory depression occur, most commonly due to succinylcholine administration in the presence of BuChE deficiency, the mainstay of therapy focuses on prolonged ventilatory support. Positive pressure ventilation is required until skeletal muscle regains adequate neuromuscular function following passive diffusion of succinylcholine from the neuromuscular junction.

# Molecular Level

The coding gene for BuChE coincides with multiple polymorphisms, resulting in wide variability in the level of activity of each variant, including silent variants with little to no enzymatic function.

# Testing

The diagnosis of pseudocholinesterase deficiency most commonly occurs through family history and clinical context of prolonged apnea and paralysis following depolarizing neuromuscular blockade via succinylcholine. With an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and a heterozygous gene frequency ranging from 1 in 25 to 1 in 50, it is imperative for family members of known homozygotes to undergo testing for the presence of an altered BCHE gene.

# Pathophysiology

The onset of pseudocholinesterase deficiency may occur through either inheritable (genetic) or acquired pathways. Regardless of its etiology, pseudocholinesterase deficiency usually does not result in clinically significant effects until the enzyme activity decreases to less than 75% of normal activity levels.

The genetic inheritance of pseudocholinesterase deficiency occurs through an autosomal recessive pattern, with frequencies of approximately 1 in 50 to 1 in 3000 individuals for heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively.

Acquired conditions that decrease the activity of the BuChE enzyme include malnutrition, advanced age, malignancy, liver/kidney disease, pregnancy, burns, and organophosphate poisoning. In contrast, obesity and chronic alcoholism are suspected to increase pseudocholinesterase activity levels. Medications such as aspirin, metoclopramide, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, oral contraceptives, and anticholinesterase agents may also influence the enzyme's activity.

# Clinical Significance

There is conflicting evidence as to whether pseudocholinesterase deficiency plays a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, increased levels of BuChE and altered structure/function of the enzyme are observable in patients with Alzheimer's disease, specifically within the pathognomonic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

Plasma cholinesterase levels were significantly higher in patients with drug addictions (most notably, cocaine) than those without, suggesting it serves a significant role in addiction pathophysiology.

Hepatocytes function as the primary synthesis pathway for plasma cholinesterase. Serum levels of plasma cholinesterase may serve as a valuable biomarker of liver function with an excellent correlation to the currently accepted standards of serum albumin, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and MELD score (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease).
