It should be remembered that the sudden stoppage of oxygen at the onset of toxicity may at times aggravate symptoms. The onset and rate of progression of oxygen toxicity can be influenced by a variety of conditions, procedures and drugs. Induction of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, by exposure to non-lethal levels of hyperoxia/hypoxia isoloated or conjointly has been tried successfully in animals and is in the process of being evaluated in man
