Germ cell tumors arise from the gonads, most commonly noted from testicles in men and very rarely from ovaries in women. Non-gonadal origin is rare and can include midline structures such as the mediastinum, retroperitoneum, pineal, or suprasellar areas.

Testicular formation during embryonic development relies on the migration of primordial germ cells from the proximal epiblast to the dorsally located urogenital ridge. The leading hypothesis suggests that there is a stop during their descent, which later leads to tumor formation in the anterior mediastinum. The alternative hypothesis is the reverse migration of transformed germ cells in the gonads. Common genetic cell origin data support this idea; however, it does not explain some of the biological differences observed.
