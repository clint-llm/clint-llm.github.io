**Other Strategies to Reduce Medication Errors**

Over the years, hospitals have developed strategies to prevent medication errors. Some of these strategies include the following:

- Double-check the dosing and frequency of all high-alert medications. The Institute of Safe Medication Practices provides a list of high-alert medications.

- If unsure about the drug or the dose, speak to the pharmacist.

- If the writing is illegible, do not give the medication believing that you think you know what it is. Call the healthcare provider to confirm the drug or dose.

- Recheck the calculation to ensure that the patient will get the right therapeutic dose.

- Ask another clinician to recheck your calculations.

**Preventing Medication Errors**

- Always write one prescription for each medication.

- Besides signing the prescription, always circle your name on the preprinted prescription pad.

- Do not hesitate to check the dose and frequency if you are not sure.

- Always consider the fact that each medication has the potential for adverse reactions.

- Do not use drug abbreviations when writing orders.

- Always add the patient’s age and weight to each prescription.

- Check for liver and renal function before ordering any medication.

- Spell out the frequency and route of dosage; do not use abbreviations.

- Always specify the duration of therapy; do not say give out "XXX" number of pills.

- Always be aware of high-risk medications.

- When writing a prescription, state the condition being treated.
