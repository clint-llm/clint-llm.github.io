Refractory diabetic wounds are often chronically or acutely infected and have compromised vascularity. Arterial compromise is usually of the small distal arteries, but larger arteries can also be involved. There can be venous congestion causing venous stasis ulcers in conjunction with arterial compromise and other changes associated with diabetes, such as neuropathy and edema.
