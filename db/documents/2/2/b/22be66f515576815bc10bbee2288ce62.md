Proper patient positioning is essential for accurate diagnosis with all imaging modalities. In magnetic resonance imaging, patient positioning is vital to obtain good quality and, ultimately, an appropriate diagnosis. However, there are numerous approaches for patient positioning concerning anatomical reference and/or pathology. It is essential to be aware of 'coils,' which are accessories within the MRI with variable sizes and properties designed to transmit and receive signals from the regions of interest.

How does magnetic resonance work?

Using a strong magnet, a powerful magnetic field is produced and forces the body protons to be aligned with that field. A specific pulse sequence then applied to these protons made them spin out of the normal equilibrium state. The pulse sequence is turned off, which resulted in the protons returning to the original alignment with the field. The re-alignment process occurs in a variable time and releases energy detected by MRI sensors to reflect the various tissues, which is then converted into an image.

**Contraindications to Magnetic Resonance Imaging**The current contraindications for MRI are:**Metallic Implant**

- Vascular clips: especially the ferromagnetic clips. If the clips are made of titanium or other non-ferromagnetic substance, the scan can be performed.

- Foreign bodies: there is a potential risk of foreign material to get displaced and damaging the vital structures. If there is any suspension about the foreign material, the exam must be canceled.

- Coronary and peripheral artery stents: nowadays, most of these stents are made of non-ferromagnetic materials, and the studies showed that MRI could be done safely.

- Aortic stent-grafts

- Prosthetic heart valves and annuloplasty rings

- Cardiac occluder devices

- Vena cava filters and embolization coils

- Hemodynamic monitoring and temporary pacing devices

- Hemodynamic support devices

- Permanent cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators

- Retained transvenous pacemaker and defibrillator leads

- Permanent contraceptive devices

- Cochlear implants

**Other Potential Contraindications**

- Tattoos and cosmetics

- Claustrophobia

- Pregnancy and postpartum

**Special Patient Conditions**

**Obese patients:**obesity carry challenges with regards to safety and performance. Among these is the challenge of fitting the patient into the scanner. Nowadays, most vendors design the 70 cm diameter scanner bore that almost carries no difficulties; however, this requires a broad imaging view and negatively impacts the image quality.

**Anxious patients:**the enclosing nature of the bore may exaggerate any nervous disorders. Here are a few tips on how to help the anxious patient:

- If the coil has a mirror, make sure to adjust it so that the patient can see the out of the magnet.

- When feasible, use the prone position to image the patient as this position allows the patient to see out of the magnet.

- Remove the pillow from the patient's head to allow a good distance from the face and the magnet. Tell the patient to close the eyes when comfortable to do so.

- Tell the patient that they can exit out of the magnet at any time and may refuse the exam. That will make them feel that they have control.

**Pediatric patient**: Children often have difficulty tolerating MRI due to long scanning times and loud, noisy exams. The problem is especially evident for children under six, as they found it difficult to stay still and follow the breathing instructions.
