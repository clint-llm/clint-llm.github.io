Beta-1 selective blockers are used to treat hypertension and many other heart diseases worldwide. In addition, Bisoprolol is indicated in patients with compensated heart failure along with metoprolol and carvedilol. Therefore, interprofessional healthcare team members, including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, should be cautious when withdrawing bisoprolol as it can cause life-threatening tachycardia, rebound hypertension, and in some cases, angina. With careful monitoring of the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and renal function, the clinician must know the possible side effects and the means to address them.

Bisoprolol masks hypoglycemia in a patient with diabetes, so health care staff should be aware of all the side effects of the drug. Bisoprolol toxicity from accidental overdose is also possible in a patient with hypertension, so it is essential to know how to antagonize the drug's effect. Pharmacists must be aware of the required doses of the drug to each patient and perform medication reconciliation. Nurses can counsel the patients regarding administration and, along with the pharmacist, counsel the patient on potential adverse effects. Pharmacists and nurses need to report any issues with the therapy regimen to the prescribing clinician for corrective action. With this type of interprofessional collaboration, bisoprolol can achieve its therapy goals with minimal adverse events. [Level 5]
