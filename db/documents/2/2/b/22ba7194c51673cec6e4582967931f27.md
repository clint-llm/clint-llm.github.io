The thyroglossal duct is a connection that serves as a pathway for the primordium thyroid gland in its embryogenesis. This pathway originates at the junction of the anterior two-thirds and the posterior third of the tongue at its base. This pathway commences at the foramen caecum, goes anteriorly, and ends at 2nd and 3rd cartilage of the trachea, where the thyroid ends its trajectory and matures. In its trajectory, the thyroglossal duct passes anteriorly to the forming hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage, until it finally reaches its final position, anterolaterally, at the superior portion of the trachea.
