**Pearls**

- Neonatal hearts are dependent on heart rate for cardiac output as they have decreased ventricular compliance.

- Neonatal vascular pressures change with an increased exposure to oxygen, seen as a decrease in PVR and an increase in SVR from the loss of the low-pressure placenta.

- Neonates possess a dominant parasympathetic tone placing them at risk for bradycardic episodes under stressful circumstances.

- Neonates are obligate nasal breathers, and their airway anatomy is small relative to head size.

- Neonate’s subglottic area is the narrowest portion of their airway.

- Neonates have inefficient respiratory mechanics, a compliant rib cage, paradoxical chest movements, smaller and fewer alveoli, decreased FRC, and higher closing capacities with higher oxygen consumption.

- Neonates are more subject to respiratory fatigue due to a large proportion of Type I slow-twitch fibers.

- Neonates are born with a high percentage of HbF, which has a stronger affinity for oxygen, causing lower partial pressure of oxygen and a left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.

- Neonates lack cerebral autoregulation and have an immature blood-brain barrier.

- The neonatal spinal cord ends at L3, and the dural sac ends at S4.

- Neonates are more susceptible to hypothermia given their increased body surface area to weight ratio and use brown fat for thermogenesis.

- Neonates' immature liver function puts them at risk for hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, impaired drug metabolism, and coagulopathies.

- Neonates have an increase in TBW, which can cause dilution and therefore decrease the efficacy of some medications.

- Neonatal kidneys have a limited RBF and low GFR, making it difficult to handle large fluid volumes and efficiently regulate electrolytes.
