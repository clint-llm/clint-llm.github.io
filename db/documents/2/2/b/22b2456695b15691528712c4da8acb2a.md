Orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) is caused due to rapidly increasing intra-orbital pressure and can lead to permanent blindness. OCS is a sight-threatening condition. This activity describes orbital compartment syndrome (OCS) and how it can lead to irreversible vision loss, and it explains the role of emergency medicine physicians and the interprofessional team in evaluating and diagnosing OCS and treating the patients with lateral orbital canthotomy to lessen the probability of permanent vision loss.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for lateral orbital canthotomy.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with orbital compartment syndrome.
- Describe the importance of lateral orbital canthotomy performed in a timely fashion.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with orbital compartment syndrome.
