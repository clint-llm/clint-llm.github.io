According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 73.5 million or **31.7%**of adults in the United States have high levels of LDL-C and are at twice the risk for heart disease than people with normal levels. Only 48.1% are receiving treatment to lower LDL-C levels.Â Recent data suggests that the classic disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia has a prevalence of estimate of 1/300,000 as homozygous and 1/250 as a heterozygote. In certain populations such as the French Canadians, Lebanese, and Afrikaners it could be as high as 1/100.

In the US, the highest level of LDL cholesterol occurs in Hispanic males, followed by African Americans and white males. Overall, elevated LDL-C is more common in females than in males.
