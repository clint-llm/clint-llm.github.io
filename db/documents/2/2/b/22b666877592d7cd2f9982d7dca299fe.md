Mitral valve commissurotomy is the technique used to repair mitral valve stenosis. Mitral stenosis is most commonly due to rheumatic heart disease. There are multiple techniques used for the repair of mitral stenosis. The closed technique which does not use cardiopulmonary bypass was very popular in the past but this has been replaced with either open repair with cardiopulmonary bypass or the percutaneous method which uses balloon dilation of the valve. This activity reviews the procedure and indications of mitral valve commissurotomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in carrying out this procedure successfully.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for performing mitral commissurotomy.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to repair of mitral stenosis using mitral commissurotomy.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of the potential complications of mitral valve stenosis repair using mitral commissurotomy.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the repair of mitral valve stenosis and improve outcomes.
