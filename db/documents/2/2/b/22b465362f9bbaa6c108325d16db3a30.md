The muscles of the back categorize into three groups. The intrinsic or deep muscles are those muscles that fuse with the vertebral column. The second group is the superficial muscles, which help with shoulder and neck movements. The final group is the intermediate muscles, which help with the movement of the thoracic cage. Only the intrinsic muscles are considered true back muscles.
