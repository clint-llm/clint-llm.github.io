Dislocation of the radial head with a concurrent fracture of the ulna is known as a Monteggia fracture.

Monteggia fractures classify into four types. The injury commonly occurs through forced pronation of the forearm, such as falling on an extended and pronated upper limb.

Dislocation of the radial head without a concurrent fracture, nursemaid’s elbow, can also occur and is also seen in children.

Classically, pediatric patients will present with the arm held in slight flexion and slight pronation.  Reduction techniques include either the supination and hyperflexion maneuver with the thumb reduction force applied over the radial head or the hyperpronation technique.  Recurrence is uncommon but can occur, especially in patients younger than three years of age.  Immobilization is not necessary for first-time events. If recurrence is noted multiple times within a short period, cast immobilization merits consideration with the arm held in flexion and neutral to slight forearm supination position.
