V-Series nerve agents are organophosphate esters that are used as chemical weapons. They are extremely potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Biological effects include seizures, salivation, lacrimation, urination, diaphoresis, diarrhea, vomiting, miosis, and muscles spasms. As little as a few milligrams of some V-series agents can be lethal to humans.
