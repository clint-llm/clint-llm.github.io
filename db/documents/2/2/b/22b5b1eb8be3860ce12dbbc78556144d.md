Central sensitization of pain occurs when the patient's nervous system is persistently in a high activity state, which decreases sensitivity to fire action potentials. When this happens, though the peripheral nervous system provides limited input, the central nervous system responds as if there has been a high level of painful stimuli. An increase in the action potential firing leads to amplifying neural signaling. Patients become hypersensitive to pain. This state of high alert is commonly known as the wind-up; clinically, it is known as temporal summation. Ordinary touch may reproduce pain (allodynia), or potentially painful stimulus appear worse (hyperalgesia).

Central pain syndrome is also known as centralized pain, central pain, central sensitization, and widespread or diffuse pain. It is relatively common and has genetic and environmental influences predisposing patients. Patients with multiple chronic disease states can experience localized and centralized pain. For example, centralized pain often occurs in patients with fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome, and it also presents following neurological injuries such as a stroke or a spinal cord injury. Therefore, healthcare providers must identify who is at risk for centralized pain.

Centralized pain is associated with memory loss and worsening anxiety. The treatment of central pain is different from nociceptor pain. It often requires patients to take antidepressants and anticonvulsants to provide adequate pain relief. Traditional pain relievers, such as NSAIDs or opioids, often are not useful. Central pain syndrome can lead to a chronic and disabling illness that causes a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Reports exist of widespread generalized pain in up to one-fifth of adult patients.
