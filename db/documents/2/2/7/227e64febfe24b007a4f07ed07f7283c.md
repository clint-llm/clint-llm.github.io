**Pes Planus**

For children, surgery is only a consideration in cases of rigid pes planus, which is rare. Rigid pes planus occurs in association with congenital virtual talus, accessory navicular bone, tarsal coalition, or another congenital hindfoot pathology. In adults, surgery is added to the treatment plan once other therapies have been exhausted. Pes planus is a topic for further discussion in the following section.

**Pes Cavus**

A possible treatment for severe cases of pes cavus includes surgery. Operative intervention may be important as deformities continue to worsen and muscles become imbalanced. Surgery is recommended before there are signs of degenerating joints and fixed deformities. Surgical options include in-phase or out-of-phase tendon transfers. Operative treatment plans may also be necessary to correct other pathologies that are associated with subtle pes cavus. More information about pes cavus appears in the next section.

**Plantar Fasciitis**

Surgery is the last option for treatment and should only merit consideration if the condition worsens or becomes chronic and other therapies have not been successful. A discussion of plantar fasciitis appears in the next section.
