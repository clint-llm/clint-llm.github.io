Optic ischemia, especially NAION, can mimic optic neuritis as there is sudden vision loss, RAPD, and optic disc swelling with associated hyperemia. Points that help in differentiating two diseases are that in optic neuritis:

- Affect patients age less than 40 years

- Eye movements are painful

- Visual field loss is central

- On fluorescein angiography, there is no delayed disc filling

Contrast enhancement MRI may help in differentiating the two. The affected optic nerve appears normal in NAION, but there is an enhancement of the optic nerve in optic neuritis with the use of gadolinium.

Optic nerve compression can mimic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Compression can occur from tumors of the optic nerve, orbital inflammatory disease, ophthalmic artery aneurysm. Contrast imaging of the full length of the optic nerve is appropriate to differentiate other causes from optic nerve ischemia.

Sometimes fundus picture of optic disc drusen can mimic optic ischemia. The optic disc in ODD appears elevated and small. Disc blurring occurs due to the stasis of axoplasmic flow in axons. Most of the patients don't experience any visual symptoms. Transient visual obscurations are experienced by a few patients.
