Evaluation of patients exposed to nerve agents should be based on the environment in which they were exposed. Immediate decontamination with copious showering and removal of all clothes is critical to prevent further exposure to both the victim and health care providers. For patients coming from a known or highly probable terrorist incident, identifying the specific nerve agent should not delay treating the symptoms. The general treatment for all organophosphate agents is the same and staying vigilant for the signs of cholinergic crisis can help steer your diagnosis and management. Evaluation and treatment should follow the standard airway, breathing, circulation priorities after precautions to protect self and staff from secondary exposure are taken. Special attention should be paid to the respiratory system as its failure is most likely to lead to the mortality of the patient.

No laboratory test to identify these agents are available for use in real-time. There are several tests used to detect exposure to nerve agents. For quick non-specific detection in the field, the military and similar institutions utilize M8 or M9 paper. However, to identify the specific nerve agents GC-MS or Ion Spectrum Mobility are used.
