Preparation is the key to a safe and successful endotracheal intubation. Providers should monitor heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and preferably, end-tidal throughout the procedure. A provider skilled in airway management including bag-mask ventilation should be at the bedside monitoring the patient. Equipment should be checked at the bedside before attempting endotracheal intubation.

Equipment includes suction, appropriate-sized bag and mask, oxygen source, appropriate size endotracheal tubes including a size larger and one size smaller, laryngoscope and appropriate-sized laryngoscope blades (including one size smaller and one size larger), endotracheal tube-securing equipment (tape or other), stethoscope, appropriate sized nasogastric tubes, and in most cases, x-ray equipment to confirm appropriate placement.

IV or IO access should be obtained before intubation attempts, and the appropriate drug should be drawn up and available before attempting intubation. Patients should be bagged with 100% oxygen to create an oxygen reservoir in the blood before attempting intubation. Once the endotracheal tube is in place, tube placement should be confirmed with a CO2-detecting device, auscultation of good breath sounds bilateral, confirmation of chest rise with bagging, the absence of "breath sounds" over the stomach, and appropriate clinical response (O2 saturation, HR, BP, end-tidal CO2). Tube position should be confirmed via x-ray as well.
