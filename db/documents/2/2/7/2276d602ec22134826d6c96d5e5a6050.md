The most crucial aspect in the diagnosis of bot fly myiasis is travel history. Travel history should include specific locations visited in Central and South America as well as the African tropics. Clinicians should ask about activities done while traveling, which may increase the risk of exposure, such as hiking and other outdoor activities. The examiner should ask about specific encounters with mosquitoes, other flying insects, and ticks. Complaints from patients are typically only related to the region of the infestation.

Patients describe a slow-growing nodule with swelling, usually noticed a week after an initial insect bite.
