Initially, the general nature of this condition should indicate minor, low-cost interventions such as NSAIDs and rest. If the condition persists, the clinician may consider therapeutic mixed steroid and anesthetic injections. Only if the condition continues to be resistant or other etiologies are indicated by the workup for this patient presentation should more invasive and/or expensive test be used. Treatment of ischial bursitis is relatively symptom driven. Primary treatment is lifestyle modification by stopping the activity that caused bursitis in the first place, whether it was a physical activity or sitting for long periods on hard surfaces. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen work well to decrease inflammation, and a regimen of daily intake for two weeks may help prevent further inflammation. Naproxen also may help reduce the pain associated with this condition.

Cold compresses may help in the short term to minimize pain from swelling. If the pain is unbearable or unrelenting, an intrabursal corticosteroid injection with lidocaine is an option. The lidocaine will help by providing immediate relief from the pain by blocking the sodium channels in the surrounding tissue, inhibiting the transmission of the pain signal. The corticosteroid will provide prolonged anti-inflammatory protection by inhibiting the inflammatory mediators. Patients will most likely be symptom-free within days to weeks without treatment.
