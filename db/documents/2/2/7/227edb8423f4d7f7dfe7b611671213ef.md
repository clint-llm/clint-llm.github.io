Anemia of chronic renal disease, also known as anemia of chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a form of normocytic, normochromic, hypoproliferative anemia. It is frequently associated with poor outcomes in chronic kidney disease and confers an increased mortality risk. Therefore, treatment is directed toward improving renal function, when possible, and increasing red blood cell production. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplementation constitute the treatment of choice for anemia of chronic renal disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of the anemia of chronic renal disease. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of individuals affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of anemia of chronic renal disease.
- Describe how to diagnose anemia of chronic renal disease.
- Review the management of the anemia of chronic renal disease. 
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to enhance the management of patients with anemia of chronic renal disease.
