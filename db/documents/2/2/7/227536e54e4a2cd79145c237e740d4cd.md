Treatment of PSP is supportive. If the ingestion of shellfish occurred recently, gastric lavage might be performed, and activated charcoal may be given. Studies in rats and guinea pigs have shown that 4-aminopyridine can reverse the flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure caused by saxitoxin, however, no studies have been performed in humans. Treatment of ASP is also supportive; respiratory support and correction of hemodynamic instability and cardiac dysrhythmias may be necessary. Treatment of DSP includes replacement of electrolyte and fluid loss. Depending on the method of exposure and presenting symptoms, treatment of NSP may include removing the patient from exposure to brevetoxins, airway management, bronchodilators, fluid replacement, and general supportive care.
