Postoperative care is standard as with other open-heart surgical operations via median sternotomy. Ambulation on postoperative day one is encouraged. Drainage tube removal follows as per institutional routine. Depending on mobility, postoperative cardiac rehabilitation and/or physical therapy are reasonable, particularly in deconditioned or older patients.
