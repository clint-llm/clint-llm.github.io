An interprofessional team-best manages this disease.  The primary care, nurse practioner, or emergency room physician is often the first to encounter these patients. Prompt referral to an oncologist/hematologist is recommended when lymphoma is suspected.  These patients may present with subcutaneous lesions and sometimes symptoms of HPS.  A comprehensive patient evaluation, laboratory tests, and punch biopsy help clarify the diagnosis.  Treatment most commonly includes immunosuppressive agents or systemic corticosteroids. The oncology nurse and pharmacist should educate the patient on the adverse effects of the chemotherapeutic agents and the duration of therapy. Continued monitoring of blood work is necessary. In addition, patients must be educated on aseptic techniques, hand washing, and avoid crowds during treatment.  If HPS is present, treatment will be more aggressive.

With an interprofessional team approach, the 5-year survival exceeds 80%.
