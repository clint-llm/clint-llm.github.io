The diagnosis and management of radiation-induced brain necrosis are complex and best done with an interprofessional team including neurology nurses. There is no optimal treatment for this pathology and recently HBO has been advocated. However, there are no good randomized trials on the use of HBO for radiation-induced brain necrosis. Some reports indicate positive results but the recovery is prolonged. One should not forget that HBO therapy is not benign and is also associated with a number of complications that may adversely affect outcomes.
