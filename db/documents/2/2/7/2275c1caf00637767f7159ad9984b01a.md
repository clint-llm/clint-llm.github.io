The rate of myelomeningocele in the United States is between 0.3 and 1.43 per 1,000 live births, with regional differences.

It is estimated that one-third of myelomeningocele patients will require tethered spinal cord release in childhood, with the incidence of symptomatic spinal cord tethering increasing during periods of rapid growth.
