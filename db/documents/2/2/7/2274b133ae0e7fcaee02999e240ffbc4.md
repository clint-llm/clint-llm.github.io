Patients in the early years of life (infant age) are at high risk, specifically those infants who have severe congenital disabilities, resulting in poor outcomes and, thus, a high morbidity and mortality rate. Patients are most vulnerable in the first year of life and more prone to have an infection, require frequent hospitalization, and need complex surgeries, including congenital heart surgery. In late childhood through adulthood, more common causes of death include infection, aspiration, and obstructive sleep apnea. Widespread bilateral coloboma resulting in poor vision, brain malformation, microcephaly,Â lead to poor prognosis.
