There is no specific clinical finding of hypercalciuria itself, but it should be suspected in cases of calcium nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, urinary crystalluria and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Hypercalciuria also can cause hematuria even without any detectable stone formation, particularly in children. The cause is thought to be from focal and microscopic tissue damage from tiny calcium crystals and focal stones that are too small to be diagnosed with standard techniques. 24 hour urinary chemistry testing makes the definitive diagnosis.
