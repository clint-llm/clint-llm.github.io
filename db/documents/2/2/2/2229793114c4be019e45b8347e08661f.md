In at least thirty percent of the population, one can find accessory renal arteries. In rare cases, there are aberrant renal arteries that do not enter the renal hilum but the renal capsule. In about ten percent of the population, one will observe the early branching of the renal arteries. This early-branching typically occurs 15 mm to 20 mm from the renal hilum; this is vital to know when performing a kidney transplant.
