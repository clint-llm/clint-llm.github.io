Patients need to understand that even though these drugs are available over-the-counter, they can still cause significant toxicity and adverse effects. The healthcare team should counsel regarding the signs of antihistamine overdose.Â The patient should be told to store these medications in a secure location in the home, away from children. Additionally, these agents should never be combined with sedatives or hypnotics. At discharge, the nurse should educate the patient on ensuring that all medications are stored in child-proof containers. A psychiatrist should see any patient who intentionally consumed the medications prior to discharge.
