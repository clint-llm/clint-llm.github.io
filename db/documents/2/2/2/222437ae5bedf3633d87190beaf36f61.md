The heart decreases the increased stress on the ventricular wall by remodeling the structure of the ventricular wall by a process known as hypertrophic growth. This process involves increased production of proteins and changes in the size and configuration of the sarcomeres present in the myocytes. These adaptations help in handling the increased stress on the heart. The left ventricular mass in highly conditioned athletes can increase up to 60 percent in comparison to non-conditioned control subjects. This change in mass sheds light on the remodeling capabilities of the heart.

An increase in the size of cells is the mechanism underlying the process of hypertrophy of any organ. The myocardial remodeling correlated with exercise and pregnancy does not have associations with the failure of the heart since there is no drastic change in the structure and functioning of the heart.
