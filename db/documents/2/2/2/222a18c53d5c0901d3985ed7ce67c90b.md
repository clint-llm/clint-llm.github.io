Clinical suspicion for megaloblastic anemia should be high in patients with unexplained macrocytic (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] greater than 100 fL) anemia or hypersegmented neutrophils on a peripheral smear. An MCV of greater than 115 fL is more specific for vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency than other causes of macrocytosis, however, a normal MCV does not rule out megaloblastic anemia.

Methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels can be obtained in patients with borderline results from the above testing. They are often also ordered to confirm the diagnosis of B12 deficiency.

In patients with evidence of B12 deficiency from the above testing, autoantibodies assays to test for antibodies against intrinsic factors should be obtained. Although the sensitivity of this assay is low, the specificity is quite high and a positive test is diagnostic of pernicious anemia.

It is imperative to remember that vitamin B12 and folate deficiency testing should be done simultaneously to ensure both deficiencies are diagnosed if present. In cases where folate is replaced without vitamin B12 supplementation and underlying B12 deficiency, the neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency will not be treated and may potentially get worse.

**The 2014 Guidelines from the British Committee for Standards in Haematology**

- Serum cobalamin and folate levels should be obtained simultaneously due to the close relationship in metabolism. (Grade 1A)

- Neurological symptoms due to vitamin B12 deficiency can occur in the absence of macrocytosis. In unexplained neurological symptoms consistent with B12 deficiency, cobalamin assays should be obtained. (Grade 1B)

- Methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels should be obtained in patients with clinical suspicion of B12 deficiency but borderline serum levels. (Grade 2B)

- Homocysteine level is more sensitive for B12 deficiency but methylmalonic acid is more specific. Both have to be interpreted in relation to the patient's renal function.

- Holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) is the ‘active’ fraction of serum cobalamin and is more specific than serum cobalamin levels.

- All patients with clinical features suspicious for pernicious anemia should be tested for anti-IF antibodies regardless of cobalamin levels. (Grade 1A)

- Patients with low serum cobalamin levels without anemia or malabsorption syndromes to explain the result should be tested for anti-IF antibodies as they may have an early/latent presentation of pernicious anemia. (Grade 2A)

- Anti-gastric parietal cell antibody testing is not recommended. (Grade 1A)

- Red cell folate testing is not recommended in most cases. (Grade 1A)

- In the presence of strong clinical suspicion of folate deficiency and a normal serum level, a red cell folate assay can be obtained if cobalamin deficiency has already been ruled out. (Grade 2B
