Scarpa's fascia is a membranous layer of the anterior abdominal wall. Passing through the abdominal wall layers from outside to inside nine distinct layers are identified: skin, subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, external oblique muscles, transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia, preperitoneal adipose tissue, and peritoneum. One of these layers, the "superficial fascia" consists of two layers: a membranous Scarpa’s fascia and an outer fatty layer, the Campers’ fascia. Scarpa’s fascia lies below the Camper’s fascia and above the external oblique muscle. It is connected laterally to the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle. Medially it fades into the linea alba and pubic symphysis. In the upper thigh just below the inguinal ligament, it blends in with the fascia lata. Scarpa’s fascia is named based on the region in which it is present. Scarpa’s fascia extends superficially to the spermatic cord and scrotum, where it is known as the dartos fascia. From within the scrotal area, the fascia is traceable backward, where it continues as Colles fascia as it blends with the deeper layers of the perineum. In females, Scarpa’s fascia extends into the labia majora. Scarpa’s fascia is a vital structure that providers need to be cognizant of because of its role in the repair of abdominal incisions and its clinical significance in forming fascial planes that limit bodily fluid extravasation.
