Differential diagnosis of myoclonus includes similar movement disorders presenting as rapid and jerky movements. They vary in amplitude from mild, not causing movements across the joint as fasciculations and myokymia to stronger movements as tremor, tics, and chorea, all of which need to be distinguished from myoclonus.

The differential diagnosis can include:

- Dystonia

- Multiple sclerosis

- Parkinson

- Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease

- Serotonin toxicity

- Huntington disease

- Subacute sclerosing

- Panencephalitis

- Alzheimer disease

- Some forms of Gaucher disease
