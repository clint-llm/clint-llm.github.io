Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) result in decreased patient satisfaction, increased patient stress, and potentially increased admission rates or delayed discharge from healthcare facilities.

Clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA), pharmacists, and nursing staff working as an interprofessional team must be aware of multiple therapies to prevent nausea and vomiting.

Aprepitant and fosaprepitant are relatively novel and expensive therapies compared to older antiemetics. Their use should be guided by risk stratification systems such as the Apfel score, Eberhart score when prescribed for postoperative nausea and vomiting, and the updated antiemetic guidelines of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/European Society for Medical Oncology (MASCC/ESMO), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN).
