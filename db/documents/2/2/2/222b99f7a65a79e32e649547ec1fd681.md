Kawasaki disease is a rare disorder, but because of its serious effects on the coronaries, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team. Once a child is suspected of having Kawasaki disease, the patient should be referred promptly to a cardiologist.

A cardiologist should be consulted to determine the initial and schedule of following echocardiogram studies, anticoagulation management, to determine if coronary artery angiography is necessary and for long-term follow-up and monitoring.Â  Other specialists to consider, include an infectious disease specialist, rheumatologist, or dermatologist. Following treatment, the short-term prognosis is good, but the long-term prognosis remains unknown primarily because many children are lost to followup.
