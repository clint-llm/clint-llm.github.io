Most often, balanitis will be found in uncircumcised men or older men who have had a circumcision later in life. Again, the etiology is unknown, but chronic inflammation and irritation seem to be the most notable inciting event for disease progression. Balanitis is oftentimes initially presenting asymptomatic. However, one of the more common physical exam findings would be erythematous changes or white hypopigmented lesions seen on the glans penis or foreskin.

This generalized inflammation can lead to a condition known as phimosis. Phimosis refers to difficulty retracting the foreskin and can lead to challenges with micturition and overall sexual function. If left unattended, additional symptoms can develop, including dysuria, urinary retention, and renal failure. The erythematous changes can further develop into more defined lesions around the coronal sulcus and foreskin. Eventually, this can progressively invade the urethral meatus and fossa navicularis, affecting the urethral tract, and strictures disease, or narrowing, can result.
