Under microscopy, two different types of cells are visualized in MNTI supported by dense fibrous stroma. The characteristics of these cells are the following:

- Large melanin-containing epithelial cells: These epithelial cells, which can be cuboidal or polygonal in shape, are larger than the other type of cells. They are usually found on the periphery of the clustering that is formed by the two types of cells. These cells usually have granules of melanin contained in the large eosinophilic cytoplasm. These cells are positive for neuron specific enolase (NSE), vimentin, cytokeratins, human melanoma black-45 (HMB-45), and dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). Also, these cells can be positive for synaptophysin and epithelial membrane antigen. Rare cases have been reported positive for S100 protein.

- Small neuroblastic cells:****These cells are small basophilic cells, with a small amount of cytoplasm, located in the center of the clustering of cells. These cells are positive for NSE, vimentin, and synaptophysin. Occasionally, this group of cells are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and rarely for neurofilament and CD99. Only a few cases have reported positive for S-100 protein, but they are negative for cytokeratins.
