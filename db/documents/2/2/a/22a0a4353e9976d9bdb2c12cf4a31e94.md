A uterine inversion is a rare event, complicating about 1 in 2000 to 1 in 23,000 deliveries. Ironically, most are seen with “low-risk” deliveries. The incidence is 3-times higher in India as compared to the United States. The incidence of uterine inversion has decreased 4-fold after the introduction of active management during the third stage.
