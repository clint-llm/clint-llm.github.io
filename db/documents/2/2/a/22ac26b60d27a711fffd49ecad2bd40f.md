Endocarditis is a type of infection usually caused by bacteria or fungi and affects the heart's inner layer, including the heart's valves. The causative organism most likely a bacteria but can also include some fungi that get to the heart through the bloodstream. Prosthetic valve endocarditis is one type of endocarditis that affects the replaced prosthetic valve. Getting infected heart valves causes damage to the valve and hence malfunction, and that can cause major complications. Early treatment is necessary to prevent bad outcomes. Having surgery for a heart valve increases the risk of infection. Those who inject themselves with IV drug abuse are at higher risk of this type of infection.
