Due to rapid alkalotic effects, sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated in those with signs/symptoms or laboratory values indicating underlying metabolic or respiratory alkalosis due to the potential for exacerbation of symptoms.

Secondary to deionizing effects on metabolically active ionized serum calcium, sodium bicarbonate is contraindicated inÂ patients with hypocalcemia.

Due to its ability to buffer pH and influence acid-base shifts, sodium bicarbonate can also influence a multitude of drug-drug interactions. These include:

- Antibiotics

- Doxycycline, levofloxacin, minocycline, tetracyclines

These effects are often noted in oral preparations where both medications are taken orally and result in significantly decreased GI absorption due to compound structural alterations due to changes in pH in the GI lumen.

- NSAIDs/other related anti-inflammatory medications

- Mesalamine, sulfasalazine

These interactions are due to the effects of sodium bicarbonate on increasing renal tubular pH, thereby increasing passive tubular reabsorption and increasing serum levels of medication.

The administration of sodium bicarbonate can exacerbate hypernatremia.

Rapid or high-dose administration of undiluted sodium bicarbonate may lead to decreased CSF pressure and intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in the pediatric population under the age of 2.

Another contraindication is for those that have hypersensitivity to sodium bicarbonate injections.
