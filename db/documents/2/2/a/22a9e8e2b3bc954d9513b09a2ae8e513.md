Disc herniation can be an early precursor to the development of spondylosis. While both spondylotic discs and herniated discs undergo similar degenerative changes (e.g., macrophage infiltration, upregulation of growth factors, and cytokines), there exist immunohistological distinctions between the two disease processes. In a 2008 study by Kokubo et al, a total of 500 cervical intervertebral discs excised from 198 patients with disc herniation and 166 patients with spondylosis were examined en bloc samples via histological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Chondrocytes taken from both groups were abundant in CD68-positive macrophages, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, basic fibroblast factor (bFGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, herniated discs demonstrated more profound inflammatory reactions involving CD68-positive macrophage infiltration into the outer layer of the annulus fibrosus. However, spondylotic discs were observed to have thicker bony endplates with a more diffuse expression of TNF-alpha and MMP-3 in the inner layer of the annulus fibrosus.
