A knowledgable interdisciplinary team that communicates effectively is key to any patient with SIN receiving optimum care. Firstly, both primary and secondary care physicians should have a comprehensive understanding of the condition so that it is part of their differentials in any patient presenting with infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Radiologists should be familiar with its appearance on hysterosalpingography, whilst, as SIN can only be confirmed histologically, pathologists must have a strong knowledge of its identifying features.

Both ectopic pregnancies and infertility can have a dramatic effect on a patientâ€™s life and relationships. Therefore, the nursing staff is essential in providing emotional and psychosocial support for these patients. Finally, pharmacists are fundamental in advising physicians regarding the most appropriate medical management of the symptoms of SIN and the treatment of non-surgical candidates.
