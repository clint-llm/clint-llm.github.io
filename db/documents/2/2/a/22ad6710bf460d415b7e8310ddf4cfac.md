Podoplanin is a type-1 transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoprotein present on the endothelium of lymphatic vessels in both submesothelial fibrotic and mesothelial cells. Podoplanin can modulate inflammatory reactions by binding to chemokines and play a potential role in the inflammatory process. One study found that patients with EPS had a diffuse infiltration of podoplanin-positive cells, which may be a suitable histopathological marker for EPS.
