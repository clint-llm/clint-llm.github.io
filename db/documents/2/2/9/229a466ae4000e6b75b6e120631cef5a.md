Central venous access maintenance and troubleshooting are crucial and necessary skills for all healthcare workers. These practices should be performed routinely to decrease or prevent catheter-based infections and complications. While initial access is typically obtained by trained physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners in the standard sterile fashion, nursing staff in intensive care units or general wards will primarily perform routine care and management. Every healthcare team member is responsible for evaluating the ongoing need for central venous access and ensuring prompt removal when no longer necessary. Routine evaluation by every team member will ensure that appropriate handling and care of the central catheter is being performed to help reduce the risk of catheter-associated complications. Multidisciplinary team training is indicated to ensure the success of the bundles. Frequent bundle monitoring and overview are also required to identify gaps and provide feedback to improve the quality of patient care.
