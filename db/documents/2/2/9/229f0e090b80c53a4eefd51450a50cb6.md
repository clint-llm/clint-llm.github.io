- Achalasia: It is a progressive disease,Â meaning that it requires chronic therapy and endoscopic or surgical intervention and reintervention. Patients may be required to be watchful about their dietary habits despite being on or after treatment.

- Scleroderma esophagus: The severity of the esophageal disease depends on how well the primary illness is well controlled. Since scleroderma is a progressive illness, patients present with significant acid reflux.

- Spastic esophageal disorders: Generally, it has a very favorable prognosis and patients usually attain good baseline status. Worsening usually warrants workup as these disorders have a propensity to develop into achalasia.
