Management of acute sodium channel blocker toxicity requires an interprofessional approach involving ICU, nursing, pharmacy, and multiple other departments.  Nursing is essential to the delivery of the medications to the patient in a timely manner in tandem with the pharmacy.  Treatment will require the involvement of the critical care team, social work, and likely, psychiatry, as there is often a concern for suicidal intent. Ultimately treatment of sodium channel blocker toxicity requires further research, as it is all too often resistant to our best current strategies.
