The mortality in patients with acute tubular necrosis depends on the underlying condition that leads to acute tubular necrosis. Some factors that lead to poor survival in such patients include oliguria, poor nutritional status, male gender, the need for mechanical ventilation, stroke, seizures, and acute myocardial infarction. The mortality rate is higher in oliguric patients than in non-oliguric patients signifying the amount of damage done leading to necrosis. Mortality is high (about 60%) in sepsis and surgical patients, causing multiple organ failure.
