The complications of UGH syndrome include:

- Corneal Staining- Long-standing hyphema causes corneal staining. It usually occurs with hyphema and raised intraocular pressure. It starts from the periphery of the cornea and grows centripetally.

- Chronic inflammation may be noted and lead to posterior synechia or peripheral anterior synechia.

- Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy- Endothelial damage due to constantly raised intraocular pressure, damage by the implant itself, and inflammation can result in endothelial pump failure leading to pseudophakic bullous keratopathy that might ultimately need penetrating or endothelial keratoplasty.

- Vitreous hemorrhage may be noted in a few cases of UGH syndrome where there is a communication between the anterior and posterior segments (posterior capsular rent or defect with rupture of the anterior hyaloid face).

- Glaucomatous nerve damage- Raised intraocular pressure may result in optic nerve damage, ultimately resulting in blindness.

- Cystoid macular edema may occur in a few cases.
