After an index ankle sprain, the microscopic tears due to the overstressing of the ankle ligaments can lead to attenuation. As a result, functional and mechanical instability may ensue, which increases the likelihood of recurrent ankle sprain when proper treatment is not applied. As previously mentioned, the ATFL is the most commonly injured ankle ligament, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and then posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL).

Lateral ankle instability can be defined as either functional instability or mechanical instability. Diagnosis of which form of instability is imperative for proper treatment. Functional instability is chronic and is commonly described subjectively by the patient as the ankle "giving out" or "giving way." For this instability, unlike mechanical, there are no clinical or radiographic findings that would suggest instability. These patients typically encounter proprioceptive deficits secondary to ligamentous trauma.

Mechanical instability entails excessive motion in the ankle joint that can be assessed clinically by performing an anterior drawer sign or radiographically stressing the ankle joint.
