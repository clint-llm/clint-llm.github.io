There are two receptors for GABA: GABA-A and GABA-B.

**GABA-A receptors.**Historically, GABA-A was differentiated from GABA-B because baclofen binds to GABA-A, but bicuculline did not bind to GABA-A and vice-versa. GABA-A is a heteropentameric transmembrane ligand-gated chloride ion channel that is present in nearly all CNS neurons. Although there are many isoforms of GABA-A, most GABA-A receptors contain either alpha and beta subunits, or alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. The different combinations of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in different GABA-A receptors influence what GABA agonistic or antagonistic drug will bind to them. Generally, due to the influx of chloride into the mature postsynaptic neuron, GABA-A activation causes hyperpolarization to decrease the likelihood of an action potential.

**GABA-B receptors.**GABA-B is a G-protein-coupled receptor that inhibits the activity of adenylate cyclase and voltage-gated calcium channels at axon terminals, resulting in modulation of intracellular activity and neurotransmitter release, respectively. GABA-B receptors are present as autoreceptors that inhibit GABA release or heteroreceptors that reduce the release of glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin, or dopamine. Presynaptic GABA-B receptors also are coupled with G-protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels to stimulate potassium uptake and cause hyperpolarization, limiting glutamate release.
