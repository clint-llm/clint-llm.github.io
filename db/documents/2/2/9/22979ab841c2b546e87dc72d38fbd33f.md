Coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are known to be associated with sudden death, myocardial ischemia, endocarditis, and congestive heart failure. They also cause difficulty during cardiac procedures such as coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, and cardiac surgery.Â CAAs are the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes and military recruits.
