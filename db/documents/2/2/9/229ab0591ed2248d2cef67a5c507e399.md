The most effective treatment for clonorchiasis is praziquantel. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 25 mg/kg orally three times per day for 2 to 3 days or 40mg/kg in a single administration, which results in cure rates of above 90%.

Of note, the recovery period for pathological changes of the bile duct may be prolonged for weeks, and symptoms can persist despite adequate treatment.  As symptoms tend to be unspecific and large populations are unknowingly inhabited by the parasite, pilot studies elucidated the effects of mass treatments in endemic areas with praziquantel, indicating positive effects of(semi-)annual treatment with praziquantel reducing the prevalence from 59.5% in 2001 to 7.5% in 2004.

An alternative regimen includes albendazole (10mg/kg) for 5 to 7 days.

According to recent studies, another alternative includes tribendimidine, a relatively new drug with promising cure rates and a favorable side effect profile.

Researchers have been trying to develop a vaccine, but these have only been tested in animals to date.
