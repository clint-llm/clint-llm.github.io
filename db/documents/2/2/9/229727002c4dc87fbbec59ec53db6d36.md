# Definition/Introduction

In 1948, Kegel exercises were first described by Arnold Kegel for pelvic floor muscle strengthening. The perineometer, also called the vaginal manometer, has been designed to record the contraction strength of pelvic floor muscles and can be used to guide the participants to conduct the exercises correctly. Dr. Kegel’s study showed that the exercises could help to prevent cystocele, rectocele, and urinary stress incontinence.

There are lots of treatments to manage the pelvic floor weakness, including medication and surgeries. Kegel exercises are among the most popular therapies because people can implement them as a daily routine. Kegel exercises are usually custom-made. The number of contractions, duration of holding time, and sets vary across different participants. Currently, there is no fixed protocol for Kegel exercises, but the fundamental rules include: (1) to identify the appropriate muscles which stop or slow the urination, (2) to contract the muscles as mentioned earlier in a correct manner and (3) to repeat the cycle for several times. Many people may contract their hip adductor, abdomen, and gluteal muscles, instead of the pelvic floor muscles during the exercises. Furthermore, alternating fast and slow contractions serve as the key elements of the exercises (Figure 1).

During the fast contractions, the patients tighten and relax the pelvic muscles quickly. During the slow contractions, the patients hold the contracted muscles for a longer period and then relax. The fast contractions train the pelvic floor muscles to adapt to the increased intra-abdominal pressure during coughing and laughing. The slow contractions help with muscle strengthening. Kegel exercises can be used in combination with biofeedback and electrotherapy to improve the treatment effect. Specific devices such as perineometer, Kegelmaster, and vaginal cones are an option in conjunction with Kegel exercises for resistance training.

# Issues of Concern

To maximize the benefits of Kegel exercises, the patients must exercise the right muscles with sufficient time for training. However, about 30% of women could not contract the pelvic floor muscles correctly based on the study of Zanetti et al.

Several studies compared the effectiveness of supervised Kegel exercises with the unsupervised group. The group undergoing supervised Kegel exercises showed better outcomes of pelvic floor function, including improvement of quality of life, decreasing urine leakage, and higher satisfaction rate.

# Clinical Significance

Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as ‘’the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine’’ by the International Continence Society (ICS). The prevalence of UI among women ranged from 25% to 45% according to existing literature. The prevalence is higher in the elder. More than 40% of women aged 70 years and older were affected by UI based on the survey of Milsom et al. Pregnancy, labor, and vaginal delivery, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and antecedent gynecological surgeries are also the risk factors.

When the pelvic supportive systems become weak or loose, the pelvic organs tend to descent to an abnormal position through the vaginal canal, which called the pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The supportive system comprises a combined action of pelvic floor muscles and connective tissues. POP affects more than half of the women aged over 50 years, and the study based on western Australian females showed that the lifetime risk of POP needing surgery was 19%.

Pelvic floor muscles, especially the pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus muscles, play a significant role in involuntarily contraction during female orgasmic. When sexual arousal continues to increase toward the maximum point, the tension of the pelvic floor muscles will reach its maximum temporarily and then relax. The release of all tension, also called orgasm, is followed by pelvic floor muscle spasm. Women’s pelvic floor muscle strength is associated with the grip strength felt by the partner. Dr. Kegel accidentally found the improvement of orgasm and the increase in perception of genital sensations among patients after training.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common bothersome among women. There are lots of treatments to manage these diseases, including medication and surgeries. Clinicians consider Kegel exercises, designed for pelvic floor muscle strengthening, as the first-line therapy for patients as there are few reported few side effects. Currently, there is no fixed protocol for Kegel exercises, but the critical point is that the patients should contract the pelvic floor muscle rather than abdominal, buttock, or inner thigh muscles.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

It is always important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a general practitioner, obstetrician, gynecologist, urologist, and a physiatrist. The physiotherapists also play crucial roles in the interprofessional group. They should teach the patients the proper way to perform Kegel exercises and how to contract the pelvic floor muscles correctly. The nurses are also vital members of the healthcare team since they will assist with the education of the patient and family.

The patients usually don’t have sufficient knowledge about general pregnancy topics and pelvic floor risks.
