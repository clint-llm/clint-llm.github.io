# Introduction

Calcium is a prominent molecule involved in many biochemical processes throughout the body. It is an essential element for proper cardiac function, the structural integrity of bone, and muscular contraction and acts as an enzymatic signal in biochemical pathways.

Serum calcium can be measured by a venous sample, with physiologic levels ranging from 8.8 mg/dl to 10.4 mg/dL for total calcium and 4.7 mg/dL to 5.2 mg/dL for ionized calcium.

# Etiology and Epidemiology

Calcium is the fifth most common element in the body and the most prevalent cation. An average human body (70 kg) contains about 1 kg, or approximately 25 mol, of calcium.

About 50% of the calcium present in circulation is free (also known as ionized calcium); 40% of serum calcium is bound to proteins, especially albumin (80%) and, secondary, to globulins (20%); and about 10% exists as various small diffusible inorganic and organic anions (e.g., bicarbonate, lactate, citrate). The free calcium fraction is the biologically active form.

Physiologically, calcium may be classified as intracellular or extracellular. Intracellular calcium has key roles in many important physiologic functions, including muscle contraction, hormone secretion, glycogen metabolism, and cell division. The intracellular concentration of calcium in the cytosol of unstimulated cells is around 0.1 μmol/L, which is less than 1/20,000 of that in extracellular fluid.

# Pathophysiology

Calcium is tightly regulated and rarely varies from physiologic levels within the body.

Calcium levels are managed by the parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, and calcitriol. The parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an essential regulator of calcium homeostasis, which acts on the renal, skeletal, and gastrointestinal systems to increase serum calcium levels. First, PTH promotes calcium absorption in the gut by stimulating the formation of renally derived calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D), which targets the intestines to increase calcium absorption.

PTH is regulated by serum calcium via negative feedback, preventing excess PTH secretion when calcium is at the physiological level (10 mg/dL).

**Calcium and the Renal System**

The PTH acts on the renal system by activating adenylyl cyclase and 1 alpha-hydroxylase to increase calcium reabsorption and phosphate excretion. Adenylyl cyclase increases calcium reabsorption at the distal convoluted tubules. The enzyme 1alpha-hydroxylase increases the conversion of vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, which results in increased calcium absorption in the intestine.

**Calcium and the Gastrointestinal System**

Humans do not endogenously create calcium, so it must be ingested and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. The amount of calcium absorbed in the small intestine is primarily influenced by current calcium levels and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (calcitriol). Still, other factors such as age, gender, race, and comorbidities can affect calcium absorption. Calcitriol is increased in response to low serum calcium and triggers an active process in the duodenum to absorb more calcium.

Since calcium is absorbed in ionic form, dietary intake of compounds that interact with calcium will reduce the amount of calcium available for absorption. These are primarily oxalate, phosphate, sulfate, citrate, fiber, and fats.

**Calcium and the Musculoskeletal System**

Bone tissue stores calcium as hydroxyapatite, which is deposited when serum calcium levels are elevated and released when levels are low. This process is linked with the endocrine system via the thyroid and parathyroid glands. When serum calcium levels are elevated, the thyroid gland releases calcitonin, which inhibits bone resorption by halting osteoclast activity. The PTH effect on bone tissue is dependent on continuous versus intermittent exposure.

Calcium is necessary for muscle contraction to occur. Contraction is initiated when actin and myosin subunits interact with each other and are inhibited by two regulatory subunits: troponin and tropomyosin. Tropomyosin obstructs the actin-myosin binding site, which prevents contraction by blocking actin and myosin interaction.

**Calcium and the Cardiovascular System**

Calcium in the heart muscle cells is responsible for stabilizing the membrane potential.

Prospective cohort studies have shown no relationship between dietary calcium intake and the risk of heart disease, death, or myocardial infarction.

Calcium is a key cofactor in the coagulation cascade and is necessary for appropriate coagulability. During primary hemostasis, von Willebrand Factor (vWF) is released from injured tissue to act as a bridge for the endothelium and platelet GpIb receptors for proper platelet adhesion. After a platelet adhesion to the endothelium, calcium is released to assist with other coagulation factors of the clotting cascade.

# Specimen Requirements and Procedure

Fasting is not a requirement to evaluate serum calcium levels. Calcium is included in the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), facilitating routine evaluation. Fist-clenching or forearm exercise can lead to falsely elevated ionized (free) calcium levels. The sample should be drawn with the patient in a sitting position. Standing increases the total calcium concentration.

A venous blood sample is required to evaluate serum levels. For children, a lancet needle can be used on a finger, and the sample can be collected in a pipette, slide, or test strip. Whole blood specimens should be analyzed within 15 to 30 minutes of collection. If this is not possible, the specimen should be kept on ice. On the ice, the specimen is stable for at least 2 hours; however, if concurrent potassium testing is requested on the same specimen, the low temperature leads to a spurious increase in potassium within 1 hour of collection.

Samples can be stored at room temperature for 8 hours or refrigerated at 2 to 8 C for up to 48 hours. If assays are not completed within 48 hours or the separated sample is to be stored beyond 48 hours, samples should be frozen at -15 C to -20 C. Frozen samples should be thawed only once. Analyte deterioration may occur in samples that are repeatedly frozen and thawed.

Urine calcium can be kept dissolved by adding 10 mL of 6 M HCl to the collection container before a 24-hour specimen is collected. Urine should be well-mixed during the collection period. A 24-hour urine sample, timed collection, or random urine sample can be useful to diagnose metabolic abnormalities and a patient’s disposition to form stones.

# Testing Procedures

Total calcium can be measured using the ISE potentiometric method, but the sample must be pre-acidified to release all bound and complexed calcium to a free form. However, total calcium is commonly measured with spectrophotometric methods, such as the o-Cresolphthalein Complexone method, Arsenazo III method, atomic absorption spectrometry, or, rarely, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS).

The free calcium analyzer consists of a system of pumps under microprocessor control that transport calibration solutions, samples, and wash solutions through a measuring cell containing calcium ion-selective, reference, and pH electrodes. Sensitive potentiometers measure the voltage difference between the calcium or pH and reference electrodes for calibrating solutions or samples. A microprocessor calibrates the system and calculates calcium concentration and pH.

Calcium ISEs contain a calcium-selective membrane that encloses an inner reference solution of calcium chloride, often containing saturated silver chloride (AgCl) and physiologic concentrations of sodium chloride and potassium chloride, and an internal reference electrode. The reference electrode, usually Ag/AgCl, is immersed in this inner reference solution. Modern calcium ISEs use liquid membranes containing the ion-selective calcium sensor dissolved in an organic liquid trapped in a polymeric matrix.

Although the range of Na+ and Cl+ concentrations usually observed in serum or plasma does not cause a clinically significant error in the measurement of free calcium, significant errors can occur with other specimens unless the matrices and the ionic strength of the calibrators and samples are matched closely. Modern electrodes have high selectivity for calcium over Na+, K+, Mg2+, H+, and Li+ ions.

# Interfering Factors

Reported calcium levels can be influenced by many factors, such as the patient's age, comorbidities, lifestyle, gender, medical therapies, and conditions during specimen retrieval. For example, if the sample was poor quality due to it being lipemic or hemolyzed, then calcium levels can be inaccurate.

Certain medications may precipitate inaccurate measurements of calcium levels. Perchlorate has been reported to cause discrepancies in ionized calcium measurements, leading to false diagnoses of hypo or hypercalcemia.

Urine calcium excretion is highly related to sodium excretion; as such dietary sodium can influence reported levels. Diets high in sodium yield higher calcium excretion; similarly, low-sodium diets equal lower calcium excretion.

Albumin is a carrier protein for calcium and can result in an inaccurately reported serum calcium level. Evaluating albumin levels to correct for total calcium and differentiate true versus factitious calcium dysregulation is important.

**Albumin Correction**

- True Calcium (mg/dL) = reported total calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 – serum albumin (g/dL))

If the corrected serum total calcium levels are between the normal levels of 8.8 mg/dL to 10.4 mg/dL, then the laboratory-reported calcium is fictitious due to impaired serum albumin levels.

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

**Hypercalcemia**

Hypercalcemia is defined as calcium levels elevated above 10.4 mg/dL or ionized serum calcium above 5.2 mg/dL.

Patients who are asymptomatic with albumin-corrected calcium levels less than 12 mg/dL are advised to avoid precipitating factors such as dehydration, inactivity, a calcium diet greater than 1000 mg/day, and certain medications (lithium carbonate, thiazides).

Treatment with normal saline is the most beneficial early management of these patients. The addition of calcitonin should result in a significant reduction of serum calcium within 48 hours. Furthermore, administering bisphosphonates will provide a more sustained effect that will reduce calcium levels in two to four days.

**Hypocalcemia**

Hypocalcemia is defined as total serum calcium levels below 8.8 mg/dL or ionized serum calcium below 4.7 mg/dL.

The physical exam could likely demonstrate contraction of facial muscles ipsilaterally by tapping on the skin overlying the facial nerve (Chvostek sign) and painful carpal spasms with wrist flexion and interphalangeal joint extension while the blood pressure cuff is set 20 mmHg above the patient’s systolic pressure (Trousseau’s signs).

Hypocalcemia can occur due to diseases, treatments, medications, and electrolyte abnormalities. Metabolic alkalosis can cause decreased serum ionized calcium due to calcium-binding albumin more readily during alkalotic states. Chronic diseases of note are hypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and vitamin D deficiency.

Other medications of note that can result in hypocalcemia are the long-term use of corticosteroids, antiepileptics, aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and bisphosphonates.

Treatment for hypocalcemia depends on the severity of the symptoms. Patients experiencing mild symptoms should be treated with calcitriol 0.5 mcg orally twice daily and calcium in the combined form of calcium carbonate taken with the dose of 500 mg orally four times daily to achieve optimal absorption. There are several options in which calcium can be administered. Calcium carbonate can be taken orally via pill, or it can be crushed and mixed with liquid. The absorption of calcium carbonate is dependent on stomach acidity. For better absorption, it may be taken with food or substituted with calcium citrate to stimulate an acidic environment.

On the other hand, calcium gluconate is available in liquid form. In severely symptomatic patients with hypocalcemia, it is essential to maintain a calcium level above 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). Hence calcium gluconate can be administered by continuous intravenous drip infused over 10-20 minutes to avoid cardiac complications such as arrhythmias.

**Hypocalciuria**

Hypocalciuria can occur due to medications, diseases, and genetic disorders. Common medications that result in reduced urine calcium are thiazides and estrogen. Genetic conditions such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), an autosomal dominant disease that decreases the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) of the parathyroid gland, maintain serum calcium levels at an elevated baseline with resulting hypocalciuria.

**Hypercalciuria**

Hypercalciuria can occur as an effect of medications, diseases, and genetic disorders. Common medications involved are spironolactone, corticosteroids, and acetazolamide.

# Clinical Significance

Calcium dysregulation can be a sign of many diseases, just as much as dysregulation can cause many adverse effects. This section will highlight various areas throughout the body in which calcium is related to pathologies.

**Bone Health and Osteoporosis**

Osteoporosis is a disorder that influences bone composition, affecting both density and mineralization. The consequences can be dire as gradual bone loss can result in bone fragility and, ultimately, bone fracture. There are an estimated 1.5 million fractures each year due to osteoporosis, as this disorder affects more than 10 million U.S. adults, the vast majority of whom are women.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) association has approved a health claim suggesting that sufficient calcium and vitamin D intake, with consistent physical activity, might reduce the risk of osteoporosis later in life.

**Gastrointestinal Malignancy**

Calcium binds to bile acids and fatty acids to form insoluble complexes that protect the cell lining of the gastrointestinal tract from acids and their metabolites. Also, calcium is involved in improving signaling within the cells, which may reduce cell proliferation by promoting cells to undergo differentiation and or apoptosis.

**Hypoparathyroidism**

Low levels of PTH occur due to autoimmune or surgical destruction, abnormal congenital development, impaired PTH regulation, or muted PTH effect. The systemic effect is hypocalcemia, which can range from mild to severe symptoms.

Surgical destruction most often occurs during thyroid, parathyroid, or neck surgery. For example, it is the most common complication following a thyroidectomy, in which patients experience acute symptoms of seizures, laryngospasm, prolonged QT, or tetany.

Autoimmune destruction is another acquired cause and typically begins during childhood or adolescence. The destruction that happens in permanent hypoparathyroidism is a part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1(APS 1) due to mutations of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene.

Abnormal parathyroid development in utero can be a cause of hypoparathyroidism identified in infants and children. An example of this is DiGeorge Syndrome which happens due to a 22q11 deletion resulting in defective development of the pharyngeal pouch and its derivatives. The effects are cardiac anomalies, hypocalcemia, hypoplastic thymus, and immunodeficiency.

**Peripartum Effects**

Professional organizations such as the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) recommend 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg of calcium to prevent the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women with a baseline calcium intake of 600 mg or less. Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends the same dosage of 1,500 mg to 2,000 mg for pregnant women with low dietary calcium intake and a high risk of gestational hypertension.

Neonatal hypocalcemia can occur within the first few days of life. Prematurity is the most common factor predisposing a neonate to develop neonatal hypocalcemia. Other conditions that increase the risk include maternal diabetes, maternal hyperparathyroidism, and being small for gestational age.

**Chronic Kidney Disease**

During chronic kidney disease, the effect of PTH can be decreased due to poor renal response. As such, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hyperparathyroidism can occur.

Clinicians should consider the potential consequences of oral calcium intake among patients with chronic kidney disease. Increased oral calcium intake is associated with an increased risk of vascular calcification, especially among patients on dialysis receiving calcium-containing phosphate binders versus non-calcium-containing phosphate binders. According to research analysis, treatment with calcium phosphate binders increased the progression of coronary and aortic calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease concomitantly undergoing hemodialysis.

Conversely, the Dallas Heart Study examined the association between coronary artery calcification (CAC) in adults with end-stage kidney disease in the presence of diabetes. The study concluded that adults with comorbid diabetes and chronic kidney disease had an increased risk of coronary artery calcification as opposed to patients with chronic kidney disease alone.

**Calcium Nephrolithiasis**

Increased calcium excretion contributes to the development of renal stones, comprised of either calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate.

# Quality Control and Lab Safety

Laboratory errors during retrieval and analysis can provide inaccurate information to the medical team. Errors in calcium measurements have been reported when anticoagulant-containing collecting tubes are inadequately filled.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients should be managed appropriately to receive the best care to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity. Given that calcium is implicated in various biochemical pathways, it is important to understand how it can be affected by various diseases and medical therapies. An interprofessional approach is recommended to tailor each patient’s needs and treatment accordingly. For example, patients taking bisphosphonates should receive continuous follow-ups for the adverse effects of long-term use, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone disease.

Interprofessional patient care involving clinicians (MD, DO, NP, and PA), nursing staff, pharmacists, and possibly dieticians can address calcium levels and coordinate activity to provide corrective actions when necessary, leading to optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
