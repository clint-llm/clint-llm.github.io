About 85% of cases of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage are secondary to a ruptured saccular aneurysm.

A family history of SAH increases the risk of SAH in individuals without any of these conditions. A study found that first-degree relatives of patients with SAH have a three-to-five-fold increased risk of SAH compared with the general population. Unruptured aneurysms in families with cerebral aneurysms are more likely to rupture than those without a family history.

A small proportion of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages is known to have a genetic association. The genetic susceptibility appears to be heterogenous with multiple chromosomes implicated.
