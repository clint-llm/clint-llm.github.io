When a tissue cell is exposed to any type of carcinogen, it probably tries to adapt to it. An increase in cell proliferation, shrinking the cytosolic capacity, and the allied organelle load could be an effort in adaptation.. When the stage of adaptation and revocable cell damage ends, the cells gradually reach a stage of irrevocable cell damage, manifesting as either apoptosis or malignant transformation. As an adaptative response, the hastened pace of cell division noted at the earlier stages of transformation facilitatesÂ further genetic damage, thereby forcefully pushing the cells further along the path to malignant transformation.
