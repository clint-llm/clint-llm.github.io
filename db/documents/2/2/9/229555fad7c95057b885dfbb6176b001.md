Facial nerve palsy from decompression sickness is a rare phenomenon but needs prompt diagnosis and treatment. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, hyperbaric chamber expert and an ENT surgeon. Obviously, decompression sickness affecting the brain (type II) or cerebral gas embolism must be considered when a diver returns to surface and exhibits a neurological deficit. However, the scenario and lack of other symptoms (other than vertigo on occasion due to alternobaric vertigo) strongly suggest baroparesis. Until the palsy is resolved, the most significant risk is of corneal damage due to keratitis from an inability to fully blink. This can be ameliorated with eye lubricant and eye patching.
