The neurons of the locus coeruleus are mostly branched and not myelinated. Some of the areas that provide input to the LC are the medial prefrontal cortex, hypothalamus, paragigantocellularis, and nucleus prepositus. The locus coeruleus provides output to the hippocampus, spinal cord, hypothalamus, and amygdala. The noradrenergic neurons that innervate areas of the brain that help maintain functions such as memory, attention, and the sleep-wake cycle.
