Females within the reproductive age group are usually affected. However, adolescents are also known to be affected. The patient may have a history of prior surgical procedures such as cesarean section, laparoscopy, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, hysterotomy, or episiotomy that might have predisposed the implantation of the endometrial tissue into the scar. The patient usually presents with cyclic pain during menstruation, swelling that may increase at the time of menstruation, a palpable mass, or bleeding from the affected areas in the skin.

The classic presentation of cutaneous endometriosis is a firm papule or nodule which averages a size of 2 cm in diameter. Umbilical endometriosis is to be suspected if a patient arrives with a nodule at the umbilicus with symptoms such as pain, itching, bleeding, or discharge. There may be local signs of inflammation, such as erythema, in the affected areas.

Any similar signs and symptoms, particularly at the scar sites and extremities, should arise suspicion in favor of cutaneous endometriosis. The average time interval between the history of surgical procedures and the onset of symptoms in cases of endometriosis in the gynecological scar is 4.2 years.
