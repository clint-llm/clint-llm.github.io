Angiography has been demonstrated to be the most informative investigation for diagnosis as well as treatment. CT angiography has a high rate of sensitivity and specificity but does not facilitate intervention concurrently. Angiography defines the character and location of the lesion as well as provides an opportunity to gain temporary control over the bleeding by transcatheter embolization or possible stenting.

There is a classification of pancreatic pseudoaneurysms based on the following features:

- The type of blood vessel from which the pseudoaneurysm originates

- Absence or presence of communication with the GI tract

- Absence of presence of highly concentrated pancreatic fluid at the bleeding site.

It is important to note that CT angiography and CT angiography are only suitable for stable patients.
