Overall, for the vast majority of people, TENS is believed to be safe and well-tolerated with little to no side effects. However, manufacturers of TENS units universally warn individuals with pacemakers, epilepsy, or are pregnant that these conditions are contraindications to use as they can lead to potential complications. Nevertheless, this has been viewed as more of a medicolegal maneuver in high-risk populations, and TENS units are actually usable in these groups assuming close medical supervision and electrode placement is not in close vicinity to the chest, neck, or abdomen.

Furthermore, there have been some complications with impacting transdermal drug delivery systems if drug application is close to the TENS electrodes.

There have been documented dermatologic complications from using TENS units — the most of these cases relate to either allergic reactions to the electrode pads or contact dermatitis. Special hypoallergenic electrode pads are available for this population. Additionally, syncope and nausea have both been documented as complications of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

Lastly, there are theoretical risks with using TENS units while driving or operating heavy machinery, so it is therefore recommended to avoid TENS during those activities to avoid the risk of further complication.
