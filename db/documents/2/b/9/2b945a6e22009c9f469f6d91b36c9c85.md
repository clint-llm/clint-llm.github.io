The typical scutula and some simple laboratory tests confirm the diagnosis of favus.

Direct microscopic examination of infected hairs mounted on slides with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) reveals endothrix infection. Mycelium and chains of spores are shown within the shafts. The most characteristic finding is elongated air-spaces seen at the sites of hyphae that had undergone autolysis. A fungal culture is the most informative method for diagnosing favus. T. schoenleinii should be cultured on Sabouraud glucose agar. The colonies are waxy or downy with ramifications, cerebriform, deep cream in color on the surface, tan-colored on the reverse, and slow-growing between two to four weeks. KOH examination of the favic culture reveals characteristic antler-like hyphae, chandelier structures, and mycelia with intercalary or terminal chlamydospores terminal dilation of hyphae giving a nail head shape known as favic nails.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has been recently used for the diagnosis of this rare mycosis. It may be a good alternative when fungal culture is unsuccessful.
