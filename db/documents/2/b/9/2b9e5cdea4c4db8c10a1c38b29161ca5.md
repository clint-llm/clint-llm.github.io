Hypertension is the major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and in the contemporary era, more than 30% of the adult population is suffering from hypertension.

Secondary hypertension is defined as elevated blood pressure (BP), secondary to an identifiable cause.

- Resistant hypertension, i.e., persistent blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg despite using optimal doses of at least three anti-hypertensive from different classes, that includes a diuretic.

- An acute rise in blood pressure in a patient who had previously stable pressures.

- Hypertension develops in non-black patients before the age of 30 years, who do not have any other risk factors for hypertension, e.g., obesity, family history, etc.

- Patients with severe hypertension (BP greater than 180/110 mm Hg) and patients with end-organ damage like acute kidney injury, neurological manifestations, flash pulmonary edema, hypertensive retinopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, etc.

- Hypertension associated with electrolyte disorders like hypokalemia or metabolic alkalosis

- Age of onset of hypertension before puberty.

- Non-dipping or reverse dipping patterns while monitoring 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Normally, the blood pressure at night is lower than the blood pressure during the day, i.e., there is a ‘dip’ in blood pressure at night. The absence of this ‘dip’ or ‘reverse dipping,’ i.e., ‘dip’ present during the day instead of at night can be suggestive of a secondary cause of hypertension.
