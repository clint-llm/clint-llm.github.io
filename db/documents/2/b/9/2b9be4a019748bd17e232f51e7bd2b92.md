Fluid and electrolytes require monitoring with the administration of all hypertonic fluids, with particular attention paid to serum sodium, potassium, and fluid ins/outs. Evaluation of circulatory and renal function is necessary before administering mannitol and evaluated during treatment. When treating increased ICP with mannitol, a CSF pressure measurement should take place within fifteen minutes after administration.
