Cervical dysplasia is the precursor to cervical cancer. It is caused by the persistent infection of the human papillomavirus (HPV) into the cervical tissue. The most common type is HPV 16, responsible for 50% of cervical cancer. HPV 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68 are the other HPV oncogenic types. HPV is a common, sexually transmitted infection that usually clears within eight to 24 months of exposure. Persistent infection leads to dysplasia, which, if untreated, can lead to cervical cancer. The process is usually slow and occurs over several years. Because of the slow progression of this identifiable and treatable infection, it is amenable to routine screening with a Pap smear and/or HPV testing depending on the patient's age and history.
