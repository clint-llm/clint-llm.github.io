Blinding covers any of the numerous participants of the clinical trial, e.g., researchers, subjects, technicians, and data analysts. Single-, double-, and triple-blinding are commonly used blinding strategies in clinical research. A single-blind study masks the subjects from knowing which study treatment, if any, they are receiving. A double-blind study blinds both the subjects as well as the researchers to the treatment allocation. Triple-blinding involves withholding this information from the patients, researchers, as well as data analysts.Randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involve the randomÂ placement of participants into two groups; an experimental group that receives the investigational treatment and a control group that acquires a placebo. Neither the researchers nor the study subjects know who is getting the experimental treatment and who is getting a placebo. This type of clinical study ranks as the gold standard for the validation of treatment interventions.

Unfortunately, blinding is not possible to achieve in all clinical trials. For example, the method of drug delivery may not be amenable to blinding. An excellent clinical protocol may help ensure that within the ethical and practical constraints, blinding is achieved as effectively as possible.
