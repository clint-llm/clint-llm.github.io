The primary function of the cardiorespiratory system is to ensure that all metabolically active tissues are adequately oxygenated at all times. Hypoxemia and hypoxia may result when these systems fail and represent major immediate threats to organ function and patient survival. The oxygenation process can be categorized into three stages: oxygenation, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption. Respiratory failure will result in a decreased oxygenation of blood. Oxygen delivery, the rate of oxygen transport from the lungs to the microcirculation, is dependent on cardiac output and arterial oxygen content.  And oxygen demand is a product of the metabolic state of the tissues.  All three of these processes must be evaluated and corrected in the clinical setting, particularly in critically ill patients or acute situations. The management of hypoxia typically involves efforts to improve global hypoxemia, oxygen delivery and focuses on blood oxygenation through supplemental oxygen and positive-pressure ventilation and cardiac output.
