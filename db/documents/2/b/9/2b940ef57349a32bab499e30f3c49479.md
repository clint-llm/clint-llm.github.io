Dysuria is defined as the sensation of pain and/or burning, stinging, or itching of the urethra or urethral meatus associated with urination. It is a very common urinary symptom experienced by most people at least once over their lifetime.Â Dysuria typically occurs when urine comes in contact with the inflamed or irritated urethral mucosal lining. This is exacerbated by and associated with detrusor muscle contraction and urethral peristalsis, which then stimulates the submucosal pain receptors resulting in pain or a burning sensation during urination. Several conditions can cause dysuria via different mechanisms. True dysuria requires differentiation from other symptoms, which can also occur due to pelvic discomfort from various bladder conditions such as interstitial cystitis, prostatitis, and suprapubic or retropubic pain.
