The skin manifestations of Darier disease consist of hyperkeratotic papules and plaques. These lesions develop in seborrheic and intertriginous areas.

Nail findings include red and white lines oriented longitudinally over the nail. Patients can also have V-shaped notches at the distal end of the nail plate along with nail fragility. In 50% of patients with Darier disease, the oral mucosa is involved.
