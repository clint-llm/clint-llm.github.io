The most frequently encountered immediate postoperative complications following osteoblastoma surgical removal are:

- 
Wound infections, as well as infections involving the urinary tract and lungs

- 
Surgical site hemorrhage

- 
A loss of stability involving the surgical stabilization construct

Tumor recurrence typically occurs late (i.e., months to years) after the procedure, and the clinician and patient must plan for this possibility for a scheduled period following the procedure. No universally accepted time intervals exist to define this period during which follow-up should occur; therefore, the range varies significantly. It is probably beneficial to continue these studies until the likelihood of regrowth of this tumor, as reported in the literature, is almost negligible.
