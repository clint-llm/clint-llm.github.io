In the early era of catheterization, left heart catheterization was performed by cutting down the brachial and radial arteries, no longer used now.

The radial artery is the brachial artery branch, which is a continuation of the axillary artery. The axillary artery is formed by the continuation of the subclavian artery when it crosses the first rib.

In the contemporary era, radial access is considered superior compared to the femoral approach in bleeding complications.
