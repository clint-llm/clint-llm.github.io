Some clinical trials have shown that ribavirin, when used early, decreases viral load. Other studies show Icatibant, which is a bradykinin inhibitor, to be effective in patients with Puumala infection. The presence of thrombocytopenia, oliguria, and elevated cytokines (such as TNF-beta or IL-18) are indicators of the severity of disease and suggest immediate ICU admission.

Overall, the most effective therapy has been supportive management. If the patient has signs of hemorrhage and severe thrombocytopenia, transfusion of RBCs and platelets will be suggested. If there is refractory fluid overload causing pulmonary edema, severe hyperkalemia, or uremic signs, then hemodialysis will be used. Always avoid drugs that will decrease GFR, such as NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors, as well as other nephrotoxic drugs.
