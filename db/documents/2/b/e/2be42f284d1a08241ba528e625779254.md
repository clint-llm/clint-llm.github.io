**Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves**- The recurrent laryngeal nerves are direct branches of the vagus nerve, which supply the intrinsic muscles of the larynx in the adult. While they are symmetric in development, they diverge in the adult. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under the right subclavian artery, while the left recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under the arch of the aorta. The recurrent laryngeal nerves develop from the sixth pharyngeal arch bilaterally, but in the growing fetus, the heart migrates inferiorly, leading to their eventual asymmetry. As the heart descends, the nerves loop around the sixth aortic arch and ascend to the larynx. On the right, as the dorsal right sixth aortic arch regresses (as does the fifth aortic arch), the recurrent laryngeal nerve elevates to the fourth aortic arch; this leads to its adult location, inferior to the right subclavian artery. On the left, the dorsal left sixth aortic arch persists and develops into the ductus arteriosus; thus, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve does not elevate, leading to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve remaining inferior to the arch of the aorta, lateral to the ligamentum arteriosum.

**Aberrant Right Subclavian Artery**- This defect is particularly relevant in thoracic surgery, particularly esophageal dissection or esophagectomy. Lack of knowledge and understanding of this abnormality, present in 0.5Â to 1.8% of the population, can lead to life-threatening bleeding during esophageal manipulation.
