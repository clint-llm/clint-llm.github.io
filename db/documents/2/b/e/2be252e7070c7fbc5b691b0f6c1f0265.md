Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare endocrine tumor syndrome with high penetrance. This syndrome is also known as Wermer syndrome.

MEN1 gene testing in an index case can confirm the diagnosis and allow early detection of asymptomatic mutation carriers years before a MEN1-associated tumor can be detected. However, approximately 20% of MEN1 kindred have no mutation in the MEN1 gene. Unfortunately, there is no genotypic-phenotypic correlation in MEN1, leading to different manifestations even among family members. Studies have demonstrated that nonsense and splicing mutations are associated with more aggressive neuroendocrine tumors.
