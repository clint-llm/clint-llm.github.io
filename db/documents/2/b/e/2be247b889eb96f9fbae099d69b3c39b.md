The male external genital organs develop in two stages. The initial hormone-independent stage develops between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In this stage, the external genitalia is bipotential, consisting of a genital tubercle, two genital folds, and two labioscrotal swellings. In the second phase, in the presence of the Y chromosome and the testosterone secreted from the fetal testes (and its conversion to dihydrotestosterone-DHT in local skin), the genital tubercle elongates, and the urethral plate (UP) develops into a groove towards the tip of the genital tubercle. The genital folds fuse to form the penile urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings fuse in the midline to form the scrotum. The genital tubercle enlarges and forms the penis. Finally, the foreskin and the glans fuse in the midline. This stage takes place between 11 and 16 weeks of gestation.
