Common degenerative findings show destruction and fibrosis of the cartilage and disruption, erosion, and ossification of sub-chondral bone. Synovitis also is commonly found which reveals hyperplasia of linings cells with infiltration of inflammatory cells. Degenerative enthesitis similarly reveals inflammatory cells. Infectious etiologies of sacroiliitis reveal lymphocytes, plasma cells, and fibrosis. Notably, some patients will show no histopathologic changes.
