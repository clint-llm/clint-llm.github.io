Simethicone is a silicone compound used for the management of flatulence and bloating. It relieves the discomfort produced by the presence of excess gas in the gastrointestinal tract. It was FDA approved in 1952.

Bernstein and Kasich performed one of the earliest studies of simethicone in 1974. This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial where they compared simethicone 50 mg to placebo. Placebo was identical in taste and appearance. Inclusion criteria included subjects ranging in age from 21 to 65 years, an outpatient setting, a minimum of two of the symptoms that were under evaluation. Subjects were enrolled alternately to simethicone or placebo. Forty-one patients were enrolled in the study, with twenty in the simethicone group and twenty-one in the placebo group. The assigned medication was given 10 minutes before each meal and at bedtime for ten days. Changes in symptoms were evaluated around day five and again around day 10. Symptoms evaluated included gas, heartburn, fullness, full feeling, distension, stuffiness, acid indigestion, bloating, pressure, upset stomach, sour stomach, and pain after eating. Symptoms were evaluated by frequency and severity. When comparing the simethicone group to placebo, researchers observed a significant improvement in all symptoms in the simethicone group at visits on day five and day 10.
