The most important consideration to improve outcomes in the treatment of a patient with microtia is early and clear communication between the surgeon and the family regarding the need for multidisciplinary care and the range and timing of interventions and management of any hearing loss. Primary care providers should be aggressive in treating infections of the contralateralÂ normal ear, as patients may have associated conductive hearing loss in the microtic ear, and speech delays are more liable to occur in children with hearing loss. A good working relationship between the plastic surgeon and the otologist is also essential in order to coordinate staged repair of the microtic ear and any associated aural atresia.
