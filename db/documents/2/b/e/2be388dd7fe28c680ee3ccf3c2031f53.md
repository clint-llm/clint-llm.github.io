Aphakia in childhood is one of the more clinically challenging clinical scenarios. Eyeglasses should be avoided when anisometropia exceeds 3.00 diopters of refractive error or 1.50 diopters of astigmatism due to the high risk of aniseikonia.

Aniseikonia produces confusion, which may lead to permanent suppression, amblyopia, anomalous retinal correspondence, and concomitant strabismus development.

Relative spectacle magnification in eyeglasses for unilateral aphakia poses a barrier to binocular vision leading to amblyopia. Another disadvantage of wearing glasses in newborns and infants is the extra weight and size of the high plus-power lens. Spectacles tend to be cosmetically, visually, and psychologically undesirable. Besides weight, high plus-power lenses also cause a ring scotoma, false orientation due to magnification, swim, and optical aberrations (chromatic, spherical, coma), which can be especially detrimental for young and active individuals.

Another problem that applies to both unilateral and bilateral aphakic spectacle lenses is that minor alterations in the vertex distance and pantoscopic tilt and alignment of the optical center of the lens with the pupil can cause an inaccurate refractive correction.

Ultimately, glasses may remain an option in children in rare situations or when the parents refuse to apply and remove a contact lens.
