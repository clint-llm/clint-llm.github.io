Although evidence for treating frostbite with hyperbaric oxygen is sparse and limited to case reports and animal studies, the proposed mechanism of action is plausible. This activity reviews the presentation and evaluation of frostbite injury and the potential for effective treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of frostbite injury.
- Outline the contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of frostbite injury.
- Describe the management of frostbite injury.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of frostbite injury and optimize patient outcomes.
