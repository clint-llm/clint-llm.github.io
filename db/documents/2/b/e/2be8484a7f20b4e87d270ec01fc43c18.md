The primary pathology involving the radius and ulna arises from fractures, which can be classified based on specific patterns and sites of involvement. Fractures usually occur in the middle third of the bones and can involve dislocation of the nearest joint due to the transmission of force via the interosseous membrane. Regardless of the site of the fracture, management should begin with a history and physical followed by plain films of the affected site and, if possible, the joint above and below; orthogonal radiographic views of each site are mandatory to appropriately manage each fracture within the guidelines of the standard of care management.

- Dorsally displaced distal radius fractures (commonly referred to as "Colle's fractures") – One of the most common forearm fractures. It involves a complete transverse fracture of the distal 2 cm of the radius. The distal fragment is displaced posteriorly, resulting in the classic "dinner fork" deformity. The etiology is usually a fall on an outstretched hand with concomitant hyperextension. The fracture site can often be comminuted, and avulsion of the ulnar styloid process is also a feature.

- Reverse Colles fracture (Smith fracture) – A complete transverse fracture of the distal 2 cm of the radius with anterior displacement of the distal fragment. Usually secondary to a fall on a flexed hand.

- Monteggia fracture – A fracture within the proximal third of the ulna with concomitant dislocation of the radial head.

- Galeazzi fracture – A fracture of the distal third of the radius with accompanying dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint.

- Barton fracture – An intraarticular fracture of the distal radius with concomitant dislocation of the radiocarpal joint.

- Essex-Lopresti fracture-dislocation – Fracture of the radial head with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint and rupture of the interosseous membrane.

- Chauffeur fracture – An intraarticular fracture of the radial styloid process.

- "Both Bone" forearm fractures - descriptive term to describe many different types of patterns involving fractures of the radius and ulnar shaft long bone

Incomplete fracture patterns of the forearm:

- An isolated "buckle" or "torus" fracture pattern of the radius or ulna is seen in pediatric patients as a manifestation of a pathologic force compromising one cortex of the bone (resulting in compression on one side depending on the direction of the force).

- Greenstick fracture is the term given to the incomplete fracture pattern in which one cortex is broken, but the other cortex only bowed.

For both of these incomplete fracture patterns, there is no clear randomized control evidence as to the most efficacious treatment strategy
