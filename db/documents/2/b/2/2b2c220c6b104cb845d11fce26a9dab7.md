The thenar eminence is primarily innervated by the median nerve (T1) but does receive some contribution from the ulnar nerve (C8, T1): the two heads of the flexor pollicis brevis have different innervation. The deep head is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8, T1), while the superficial head is innervated by the recurrent branch of the median nerve (T1). Â The abductor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis are both innervated solely by the recurrent branch of the median nerve.

The median nerve arises from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. It then travels distally down the arm between the two heads of the pronator teres. It passes within the carpal tunnel, deep to the flexor retinaculum, and branches further. One of these branches is the recurrent branch which innervates the thenar eminence.
