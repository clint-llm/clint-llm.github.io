The occipital bone is the most posterior cranial bone and the main bone of the occiput. It is considered a flat bone, like all other cranial bones, meaning that its primary function is either for protection or to provide a broad surface for muscle attachment. The scalp, which consists of five layers, covers the bone. Going from superficial to deep, the scalp layers are skin, dense connective tissue, aponeurosis of the occipitofrontalis muscle, loose areolar connective tissue, and the periosteum. Within the dense connective tissue are the occipital artery and vein, and the lesser and greater occipital nerves. The inner part of the bone forms the posterior cranial fossa.
