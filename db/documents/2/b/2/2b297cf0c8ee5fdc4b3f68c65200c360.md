Dextran is a polysaccharide made from natural sources of glucose by bacteria and with 1:6 glucoside links.

Microsurgeons can use dextran to decrease the risk of vascular complications such as thrombosis.

As an eye lubricant, dextran 70 increases viscosity on the surface of the eye to retain tear fluid.
