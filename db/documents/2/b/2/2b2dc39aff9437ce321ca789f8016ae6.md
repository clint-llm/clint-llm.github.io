At a minimum, patients with complaints of hearing loss or speech comprehension should be evaluated by an audiologist for pure tone audiometry with any additional indicated tests. Evaluation by an otolaryngologist is also often helpful, especially if there are any unusual patterns on the audiometry to suggest an etiology of loss other than ARHL.
