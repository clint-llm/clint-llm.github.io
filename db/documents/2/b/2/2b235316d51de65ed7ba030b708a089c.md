Androgenic alopecia most often respects the anterior borderline; intermediate hair and hairy duvet persist on this anterior border. There is no scarring or peri-follicular inflammation. The eyebrows are spared. The biopsy, when performed, highlights the miniaturization of the follicles. A sudden onset of FFA affecting the eyebrows and the occipital areas can be confused with alopecia areata. Scarring alopecia could not be obvious in the early stages. Dermoscopy could be helpful in this cases, revealing exclamation mark hair, black dots, yellow dots, and pigtail hairs

Chronic lupus erythematosus may lead to plaque-like frontal scarring, but there is a destructive pigment that is not present in FFA, diffuse hyperkeratosis, and diffuse erythema. Some women have high frontal implantation of familial origin

Traction alopecia is common in women
