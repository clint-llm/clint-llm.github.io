The heart is usually made up of four chambers. Two top chambers are called the atria, and the two bottom chambers are the ventricles. In congenital heart univentricular lesions requiring Fontan completion or correction, there is usually only one functional single ventricle. Therefore, this single ventricle carries the job of pumping blood to the lungs and the systemic body.

Since the first description of a Fontan to surgically treat tricuspid atresia, the procedure has been modified to treat many different variations of functionally univentricular congenital heart disease in addition to tricuspid atresia, with hypoplastic left heart syndrome being the most common (25% to 67%).
