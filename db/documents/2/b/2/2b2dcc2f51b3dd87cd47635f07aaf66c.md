The acute vertigo of labyrinthitis should resolve within a couple of days; however, milder symptoms may persist for several weeks. The prognosis is usually good if the patient has no serious neurological sequelae. However, neurological complications may require further interventions, and the prognosis becomes more guarded. For example, ventriculoperitoneal shunts may be required in patients with hydrocephalus secondary to bacterial meningitis.
