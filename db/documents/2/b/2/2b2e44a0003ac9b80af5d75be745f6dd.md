Ethacrynic acid is usually reserved for patients with sulfa allergies. The interprofessional healthcare team should be aware of the drug's rapid onset and monitor the dosages of the drug to avoid hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalances. Pharmacists and clinicians are to pay close attention to patients with renal failure and adjust therapeutic levels of ethacrynic acid accordingly. Nurses should be aware of the signs of adverse events so they can report these promptly to the ordering clinician. To improve outcomes, monitor blood pressure, and avoid concurrent use of other ototoxic medications. If ototoxicity, hepatotoxicity, or electrolyte imbalances are suspected, ethacrynic acid therapy should stop immediately, and the patient should receive appropriate supportive care and symptom management. Utilizing interprofessional team strategies will result in better therapeutic outcomes and fewer adverse events with ethacrynic acid, driving better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
