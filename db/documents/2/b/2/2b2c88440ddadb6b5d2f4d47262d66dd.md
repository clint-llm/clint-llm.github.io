Varicoceles are usually asymptomatic. The patient may describe a "bag of worms" if the varicocele is large enough. Varicoceles present as soft lumps above the testicle, usually on the left side of the scrotum. Right-sided and bilateral varicoceles may also occur. Patients may sometimes complain of pain or heaviness in the scrotum. Often they are found in the course of an infertility workup.

Large varicoceles are easily identified on simple inspection alone and will show the typical "bag of worms" appearance. Medium varicoceles would describe those that are identifiable by palpation or physical examination without any bearing down by the patient. Small varicoceles are defined as those that can be identified only during a strong Valsalva (bearing down).
