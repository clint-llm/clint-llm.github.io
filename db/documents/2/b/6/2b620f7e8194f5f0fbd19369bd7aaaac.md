Following surgical excision, it appropriate to avoid contact sports and strenuous activity. Sutures may be removed within 7-10 days. Patients should be instructed on the fact that the surgical scar will generally take 8 weeks to reach a maximum of 80% tensile strength of the original skin strength. Scar revision, if necessary, should take place between 6 months to 1 year following excision as the remodeling phase of wound healing occurs between 3 weeks to 1 year.
