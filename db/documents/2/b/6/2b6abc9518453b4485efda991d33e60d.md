Complications for nuclear renal scans are minimal. They include the potential complication of radiation exposure to patients, but exposures are very low compared to for example a CT scan of the abdomen. Radiation exposure from a 99m-Tc labeled renal scan is approximately 1 msvt as compared to 10 msvt for a CT scan of the abdomen. According to a 2006 article, the radiation dose of single technetium 99m nuclear renal scan was approximately equivalent to the exposure from 50 chest radiographs while that of an abdominal or pelvic CT was reported as equivalent to 500 chest films.

Pain or inflammation can develop at the injection site as with any injection.

Adverse reactions from radionuclides include vasovagal reaction, fever, and allergies, but most of them are mild and do not require hospitalization.
