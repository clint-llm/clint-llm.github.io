**Effect of SARS-CoV-2****on the Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract**

The pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract involvement in SARS-CoV-2 is unknown and is likely multifactorial. Several hypotheses have been described so far, including the direct ACE 2 mediated viral cytotoxicity of the intestinal mucosa, cytokine-induced inflammation, gut dysbiosis, and vascular abnormalities. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into the hosts' cells by binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors present on the respiratory epithelium followed by priming of the spike protein by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that facilitates cell entry and subsequent viral replication

**Effect of SARS-CoV-2****on the Liver and Pancreatobiliary System**

Elevation in liver biochemistries is frequently noted in 14% to 53% of patients with COVID-19 infection

Although there is an abundant expression of ACE2 receptors in the enterocytes, there is a limited expression of ACE2 receptors in the hepatocytes

In addition to the luminal GI tract cells, ACE2 is expressed in the pancreatic islet cells and pancreas microvasculature pericytes as well. Literature describing the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the pancreas manifesting as acute pancreatitis is uncommon. Hyperlipasemia has been reported in a minority of COVID-19 patients and is not specific to pancreatitis and was not reflective of severe infection or poor clinical outcome
