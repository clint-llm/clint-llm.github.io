The literature on the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysm is continuously evolving and reflects an interplay of protein degeneration, thrombosis, hemodynamic stress, and inflammatory cytokines contributed by genetic triggers and developmental risk factors.

Major theories on the development of aneurysm have surfaced from in-vitro studies that emphasize the role of the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins by proteolytic enzymesÂ such as elastase, collagenase, plasmin, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

As most of the cases of an isolated aortic arch aneurysm are seen in relation to underlying atherosclerosis, lab findings suggest that inflammatory cells present within the atheroma accelerate the breakdown of matrix protein by the release of the inflammatory mediators.

Independent risk factors for both atherosclerosis and aneurysm, including hypertension and smoking, exert a direct effect on the vasculature, adding to the multifactorial pathophysiology of aneurysm formation.
