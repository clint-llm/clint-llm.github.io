Diagnosis and definitive treatment are often delayed due to the non-specific clinical findings resulting in misdiagnosis, and elderly patients frequently present late. EMPD is commonly mistaken for: contact dermatitis, fungal infection, psoriasis seborrheic dermatitis, anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia, lichen sclerosis, melanoma, mycosis fungoides, and histiocytosis. Perianal or vulvar EMPD may also be misdiagnosed as leukoplakia, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, condylomata acuminate, hidradenitis suppurativa, or Crohnâ€™s disease.
