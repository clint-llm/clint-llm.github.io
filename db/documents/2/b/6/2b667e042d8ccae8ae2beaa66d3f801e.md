Strong evidence supporting minimum preflight surface intervals is lacking. Most studies have been performed in hyperbaric and hypobaric chambers rather than in real diving and flying conditions. For recreational divers, the most widely used flying after diving guidelines is from a published consensus of attendees at the 2002 Flying After Diving Workshop held by Divers Alert Network (DAN) and Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS). These recommendations do not apply to military, commercial, scientific, or public service diving, nor for recreational divers who dive with gas mixtures other than air, for example, those divers who use nitrogen and oxygen mixture such as Nitrox or oxygen, helium, and nitrogen mixture such as trimix.
