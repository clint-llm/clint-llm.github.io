The main FDA-approved indication of tranylcypromine is for major depressive disorder without melancholia. The non-FDA-approved indications for this medication include treatment-resistant depression, treatment-resistant social anxiety disorder, treatment-resistant panic disorder, and atypical depression. Atypical depression consists of hyperphagia, hypersomnia, rejection sensitivity, and leaden paralysis accompanying the depression. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tranylcypromine so providers can direct patient therapy where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of action of tranylcypromine.
- Review the approved indications for using tranylcypromine.
- Describe how to prevent potential serotonin syndrome when initiating tranylcypromine therapy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with tranylcypromine therapy to improve patient outcomes for patients with indicated conditions.
