Stenosis of the renal artery can reduce blood flow through the kidney and produce increased renin, which converts angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I and subsequent cleavage forms angiotensin II. This situation induces vasoconstriction and increases renal artery blood pressure, leading to renal hypertension, which is an important differential diagnosis in patients with high blood pressure.
