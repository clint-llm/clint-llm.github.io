# Introduction

Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is a common ophthalmologic surgical procedure used to correct refractive error. LASIK was patented in 1989 by Dr. Gholam Peyman.

**A Historical Perspective**

Understanding the impact of LASIK in refractive correction requires knowledge of its development. The first significant breakthrough in refractive therapy came in the 1930s, with radial keratotomy by Dr. Tsutomu Sato in Japan. By making incisions deep into Descemet’s membrane, the flattening of the cornea helped correct myopia. However, many complications, like corneal decompensation, came from these deep incisions. Alternative methods were developed, such as the hexagonal keratectomy by Dr. Antonio Méndez in Mexico.

Keratomileusis is the medical term for corneal reshaping, which came about in the 1950s and ’60s with the work of Spanish ophthalmologist José Barraquer. His technique initially involved the microkeratome, a mechanical instrument that, with its oscillating sharp blade, cuts the top layer of the cornea away to create a lenticule and reveal underlying stroma. An additional cut through the stroma was made, and the lenticule was sutured back into place. This technique came to be known as anterior lamellar keratoplasty (ALK).

The excimer, or “excited dimer” laser and its medical use, was discovered in 1970 by Dr. Stephen Trokel and Dr. Rangaswamy Srinivasan in the early 1980s.

LASIK is essentially a combination of ALK and PRK, which was first utilized in the early 1990s.

# Anatomy and Physiology

The refractive power of the eye is attributed, in part, to the cornea. It is responsible for about two-thirds of the eye’s power of refraction.

The cornea is the one-half millimeter thick tissue comprising the anterior surface of the eye. It has five layers consisting of, from superficial to deep, a squamous epithelial layer, the anterior basement membrane (Bowman’s), a stroma filled with keratocytes and collagen, and the posterior basement membrane (Descemet’s) with a single layer endothelium separating it from the anterior chamber of the eye.

LASIK surgery changes the refractive power of the cornea first by creating a hinged corneal flap from the epithelium, Bowman’s membrane, and the superficial part of the corneal stroma. The more posterior layers of the stroma are exposed for ablation treatment. Thus, for a myopic treatment, central corneal curvature is decreased with the ablation, and the total refractive power of the eye decreases to attain emmetropia, or normal vision (see figure 1). For a hyperopic treatment, the paracentral area is flattened, leading to a steeper central cornea and an increase in refractive power (see figure 1). After targeted laser therapy to the stroma, the flap is replaced, and reepithelialization occurs over the flap margin. Sutures are not necessary.

# Indications

LASIK is an option in patients with low to high myopia, with or without astigmatism. It has been shown that LASIK can improve myopia from -2.00 to -20.00 D; however, it is generally indicated in patients with low to moderate myopia, from -0.5 D up to -9.00 D, as these patients have a higher probability of reaching emmetropia.

Currently, LASIK is the most common laser treatment for refractive error. In addition to its applications for a wide variety of refractive errors, patients suffer relatively little pain compared with techniques that do not create a flap, with recovery time to baseline being only a few days.

# Contraindications

**Absolute Contraindications**

**Refractive Instability**

Changes greater than 0.5 D in the last year constitute instability, and LASIK is not recommended for patients since it is a permanent procedure and operating on eyes that change rapidly may lead to severe complications such as postoperative ectasia.

**Corneal Ectasia**

A normal corneal thickness is around 540-550 microns.

**Keratoconus**

A cone-shaped cornea is an absolute contraindication for LASIK due to the risk of the condition causing corneal ectasia.

**Uncontrolled Systemic Diseases**

Systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves disease, Crohn's disease, and other diseases that cause keratoconjunctivitis sicca or other forms of ocular pathology.

**Active Infection**

Bacterial blepharitis and keratitis can increase the risk of spreading infection and inflammation through the cornea into the eye.

**Relative Contraindications**

**Age**

While LASIK is generally not advised for children due to the changes in refraction during adolescence, it has been successful in patients under 18 years old with high myopia or other severe pathologies.

**Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus or Herpes Simplex Keratitis**

Active infection by Herpes should be treated before surgery occurs. A study determined that it is safe to operate on patients with a history of ocular Herpes; however, it is recommended to wait one year for the virus to be in remission before surgical intervention.

**Cataract**

Patients with mild cataracts may still receive LASIK surgery, but with the caveat that when the cataract progresses, visual acuity may be impaired despite LASIK. Intraocular lens implantation following cataract surgery is an indicated alternative procedure to LASIK.

**Glaucoma**

Patients with glaucoma who undergo LASIK may develop a false decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) after surgery due to decreased corneal thickness.

**Corneal Dystrophy (CD)**

Certain diseases like Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy may be accelerated with surgical interventions such as LASIK.

**Keloidosis**

It is suggested by some sources that patients with a history of keloids may have their surgical results complicated by the disease.

**Pupil Size**

It has been historically reported that patients with a larger pupil size may have an increased risk for postsurgical visual complications, such as halos/star-bursting with light, and glare.

# Equipment

**Excimer Laser**

There are various excimer lasers approved by the United States Federal Drug Agency (US FDA), each with advantages that may be chosen according to the patient’s needs. Differences among lasers include beam size, beam repetition speed, and other benefits such as eye-tracking.

**Femtosecond Laser**

Flap creation can be made with various approaches, as described in the technique section; however, the general approach with LASIK currently is to create the flap using a femtosecond laser. The advantage of the laser over mechanical techniques is that the flap can be created thinner and with more precision, which leads to better results and fewer flap-related complications after surgery.

# Preparation

Before a screening examination, contact lenses should be temporarily discontinued 1 to 2 weeks in advance to allow the corneal surface to stabilize, thus giving more accurate measurements.

The cornea is evaluated by keratometry and pachymetry.

For a more detailed evaluation of candidacy, the Randleman criteria can help screen patients who are at high risk for developing post-surgical corneal ectasia. The criteria consider variables such as topographical results, corneal thickness, age, and spherical manifest refraction.

Once the patient is approved for LASIK, the Munnerlyn formula is used to calculate the ablation zone and depth for LASIK treatment, which incorporates the thickness of tissue ablated, the diameter of the optic zone, and the dioptric correction.

# Technique or Treatment

**Pre-Surgery**

All equipment should be checked for safety, and to ensure patient topographical data is imported into the excimer laser. The patient should be given education on the routine of the procedure, as well as signing an informed consent document.

**Surgical Technique**

In general, LASIK surgery is performed in the following manner: the patient is brought to the table and placed in a comfortable supine position. The fellow eye is taped closed, and the operative eye is positioned open with a speculum.

After the flap is created, the surgeon carefully reflects the flap to reveal the underlying stroma. The surgeon positions and signals the excimer laser to provide sculpting to the stromal surface through photoablation.

**Post-Surgery**

The patient instills preservative-free artificial tears because dry eyes are a common side-effect of surgery. Patients are advised to use artificial tears frequently, but if symptoms persist, the use of punctal plugs may be prescribed. The patient is also given antibiotics, and steroidal eye drops to use for 5 to 14 days after the surgery.

**Alternate Procedures**

There are other laser-assisted procedures that may be options for the patient with refractive errors. In addition, with advances in technology, variations to LASIK have been implemented successfully in practice.

**PRK**

One study shows that while LASIK has better results for visual acuity sooner after the surgery, patients with PRK tended to maintain better refraction years after the initial surgery.

**Femtosecond Lenticule Extraction (FLEx) or Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE)**

The femtosecond laser removes the squamous epithelium without leaving a flap. It is indicated in patients with higher myopia (-6.00 D to -12.00 D) compared to LASIK.

**Laser Epithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK)**

Lasek is a procedure where an alcohol solution is used to assist in the removal of the superficial corneal layer. Epi-LASEK uses an epi-microkeratome to remove the layer. Both techniques are variants of PRK and can be considered as viable alternative procedures.

# Complications

**Dry Eyes**

One of the most common transient side-effects from LASIK is dry eyes due to a lack of tear production. This is due to the interruption of the lacrimal reflex as a result of nervous tissue being severed during the procedure.

**Visual Aberrations**

20% of patients will report some form of visual change.

**Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis**

Patients may also report blurriness and foreign body sensation that may be caused by diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK), or “sands of Sahara” syndrome, a sterile inflammatory response.

**Corneal Flap Complications**

The incidence of microstriae, macrostriae, buttonholing, incomplete cap, free cap, cap dislodgement, and epithelial ingrowth after surgery, is a low-risk event, with 0.1-4% of patients reporting some form of complication.

**Post-LASIK Ectasia**

A thin cornea before surgery may increase the risk of developing ectasia or further thinning of the cornea. The incidence has been reported from 0.04% to 0.6%.

**Infectious Keratitis**

Less than 0.1% of patients will develop an infection after LASIK.Staphylococcus species, or atypical mycobacteria, especially if the onset of infection is one-two weeks after surgery.

**Rare Complications**

Ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and posterior vitreous detachment, are potential but very rare complications of LASIK, occurring in less than 0.1% of patients.

# Clinical Significance

While LASIK may be used in refractive errors, it was shown that this procedure is reliable in patients with myopia of - 6.0 D or less and astigmatism of less than 2.0 D.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The professional team in LASIK treatment typically consists of ophthalmic surgeons, optometrists, nurses, medical assistants, and technicians. Team members work together in the outpatient setting to determine the best candidates for LASIK to prevent unnecessary costs and complications to the patient. The team, on the day of surgery, is responsible for adhering to standard clinical protocols, including obtaining the patient’s informed consent for the procedure, the correct marking of which eye will receive each specific treatment, the proper placement, and preoperative evaluation of necessary equipment for the procedure, a timeout called before the operation, and patient education throughout the treatment process. Communication among team members is vital, concerning any changes in patient status at any time before, during, or after the procedure and optimizes patient outcomes.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

The team educates the patient regarding the procedure and obtains informed consent before surgery. They perform instrumentation checks with correct placement and distribution during the procedure and ensure sterility. Communication with other team members is crucial for patient safety.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

The team guides the patient through post-procedure education for proper eye care, including the administration of prescribed eye drops. They assist with patient follow-up in an outpatient setting, with eye examinations to document visual acuity and visual changes.
