Breast cancer care requires an interprofessional team approach, including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, nurse navigators, physical therapists, and more. These teams are crucial in formulating plans during breast tumor boards and in the aftercare of these patients for survivorship planning. Being up to date in all aspects of these specialties provides for the best patient care, improved patient outcomes, and overall enhances the team's performance when taking care of these patients.
