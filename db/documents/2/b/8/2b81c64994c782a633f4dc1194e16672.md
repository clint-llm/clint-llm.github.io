An epileptic syndrome is a chronic disorder that heavily depends on an interprofessional team to provide a holistic and integrated approach to provide the best possible long term seizure control.

Collaborating by shared decision making and communication are key elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities.
