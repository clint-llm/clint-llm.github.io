Laryngeal mask airways (LMA) are supraglottic airway devices. They may be used as a temporary method to maintain an open airway during the administration of anesthesia or as an immediate life-saving measure in a patient with a difficult or failed airway. Laryngeal mask airways were introduced into clinical practice in the 1980s where they were initially used predominantly in the operating room. Since then, their use has become more widespread in the intensive care unit, emergency department, and field settings. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in placing a laryngeal mask airway and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with difficult airways.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the technique for laryngeal mask airway use. 
- Describe the indications for laryngeal mask airways. 
- Review the complications of laryngeal mask airways. 
- Explain the importance of well-coordinated teamwork and clear communicatioto facilitate appropriate use of laryngeal mask airways in patients with difficult airways.
