The embryological development of the arterial system of the upper limb is highly complex. It appears to commence with the development at day 29 to 31 of a capillary plexus from the dorsal aorta (Carnegie stage 12). This proceeds during Carnegie stage 13 to develop with the limb and selectively enlarges to give rise to the greater and lesser components of the relevant vasculature. The subclavian and axillary arterial vasculature has generally matured from the capillary plexus by Carnegie stage 15.
