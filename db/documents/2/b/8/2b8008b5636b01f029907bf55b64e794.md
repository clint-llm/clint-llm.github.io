ADAMTS-13 deficiency is the cornerstone, lead to accumulation of ultra-large vWF with the formation of platelet-rich microthrombi that can embolize and occlude arterioles. The vWF-platelet aggregates are large enough to obstruct microvessels, thus conduce to the clinical and histopathological changes (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ischemic organ failure). Although deficiency of ADAMTS-13 is necessary to cause TTP, it is not sufficient to induce the clinical syndrome. This was observed in some patients during the long-term, and following they showed a low activity of ADAMTS-13 without the clinical syndrome. The hypothesis of “second trigger” explains that some conditions such as infections, pregnancy, and inflammation increase plasmatic vWF level conducing to overt TTP.
