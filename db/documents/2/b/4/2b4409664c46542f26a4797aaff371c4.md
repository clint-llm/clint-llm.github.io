A pre-anesthetic evaluation must be performed for each patient undergoing general anesthesia, focusing on identifying potential risks or complications related to the upcoming procedure and composing an individualized plan for patient care. Often, the patient can relay important information regarding unilateral restriction or congestion in the nasal airway and give some direction as to which naris should be used for the NTI. If the patient interview does not yield information related to the relative patency of one side versus the other, then physical examination may guide the laterality of intubation.

Anterior rhinoscopy may be performed (this is not a common practice), which gives the anesthesia provider the ability to visualize the anterior portion of each nasal cavity. The main limitation of anterior rhinoscopy is the inability to provide information regarding the posterior nasal cavity. To fully assess the pathway, a flexible fiber-optic nasopharyngoscope or bronchoscope may be passed into the nasopharynx.
