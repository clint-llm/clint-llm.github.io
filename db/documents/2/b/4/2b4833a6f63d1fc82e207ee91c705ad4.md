Currently, there is no known cause to explain the development of GERD. Over the years, several risk factors have been identified and implicated in the pathogenesis of GERD. Motor abnormalities such as esophageal dysmotility causing impaired esophageal acid clearance, impairment in the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), transient LES relaxation, and delayed gastric emptying are included in the causation of GERD et al.Â concluded that obesity was associated with an increased risk of developing GERD symptoms, erosive esophagitis, and esophageal carcinoma et al. evaluated the predictive factors for erosive reflux disease in more than 6000 patients with GERD and noted that the odds ratio for the erosive disease increased with the body mass index (BMI)
