Tofacitinib exerts its mechanism of action by inhibiting intracellular cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase JAK enzymes, which are involved in adaptive and innate immune reactions in the process of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs).

The intracellular Janus kinases' natural role is to phosphorylate the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) enzymes which further influence gene expression and impact hematopoiesis and immune cell function.
