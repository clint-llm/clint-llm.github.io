Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a toxic noninflammatory myopathy caused by exogenous corticosteroid administration. The condition typically develops with doses higher than 10 mg prednisone equivalents/day used for four weeks or longer. However, 2 to 3 weeks of higher doses (such as 40 to 60 mg prednisone/day) have been associated with more acute presentations. Oral and intravenous formulations are most associated with corticosteroid myopathy, although case reports exist regarding steroid myopathy following inhaled corticosteroids and epidural, intramuscular, or intra-articular injection.
