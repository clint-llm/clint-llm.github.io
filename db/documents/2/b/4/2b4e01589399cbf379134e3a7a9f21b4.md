To easily understand respiratory physiology, lungs can be compared to balloons. Balloons are elastic structures that tend to collapse if nothing is preventing the air from inside to leak out. On the other hand, the chest wall also has elastic recoil, which, at rest, tends to expand. The pleural space, filled with pleural fluid, is what juxtaposes the two surfaces. The pressure difference between the alveolar pressure and the intrapleural pressure is the transmural pressure across the lung (i.e., TPP). The pressure difference between the intrapleural pressure and the atmospheric pressure is the transmural pressure across the chest wall (CWP). At rest, the TPP is approximatelyÂ 4 mmHg, and the CWP is approximately -4 mmHg. In other words, at rest, the inward elastic recoil of the lung exactly opposes the outward acting elastic recoil of the chest wall, and there is no net airflow.
