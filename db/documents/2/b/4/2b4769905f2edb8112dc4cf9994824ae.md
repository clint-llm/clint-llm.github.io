Many latest developments in the fields of host immune responses and pathogenesis, better diagnostic modalities, and treatment of TB are happening globally.

Human genetic polymorphisms are being identified that could explain the heterogeneity of host immune response to anti-inflammatory therapies. Studies on genomics and metabolomics are identifying survival-predicting biomarkers in CSF (αβ T cells, NK cells, and pro-resolving mediators) that may be used to tailor and individualize therapy.

Advanced imaging techniques and sequences like 3-D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) are being studied to delineate brain lesions better. Phase-contrast MRI is another novel and sensitive technique to assess altered CSF flow dynamics in patients with TBM.

Novel promising drugs such as linezolid, bedaquiline, and pretomanid are being tested in various combinations, especially in highly drug-resistant forms.

Aspirin is being investigated as an adjunctive treatment to reduce infarction incidence because it could inhibit CSF thromboxane A2 and upregulate pre-resolvins.

Suitable strategies are also being designed and implemented to accomplish the targets of the End Tuberculosis Strategy on a global level.
