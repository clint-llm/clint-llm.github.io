Pamidronate belongs to the drug class known as bisphosphonates, whose therapeutic value stems from their ability to inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

FDA-approved indications for pamidronate include moderate or severe hypercalcemia of malignancy, moderate to severe Paget disease of bone, osteolytic bone metastases of breast cancer, and osteolytic lesions of multiple myeloma.

Non-FDA-approved indications for pamidronate include: osteoporosis, complex regional pain syndrome, osteoporosis secondary to chronic glucocorticoid use and prolonged immobility, bone loss, nonmetastatic hormone-responsive prostate cancer, and osteogenesis imperfecta in children.
