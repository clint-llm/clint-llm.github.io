In immunocompetent individuals, GCBL will normally start as a small, often keratotic, plaque usually on the foreskin of the penis and will gradually, over up to twenty years, change into a structure typically described as a ‘cauliflower-like growth’ approximately twenty centimeters in size. The tumorous growth often forms ulcers or horns and is usually malodorous. When found on the penis, it can extend into the penile urethra or the corpus cavernous and produce fistulas. Although lymphadenopathy (usually regional) is seen with this tumor, it is most often caused by secondary spread and not because of metastasis of the tumor, which is very uncommon.

In the case of perianal GCBL, the first presenting symptoms are usually in the form of a painful mass, bleeding, fistulations, or abscesses.

In immunocompromised and pregnant patients, GCBL proliferates at a much more rapid pace compared to the proliferation rates seen in immunocompetent and nonpregnant individuals.
