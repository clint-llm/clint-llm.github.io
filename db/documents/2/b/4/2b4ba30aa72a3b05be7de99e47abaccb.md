**Screening for Familial Hypercholesterolemia**

Screening for familial hypercholesterolemia should occur in people age 2 years and older if the patient has a family history of hypercholesterolemia or premature CHD.

**Suspicious for Familial Hypercholesterolemia**

- In people 20 years old or younger: if untreated fasting serum LDL cholesterol levels are 160 mg/dL and higher or non-HDL cholesterol levels are 190 mg/dL and higher

- In adults older than 20 years: if fasting LDL cholesterol levels are 190 mg/dL and higher or non-HDL cholesterol is 220 mg/dL and higher.

- FH in the family member or total cholesterol greater than 240 mg/dL in either parent.

- Tendon xanthomas at any age, corneal arcus senilis in a patient younger than 45 years of age, and yellow-orange xanthelasma tuberous or xanthomas in a patient aged 20 to 25 years.

**Genetic Tests or Clinical Criteria/Diagnostic Criteria for Heterozygous FH (HeFH) and Homozygous FH(HoFH)**

- Heterozygous FH (HeFH): The two most commonly used criteria for evaluating and diagnosing FH are the Dutch lipid clinic criteria and the Simon Broome criteria.

- Homozygous FH (HoFH): Clinically, HoFH is diagnosed based on untreated LDL-C plasma level greater than 500 mg/dL (more than 13 mmol/L) or treated LDL-C plasma concentration equal to or greater than 300 mg/dL (more than 8 mmol/L), and the presence of tendon xanthoma or cutaneous manifestation before the age of 10 years or both parents has consistent criteria for HeFH based on the untreated elevation of LDL-C levels.

**Cascade Screening**

Cascade screening is defined as evaluation and screening that involves family members of the patient with FH.

**Radiology**

Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of the heart and aorta is recommended annually in patients with homozygous FH. Radiographic imaging of the Achilles tendon helps accurately measure Achilles tendon xanthomas.

**Biopsy**

If a skin lesion or the diagnosis of heterozygous FH is unclear, a biopsy of the skin lesion can be performed. Both xanthelasmas and the xanthomas of FH contain accumulations of cholesterol.
