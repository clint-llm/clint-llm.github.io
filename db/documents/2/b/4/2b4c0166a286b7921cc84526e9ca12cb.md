Patients with pseudomembranous colitis most commonlyÂ report symptomatic diarrhea. C. difficile presents in various ways. Patients may be asymptomatic carriers or present with fulminant pseudomembranous colitis with toxic megacolon. Generally, the presence of pseudomembranes indicates a more severe case of C. difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Other notable symptoms and signs include fever, abdominal cramping, and leukocytosis. Severe pseudomembranous colitis can manifest profound leukocytosis with white blood cell counts up to 100,000/mm3, hypovolemia, hypotension, protein-losing enteropathy, reactive arthritis, and toxic megacolon. About 3% to 8% of pseudomembranous colitis will develop fulminant infection including severe ileus, toxic megacolon, hypovolemia, hypotension, renal dysfunction, colonic perforation with attendant peritonitis, and septic shock.
