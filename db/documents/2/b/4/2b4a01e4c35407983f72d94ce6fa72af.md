**Selective Polishing**

Routine tooth polishing is still the standard practice among most dental care professionals on the basis that a smooth and lustrous surface is less likely to be colonized by bacteria. Regular tooth polishing using the traditional method (rubber-cup with prophylaxis paste) removes the enamel’s superficial layer and causes morphological changes in the tooth structure over time.

**Manual Devices**

**Porte Polisher**

A porte polisher rubs the abrasive agent against the tooth surface with a wedge-shaped, tapered, orange-wooden point.

It is noiseless with minimum aerosol production, portable, accessible on various aspects of the teeth, and hence can be used on malpositioned teeth and generates minimal heat. But it has the disadvantage that is time-consuming and requires more force.

**Polishing Strips**

These are for interproximal regions and line angles of teeth. Since they are very abrasive, the soft tissue in the interproximal areas must be protected. They come in various colors and sizes of abrasive agents.

**Engine-Driven Devices**

These are widely used and need either a straight or a contra-angled handpiece. A polishing brush or a rubber cup is attached to the handpiece used at a velocity of 2500 to 3000 rpm. It is estimated that the average speed used by dental hygienists is 2500 rpm.

**Air-Powder Polishers**

These are generally used for supragingival plaque removal as they reach the inaccessible areas where the rotary devices cannot reach like furcations, flutings, close root proximities.

The air powder polisher can also be used with an ultrasonic scaler or directly with the air/water connector or separately. It works with foot control. The nozzle of the handpiece has to be held 3 to 4 mm from the tooth as it propels the slurry of water and sodium bicarbonate on the tooth. The motion used in air powder polishers is a paintbrush motion at an angle of 60 degrees for anterior teeth, an 80-degree angle for posterior teeth, and 90-degree on the occlusal surfaces. It should be directed at the middle thirds of the tooth in a circular motion with an air pressure of 40 to 100 psi and inlet water pressure of 20 to 60 psi.

**Advantages**

The main advantage of air-powder polishers is their ability to efficiently remove biofilm, without harming the periodontal soft tissues and the hard tissue structures. It is a faster method, and there is more patient comfort.

- It saves time, and hence, it can prevent patient and operator fatigue.

- It can be used in orthodontically bracketed teeth as it does not physically damage and disturb the bands and the wires and also does not disturb the bonding cement.

- It reduces dentinal sensitivity by blocking the tubular opening with bicarbonate crystals.

- It reaches inaccessible areas that cannot be reached by rotary devices.

**Disadvantages**

Since they use sodium bicarbonate in the slurry, it should be cautiously used in patients with restricted sodium diets. Non-sodium prophy powder can be used, which contains aluminum trihydroxide in such cases.

- It should be carefully used in patients with respiratory, renal, or metabolic disease, diuretics, or long-term steroid therapy, those having titanium implants, or with children and in patients with infectious diseases.

- Infection control is a problem with these devices since they produce aerosols. Hence, pretreatment washes are recommended.

- There is a risk of subcutaneous emphysema intraorally. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions to avoid such complications.

Air polishers are generally used in the supragingival surfaces, but, glycine powder air polishers are used for removing sub-gingival biofilm that results in less erosion of the soft tissues and an 80% reduction in abrasion of the root surface as compared to hand instrumentation or sodium bicarbonate air polishing.

**Vector System**

These use a polishing fluid, which causes minimum damage to the cementum surface. The polishing fluid contains hydroxyapatite or an abrasive fluid containing silicon carbide with a resonating device that deflects the forces directed toward the tooth and hence protects the tooth. The plaque is removed by fluid dynamics and gives effective control of inflammation.
