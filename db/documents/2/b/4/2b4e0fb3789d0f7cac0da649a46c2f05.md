Abnormal uterine bleeding is a broad term that describes irregularities in the menstrual cycle involving frequency, regularity, duration, and volume of flow outside of pregnancy. Up to one-third of women will experience abnormal uterine bleeding in their life, with irregularities most commonly occurring at menarche and perimenopause. A normal menstrual cycle has a frequency of 24 to 38 days and lasts 2 to 7, with 5 to 80 milliliters of blood loss. Variations in any of these 4 parameters constitute abnormal uterine bleeding. This activity reviews abnormal uterine bleeding diagnosis and treatment and explains the importance of an interprofessional approach to evaluating and treating abnormal uterine bleeding.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding that can be remembered with the acronym PALM-COEIN, explaining which specific etiologies are included in the "not otherwise classified" category.
- Describe the epidemiology of abnormal uterine bleeding.
- Explain the causes of abnormal uterine bleeding related to the structure of the uterus versus the clotting pathway and the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. 
- Review the role of the interprofessional team in collaborating to treat women with abnormal uterine bleeding.
