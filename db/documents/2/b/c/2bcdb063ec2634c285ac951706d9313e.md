The differential diagnosis of cutaneous manifestations of neonatal lupus erythematosus includes neonatal rashes with no associated congenital heart block or maternal autoantibodies type A (Ro/SSA), B (La/SSB) or anti-U1 RNP. These rashes include acute annular urticaria, tinea corporis, seborrheic dermatitis, annular erythema of childhood, cutis marmorata telangiectasia congenita, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and some auto-inflammatory syndromes (CANDLE syndrome, APLAID syndrome, SAVI syndrome and C1q deficiency).

Other causes of fetal bradycardia or heart block include congenital heart block related to congenital heart defects such as L-transposition of the great arteries, endocardial cushion defects, Holt-Oram syndrome; and idiopathic, familial congenital heart block.
