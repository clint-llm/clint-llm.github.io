Functional dyspepsia prevalence varies worldwide, with higher prevalence in Western countries (10% to 40%), including the United States (US). In Asian countries, the prevalence is 5% to 30%.Â  Functional dyspepsia is found to be more common in women than in men. This difference is said to be due to inherent sex-specific differences in gastrointestinal function. For example, there exists sex-specific variation in hormone mechanisms, pain signaling, and health care maintenance.
