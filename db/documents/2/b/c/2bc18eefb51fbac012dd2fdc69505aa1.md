There are three groups of muscle in the back; superficial, intermediate, and deep muscle layers. The superficial layer consists of two muscles; splenius cervicis and splenius capitis. They play an important role in the extension of the neck and the movement of the shoulder.

The intermediate muscle group contains longissimus, iliocostalis, and spinalis muscles. All three muscles of the intermediate group have the same tendinous origin. These groups of muscles help in the flexion of the head and upper vertebral column and the movement of the thoracic cage. The deep layer consists of semispinalis, rotatores, and multifidus. The main function of this muscle group is the stabilization of the vertebral column and maintaining the posture. They also help in balance and proprioception.
