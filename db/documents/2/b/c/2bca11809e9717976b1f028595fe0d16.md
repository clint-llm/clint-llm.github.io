A band-like mononuclear infiltrate obscuring the interface between the follicular epithelium, and the dermis is found. The epithelial-stromal junction may have prominent vacuoles and dyskeratosis with individually necrotic, polygonal basal keratinocytes. Inflammation affects the upper portion of the follicle most severely, but it may extend down the length of the follicle. Perifollicular fibrosis and chronic inflammation may be seen in later stages. Ultimately, follicles are replaced by columns of sclerotic collagen called follicular scars. Such scars can be highlighted with elastic tissue stains. Grouped globular immunofluorescence, usually IgM, especially when found adjacent to the follicular epithelium, is the characteristic pattern seen in lichen planopilaris, in contrast to chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus where linear deposits of immunoreactants are typical.
