In the majority of the patients, PIVH is found incidentally during ultrasound screening for low-weight or preterm infants. Those with symptoms may show clinical neurological deterioration, respiratory distress, apnea, bulging fontanelle, seizures, hypoactivity, decreased responsiveness, or stupor.

Historical features that will predispose an infant to PIVH primarily result from the course of the pregnancy of the mother.

- Gestational age ≤32 weeks

- The absence of antenatal steroids

- Antenatal maternal hemorrhage

- Maternal chorioamnionitis

- Vaginal delivery

Specific details from the birth of the infant may also increase the likelihood of PIVH in the preterm infant.

- Birth weight less than 1500 g

- Early sepsis

- Hypotension requiring intervention

- Hypoxemia

- Hypercapnia

- Respiratory distress syndrome

- Positive pressure ventilation at birth

- Longer duration of assisted ventilation

- Pneumothorax

- Low Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes

- Seizure

- Patent ductus arteriosus

- Higher frequency of endotracheal suctioning

- Surfactant use

- Thrombocytopenia

Preterm infants with grade IV weighed less at birth and have less gestational age when compared with those with grade III.

The use of antenatal steroid treatments and cesarean section are factors that reduce the occurrence of PIVH.
