Protamine is a medication used to reverse and neutralize the anticoagulant effects of heparin. Protamine is the specific antagonist that neutralizes heparin-induced anticoagulation. Protamine is a strongly alkaline (nearly two-thirds of the amino acid composition is arginine) polycationic low-molecular-weight protein found in salmon sperm that is also currently available in a recombinant form. This activity reviews indications, contraindications, mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, and other key elements of protamine use that are pertinent for members of the interprofessional team that manage the care of patients who require reversal of heparin.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of administration of protamine.
- Describe the adverse effects of protamine administration.
- Summarize the appropriate monitoring necessary when administering protamine.
- Discuss the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving protamine in the cardiac operating room setting.
