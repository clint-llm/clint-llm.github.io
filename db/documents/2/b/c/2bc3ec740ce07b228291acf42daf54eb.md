The SIA has historically been considered to anastomose at the convergence of the subclavian artery and the eighth and ninth branches of the intersegmental arteries. New research, however, suggests the SIA originates instead from the seventh and eighth intersegmental arteries and instead of the subclavian itself, by two arteries located posterior to it. The portions of the intersegmental arteries curl between the aorta and the anastomosis. Following this inward curvature, the SIA serves as the primary source of arterial blood to the posterior intercostal arteries associated with the first and second ribs.
