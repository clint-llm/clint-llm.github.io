Specialized equipment needed for performing CN testing is minimal. Many of the supplies are readily available in the hospital or clinic setting. A 256-hertz or 512-hertz tuning fork is required to perform the Rinne and Weber tests.

Ishihara or Hardy-Rand-Ritter plates are used to evaluate color perception, and a fundoscopy is required for optic nerve testing. The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test or Sniffin’ Sticks are helpful in testing the olfactory nerve. If these cannot be obtained, items commonly found in the office or hospital, such as coffee, soap, or peanut butter, can be used.

A pen light or flashlight, cotton wisps, safety pins or blunt tip needles, and a hand-held Snellen chart are portable testing instruments that can be carried in a white coat. Sweet, sour, salty, and bitter solutions assess taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
