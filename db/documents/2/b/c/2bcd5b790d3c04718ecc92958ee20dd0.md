Further evaluation beyond the clinical diagnosis may be required to determine the exact cause and most effective treatment modality. The lesion can be cultured if a bacterial infection is suspected. Fungus, another common invader, can be elicited by a skin scraping of the lesion. The scraping should be taken from the active margin of a lesion, and a 20% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is added. The presence of hyphae and/or budding yeast, when viewed with light microscopy, indicates a fungal infection. If the presentation is unusual or therapy has failed, consider performing a biopsy. The use of a Wood lamp can help detect Pseudomonas or erythrasma (Corynebacterium minutissimum) infections. A fasting blood glucose level should be obtained if there is suspicion of diabetes mellitus. This is especially true with difficult to treat and recurrent episodes.
