The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is the concentration of oxygen in the gas mixture. The gas mixture at room air has a fraction of inspired oxygen of 21%, meaning that the concentration of oxygen at room air is 21%. The percentage of oxygen at different altitudes remains the same, meaning the FiO2 of air in the atmosphere remains 21%, irrespective of the altitude of an individual.
