Older patients are more vulnerable to complications. A delay in diagnosis and treatment worsens the condition. Renal insufficiency is a common manifestation that ultimately progresses to end-stage renal disease. The inflammatory interstitium is entirely replaced by fibrosis, and severe degeneration of tubular epithelial cells induces irreversible renal impairment necessitating early renal replacement therapy. Initially, glomeruli are usually spared, but later on, glomeruli are also involved. Damage of glomeruli provokes the hyperfiltration of proteins, glucose, blood cells, and other essential components of blood. The insufficiency of reabsorption from damaged renal tubular cells causes an excessive renal loss of body electrolytes. Also, there is an acid-base imbalance causing hypokalemic metabolic acidosis.

The involvement of proximal tubules, especially in TIN with uveitis, heightens the chances of glycosuria, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricosuria, proximal renal tubular acidosis, aminoaciduria, proximal renal tubular acidosis, and kaliuresis, which is described as Fanconi syndrome.

Some cases of TIN result from antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and transform to necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis when corticosteroid therapy is delayed.

Tubulointerstitial inflammation increases angiotensin II activity, which leads to arterial hypertension due to sodium retention and increases oxidative stress.
