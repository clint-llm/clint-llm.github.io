Exact etiology ofÂ MPNs is not known; however, patients with a genetic mutation (Janus kinase 2) are associated with a higher risk of developing MPNs. In addition, exposure to a higher level of ionizing radiation and toxins such as benzene has been associated with an increase in the risk for development of MPNs.
