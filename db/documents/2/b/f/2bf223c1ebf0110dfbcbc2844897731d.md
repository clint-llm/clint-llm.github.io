The typical location for a chance fracture is at the thoracolumbar region (T10-L2) in most adults; in children is may be located in the mid lumbar area.

The Chance fracture is an unstable flexion-distraction spinal injury with no rotation of the fracture fragments or lateral displacement, as explained by the three-column concept described by Francis Denis.

- Anterior column: anterior longitudinal ligament, anterior annulus, anterior two-thirds of the vertebral body

- Middle column: the posterior third of the vertebral body, posterior annulus, and posterior longitudinal ligament

- Posterior column: posterior elements and posterior ligamentous complex

An injury that involves at least two of the three columns is considered unstable. A Chance fracture involves at least two columns–a distraction-type injury of the middle and posterior columns–with or without an additional compression-type injury of the anterior column.

Chance fractures can be further subdivided into osseous injuries, ligamentous injuries, and osteoligamentous injuries. An osseous Chance injury includes fractures of the spinous process, pedicles, and the vertebral body. A ligamentous Chance injury can involve rupture of the interspinous ligament, posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamentum flavum, facet joint capsule, and intervertebral disc. An osteoligamentous injury includes elements of both osseous and ligamentous injuries.

Chance fractures are unlike other spinal injuries because of their high association of intra-abdominal injuries. The incidence of intra-abdominal injury can be as high as 50%. The most commonly associated intra-abdominal injuries are bowel perforations and mesenteric lacerations,
