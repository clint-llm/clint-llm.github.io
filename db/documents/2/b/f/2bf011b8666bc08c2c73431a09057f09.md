Condyloma acuminata are often diagnosed clinically following definitive history and thorough visual examination of the lesions. Additional testing can be done to aid in the diagnosis. A colposcope can be used to magnify the lesion for improved visualization. Confirmatory testing and gene typing are possible via DNA detection assays such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additionally, the acetic acid test can be used to evaluate the lesion further. In this test, five percent acetic acid gets applied to the lesion. Following the application, white areas of the lesion raise concern for dysplasia. The acetic acid test is not valid for screening as it has high false-positive rates. If the clinician is concerned about dysplasia, a biopsy of the lesion is the appropriate followup.

Physicians should have a concern regarding sexual abuse in children with condyloma acuminata. Although condyloma acuminata are considered to be sexually transmitted, there are other forms of transmission. The suspicion of sexual abuse should increase as the age of children increases. Physicians in the United States are required to report suspected sexual abuse. Clinicians should use their professional judgment when considering reporting sexual abuse.
