The vestibulocochlear nerve, also referred to as the eighth cranial nerve (CN XIII), is a sensory afferent nerve that transmits electrochemical impulses from the inner ear to the brainstem. It is composed of three separate nerves that run parallel to one another, the two vestibular nerves and the cochlear nerve. The superior and inferior vestibular nerves receive sensory input from the vestibular labyrinth, which is made up of the otolith organs and the semicircular canals and is responsible for balance and coordination of movements. The cochlear nerve receives sensory input from the cochlea, which is involved in hearing.
