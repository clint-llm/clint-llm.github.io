The venom of cottonmouth snakes contains enzymes that cause local tissue necrosis and potentially coagulopathy. The enzymes responsible for local tissue swelling and ecchymosis include metalloproteinases, hyaluronidase, and phospholipases A2. The venom of the A. piscivorous is cytotoxic and causes local tissue destruction. Like the other pit vipers, their venom contains phospholipase A2 (PLA2), an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids. Phospholipids are the primary component in the membranes that surround cells, and when broken down by PLA2, it causes tissue damage.

Additionally, metalloproteinases, among other venom constituents, contributes to hematologic and soft-tissue toxicity through a variety of actions. Hematologic effects include can both activate the coagulation cascade as well as have fibrinolytic, prothrombin activation and inhibit platelet aggregation.AgkistrodonÂ species.
