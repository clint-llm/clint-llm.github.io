CLABSIs are the most common complication of central venous catheter placement. CLABSIs are a source of significant morbidity and mortality and increased healthcare costs. Most of the equipment, preparation, and technique described above have been incorporated into bundled practices and checklists that have been shown to reduce the incidence of CLABSIs. In adults, the femoral site is avoided due to evidence demonstrating a higher risk of bloodstream infection than other sites. However, this has not been shown in children, and the femoral site is preferred in this population due to ease of access. Lastly, long-term central venous access, such as PICCs, has also been associated with a lower risk of bloodstream infections.
