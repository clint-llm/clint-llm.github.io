Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) incidence is rapidly increasing, especially in western countries. Rising obesity levels, increasing incidence of childhood obesity, sedentary lifestyles, consumption of unhealthy quick eats, and a longer lifespan are some of the likely contributors. The incidence and prevalence of NAFLD are underestimated as ultrasonography is commonly used to screen for fatty liver disease. The prevalence of NAFLD is 80% to 90% in obese adults, 30% to 50% in patients with diabetes mellitus, 90% or more in patients with hyperlipidemia, 3 to 10% in children, and as high as 40% to 70% among obese children.
