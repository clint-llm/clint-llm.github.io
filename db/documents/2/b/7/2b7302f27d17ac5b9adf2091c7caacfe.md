When it comes to monitoring, nursing staff should be able to teach pursed-lip breathing and explain to the trainee when this technique would be useful. The risk and benefits of the technique should be thoroughly explained with all questions and concerns addressed.

The nursing staff often spends the most time with patients of all health professionals. Nurses should be able to identify any patients that are in respiratory distress. With the knowledge of the common signs and symptoms of respiratory distress, nurses can effectively alert the appropriate response team and physicians to intervene before they deteriorate. Since the compensatory pursed-lip breathing is common to COPD patients, nursing should monitor COPD for the fatigue of respiratory muscles. Promptly alerting the physician can prevent patients from requiring mechanical ventilation.
