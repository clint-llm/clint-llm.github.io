While the indications for liver transplantation are becoming broader, the contraindications are getting less due to advancements in liver transplant techniques. Still, liver transplantation has some absolute and relative contraindications.

**Absolute Contraindications**

- MELD score of less than 15

- Advanced cardiac or pulmonary disease

- Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

- Active alcohol or illicit substance use

- HCC or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma with metastatic spread

- Untreated septic shock or sepsis

- An anatomic abnormality that precludes liver transplantation

- Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

- Extra-hepatic malignancy (outside the liver), unless the patient is tumor-free for more than two years with a low probability for recurrence.

- Hemangiosarcoma

- Fulminant hepatic failure leading to sustained intracranial pressure (ICP) above 50 mmHg or cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) less than 40 mmHg.

- Lack of psychosocial support and severe psychologic disease

- Severe pulmonary hypertension

Although AIDS is an absolute contraindication for liver transplantation, recent centers are selecting patients with HIV alone as candidates for liver transplantation.

**Relative Contraindications**

- General debility

- Persistent non-compliance

- Advanced age

- Extensive previous abdominal surgery

- Extensive portal or mesenteric thrombosis
