The etiologies for stridor differ depending on whether the patient is pediatric or adult. For pediatrics, the most common causes of acute stridor include croup and foreign body aspiration. However, there are many other causes. The cause of stridor can further be differentiated based on acuity and based on congenital versus noncongenital causes.

**Congenital Causes of Stridor in Pediatrics**

- Nasal deformities such as choanal atresia, choanal atresia, septum deformities, turbinate hypertrophy, vestibular atresia, or vestibular stenosis

- Craniofacial anomalies such as Pierre Robin or Apert syndromes or conditions causing macroglossia

- Laryngeal anomalies such as laryngomalacia, laryngeal webs, laryngeal cysts, laryngeal clefts, subglottic stenosis, vocal cord paralysis, tracheal stenosis, tracheomalacia

**Noncongenital Causes of Stridor in Pediatrics**

- Acute: Foreign body aspiration, airway burns, bacterial tracheitis, epiglottitis, anaphylaxis, croup.

- Subacute: Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess.

- Chronic: Vocal cord dysfunction, laryngeal spasm, neoplasm, multiple system atrophy

(See table below)

The most common cause of chronic stridor in infants is laryngomalacia.
