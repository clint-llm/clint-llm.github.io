Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common childhood and adolescent soft tissue sarcoma (3% of childhood tumors, 50% of pediatric soft tissue sarcomas) with slight male predominance (M/F, 1.3:1). RMS accounts for approximately 1% in adulthood tumors. Although rhabdomyosarcoma can arise anywhere in the body, there are distinct age and type involvement patterns. Children and young adolescents have more head and neck involvement which is usually of the embryonal type. Extremity rhabdomyosarcoma is more common in adolescents and usually the alveolar type. Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma occurs in hollow viscera, usually in children. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma typically arises in the extremities and mainly affects adults. Common rhabdomyosarcoma metastatic sites include lung, bone marrow, and lymph nodes
