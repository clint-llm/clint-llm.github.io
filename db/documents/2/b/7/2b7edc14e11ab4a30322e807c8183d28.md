**Absolute Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include patients with unrealistic expectations or body dysmorphic disorders, a pathological eye condition that needs treatment first e.g. acute blepharitis, active myasthenia gravis, undiagnosed dry eye syndrome, and thyroid orbitopathy. Moreover, uncontrolled glaucoma and only one seeing eye are absolute contraindications of lower blepharoplasty.

**Relative Contraindications**

Relative contraindications include a recent refractive procedure such as laser-assisted in situ keratomileuses (LASIK). Surgery should be delayed at least 6 months to allow time for the cornea to heal. Significant medical comorbidities such as heart failure or respiratory failure are another relative contraindication. However, surgery can still be done under local anesthesia. A high dose of anticoagulation and uncontrolled hypertension put the patient at a higher risk for retrobulbar hematoma and surgery should be postponed until medical optimization.
