Recent advances in early diagnosis and non-operative management of subphrenic abscess have decreased the incidence and improved the outcomes. A primary subphrenic abscess is defined as an abscess that developed in the intraabdominal space without the introduction of bacteria from the outside of that space. The actual frequency of primary subphrenic abscess is not known and is thought to be very rare. It constituted 13% in one case series.

Most subphrenic abscesses are caused by the introduction of bacteria into the subphrenic space. Among secondary subphrenic abscesses, gastric and biliary tree surgery constitutes 52% of abscesses. Appendicitis contributes toÂ 8%, while colonic surgery and trauma comprise 19% and 8%, respectively. Left-sided abscesses occur in 40%, and multiple space abscesses in 20% of patients.
