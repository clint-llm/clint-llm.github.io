Post-partum care providers must ensure they are addressing and validating any concerns a woman may have about her perineal trauma experienced during childbirth. A woman's physical and psychological health should be discussed. Severe perineal trauma can have long term effects on a woman's sexuality, overall wellbeing, and relationship with her partner.

Women who have suffered an OASIS injury in a previous pregnancy need to be counseled about the risk of recurrence of injury with subsequent pregnancies. Elective cesarean section can be discussed as an option, but the low risk of another OASIS injury should be carefully weighed against the risk of cesarean delivery.

The health care team should be prepared and willing to ask about and treat any complications a woman may have after childbirth. Some women feel embarrassed and ashamed about the problems they encounter and will not bring up concerns to their care providers.
