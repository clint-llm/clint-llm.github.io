Due to high prevalence and high rates of readmission compared to other chronic medical diseases, coronary heart disease in patients must receive treatment with significant interprofessional communication for not only symptomatic improvement but also mortality reduction.

Nitrates are the first-line medication for angina, one of the main symptoms of coronary heart disease. Multiple health care professionals such as general practitioners (GP), home care workers, pharmacists, and dieticians can work together to improve patientsâ€™ quality of life and prevent exacerbation of the disease.

Nursing can verify medication compliance at each visit and monitor for adverse events, reporting these to the prescribing clinician. Pharmacists should verify both dose and dose form prior to dispensing, and also alert the prescriber should there be any discrepancies. Pharmacists should also perform medication reconciliation and communicate any issues to the nurse or prescribing clinician.

Nitrate therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
