If there is clinical evidence of infection, treat with systemic antibiotics.

For surgically unfit patients or patients with inoperable metastatic disease (not a surgical candidate), the following are appropriate:

- Conservative management: Historically believed to not be an option due to high rates of urosepsis and mortality; however, recent analyses of the data have shown that there are minimal morbidity and mortality associated with nonoperative management

- Experimental treatments include endoscopic fibrin glue injection

Surgically fit patients should have operative repair of CVF (open or minimally invasive).

- Most patients should receive a single-stage operation (no increased risk in morbidity or mortality compared to staged operations)

- Patients who are at high risk for an anastomotic leak, for example, a contaminated field with feces or abscess, current steroid use, history of pelvic radiation, hemodynamic instability, should get a staged operation. First stage: Surgery is as above with either primary anastomosis and proximal diverting loop ileostomy or Hartmann's procedure (end colostomy). The second stage is the reversal of ostomy. In rare instances (not typically done) the Hartmann's is reversed and also protected with a diverting ileostomy, this will require a third stage operation to reverse the ileostomy.

All patients will require a bladder Foley catheter for a period of 7-10 days postoperatively

A purely diverting ostomy to divert the fecal stream from the CVF has fallen out of favor secondary to poor resolution rates, persistent urinary tract infections, and high recurrence rates.
