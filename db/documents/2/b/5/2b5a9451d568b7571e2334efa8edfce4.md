The management of an ectopic thyroid is with an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, ENT surgeon, pediatric surgeon, and a pediatrician. It is crucial to rule out the presence of other functioning thyroid tissue before considering surgical removal. For most patients, removal of the ectopic thyroid tissue has little morbidity, but if it is the only thyroid tissue, the patient will need life long thyroid hormone supplementation.
