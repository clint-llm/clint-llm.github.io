A morphine overdose can be potentially lethal due to the risk of respiratory depression. When administered via the epidural route, morphine can cause delayed respiratory depression up to 24 hours after a single injection. If suspected, immediately stop opioids or sedatives and administer intravenous naloxone to reverse the effects of morphine. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist, and its effective dose depends on the opioid doseÂ received. In the postoperative patient population, the starting dose of naloxone is 0.04 mg, with increments every 2 minutes if needed to a maximum of 15 mg.
