The causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) are often common conditions presenting atypically. The list of causes is extensive, and it is broken down into broader categories, such as infection, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, malignancies, and miscellaneous.

**Noninfectious Inflammatory Causes of FUO**

- Giant cell (temporal) arteritis

- Adult Still disease (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis)

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Periarteritis nodosa/microscopic polyangiitis (PAN/MPA)

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

- Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)

- Gout

- Pseudogout

- Behçet disease

- Sarcoidosis

- Felty syndrome

- Takayasu arteritis

- Kikuchi disease

- Periodic fever adenitis pharyngitis aphthous ulcer (PFAPA) syndrome

**Infectious Causes of FUO**

- Tuberculosis (TB)

- Q fever

- Brucellosis

- HIV infection

- Abdominopelvic abscesses

- Cat scratch disease (CSD)

- Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection

- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection

- Enteric (typhoid) fever

- Toxoplasmosis

- Extrapulmonary TB

- Organ-based infectious causes of FUO:

- Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE)
- Chronic sinusitis/mastoiditis
- Chronic prostatitis
- Discitis
- Vascular graft infections
- Whipple disease
- Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD)
- Cholecystitis
- Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)

- Tickborne infections:

- Babesiosis, Ehrlichiosis
- Anaplasmosis
- Tickborne relapsing fever (rodent-infested cabins)

- Regional infections:

- Histoplasmosis
- Coccidioidomycosis
- Leptospirosis
- Visceral leishmaniasis
- Rat-bite fever
- Louse-borne relapsing fever

**Malignant and Neoplastic Causes of FUO**

- Lymphoma

- Renal cell carcinoma

- Myeloproliferative disorder

- Acute myelogenous leukemia

- Multiple myeloma

- Breast/liver/pancreatic/colon cancer

- Atrial myxoma

- Metastases to brain/liver

- Malignant histiocytosis

**Miscellaneous Causes of FUO**

- Cirrhosis (due to portal endotoxins)

- Drug fever

- Thyroiditis

- Crohn disease

- Pulmonary emboli

- Hypothalamic syndrome

- Familial periodic fever syndromes

- Cyclic neutropenia

- Factitious fever

**Common Causes of Fever in the Different Subclasses**

- Classic FUO: The frequency of each category varies by both time and location, although, endocarditis, complicated urinary tract infections, abscesses, and tuberculosis (TB) are consistently reported in patients with classic FUO. In patients over the age of 65, connective tissue diseases are determined to be the cause of fever more frequently.

- Nosocomial FUO: Healthcare-associated fevers can be due to drug fever, complications post-operatively, venous thromboembolic disease, malignancy, transfusion-related reactions, or Clostridium difficile infection.

- Neutropenic FUO: Fevers are common in this subclass and are frequently due to infection.

- HIV-related FUO: Fevers can be present during acute illness, but are also common in the setting of untreated infection signifying additional infection with opportunistic organisms.
