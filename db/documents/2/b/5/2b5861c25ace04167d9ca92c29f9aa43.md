The pattern electroretinogram (PERG) is a non-invasive test with minimal risks. Patients may experience mild ocular discomfort during the procedure or, in very rare cases, develop a corneal abrasion depending on the type of electrode used. Other interfering factors are described below.

**Interfering Factors**

- Deviating from standardized testing conditions (i.e., lighting, flash intensity, recording environment, duration of light or dark adaptation, and pupil size)

- Electrode-based artifacts including poor contact with skin or cornea, incorrect placement, unstable position, and high electrical impedance

- Eye blinking or movement

- Defocus or uncorrected refractive error

- Reduced electrical response with aging

- Ocular media opacification

- Diurnal fluctuation

- Depressed response with anesthesia

- Variability in recordings between different device types.
