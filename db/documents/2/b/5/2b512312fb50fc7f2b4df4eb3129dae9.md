When eliciting a history from a patient who presents for altered mental status, it is important to obtain information both from the patient and from collateral sources (e.g., parents, children, friends, emergency management services, bystanders, the patient’s primary physician). This information can provide more insight regarding the chronicity of the change, precipitating factors, exacerbating or relieving factors, and recent as well as chronic medical history.

It is important to obtain detailed medication history, including over the counter and herbal supplements, to rule out drug interaction as a cause of altered mental status. Similarly, a history of illicit substance use (e.g., nicotine-containing products, alcohol, drugs such as heroin, marijuana, cocaine, club drugs like 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), including frequency of use, typical dose, and last use.

When performing a physical exam, start with a primary survey (assessing the patient’s airway, spontaneous respirations, pulses and heart rate, the level of consciousness). Make sure to expose the patient and check their back and extremities for signs of trauma (ecchymosis, deformities, lacerations) or infection (cellulitis, rashes). Then, perform a secondary survey, with careful attention to the pupillary and neurologic exam.

Consider using a diagnostic tool for evaluation of mental status, such as the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the Quick Confusion Scale, or the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)
