Photosensitivity is caused by an abnormal reaction to aÂ component of the electromagnetic spectrum of sunlight and a chromophore (reactive compound) within the skin. Patients can be sensitive to one kind of sunlight, for example only to ultraviolet radiation, ultraviolet A or B (UVA, UVB), or visible light, or to a wider range of radiation. The most common photosensitivity is to UVA. Mainly, exposure to visible light triggers porphyria.
