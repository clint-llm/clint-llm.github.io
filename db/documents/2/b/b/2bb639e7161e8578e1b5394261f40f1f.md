Elevated levels of chloramphenicol circulating in the plasma result from two distinct pathophysiologic processes. A normally functioning liver will metabolize the chloramphenicol parent molecule (primarily by glucuronidation). The immature neonatal liver is unable to synthesize and recycle the UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzyme efficiently. Similarly, the neonatal kidneys are unable to excrete chloramphenicol and its metabolites efficiently. These two deficiencies result in elevated serum levels of chloramphenicol. The chloramphenicol molecule displaces unconjugated bilirubin from albumin, leading to kernicterus and eventually death if untreated.
