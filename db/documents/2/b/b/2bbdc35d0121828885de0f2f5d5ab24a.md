Nonalcoholic, fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the ectopic accumulation of fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis) when no other causes of secondary liver fat accumulation are present. As minor deposition of fat can occur in healthy adults, deposition of fat in at least 5% of hepatocytes is considered pathologic. This activity will review the evaluation and management of NAFLD and the role of the health care team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of NAFLD.
- Outline the evaluation of NAFLD
- Explain the treatment and management options available for NAFLD
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of condition and improve outcomes.
