A punch biopsy is usually not indicated or necessary to make a diagnosis of keratosis pilaris. However, if a clinician chose to perform a punch biopsy of a lesion, histology would display the following features: marked follicular plugging of the hair follicle orifice, with hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the epidermis. Lymphocytic infiltrate of the dermis will also be present, and hypergranulosis may also present in this skin condition.
