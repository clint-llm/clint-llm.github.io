Penetrating keratoplasty indications include keratoconus, ectasias, corneas degenerations, dystrophies, keratitis, congenital opacities, chemical/mechanical corneal trauma, and re-grafts. The reported leading indications in a region are dependent on sociopolitical, geographical and economic factors and may not accurately reflect the most common aetiologies of corneal pathology.

Endothelial keratoplasty (EK) includes PLK, DLEK, DSEK, DSAEK, DMEK, and DMAEK. EK procedures are not appropriate for patients with healthy corneal endothelium such as keratoconus. EK indications include: Fuch’s endothelial dystrophy, posterior polymorphous dystrophy, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, bullous keratopathy, iridocorneal endothelial syndrome, and failed EKs.

Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) indications include those that relate to the pathology of the anterior cornea (epithelium, Bowman’s layer, and stroma), such as keratoconus and corneal scars.
