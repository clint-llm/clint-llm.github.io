The management of patients on anticoagulation and anti-aggregation therapy is a daily challenge for physicians. The interruption of therapy can increase the risk of thrombotic events during and after surgery. However, the non-interruption of these medications can heighten the risk of bleeding during surgery and trigger a sequence of undesirable outcomes ranging from minor to uncontrolled bleeding.

The optimal management of these patients is thus achieved through a balance between thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Several case-based considerations affect the decision of whether or not to interrupt anticoagulation or anti-aggregation therapy before surgery. These include an evaluation of an individual's underlying bleeding risk, the risk of bleeding associated with the surgical procedure, the timing of interruption and resumption of anticoagulation therapy, and whether to use bridging therapy. These are all typical questions that will be addressed in this review.
