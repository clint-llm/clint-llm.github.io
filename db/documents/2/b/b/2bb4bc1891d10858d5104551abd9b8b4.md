The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is immediately deep to the superior thyroid artery and descends on the larynx. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal pierces through the thyrohyoid membrane along with the superior laryngeal artery (a division of the superior thyroid artery). The course of the recurrent laryngeal nerves is interesting due to the lack of symmetry. On the left, the ipsilateral recurrent branches from the vagus nerve and is close to the aorta and wraps around it in an anterior to posterior fashion and ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove on its way to the larynx. On the right, the recurrent laryngeal nerve has a close relation to the right subclavian artery as it wraps around it in an anterior to posterior fashion and, like the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove to the ipsilateral larynx.
