The caloric test, first described by Robert Barany, assesses lateral vestibular canal function.

The slow water irrigation (flow rate of 350 +/- 30 ml per minute) of the ear (with an intact tympanic membrane) with water at 7 degrees above or below the body temperature for a period of 30 to 40 seconds induces convection current as well as thermal stimulation of the vestibular apparatus.

**Types of Caloric Testing**

- Bithermal caloric test (by water at 7 degrees above or below the body temperature or by air at 24 or 50 degrees Celsius)

- Monothermal caloric test

- Ice caloric test

**Assessment**

An interaural variability in the caloric paresis of more than 22 to 25% and the directional preponderance greater than 26 to 30% indicates an asymmetric response.
