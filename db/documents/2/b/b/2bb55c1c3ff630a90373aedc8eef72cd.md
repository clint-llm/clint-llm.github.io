One in 11000 people who travel by commercial air experienced an in-flight medical emergency. This equates to an emergency in 1 out of every 604 flights, 17% of those patients required hospital care upon landing.

When someone falls ill on a flight, crews are directed to ask for any health care professional to assist, and any who step forward are protected legally by the 1998 Aviation Medical Assistance Act (AMAA). Medically trained persons onboard should step forward, identifying themselves. The most experienced member should take charge, utilizing the CPR trained flight crew, and take initial steps to stabilize the patient using the on-board first aid kit, emergency medical bag, and automatic external defibrillator (AED) on board. If needed, ground-based physicians are reachable for a consult by the crew on radio frequencies. These actions also help the crew to determine if it is necessary to divert to an alternate airfield for an immediate landing.
