The successful treatment of PCFCL relies heavily on a team-oriented, patient-centered approach. Diagnosis of PCFCL depends on clinical and histopathologic correlation. The treatment approach will be formulated based on the extent of the disease and proper identification. As some cases of PCFCL can act more aggressively than others, healthcare workers need to provide a timely diagnosis.
