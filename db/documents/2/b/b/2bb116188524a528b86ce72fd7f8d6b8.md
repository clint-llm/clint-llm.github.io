Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory genetic disorder that mainly affects people of Mediterranean origin. FMF is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis (chest, abdomen, joints), leading to painful attacks early during childhood. Amyloidosis is the most fatal complication of FMF. Early initiation with colchicine leads to improvement in the attacks and prevent amyloidosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with FMF and highlights the role of the healthcare team in promptly diagnosing and treating patients affected with FMF.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of familial Mediterranean fever.
- Review the typical presentation of patients with familial Mediterranean fever.
- Describe the role of colchicine and other agents in the management of familial Mediterranean fever.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the healthcare team to promptly diagnose and treat familial Mediterranean fever to improve patient outcomes.
