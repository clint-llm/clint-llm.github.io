The management of conductive hearing loss due to ossicular chain disruption requires a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, audiologists, anesthesiologists, and speech therapists. Early diagnosis and treatment of conductive hearing loss are essential for long-term speech fluency and social function.

Patients with chronic ear disease, trauma, and resulting hearing loss should be referred by their primary care physicians to audiologists for hearing evaluation. If ossicular chain disruption is suspectedÂ from audiometry and imaging, a referral should be sent to an otolaryngologist. Postoperatively, patients should be followed by an otolaryngologist and an audiologist to monitor surgical outcomes and undergo postoperative audiometry to assess the improvement of hearing and long-term stability of hearing results. For children, speech therapy should continue even after surgical repair to enhance speech outcomes.
