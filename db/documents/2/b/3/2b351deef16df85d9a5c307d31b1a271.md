The Leopold maneuvers, named after the German obstetrician and gynecologist Christian Gerhard Leopold (1846â€“1911), are part of the physical examination of pregnant women.

Fetal presentation refers to the fetal anatomic part proceeding first into the pelvic inlet. When the fetal head is approaching the pelvic inlet, it is referred to as a cephalic presentation. The commonest presentation is the vertex of the fetal head. Malpositions are abnormal positions of the vertex of the fetal head, using the occiput as the reference point, relative to the maternal pelvis. Malpresentations are all presentations of the fetus other than vertex, which includes the breech presentation, transverse and oblique lie. Spontaneous vaginal delivery is most common when a cephalic-presenting fetus is in the occiput anterior position.

Malpresentation is estimated to occur in 5% of all deliveries and is an essential cause of the high cesarean delivery rate.

Accurate assessment of fetal presentation and position is crucial in guiding obstetric management. However, the accuracy of Leopold maneuvers varies depending on many factors, especially examiner experience. Therefore ultrasonographic examination remains the current gold standard investigation for ensuring the fetus is in the cephalic presentation during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is recommended for confirmation when any malpresentation is even slightly suspected.
