Hemineglect, which usually results from lesions in the temporoparietal junction, should be distinguished from Balint syndrome. In patients with hemineglect defective eye movements may mimic ocular apraxia, difficulty in performing hand movements may mimic optic ataxia, and deficits in perception can mimic simultagnosia.
