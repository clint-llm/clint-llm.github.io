There are multiple causes of epistaxis which can be divided into local, systemic, environmental, and medication-induced.

**Local causes:**

- Digital manipulation

- Deviated septum

- Trauma

- Chronic nasal cannula use

**Systemic causes:**

- Alcoholism

- Hypertension

- Vascular malformations

- Coagulopathies (von Willebrand disease, hemophilia)

**Environmental factors:**

- Allergies

- Environmental dryness ( more common in winter months)

**Medications:**

- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin)

- Anticoagulants (warfarin)

- Platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel)

- Topical nasal steroid sprays

- Supplement/alternative medications (vitamin E, ginkgo, ginseng)

- Illicit drugs (cocaine)

While epistaxis is a very common spontaneous problem, rarer etiologies such as neoplasms or vascular malformations must always be in the differential diagnosis, particularly if additional symptoms such as unilateral nasal obstruction, pain, or other cranial nerve deficits are noted.
