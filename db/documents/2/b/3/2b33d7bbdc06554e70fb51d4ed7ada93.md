Zafirlukast is an orally available drug (10 mg and 20 mg tablets and chewable tablets), which is FDA-approved for managing chronic asthma in adults and children five years and older. It is used off-label in managing chronic urticaria, preventing exercise-induced bronchospasm, and allergic rhinitis.

A recent study indicates that membrane ion channel TMEM16A is a potential drug target for treating adenocarcinoma of the lung. Zafirlukast can target the TMEM16A channel to inhibit the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that zafirlukast can significantly inhibit lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth in mice. The research identified zafirlukast as a novel TMEM16A channel inhibitor with remarkable anticancer activity. Zafirlukast is a promising drug candidate for future preclinical and clinical studies for patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung.
