In general, nerves derive from the ectodermal germ layer, which further divides into neuroectoderm and neural crest cells. The nerves from the central nervous system develop from the neuroectoderm, while the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest cells. Therefore, the trigeminal nerve and its branches, including the mental nerve, come from the neural crest cells.

The brachial apparatus gives rise to the trigeminal nerve in the face. These apparatus develop into the muscles, vessels, bone, and nerves in the face and neck. The brachial arch is made up mainly of mesoderm and neural crest cells. The first brachial arch develops into the mandibular nerve, which gives rise to the inferior alveolar nerve and consequently to the mental nerve.
