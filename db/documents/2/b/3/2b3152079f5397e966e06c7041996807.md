Metacarpal fractures typically occur secondary to a direct blow or fall directly onto the hand. These fractures commonly occur during athletic activities, particularly in contact sports. Almost one-fourth of cases occur during athletic events.

A direct blow over the dorsum often results in a transverse fracture, while axial and bending forces result in oblique and spiral fractures.
