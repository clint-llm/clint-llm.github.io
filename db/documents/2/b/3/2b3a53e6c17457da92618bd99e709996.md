The best method for confirming C. psittacosis infection is with serologic testing, namely micro-immunofluorescent antibody test (MIF). Cultures are highly discouraged due to being difficult, infectious to lab personnel, and only performed in specialized labs. MIF testing uses chlamydia-specific surface antigen. A test result with antibodies above 1:16 is considered evidence for exposure, while a 4-fold titer rise with clinical correlation is considered diagnostic. Complement fixation (CF) was the previously diagnostic test of choice, but it cannot differentiate between chlamydial species.

If obtained, laboratory testing may evidence a normal white blood cell count with a "left shift." Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may be elevated. If a systemic illness is present, the patient may evidence abnormal liver enzymes, hyponatremia, and elevated BUN/creatinine.

Chest radiographs most often show single lower lobar changes. Computed tomography has higher sensitivity and may reveal nodular pulmonary infiltrates with surrounding ground-glass opacities.
