Complications of hyperbaric therapy are rare and include pneumothorax, oxygen induced seizure and barotrauma. Any pneumothorax present due to overexpansion injury should be treated with tube thoracostomy prior to diving or to changing chamber depth, as expansion during ascentÂ is likely. Otic barotrauma can be avoided with education of a conscious diver. Unconscious or intubated divers can simply be dived (which will result in a hemotympanum) or a myringotomy can be performed prior to diving. In no case should the treatment be delayed to perform a myringotomy should a specialist need to be called in for the procedure. Hyperbaric physicians should be comfortable performing the procedure. Oxygen induced seizures that occur during treatment are not grounds to discontinue treatment. Seizures should be allowed to extinguish prior to any change in chamber depth to prevent additional injury during ascent.
