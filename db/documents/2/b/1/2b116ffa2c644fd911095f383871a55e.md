- Many DVTs will resolve with no complications.

- Post-thrombotic syndrome occurs in 43% of patients two years post-DVT (30% mild, 10% moderate, and severe 3%).

- The risk of recurrence of DVT is high (up to 25%).

- Death occurs in approximately 6% of DVT cases and 12% of pulmonary embolism cases within one month of diagnosis.

- Early mortality after venous thromboembolism is strongly associated with the presentation of pulmonary embolism, advanced age, cancer, and underlying cardiovascular disease.
