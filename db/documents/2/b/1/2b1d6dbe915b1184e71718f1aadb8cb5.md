Successful application of ergonomics can reduce the chance of illness and injuries, improve worker productivity, and increase satisfaction in the workplace. Conversely, it can often lead to increased work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) if applied incorrectly. WMSDs are disorders of the musculoskeletal system due to work environments and/or when a pre-existing musculoskeletal disorder worsens due to work conditions or risk factors inherent in the workplace. Examples of workplace risk factors include jobs requiring repetitious, forceful, or persistent use of the upper extremity, frequent lifting, pushing, pulling heavy objects, or maintaining prolonged uncomfortable postures for an extended period.
