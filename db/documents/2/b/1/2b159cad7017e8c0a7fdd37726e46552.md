It is of utmost importance to understand the multitude of roles that superoxide and its derivatives have in the human body. Among the most studied mechanisms is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the phagocytic cells to eliminate pathogens that invade the body. This process is mediated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by the production of superoxide, as well as subsequent production of hydrogen peroxide and other free radicals. Superoxide also plays a vital role in cell signaling and survival by activating membrane-bound receptors. It can also alter mitochondrial membrane permeability to promote apoptosis. Superoxides have also been demonstrated to be an underlying cause in the pathophysiology of many diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic inflammation, dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others. These pathological states have one thing in common; the intracellular and extracellular excess of superoxide and other radicals that can disrupt cellular homeostasis.
