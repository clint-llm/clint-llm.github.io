Routine genetic testing for arteriopathies is not recommended in the absence of suggestive history or physical examination. Patients must be referred to aÂ genetic counselor for formal assessment. Due to a higher incidence of extra coronary vascular abnormalities in patients presenting with SCAD and fibromuscular dysplasia, screening for aneurysms from the brain to pelvis should be considered.
