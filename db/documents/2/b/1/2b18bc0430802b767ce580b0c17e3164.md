The synucleins are proteins of concern due to their implication in synucleinopathies. Synucleinopathies include Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, and multiple system atrophy.

Alpha-synuclein has strong links to Parkinson disease. Research shows that alpha-synuclein accumulation results in impaired lysosomal autophagy. Additionally, mutations in alpha-synuclein lead to the generation of aberrant proteins, which causes further impairment in lysosomal proteolytic pathways and subsequent neuronal cell death.

Beta-synuclein is generally neuroprotective as it can inhibit alpha-synuclein aggregation, but in specific cases, it can be pathologic. Rare cases of dementia with Lewy bodies have been found with point mutations in beta-synuclein, leading to a neurotoxic effect.

Multiple system atrophy characteristically demonstrates autonomic failure, parkinsonism, and ataxia. It is a sporadic, adult-onset, progressive disorder. The pathologic hallmark presentation of multiple system atrophy is glial cytoplasmic inclusions of misfolded alpha-synuclein, found in oligodendrocytes. Multiple system atrophy predominantly affects the striatonigral and olivopontocerebellar structures. Multiple system atrophy has two main motor phenotypes, parkinsonian and cerebellar. Clinical differentiation from Parkinson disease is not possible and requires neuropathology for definitive diagnosis.

In the animal model, research has shown that the lack of gamma-synuclein in the central nervous system can decrease the ability to use information (memory) to manage and solve tasks and problems. Still, with the animal model, gamma-synuclein has been shown to recruit macrophages in the area of damage to the optic nerve and stimulate scar tissue production.

In both animal studies just mentioned, the elderly mice showed a reduction in the presence of this protein.
