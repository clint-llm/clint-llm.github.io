Although most patients recover from the disease, oneâ€™s recovery can be complicated by gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. In some cases, it is thought that pneumonitis and respiratory decompensation might result from aspiration during periods of acute encephalopathy from viral meningoencephalitis.

Adult survivors of St. Louis encephalitis may have a prolonged period of convalescence, usually with symptoms of asthenia, anxiety, irritability, emotional lability, depression, tremor, dizziness, attention deficits, memory deficits, and gait unsteadiness that can persist for months.

In pediatric patients, younger age tends to be associated with a higher incidence of neurologic sequelae, particularly in patients younger than ten years of age. These include convulsions, pyramidal signs, extrapyramidal signs, and intellectual disability.

There have also been case reports of post-infectious encephalomyelitis and subacute thyroiditis associated with SLEV infection.
