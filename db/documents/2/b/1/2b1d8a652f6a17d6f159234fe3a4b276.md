The vast majority of patients who experience cardiopulmonary arrest are known cases of coronary artery disease. Cardiopulmonary arrest in such patients can be prevented by reducing the progression of the disease by altering modifiable risk factors and regular medication. In addition, healthcare professionals should educate the patient about the advantages of a healthy diet, regular exercise, effective treatment of dyslipidemia, hypertension (HTN), diabetes (DM), and smoking cessation. Finally, it is the responsibility of healthcare professionals to be well versed with the basic principles and clinical skills needed for effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
