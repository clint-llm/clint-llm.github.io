Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are effective in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in improving the metabolic profile and potentially reducing the risk of long-term complications of hyperglycemia. They may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic drugs and insulin. They do not have correlations with any serious adverse effects. This makes them particularly useful for patients who have renal, cardiorespiratory, or liver problems, who are at a higher risk for developing lactic acidosis and, therefore, are not good candidates for metformin therapy. They also do not cause hypoglycemia, making them a useful substitute for sulfonylureas, which are associated with frequent occurrences of hypoglycemia. Patients should receive counsel to maintainÂ an appropriate diet as high levels of carbohydrates can worsen gastrointestinal side effects. If used in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, the patient should carry glucose with them for the quick reversal of hypoglycemia. Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus requires an interdisciplinary approach; the primary care provider, the pharmacist, and the nurse practitioner should educate the patients regarding side effects and instruct them to maintain an appropriately healthy diet.
