When a child is born with a truncated or deformed limb, practitioners should inquire about a family history of any possible inherited sources of limb deformity.Â They should also inquire about teratogenic exposures to drugs such as misoprostol or thalidomide, as these drugs have a known association with limb deformities.

Clinicians should perform a careful assessment for associated syndromes such as VACTERL anomalies or Fanconi anemia, which can have life-threatening consequences if left untreated. The anatomical variant will often help guide clinicians towards most likely associations, such as in the case of thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome.
