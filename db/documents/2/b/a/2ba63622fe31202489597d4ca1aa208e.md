As the name suggests, scientists believe that the nasopharynx derives from both the nasal cavity and the pharynx embryologically. Both the eustachian tube and its opening develop from the first pharyngeal arch. Therefore, posterior to the eustachian tube opening appears to be an embryological extension of the pharynx. Anterior to the eustachian tube opening is considered an extension of the nasal cavity via the primitive nasal sac. This theory has support from histological evidence that nasopharyngeal mucosa anterior to the eustachian tube opening resembles that of the nasal cavity (highly vascular and dense with lymphoid tissue) and posterior mucosa resembles that of the oropharynx (stratified squamous).

The nasopharyngeal area derives from the neural crests of the ectodermal leaflet.
