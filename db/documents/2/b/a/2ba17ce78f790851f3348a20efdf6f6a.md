Tibial fracture is the most common cause of compartment syndrome accounting for up to 12% of all compartment syndrome cases. Open tibial fractures are more likely to cause compartment syndrome (6%) than closed fractures (1.2%). In patients with tibial diaphyseal fractures, younger age is associated with an increased risk of developing compartment syndrome.

Traumatic compartment syndrome may be more common in men. The use of an intramedullary rod is not associated. The frequency of compartment syndrome is much higher in patients with associated vascular insults. One study suggested 19% of patients with vascular injuries required a fasciotomy.

The incidence of chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a relatively common cause of leg pain in athletes ranging from 27% to 33%. Risk factors include running athletes. Also, fasciaÂ defects occur in up to 40% of athletes compared to 5% in asymptomatic athletes. Symptoms are frequently bilateral. Males and females are affected equally.

Compartment syndrome in children without a fracture is rare and not well understood. The leg is also the most common location of compartment syndrome in children. In one study of 39 cases of compartment syndrome in kids, vascular was the most common etiology (28%), followed by trauma (26%), postoperative (21%), exertion (15%), and infection (10%).
