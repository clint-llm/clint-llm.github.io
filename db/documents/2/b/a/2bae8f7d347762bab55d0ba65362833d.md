The equipment necessary for spinal motion restriction requires a spine board (either long or short) and a cervical spine collar.

**Long Spine Boards**

Long spine boards were initially implemented, in conjunction with a cervical collar, to immobilize the spine as it was thought that improper handling in the field could cause or exacerbate spinal cord injuries. The long spine board was also cheap and served as a convenient method to transport unconscious patients, reduce unwanted movement, and cover uneven terrain.

**Short Spine Boards**

Short spine boards, also known as intermediate-stage extrication devices, are typically more narrow than their longer counterparts. Their shorter length allows for their use in closed or confined areas, most commonly in motor vehicle collisions. The short spine board supports the thoracic and cervical spine until the patient can be placed on a long spine board. A common type of short spine board is the Kendrick Extrication Device, which differs from the classic short spine board in that it is semi-rigid and extends laterally to encompass the flanks and head. Similar to long spine boards, these are also used in conjunction with cervical collars.

**Cervical Collars**

Cervical collars can be classified into two broad categories: soft or rigid. In trauma settings, rigid cervical collars are the immobilizer of choice as they provide superior cervical restriction.
