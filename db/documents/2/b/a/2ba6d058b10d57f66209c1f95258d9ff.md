Recent studies have found three signaling molecules necessary for correct patterning of the kidneys: Lim1, Pax2/8, and Odd1. Lim1 is essential for proper patterning the pronephric duct, mesonephric duct, and mesonephros. Pax2 has been found to be a potent initiator of nephron development, therefore is the only molecule capable of specifying renal tissue wherever it gets expressed in the intermediate mesoderm and ectopically. Hence, Pax2/8 mutant embryos fail to express Lim1 and show a complete absence of kidney development.

In addition to the Gdnf-RET pathway, Bone Morphogenic Protein 4 (Bmp4) and Gremlin regulate the development of the ureteric bud. Bmp4 released by the metanephric blastema suppresses ureteric bud development while stimulating ureteric stalk elongation. On the other hand, the ureteric bud secretes Gremlin, which inhibits Bmp4, thus ensuring it continues to develop. Therefore, these reciprocal interactions ensure that a single ureteric bud develops from each nephrogenic cord.
