Mycoplasma pneumonia is often encountered by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, emergency department physician, and internist. As such, it requires the efforts of an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists. Cross-disciplinary communication within this interprofessional arrangement will result in better patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Because there are no rapid tests to detect this organism, most patients are treated empirically. The pneumonia is benign, and most patients have an uneventful recovery. However, some patients may develop a parapneumonic effusion, otitis media, lung abscess, or empyema. These patients are best referred to as the appropriate specialty for further management. In immunocompromised and transplant patients, an infectious disease consult should be made.
