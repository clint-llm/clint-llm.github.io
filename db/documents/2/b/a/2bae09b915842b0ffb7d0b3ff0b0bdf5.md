Muscular hematomas are in simple terms defined by bleeding within a muscle group. These muscular hematomas may be traumatic or spontaneous. Traumatic muscle hematomas, while painful to the patient, are manageable with conservative rest and non-narcotic pain medication. Spontaneous muscle hematomas, in contrast, are mainly located in the abdominal waist area and have the potential to develop into life-threatening conditions.
