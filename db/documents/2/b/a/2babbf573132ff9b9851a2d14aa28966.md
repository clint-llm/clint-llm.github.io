The etiology of autoimmune hepatitis is unknown. The current proposition for pathogenesis is thought to be secondary to a failure of immune tolerance in a genetically susceptible individual leading to a T-cell mediated inflammation caused by various environmental triggers. Common triggers include infections, medications, and toxins. Certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes are more susceptible to the development of autoimmune hepatitis. Susceptible alleles are different in different ethnic groups. Among White North Americans and Northern Europeans, susceptible alleles are located on the short arm of chromosome 6, specifically within the region of DRB-1. Nitrofurantoin and minocycline are well-documented culprits of drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha drugs have been more recently linked to autoimmune hepatitis.
