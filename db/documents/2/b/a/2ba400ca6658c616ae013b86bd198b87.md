Establishing smooth bonding between the breastfeeding parent and the neonate is essential for successful breastfeeding.

Skin-to-skin contact in the first two hours after birth is important for initiating lactation. The breast crawl of the alert neonate that occurs soon after birth will initiate the bonding process. The breast crawl is when the neonate is placed on the birthing parent's abdomen after birth and finds its way to the breast to suckle.

Successful neonatal breastfeeding factors include proper latching and an alert neonate with intact rooting and suckling reflexes. Although lactation is a natural process, parental support and education for proper positioning and latching are often required.

Limiting factors like pain, anxiety, and emotional instability, among others, should be addressed before and after delivery. Lactation consultants or knowledgeable nurses can facilitate the successful initiation of breastfeeding.

Achieving a correct latch on the nipple is imperative. Incorrect latch resulting from poor neonate positioning or issues such as lip or tongue tie may result in cracked nipples or pain while breastfeeding.

Medication use needs to be monitored and addressed during breastfeeding. The need for a complete cessation of breastfeeding due to medication use is uncommon; adjusting the medication regimen to safe alternatives while breastfeeding may be necessary. Some studies show an increase in medication use while breastfeeding compared to pregnancy.
