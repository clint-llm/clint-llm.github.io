Frontal lobe syndrome due to neurodegenerative disorders is usually caused by 2 main histopathologies: alpha-synuclein and tau protein. Tauopathies that impair the frontal lobes include frontotemporal dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and advanced Alzheimer's disease. If tau is hyperphosphorylated, the protein dissociates from microtubules and creates aggregates that are insoluble.
