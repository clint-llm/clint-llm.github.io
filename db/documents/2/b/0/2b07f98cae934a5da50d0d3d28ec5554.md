To conclude, ectopia lentis is a rate familial or acquired displacement of crystalline lens from the patellar fossa. The subluxated or dislocated lens can be seen in the anterior chamber or posterior vitreous cavity. The patient can present with defective vision, loss of accommodation, monocular diplopia, pain, and redness. A detailed anterior segment, posterior segment, and systemic evaluation are necessary in each case. The management depends on the age of onset, visual acuity, the extent of subluxation or dislocation of the lens, and the presence of associated ocular and systemic complications. All patients should undergo a familial screening of ectopia lentis to rule out syndromic associations.
