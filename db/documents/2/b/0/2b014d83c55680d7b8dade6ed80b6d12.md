Surgeons became aware that they would never correct or cure heart conditions unless they could stop the blood circulation through the heart, open it, and operate in a bloodless field under direct vision.

Two concepts were utilized to develop the first two open-heart surgery techniques, namely 'inflow obstruction' by John Lewis & Mansur Taufic in 1953 and the 'controlled cross circulation' technique by Walton Lillehei in 1954.
