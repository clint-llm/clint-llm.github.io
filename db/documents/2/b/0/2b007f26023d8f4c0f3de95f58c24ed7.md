The term stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) often is used synonymously with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) and encompasses a variety of conditions that result in a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. This most frequently occurs with long-standing atherosclerotic obstruction within the epicardial coronary arteries, resulting in poor flow and distal ischemia. However, mismatched myocardial oxygen supply and demand leading to episodic ischemia can occur with a variety of pathophysiologic processes such as coronary artery vasospasm, microcirculation dysfunctions, or congenital anomalies. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of chronic ischemic heart disease and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of chronic ischemic heart disease.
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for chronic ischemic heart disease.
- Explain the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by chronic ischemic heart disease.
