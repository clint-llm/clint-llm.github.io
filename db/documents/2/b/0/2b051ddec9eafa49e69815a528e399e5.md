Donepezil hydrochloride is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor most commonly used for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Donepezil is FDA approved for use in mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer disease. No evidence exists that donepezil alters the progression of the disease. It can, however, ameliorate some symptoms by improving cognition and/or behavior. It also has other off-label indications. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of donepezil, pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer dementia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for donepezil.
- Review the therapeutic mechanism of action of donepezil.
- Summarize the adverse effects and potential drug interactions of donepezil.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diabetes management and improve outcomes when using donepezil therapy.
