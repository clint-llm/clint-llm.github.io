Because PTRA confers an increased risk for complications, its use is in selective cases. Approximately 1% to 3% of coronary lesions that are crossable with a guidewire are not crossable with the balloon catheters or are un-dilatable with pressures even more than 20 atm. PTRA can be used successfully for such lesions, leading to improved compliance. This approach allows for a proper balloon dilatation and successful stent placement. PTRA is also indicated for small calcified lesions to alter the compliance of the vessel to allow balloon angioplasty.

Orbital atherectomy is also recommended for severely calcified coronary lesions, defined as severe calcification seen during fluoroscopy involving both sides of the arterial wall for at least 15 mm or the presence of at least a 270-degree arc of calcium detected on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In addition to OA, ELCA has shown improved outcomes for long, moderately calcified and ostial lesions, saphenous vein graft lesions, and total occlusions.

Bifurcating lesions are especially challenging for the conventional balloon angioplasty due to plaque shift and high rates of restenosis. CBA, when used for such interventions, confer lower rates of restenosis than PTCA (40% vs. 67%).
