- General inflammatory and autoimmune syndromes. Examples include systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, and Sjogren syndrome.

- Infectious etiologies such as Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, and herpes viruses

- Vascular etiologies such as migraine headaches, small vessel ischemia, vascular malformations and emboli

- Metabolic causes that include vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disease

- Uncommon genetic etiologies that include mitochondrial cytopathy, Fabry disease, Alexander disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia

- Neoplastic causes that include primary CNS malignancies or metastasis
