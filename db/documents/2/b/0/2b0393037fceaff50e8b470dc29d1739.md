Glenohumeral instability is a common and perplexing clinical issue. Dependent on the mechanism of injury, patient age, and clinical symptoms, these factors can determine what imaging modality is appropriate for a patient to undergo. One such imaging modality is shoulder arthrography. This activity describes the examination and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients who undergo glenohumeral arthrography.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the glenohumeral joint.
- Summarize the technique for performing a shoulder arthrogram.
- Outline both indications and contraindications for a shoulder arthrogram.
- Explain normal and abnormal findings on a glenohumeral arthrogram.
