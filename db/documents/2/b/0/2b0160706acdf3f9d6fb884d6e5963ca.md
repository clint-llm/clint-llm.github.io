CNS-TB can be lethal or cause devastating complications. The initial complications are a result of pachymeningitis leading to hydrocephalus and multiple cranial nerve palsies, including deafness, opticochiasmatic arachnoiditis resulting in visual loss, focal neurological deficits, stroke, and hemiplegia due to arteritis, cerebral edema, and seizures due to intracranial tuberculoma/tuberculous abscesses and diabetes insipidus or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Myelitis complicates TBM in 10% of cases and is an independentÂ predictor of poor outcomes.

From 10 to 30% of patients with TBM are left with long-term residual neurologic deficits.
