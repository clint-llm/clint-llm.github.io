In a small percentage of the population (approximately 2.9%), the subcostal muscle runs in front and contacts the QL, in particular with its terminal portion. The subcostal muscle is activated electrically during expiration, leading to the supposition that the QL could influence forced expiration, but further study is warranted.

Quadratus lumborum is a continuation of transverse abdominal muscle. The latter is part of the anterior fascial system of the body (from the deep anterior fascia of the neck, the endothoracic fascia, to the transversalis fascia up to the pubis). The transversalis fascia penetrates the abdominal musculature. We can assume that an abnormal tension of these muscles (globular abdomen) can negatively influence the resting tension of the QL, altering the distribution of the lumbar area loads.
