Very few clinical trials have been performed in regard to the medical management of pulmonary, endocrine tumors because of its rarity.  However, there are ongoing randomized control trials such as Alliance A021602: CABINET. This trial is currently comparing the effects of cabozantinib vs. placebo for those patients with well-differentiated bronchial carcinoids. Other ongoing trials include an open-label phase II trial that is currently assessing the use of ipilimumab and nivolumab in advanced disease. The data from these studies are still being collected with anticipated results available in the near future. Ongoing studies such as these may highlight a much larger role of medical management as compared to surgical resection.
