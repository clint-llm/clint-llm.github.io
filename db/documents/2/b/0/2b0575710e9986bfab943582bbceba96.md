Homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD)  expresses in various tissues in the body such as the kidney, liver, small intestine. HGD plays an important role in the tyrosine pathway by converting homogentisic acid (HGA) to maleylacetoacetate. HGD is a 445 amino based protein mapped to chromosome 3q13.33. Mutation in the HGD gene leads to a deficiency of the HGD enzyme resulting in the accumulation of homogentisic acid (HGA).

These mutations occur in specific parts of the exons. The normal HGD has a six subunit called a hexamer arranged in two trimers, each containing an iron atom. Various mutations may affect the function, structure, or solubility of HGD.  Rarely, this genetic disorder can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; other defects in other genes probably are responsible in these cases.
