The bones of the orbit protect the globe of the eye as well as other periocular contents. A fracture to the orbit can involve the contents of the orbit and potentially compress nerves or muscles within the orbit.

When swelling occurs within the orbit, it can cause potential damage to the orbital contents. Intraconal lesions can cause damage to the optic nerve and associated vessels, the central retinal artery, and central retinal vein.

The abducens nerve is commonly affected when the intracranial pressure increases because its course bends sharply on the petrous part of the temporal bone.
