Phosgene is primarily an occupational exposure. Phosgene badges are used by workers in phosgene industries and may be the only indicator of exposure. Therefore the patient care team should inquire about one. Those exposed to phosgene should wear badges as close to the zone of inhalation as possible. They should only be used as estimates as they cannot reflect actual inhaled concentration. Thus, clinical judgment is paramount.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has measured air samples in California and identified concentrations not exceeding 31.8 parts per trillion (ppt) in the Los Angeles basin. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have recommended exposure limits no greater than 0.1 ppm. This is particularly useful in settings where phosgene badges are utilized.
