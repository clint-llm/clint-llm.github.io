Postherpetic neuralgia is almost universally diagnosed based on history and physical. However, laboratory tests and some targeted imaging may provide a degree of utility. They are of greater value in atypical presentations of PHN, such as zoster sine herpete or herpes zoster of the larynx. Serological testing for VZV IgG and IgM titers is available, although the sensitivity and specificity are less than ideal. A four-fold rise has been used to diagnose subclinical HZ (zoster sine herpete). However, this rising titer may or may not be secondary to viral exposure or reactivation. Comparatively, immunofluorescence of vesicle scrapings detects VZV antigens in a highly specific and sensitive manner. Similarly, PCR is exquisitely sensitive for the detection of VZV DNA.

Results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis are abnormal in 61% of patients. Pleocytosis, elevated protein, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) DNA are usually seen. Viral culture or immunofluorescent staining helps distinguish herpes simplex from herpes zoster.

Small-scale studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may hold promise for diagnosing challenging PHN cases and differentiating between PHN and HZ. A study by Haanpaa et al. reported that MRI revealed lesions attributable to HZ in the cervical cord and the brain stem in 9 patients (56%). At three months after the onset of HZ, PHN developed in 5 patients (56%) who had an abnormal MRI. On MRI, seven patients with no HZ lesions did not develop residual pain.
