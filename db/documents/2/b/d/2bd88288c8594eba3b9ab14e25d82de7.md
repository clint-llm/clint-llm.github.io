In the emergency department, there are several tools to help reveal the diagnosis and extent of the injury. An elevated white blood cell count is expected a few hours after the injury but can be useful in tracking the progression of the inflammatory phase or any secondary infection. Plain radiographs will clearly define the extent of penetration if the substance injected is radiopaque. Radiolucent material will not be visible on plain radiographs but may appear as subcutaneous emphysema. CT and MRI can be helpful with an assessment of soft tissue damage but are usually not necessary.
