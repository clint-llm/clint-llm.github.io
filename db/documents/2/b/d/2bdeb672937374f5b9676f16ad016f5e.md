Bimalleolar ankle fracture is considered an unstable fracture, and the orthopedic team should be responsible for its management. The patient may first present to a family clinician or the ED. Managing this fracture requires open communication with the orthopedic surgeon to enhance and improve patient outcomes. Nurses canÂ help with patient evaluation, assist during surgery and provide post-procedural patient care and counsel. Pharmacists can verify pain control mediation and antithrombotic therapy if needed. The physiotherapist's essential role is to help the patient physical health, muscle strength, and weight-bearing abilities after the surgery. The emergency team should perform emergency fracture reduction. After the surgery, all interprofessional team members should follow up with the patient to ensure a full recovery. This team includes:

- Orthopedic team

- Physiotherapy team

At home, the patient must be given thromboprophylaxis prescriptions and equipment like (walker boots, crutches, canes, etc.), and ensure that there is someone at home to help the patient till complete recovery. The interprofessional team model will drive optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
