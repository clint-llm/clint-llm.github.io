Motion sickness is a common condition that practitioners should be prepared to evaluate and treat.  Prevention of symptoms is more effective than treatment; therefore the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should provide education and emphasize behavioral countermeasures to minimize sensory conflict.  When indicated, many pharmacologic options are available, and healthcare workers should carefully weigh the risk: benefit ratio to minimize adverse effects.  Clinicians must also be aware of the “red flag” signs of vestibular and neurologic pathology, as symptoms may be confused with motion sickness.

Aerospace programs, aiming to treat symptoms in astronauts without compromising alertness and cognitive function, have led the future of motion sickness treatment.  Intranasal scopolamine offers promise for future use but it not yet available commercially.
