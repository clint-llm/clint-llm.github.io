Percutaneous pins can usually be removed at the 3 to 4-week point post-operatively. Children can then be allowed to commence mobilization. Children may experience some stiffness immediately following the removal of immobilization; however, this has been shown to improve rapidly in the first month after surgery. Older children regain their range of motion more slowly compared to younger children.
