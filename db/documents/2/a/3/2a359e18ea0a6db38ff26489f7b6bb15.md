An appropriate reporting pattern with a clear representation of sonography findings without vague terms and a clear description of pathology avoids unnecessary secondary and alternative imaging of pathology and enhances the healthcare outcomes of the sonography reporting team. Clear communication between the reporting team and treating clinician helps in the most accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up plan for the patient.

We discuss here and recommend reporting patterns by eminent sonography bodies in obstetrics and gynecology. Uterine pathologies like leiomyoma and adenomyosis are the most common benign pelvic pathologies. With the trending lifestyle and improved health care facilities, there is a special place for conservative management of such lesions in the case of young and infertile patients.

With precise sonographic evaluation and reporting of these lesions, mode of surgery, type of surgery - conservative or radical and fertility treatments, proper selection of cases for minimally invasive techniques like uterine artery embolization, laparoscopic morcellation, and fibroid ablation is possible. Hence, a meticulous reporting pattern has been suggested by the morphological uterine sonographic assessment (MUSA) group. The terms and definitions formed and recommended in reporting are aimed to have homogeneity for clinical research, to predict the risk of various uterine pathologies, and to determine the precise line of treatment in various clinical scenarios.

As per its recommendation, the uterine myometrium is reported to mention the dimensions of uterine corpus and cervix, serosal contour - lobulated or regular, myometrial walls- symmetrical or asymmetrical, and echogenicity- homogeneous or heterogeneous. The junctional zone is described as regular, irregular, or interrupted, and presence of cystic areas, hyperechogenic dots, hyperechogenic buds, and lines. The myometrium should be assessed for echogenicity - homogeneous or heterogeneous. Any pathological lesion may be detailed for its echotexture, ill-defined, or well-defined site and size.

FIGO classification for myoma localization is the preferred way to report the position of the myoma to the uterus. It could be 0: pedunculated and intracavitary; 1: submucosal and < 50% intramural; 2: submucosal and ≥ 50% intramural; 3: 100% intramural, but in contact with the endometrium; 4: intramural; 5: subserosal and ≥ 50% intramural; 6: subserosal and < 50% intramural; 7: subserosal and pedunculated; 8: other (e.g.parasitic, cervical).

The presence of myometrial cysts with acoustic shadowing and internal shadowing, hyperechogenic islands, and echogenic spots should be mentioned. Vascularity of the uterus should be assessed with Doppler and reported with associated pathology.

A few of the minor reporting glitches with ambiguous and vague description patterns in reporting pelvic sonography should be abandoned. Follicles are anechoic structures in the ovary varying in size throughout the menstrual cycle. Reporting normal follicles less than 25 mm as cysts may be misunderstood as an abnormal finding of cystic mass, or highlighting it as multiple may confuse it with polycystic ovaries. Similarly, the corpus luteum, referred to as a cyst, is misunderstood as an abnormal finding. In all these cases, which are normal cyclical menstrual changes in the ovary, reporting it as cysts should be deferred, and terms like 'normal ovary with dominant follicle' or 'normal ovary with multiple small follicles' or 'normal ovary with corpus luteum' should be preferred.

Since most benign ovarian lesions have distinct, defined sonographic features which funnel down the diagnostic dilemma, a more specific sonographic description should be given beyond the sonographic term like 'ovarian neoplasm' or 'complex ovarian or adnexal mass.' As complex mass hints at a solid component present in mass, the terminology 'complex adnexal mass' may create a diagnostic dilemma for the treating physician and dilute the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Hence, more detailed evaluation and reporting in terms of solid component, multilocularity, echotexture, vascularity, presence of papillary projections, regularity of mass, and ascites should be reported to give a clear picture to the treating physician, which helps in triaging the patient properly and avoids unnecessary alternative imaging.

It is advisable to provide animated or schematic diagrams of possible pathological diagnoses rather than just sonography images. This helps the treating clinician with the spatial orientation of the pathology. The sonographer should provide the orientation of adjacent vital structures like vessels and ureters when the anatomical relation of the structures deviates from normal, which will help surgeons to avoid inadvertent injury to these structures. With the recent advent of volumetric ultrasound imaging, volume contrast imaging (VCI) modes, 3D printers, and tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI)- a post-processing modality that enables localization of multiple fibroids and determining the tumor spread. A picture is worth a thousand words.
