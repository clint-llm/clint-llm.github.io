**Mechanism of Action**

The mechanism of action of GABA receptor antagonists depends on the drug itself. Bicuculline is a competitive antagonist at GABA-A receptors; it binds to GABA-A receptors and thus inhibits the binding of GABA.Â Picrotoxinin, the active component of picrotoxin, acts as a non-competitive antagonist at GABA-A receptors, binding to GABA ionophores.

Flumazenil acts as a specific benzodiazepine antagonist at GABA-A receptors. However, research has shown that flumazenil also has partial positive allosteric modulatory activity at GABA-A receptors containing the alpha-6 subunit.
