Patients with eczema herpeticum should be counseled that they are infectious until all lesions have crusted over and thus avoid close contact with others until then. Encourage patients to avoid scratching and wash hands frequently due to the risk of autoinoculation. Patients diagnosed with mild EH and treated as outpatients should be cautioned to seek emergency care if they develop systemic symptoms or worsening rash, as they may require hospitalization, intravenous acyclovir treatment, or antibiotic coverage.
