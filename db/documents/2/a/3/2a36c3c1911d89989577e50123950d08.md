The primary blood supply to the hand is through the radial and ulnar arteries. The ulnar artery gives rise to the superficial palmar arch and gives off a deep branch to anastomose with the deep arch. The radial artery gives rise to the deep arch and gives off a superficial branch to anastomose with the superficial arch. This creates an extensive collateral network to prevent ischemia injury. Blood supply to the thumb MP joint may be directly the superficial arch or via a deep branch of the radial artery; the princeps pollicis artery.

The axillary lymph nodes provide lymphatic drainage of the upper limb. The lymphatic system of the upper extremity uses a pathway that originates in the distal fingers tips and palms. The lymphatic system travels on the dorsal aspect of the hand. The lymphatic vessels are typically found just posterior to the cutaneous veins. The lymph drainage continues proximally up the arm, running with the basilic vein until connecting to the lymph nodes in the lateral axillary region.
