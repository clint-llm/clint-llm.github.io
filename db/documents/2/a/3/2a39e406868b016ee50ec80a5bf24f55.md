Decompression illness (DCI) is the entire subset of decompression-related maladies experienced by man and includes two main categories: (1) decompression sickness (DCS), which is a constellation of maladies that result from bubble formation due to dissolved gas and (2) overexpansion injuries, including arterial gas embolism (AGE), which result from gas of any kind expanding directly due to the effect of Boyle’s Law as ambient pressure is reduced. Diving injuries of any kind are rare, with the current incidence of diving maladies overall varying from 1 to 3/10,000 dives. Most evidence indicates that the incidence of arterial gas embolism is at least an order of magnitude less common, implying an incidence of less than 1/100,000 dives. Iatrogenic gas embolism occurs when there is an introduction of gas into the arterial system as the result of a medical procedure.
