Early symptoms include floaters, blurred vision, and decreased vision. Later symptoms in the course of the disease include nyctalopia, diminished contrast sensitivity, and decreased color vision. Fundus examination reveals vitreous inflammation associated multiple yellow-white choroiditis spots that are often initially observed inferior to the optic nerve head. These lesions are usually 500 to 1500 micrometers in diameter. The typical "birdshot" appearance and distributions of lesions gives the disease its name. As the disease progresses, the lesions become more confluent and linear around the veins, eventually becoming more atrophic in appearance.
