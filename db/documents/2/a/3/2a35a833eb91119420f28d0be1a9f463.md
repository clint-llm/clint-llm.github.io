Pregnant women offered or undergoing IOL should be managed by a coordinated interprofessional team involving the obstetric provider, specialty-trained obstetric nurse, midwives, anesthetic staff, and a neonatology team. Ultimately, whenever there is a change in the pregnant woman's or the fetal status, a collaborative effort between all healthcare team members must be made to ensure the pregnant woman'sÂ and her fetus(s). The nurses and the midwives play a very crucial role during the process of IOL.

Clear communication among the interprofessional team members is vital for achieving the best standard of care that needs to be delivered to pregnant women undergoing IOL and their families. Witten patient information leaflets should be given to pregnant women offered IOL. They should be easy to understand, and women can also be referred to online resources to help them make informed decisions about their pregnancies.
