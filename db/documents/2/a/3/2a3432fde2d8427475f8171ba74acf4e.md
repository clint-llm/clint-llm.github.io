Ivabradine blocks the channel responsible for the cardiac pacemaker current, I(f), which regulates heart rate. This results in prolonged diastolic time and reduced heart rate.

Rapid resting heart rate can lead to detrimental effects on left ventricular function and has been associated with negative outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. Therefore, reducing resting heart rate to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is a therapeutic target among drug manufacturers. Ivabradine reduces heart rate but does not affect myocardial contraction, relaxation, or ventricular repolarization.
