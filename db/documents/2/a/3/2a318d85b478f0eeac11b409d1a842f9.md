The term polypharmacy was used over one and a half centuries ago to refer to issues related to multiple-drug consumption and excessive use of drugs. Since then, it has evolved with different meanings and situations, including but not limited to "unnecessary drug use" and "medication use without indication." Based on the review of current data, the use of 5 or more medications is an acceptable definition of polypharmacy. This cut-off point of 5 drugs is associated with the risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, frailty, disability, and mortality in older adults.

The World Health Organization suggests that while the definition is numerical, emphasis should be on evidence-based practice and the goal of reducing inappropriate polypharmacy. The United States has one of the world's highest medication usage rates per capita. Management of polypharmacy is a challenge for all health care providers. Hence, this article will review strategies to reduce polypharmacy and skills to improve medication use management.
