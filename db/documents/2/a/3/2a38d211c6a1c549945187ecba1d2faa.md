Patients with Neurotrophic keratitis rarely complain of symptoms, probably due to their lack of corneal sensation. Occasionally, however, they may present with redness and blurring of vision. The blurring of vision can occur due to persistent epithelial defects, corneal edema, or scarring. Antecedent episodes of redness and eye pain or the presence of cutaneous blistering or scarring suggest previous herpetic infections. A history of corneal trauma, surgery, chemical burns, long-term use of topical medications, neurosurgical procedures, or diabetes may be obtained.

The hallmark of this disease is reduced or absent corneal sensation. Neurotrophic keratitis can be classified into three stages according to the Mackie classification. This staging is based on the severity of corneal damage, increasing from stage 1 to stage 3.

- Stage 1 is characterized by corneal epithelial changes with dry and cloudy corneal epithelium, the presence of superficial punctate keratopathy, and corneal edema.

- Stage 2 is characterized by recurrent and/or persistent epithelial defects with an oval or circular shape, most frequently localized at the superior half of the cornea.

- Stage 3 is characterized by corneal ulcer with stromal involvement that may be complicated by stromal melting and progression to corneal perforation.

In summary, staging of neurotrophic keratitis is characterized by epithelial changes (stage 1), persistent epithelial defects (stage 2), and corneal ulcer (stage 3).
