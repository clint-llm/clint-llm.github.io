A significant number of patients will be identified via lung cancer screening programs. These programs are a valuable tool for identifying and monitoring patients at high risk for lung cancer to diagnose it at a stage that remains amenable to curative therapy. The US preventive services task force (USPSTF) currently recommends annual screening with low-dose CT in adults aged 55 to 80 that have a cumulative 30-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. This topic is currently under discussion, considering decreasing the smoking history to 20-pack-years and starting the age of screening at 50.

All patients with suspected or biopsy-proven lung cancer should undergo appropriate staging workup. Standard assessments include CT chest and abdomen with contrast, smoking cessation counseling, pulmonary function testing, bronchoscopy (may be performed intraoperatively), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography PET-CT scan, and consideration of lymph node evaluation.

Once the decision has been made to proceed with lung resection, all patients need to undergo respiratory testing to determine their ability to tolerate the procedure. The mainstay is pulmonary function testing, V/Q scan, and cardiac stress testing, as indicated.
