Microalbuminuria arises when GBM, a complex sieve, leaks an increased amount of albumin. The proposed mechanism is a combination of glomerular size enlargement, GBM thickening, mesangial expansion, and podocyte foot process effacement. Microalbuminuria can also occur via inadequate tubular reabsorption.

Dysregulated enzymatic metabolism of the extracellular matrix is the pathogenesis behind developing endothelial damage.
