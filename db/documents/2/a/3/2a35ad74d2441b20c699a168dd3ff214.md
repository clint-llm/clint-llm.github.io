Due to the larger size and more complex design than the single lumen tube (SLT), intubation with a DLT can be a challenge, even in a patient with a normal airway. Use of a DLT is therefore relatively contraindicated in a patient with

- A difficult airway

- A preexisting trachea or stoma

- A tracheal constriction

- Limited mouth opening

Distorted airway anatomy due to tortuosity or lesion extending into the airway is a contraindication to placement of DLT.  In certain instances, such as where conversion to an SLT may be needed at any time during surgery or the need to re-intubate for postoperative mechanical ventilation is warranted, it is advisable to choose an SLT with a bronchial blocker for lung isolation. The need to re-intubate with an SLT may be risky due to the presence of airway edema.

DLTs specially designed for patients with a tracheostomy (double-lumen tracheostomy tube set) are commercially available. They have the same design as conventional DLTs but are shorter and curved between the intratracheal and extra tracheal parts.
