Cogan syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that presents with audiovestibular symptoms and non-syphilitic interstitial keratitis. The beneficial response to corticosteroids supports autoimmune pathogenesis. However, the treatment is sometimes difficult as failure to treat hearing loss may cause deafness. Permanent hearing loss usually occurs due to recurrent flares.

The first line of treatment is corticosteroids. Additionally, multiple immunosuppressive drugs have been used.

The patients and caregivers should be explained the prognosis, management, and outcome to ensure compliance and the best possible outcome.
