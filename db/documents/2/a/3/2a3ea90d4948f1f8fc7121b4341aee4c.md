Multiple complications can result from chronic suppurative otitis media such as polyps, osteitis, sclerosis, tympanosclerosis, labyrinthitis, and intracranial suppurative complications such as epidural, subdural, or brain abscesses. The most common complication is hearing loss, either conductive or sensorineural. Hearing loss is associated with language delays and behavioral problems.
