Mediastinal seminomas are a relatively rare malignant disorder that is best treated by an interprofessional team. These tumors are usually curable with aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. Surgical intervention is used in some cases when the tumor is small and localized. However, in either case, recurrence may take place, and repetition of these treatment modalities or a combination of them may need to be utilized. In order for any of these steps to occur, a team of various medical personnel is required including physicians, surgeons, pharmacists, nurses, lab, and surgical technicians. All of these people must maintain effective and efficient communication with each other to give the patient the best outcome possible. Overall, the younger the patient, the better prognosis they can have based on their ability to handle more aggressive treatment.
