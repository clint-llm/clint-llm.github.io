The pulmonary system is typically excellent at removing excess CO2 from the body. Most causes of hypercapnia are due to the failure of the pulmonary system to ventilate properly removing CO2.

BiPAP, CPAP, and intubation with mechanical ventilation are supportive measures that aim to optimize oxygenation while removing CO2 from the body, but the treatment of hypercapnia should focus on identifying the inducing etiology and target therapy towards it. Often, there is more than one insulting disease present.
