Many healthcare professionals prescribe inhaled corticosteroids, including the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pulmonologist, ENT surgeon, allergist, and emergency department physician. It is essential to know the adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Patients should receive education about the local adverse effects and strategies to reduce their impact. More importantly, inhaled corticosteroid use correlates with a reduction in growth velocity in children with asthma. However, these effects in low doses of inhaled corticosteroids are small, nonprogressive, and potentially reversible.

There is conflicting evidence on the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on bone metabolism and osteoporosis. High doses of ICS correlate with an increased risk of fracture. Adult patients on chronic ICS therapy should have periodic bone density measurements. Routine testing of bone density in children is not needed, but the recommendation is for supplementation with adequate vitamin D and calcium.
