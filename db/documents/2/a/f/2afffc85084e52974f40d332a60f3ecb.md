All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and pharmacists, who order, prescribe, administer, or dispense lidocaine, should be familiar with its toxicity and how to manage it. Lidocaine may cause significant pain on initial injection due to the agent stimulating nociceptors before it exerts its effects on sodium channels; this can be counteracted by buffering the lidocaine with small volumes of sodium bicarbonate shortly before use, making the solution less acidic.

IV infusions of the drug should be treated as high-risk; a 2020 consensus statement suggested that, when used outside of the operating room or post-anesthesia care unit, patients receiving IV lidocaine infusions should ideally be managed in a high-dependency setting with continuous monitoring, and the infusion should be delivered through a separate, dedicated cannula using a tamper-proof pump.
