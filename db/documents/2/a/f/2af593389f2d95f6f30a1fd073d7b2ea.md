The homogentisic acid oxidase is involved in the metabolism of the tyrosine and phenylalanine. Tyrosine is mainly necessary for specific functions, such as melanin, hormone, and several proteins, but the most majority is unused and finally generates acetoacetate and malate. In AKU, the HGD cannot form 4-maleylacetoacetate from homogentisic acid; therefore, the level of homogentisic acid in the blood will rise 100 times than normal, even though the kidneys eliminate a plentiful amount. The HGD converts to benzoquinone acetic acid, which produces polymers that match the skin pigment melanin. These accumulate in the collagen. This process of deposition is called ochronosis.

The pathological effects of ochronosis include arthritis,   increased incidence of renal, prostatic, gall bladder stones, ruptures of muscle, tendons, and ligaments.
