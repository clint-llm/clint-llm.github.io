Patients with floating knee injuries typically will have incurred multiple trauma injuries to that region and should not be overlooked. Furthermore, patients will most likely present with a history of trauma — for example, a motor vehicle accident (MVA), a fall from a height, pedestrian vs. auto, etc.  Patients with an isolated floating knee injury will present with complaints of severe leg pain, inability to bear weight, and potentially some knee instability (due to ligamentous disruption which often accompanies these injuries). On physical examination, there will usually be tenderness to palpation at both the tibial and femoral fracture sites along with gross deformities and shortening of the affected limb. More advanced classification fractures may also be present in one or more of the fractured components. The neurovascular status may or may not be compromised and requires a thorough examination.
