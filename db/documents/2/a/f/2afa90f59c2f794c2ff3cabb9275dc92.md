The desirable and optimal test result range of Lp(a) is <14mg/dL. The highest risk range is >50 mg/dl. Patients with an Lp(a) of 14-30mg/dl are considered to be at borderline risk, and those within the range of 31-50md/dl are at high risk.

Lp(a) levels directly contribute to serum LDL levels. This is due to Lp(a) particles containing an LDL particle.

Laboratory testing for Lp(a) often also includes lipoprotein-X (LpX) levels reported as a separate result. These are compounds consisting of cholesterol and phospholipids, and high levels are associated with cholestasis and hyperviscosity syndromes.
