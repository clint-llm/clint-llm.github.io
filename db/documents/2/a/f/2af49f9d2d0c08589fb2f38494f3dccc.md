Necrotizing periodontal diseases (NPDs) encompass necrotizing gingivitis (NG), necrotizing periodontitis (NP), necrotizing stomatitis (NS), and in extreme cases, NPDs can lead to noma (cancrum oris). These are all considered stages of the same condition due to their shared etiology and clinical presentation.

Necrotizing gingivitis is the most common form and progresses to necrotizing periodontitis in susceptible populations, such as in immunosuppressed patients. The necrotic destruction is limited to the interdental papillae that exhibit the typical punched-out appearance.
