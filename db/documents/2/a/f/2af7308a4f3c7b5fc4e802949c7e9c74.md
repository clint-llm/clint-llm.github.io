The most common complications are pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade requiring intervention, device-related thrombus, device embolization, persistent atrial septal defect (ASD), cardiac perforation, and procedure-related stroke. The incidence of pericardial effusion/tamponade is about 1.2% to 5% and, in the majority of cases, is managed with pericardiocentesis.

Device-related thrombusÂ can be encountered in up to 14% of patients and is managed with a longer course of anticoagulation with a success rate approaching 95% (median treatment duration of 45 days).
