Coxsackievirus Group B is a member of the familyÂ Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus. The enterovirus (EV) is a positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA virus named for their enteric, or gastrointestinal route of transmission.

Coxsackieviruses are non enveloped viruses with linear single-stranded RNA. Group A coxsackieviruses were noted to cause flaccid paralysis, which was caused by generalized myositis. In contrast, group B coxsackieviruses were observed to cause a spastic paralysis because of the degeneration of neuronal tissue and focal muscle injury. At least twenty-three serotypes (1-22, 24) of group A and six serotypes (1-6) of group B are recognized: CV-B1, CV-B2, CV-B3, CV-B4, CV-B5, and CV-B6.
