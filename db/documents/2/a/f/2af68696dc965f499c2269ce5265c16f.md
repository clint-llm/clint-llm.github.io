Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a commonly performed operation today in the United States. It has many advantages over other weight-loss surgeries but can present with early and late complications.Â Chronic complications include but are not limited to strictures, internal hernias, gastro-gastric fistulae, gallstones, marginal ulcers, dumping syndrome, and the nutritional deficiencies that accompany altering the GI tract. As increasingly more patients will have had this surgery, a healthcare practitioner must be aware of these sequelae and their management.
