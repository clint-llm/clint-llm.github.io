The most common differential for VKDB is trauma- accidental or non-accidental injury. Other differentials include:

- Clotting factor deficiencies such as hemophilia A or hemophilia B. Non-reversal of condition despite administering clotting factors may help to determine the exact cause.

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)- running laboratory studies will help to differentiate between DIC and VKDB.

- Thrombocytopenia, especially maternal immune thrombocytopeniaÂ as antibodies to platelets, can cross the placenta and decrease infant platelet count manifesting as purpura. However, in VKDB, the platelet count is generally normal.

- For infants presenting with isolated gastrointestinal bleed, intussusception can be a differential.

However, based on laboratory studies, it becomes easier to arrive at the diagnosis and treat the disease accordingly.
