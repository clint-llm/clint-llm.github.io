The initial workup of symptoms suggestive of cerebral ischemia should include basic labs, including blood glucose, complete blood count, chemistry, coagulation factors, EKG, and cardiac enzymes. A stat non-contrast head CT should be obtained to rule out a hemorrhage or mass lesion.

Often in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke, a non-contrast head CT may demonstrate no discernable abnormality, especially if the patient presents early in the course of the illness. In this case, MRI or CT perfusion may be valuable in order to determine the viability of the ischemic tissue. Because the fate of ischemic neuronal tissue depends upon both the extent and duration of ischemia, patients presenting with acute focal cerebral ischemia often have a region of infarcted brain tissue (the core infarct) surrounded by a larger area of the ischemic brain which may still be viable. This potentially viable region is known as the penumbra. There has been extensive research in the last decade regarding neuroimaging modalities for determining the volume of ischemic penumbra.

Although a thorough analysis of acute stroke imaging techniques is beyond the scope of this article, it is important to recognize that patients with suspected large vessel occlusions may benefit from advanced imaging to determine candidacy for endovascular interventions. If a patient presents with symptoms of large vessel occlusion, including signs of cerebrocortical ischemia, transfer to a comprehensive stroke center or thrombectomy-capable stroke center should be considered.
