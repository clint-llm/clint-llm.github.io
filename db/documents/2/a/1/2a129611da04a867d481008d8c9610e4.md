Empty sella syndrome (ESS), also known as arachnoidocele, is a disorder in which the subarachnoid space herniates into the sella turcica, causing compression and flattening of the pituitary gland and stretching of the pituitary stalk. There is still some debate regarding who first coined the term “empty sella”; W. Bush vs. Sheehan and Summer both used this term around the 1950s to describe a phenomenon recognized in cadavers in which there was an empty appearance of the sella turcica and flattened pituitary gland. Over the following years, the term was adapted further by radiologists observing a similar phenomenon in computed tomograms (CTs) and magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) of the brain.
