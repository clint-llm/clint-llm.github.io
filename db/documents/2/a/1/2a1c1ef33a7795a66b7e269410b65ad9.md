Kyrle disease commonly presents in patients with significant comorbidities such as end-stage renal disease and diabetes mellitus. Thus, it is imperative that dermatologists have a high index of suspicion for renal failure and/or diabetes mellitus or potential worsening of these disorders in patients presenting with Kyrle disease. Dermatologists and dermatology nurses must work closely with primary care providers and other specialty providers, such as nephrologists or endocrinologists, to prevent a negative impact on patients’ quality of life. Future studies on the morbidity and mortality of Kyrle disease are still needed as the current literature is based on small case series.
