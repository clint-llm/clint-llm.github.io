Continuity is important. Discussions should take place often and should not contain too much information. It is important to ensure that each party understands the information delivered in each session. A good technique is to Ask/Tell/Teach/Ask. Ask the patient or family member what they understand about the topic to be discussedÂ to have a baseline for their knowledge. Then you can Tell them the new information or Teach them the new skill. Finally, Ask them to repeat back what you told or taught them in their words.
