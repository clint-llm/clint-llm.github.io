After obtaining a history, imaging in the form of computed tomography (CT) angiography of the abdomen and pelvis should be pursued. In the setting of traumatic injury, this may already be included in the diagnostic workup should blunt trauma have occurred. In the absence of trauma, a dedicated study in the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of renal artery thrombosis should nonetheless prompt healthcare providers to order an imaging study rapidly. It is also better to evaluate with an IV contrast study to rule out thrombosis of the renal artery.

In atraumatic occurrences, an echocardiogram should be ordered to evaluate for the possibility of an embolus emanating from the heart. This is especially important in those with a cardiac valvular prosthesis and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Laboratory studies should include a comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, urinalysis with urine culture, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A strong correlation with hematuria, proteinuria, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and elevated LDH has been noted once the thrombosis has progressed to renal infarction. These laboratory tests may not be as definitive in the setting of a partial thrombosis without infarction.

Additional laboratory testing for intraabdominal pathology should be considered as well, especially if the patient presents with the main complaint of abdominal pain in the absence of flank pain and urinary symptoms.
