Complications in forearm amputations are much lower than those of the lower limb. Common complications pertain to edema, local infection, wound breakdown, and failure of grafts. These are infrequent but must be recognized.

More specifically, phantom limb pain occurs in the majority of upper limb amputees. This is defined as the patient's awareness of the amputated portion of the limb.

Hematomas can form postoperatively if bleeding is not controlled appropriately. Meticulous hemostasis and use of drain can reduce the chance of hematoma formation.

Regardless of the technique employed to divide peripheral nerves, a neuroma always forms.

Joint contractures usually are prevented by immediate postoperative active motion. If contractures develop, more aggressive physical therapy is required.

Revision surgery is a common complication, as trauma is the most common indication. A study in Iraq and Afghanistan soldiers showed that 42% of upper extremity amputees required a repeat surgical procedure, and those with forearm amputations were 4.7 times more likely to develop phantom limb pain.

Finally, psychological stress must not be overlooked. Tintle et al. found that upper-limb amputations have far higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and disability than those with lower-limb amputations.
