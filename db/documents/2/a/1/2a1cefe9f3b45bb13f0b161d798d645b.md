**Le Fort Type I**

Le Fort type I presents as a swollen upper lip, anterior open bite malocclusion, ecchymosis of the maxillary buccal vestibule and palate, and mobility of the maxilla.

With a Le Fort type II fracture, there is significant deformity and swelling, widening of the intercanthal space (nasal septum fracture), mobility of the maxilla and nose as a combined segment, as well as bilateral periorbital edema and ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), epistaxis, anterior open bite malocclusion, ecchymosis of the maxillary buccal vestibule and palate, and possible CSF rhinorrhea. Since the fracture involves the inferior orbital rim and floor, there may be sensory deficits in the infraorbital region extending inferiorly to the upper lip.

The most significant clinical findings are demonstrated by bilateral periorbital edema and ecchymosis (raccoon eyes), ecchymosis of the maxillary buccal vestibule and palate, lengthening of facial height- elongation and flattening of the face (dish-face deformity), orbital hooding, enophthalmos, ecchymosis over the mastoid region (Battle’s sign), CSF rhinorrhea, CSF otorrhea, and hemotympanum.
