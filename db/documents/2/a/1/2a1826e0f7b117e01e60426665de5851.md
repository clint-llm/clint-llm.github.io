The history and physical exam are important in the evaluation of all patients with abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients infected with norovirus typically have symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis. Common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and cramping, diarrhea, myalgias, headache, and chills. Some patients report a predominance of diarrhea while others report nausea and vomiting as primary symptoms. Symptoms may develop with or without prodrome and typically persist for 1 to 3 days. Physical exam findings are usually consistent with gastroenteritis. The abdominal exam may reveal nonspecific, non-focal tenderness, but significant tenderness or peritoneal signs on the abdominal exam should prompt further investigation for other pathology. Likewise, the grossly bloody stool is not consistent with norovirus infection and warrants further investigation. Depending on their hydration status, patients may show signs of dehydration such as tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, decreased skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes. Rarely, patients may present with significant neurologic symptoms such as a seizure or encephalopathy.

Important historical elements to elicit include the patientâ€™s living quarters (e.g., nursing home, military barracks), the source of water (e.g., river, city, well), recent travel, recent antibiotic use, ingestions of undercooked or raw food, or recent sick contacts (e.g., school). It is also important to screen for immunocompromised states which could predict a longer course of symptoms and greater risk for morbidity and mortality.
