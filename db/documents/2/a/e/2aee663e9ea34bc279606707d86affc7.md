Absolute contraindication to hemodialysis is the inability to secure vascular access, and relative contraindications include:

- Difficult vascular access

- Needle phobia

- Cardiac failure

- Coagulopathy

Modern techniques are employed in patients with extensive vascular disease to improve the establishment and salvaging of vascular access. Relative contraindications like needle aversion can be overcome by careful use of local anesthetics and nursing encouragement. Severe coagulopathy complicates the maintenance of anticoagulation in the extracorporeal circuit.

Where the patient can clearly express the wish to decline dialysis treatment,Â the provider is obliged to respect this decision. Nonetheless, the nephrologist must ensure adequate addressing of all reversible factors, such as unfounded fears about the dialysis process or a depressive illness clouding the judgment and requesting a psychiatric evaluation. In such patients, especially those with multiple comorbidities, a shift is made to conservative management using all proper treatments apart from dialysis.

Patients with unacceptable quality of life should be spared the discomfort of HD as survival on dialysis may be no longer with most of the additional time spent on having or recovering from dialysis sessions. Symptomatic treatment of ESRD and its complications can be done with medication and diet, such as pain management with analgesics. In addition, low doses of gabapentin or pregabalin can be used for severe itching and insomnia.
