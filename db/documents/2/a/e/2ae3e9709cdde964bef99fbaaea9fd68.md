The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is a United States Congressional Act passed as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1986. It is commonly referred to as a federal “anti-dumping law” that prevents hospitals from denying or limiting treatment to patients based on their insurance status or ability to pay and transfer them to other facilities. Since the law was passed, it has had other far-reaching influences on various aspects of the healthcare system, including emergency medical services (EMS).

Failure of hospitals and EMS systems to comply with EMTALA mandates can result in stiff penalties imposed by federal agencies, including the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). These penalties can be in the form of monetary fines, exclusion from Medicare reimbursement, and federal prosecution.
