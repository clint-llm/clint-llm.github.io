All races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups are affected by child abuse, with boys and adolescents more commonly affected. Infants tend to have increased morbidity and mortality with physical abuse. Multiple factors increase a child's risk of abuse. These risks include the following:

- Individual factors (eg, a child's disability, unmarried mother, maternal smoking, or a parent's depression)

- Familial factors (eg, domestic violence at home, more than two siblings at home);

- Community factors (eg, lack of recreational facilities); and

- Societal factors (eg, poverty).

- Living in an unrelated adult's home

- Being a child previously reported to CPS.

There are also “protective factors” that decrease the risk of child maltreatment, including family support and parental concern. Preventive factors include parental education regarding child development and parenting, social support, and parental resilience.
