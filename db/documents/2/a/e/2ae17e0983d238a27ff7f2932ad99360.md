Sleep-disordered breathing disorders (SDB) encompass a spectrum of chronic conditions ranging from snoring, upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and central sleep apnea (CSA) and its sub-types.

While OSA and CSA are defined by the number of apnea and hypopnea episodes per hour of sleep (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI), UARS is defined in general as airflow limitation due to increased respiratory effort leading to arousals from sleep without significant desaturation (i.e., RERAs) associated with daytime symptoms.

The etiology, epidemiology, history and physical presentation, evaluation, management, differential diagnosis, and complications of UARS are reviewed here. The topics of OSA and CSA are described separately.
