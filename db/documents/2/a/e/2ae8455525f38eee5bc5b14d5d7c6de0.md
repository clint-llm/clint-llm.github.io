**AIN Compressive Neuropathy**

The surgical decompression of the AIN is indicated only if a prolonged period of nonoperative treatment fails. The technique may include the release of the superficial arch of flexor digitorum superficialis and lacertus fibrosus, detachment of superficial head of pronator teres, ligation of any crossing vessels, and removal of any space-occupying lesion.

**Pediatric Supracondylar****Fracture**

Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) is indicated in type II and III supracondylar fractures, flexion type, or medial column collapse. The urgency of this surgery depends on the clinical presentation. Of note, an isolated AIN injury is not an urgent surgical consideration and can be done electively.
