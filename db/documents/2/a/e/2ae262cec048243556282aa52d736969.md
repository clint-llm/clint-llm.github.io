Despite being a highly prevalent condition, urinary incontinence is inadequately screened for by health care providers. As a result, a large number of patients with urinary incontinence are without treatment, having to tolerate suboptimal health and quality of life. Health care providers in various settings such as hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes can better screen for and communicate findings of patient urinary incontinence with one another to better facilitate patient care. In a collaborative approach, nurses and medical assistants can help screen patients for urinary incontinence. Pharmacists can provide assistance with medication reconciliation in relevant cases.  In more complicated cases of urinary incontinence, collaboration among primary care clinicians and specialists is needed to deliver the seamless, quality care to patients. A study intended to increase screening and management of urinary incontinence by primary care clinicians was unsuccessful despite additional training and support offered to them. The study focused primarily on clinicians and not other health care providers.
