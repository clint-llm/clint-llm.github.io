Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a severely debilitating unilateral headache. The complications mostly arise from the treatment of CPH with indomethacin which is the drug of choice in these patients. Exacerbation of peptic ulcer disease and renal insufficiency as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events can be seen in patients treated with indomethacin.
