Evaluation of nutritional status is critical, either to identify if an individual has nutritional imbalance due to an underlying condition or to assess if an individual is likely to develop a pathological condition due to nutritional imbalance. A detailed, systematic evaluation of a patient's nutritional status conducted by healthcare providers in a team-based setting to diagnose malnutrition and identify underlying pathologies to plan intervention constitutes nutritional assessment. This article provides an overview of nutritional evaluation, including components of nutritional assessment, factors that affect nutritional status, and the role of interprofessional teams involved in managing patients at nutritional risks.
