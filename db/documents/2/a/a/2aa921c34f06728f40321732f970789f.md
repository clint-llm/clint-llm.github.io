**Treatment & management**

- **Nonoperative**
- NSAIDs can help reduce swelling and joint pain. Intraarticular steroid injections can provide temporary relief but have not shown long term benefits. Activity modifications such as avoiding running, jumping, and stairs can make a difference in pain and discomfort; however, it may not be desirable for many patients. Other conservative treatments include shoe modifications and orthotics. They aim to modify the biomechanics of the first MTP joint, reducing motion, limiting irritation from the dorsal osteophytes, and reducing the mechanical stresses on the joint. Morton's extension, made of a firm or rigid orthotic material that extends under the great toe, can help reduce dorsiflexion. Navicular pads have been used to alter the loading patterns of the joint. Rocker bottom soles can help diminish painful dorsiflexion during the gait cycle. Shoes with a high toe box can take the pressure off prominent osteophytes. However, many of these modifications are not well tolerated by patients.

- **Operative**
-  Cheilectomy

- This procedure has a good outcome with a mild to moderate degree of restriction in dorsiflexion with a satisfaction rate of 88% to 95%. Patients with more severe disease or pain during the midrange of motion have low satisfaction rates with this procedure. It uses the dorsal approach. The capsule is opened, followed by complete synovectomy. Approximately 30% of the dorsal aspect of the metatarsal head is removed. Removal of >40% can lead to a painful overload of the remaining articular surface, or dorsal subluxation of the phalanx. If present, lateral osteophytes are removed as well. Remove dorsal bone until 60 to 70 degrees of dorsiflexion at the MTP joint is achieved. The average increase in dorsiflexion is approximately 25 degrees. The main benefit is the relief of dorsal impingement, which is the primary source of pain.


- Moberg Procedure

- This procedure is a dorsal closing wedge osteotomy of the proximal phalanx. It can be used at the time of cheilectomy if it fails to achieve adequate dorsiflexion.


-  Arthrodesis

- This approach is the current standard of care for managing more severe (grade 3 to 4) hallux rigidus. Successful clinical outcomes are based on the correct positioning of the fusion. The recommended positioning of the hallux relative to the floor is between 10 degrees and 15 degrees of dorsiflexion and 10 degrees to 15 degrees of valgus.


- Keller resection arthroplasty

- This surgery involves the removal of the base of the proximal phalanx. Indicated in low demand patients aged >70 years.


- MTP arthroplasty

- Silicone implants have shown good short- term outcomes. However, long- term data shows high rates of complications.
- Polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel hemiarthroplasty is a new treatment option. FDA approved for implantation in July 2016 in the United States. It has similar material properties to human articular cartilage in terms of water content, tensile strength, and a compressive modulus. The implant is held in place via press-fit and sits projecting by 1.5 mm to function as both hemiarthroplasty and interpositional space. Early data shows similar outcomes to arthrodesis; however, long term data is necessary.
