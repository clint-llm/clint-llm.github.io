The drug used to reverse tPA toxicity is aminocaproic acid,Â an FDA-approved drug for managing acute bleeding caused by increased fibrinolytic activity. It acts as an effective inhibitor for proteolytic enzymes like plasmin, the primary enzyme responsible for fibrinolysis.

**Drug Interactions**

Monitor closely with any drug that causes anticoagulation as there is an increased risk of bleeding.

- Defibrotide: Through pharmacodynamic synergism, defibrotide increases the effects of tPA drugs and is thus contraindicated.

- Prothrombin complex concentrate, human: This can cause pharmacodynamic antagonism of the tPA drugs.

- Apixaban: Apixaban and tPA drugs increase anticoagulation and can lead to an increased bleeding risk.

- Nitroglycerin: This could decrease the serum concentration of tPA drugs.

- Salicylates: These could enhance the toxic effects of thrombolytic drugs. Monitor therapy, as there is an increased risk of bleeding.
