Overall the prognosis of postmenopausal bleeding is favorable because the most common etiologies are benign. Once the etiology of bleeding is identified, treatment can be instituted. Even in cases where endometrial cancer is diagnosed, the prognosis is better compared to many other malignancies. Over 70% of endometrial cancer cases are diagnosed at stage I, with an associated survival rate at five years of 90%.

Caution is warranted in patients who are diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia. Some patients with endometrial hyperplasia may have undiagnosed concurrent endometrial carcinoma. One study found certain risk factors increase this risk:

- Age 40-59, with an odds ratio of 3.07

- Age ≥60, with an odds ratio of 6.65

- Body mass index ≥35 kg/m(2), with the odds ratio 2.32

- Diabetes mellitus, with an odds ratio of 2.51

- Endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia, with the odds ratio 9.01, p=0.042

In this study, the presence of more risk factors was correlated with an increased risk of concurrent carcinoma.

- No risk factors = 0%

- 1 risk factor = 7%

- 2 risk factors = 17.6%

- 3 risk factors = 35.8%

- 4 risk factors = 45.5%
