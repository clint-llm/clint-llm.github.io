Whereas bones are typically connectedÂ at joints, sesamoid bones are unique because they are not connected to other bones. Instead, they are found within muscles and are often connected through tendons. The patella's function and relation to the other muscles have been well studied and form the basis for discussing sesamoid bones with muscle groups.

The patella's unique position in the lower extremities allows it to act as a pivot point, allowing the quadriceps to bear increased loads with decreased friction.

The vital connection between the quadriceps tendon and the patellar ligament via the patella allows for the knee's extensive and distinct range of motion by transferring forces. However, not all sesamoid bones serve this unique purpose. The fabella bone, a common sesamoid bone variant near the gastrocnemius and articulating with the lateral femoral epicondyle, often presents with complications like the fabella pain syndrome.
