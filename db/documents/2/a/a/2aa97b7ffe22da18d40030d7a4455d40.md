As stated earlier, pneumatosis intestinalis is not a primary condition in itself but a radiographic sign of underlying pathology. The COVID-19 respiratory illness is the cause of an ongoing global pandemic with an estimated 40 million confirmed cases. Although the coronavirus is known to affect many organ systems and is primarily a pulmonary pathology causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, gastrointestinal involvement has been reported.

Most recently, Meini et al. reported a case of pneumatosis intestinalis in a patient with COVID-19 that resolved with conservative treatment of the respiratory illness. It is speculated that bowel wall damage and alteration of gut microbiota during COVID-19 infection of a patient can cause pneumatosis intestinalis. With the recent global outbreak, including over 1 million deaths, it is important to recognize the extrapulmonary manifestations of the disease, including pneumatosis intestinalis.
