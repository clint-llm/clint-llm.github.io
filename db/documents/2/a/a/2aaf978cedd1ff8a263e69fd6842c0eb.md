Hemophilia is an inherited condition caused by a deficiency of one of the clotting factors in the blood. It may be due to a defect in the gene for the clotting factor. The genes for factors VIII and factor IX are present in the X chromosome. Hemophilia B is inherited via an X-linked recessive pattern, thus affecting mostly males, where affected males will have 100% carrier daughters while none of their sons would be affected. Female carriers will have a 50% chance of delivering affected sons and a 50% chance of delivering carrier daughters. Females could be affected if they received the mutated alleles from both their parents or through the process of Lyonization, where there is inactivation of the other X chromosome.

Acquired hemophilia B is a rare autoimmune disorder that occurs in patients with no family history of bleeding disorders or hemorrhage due to autoantibodies developing against coagulation factors. Patients with acquired hemophilia usually have pre-existing underlying autoimmune diseases, malignancies, or infections like HIV and hepatitis B or C.
