It can often be challenging to separate the two types of second-degree AV blocks. A rhyme is often used to remember type I or Wenckebach: “longer, longer, longer, DROP, now you have a Wenckebach.” This rhyme is alluding to the progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a non-conducted beat or the lack of a QRS complex after a P wave.

When a Mobitz type I has a fixed conduction ratio of 2:1, meaning 2 conducted beats to one non-conducted beat, it is difficult to differentiate between type I and type II. In this scenario, it is recommended to assume the worst-case scenario and call this rhythm a “non-typeable second-degree AV block.” This should be managed like a type II with transcutaneous or transvenous pacing until further workup can be completed.
