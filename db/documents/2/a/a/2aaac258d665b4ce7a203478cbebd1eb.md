Initially, evaluate the airway, breathing, and circulation, and stabilize as necessary. If the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of less than 8, no gag reflex, or other concerns for an ability to protect their airway, perform rapid sequence intubation. Similarly, if heart rate or blood pressure is slow enough to decrease CPP, consider external pacing, defibrillation, or vasopressors, as indicated.

At the bedside, check vital signs, ECG rhythm, and glucose. Consider empiric administration of a “coma cocktail” - naloxone for opiate overdose, dextrose for hypoglycemia, and thiamine for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or beriberi.

If the history or physical is suggestive of trauma, consider cervical spine immobilization. If there are signs of impending herniation (e.g., Cushing reflex or a unilateral blown pupil), elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees, increase the respiratory rate, and consider mannitol and neurosurgical decompression. If there are no signs of impending herniation, consider head CT and appropriate neurosurgical consultation for any lesions identified on CT.

If the patient has signs concerning for infectious sources, give antibiotics, appropriate weight-based fluid boluses, and consider pulse dose steroids in the steroid-dependent.

If there are no signs of trauma and no suspicion for infection, consider toxic or metabolic causes, including medication overdose, withdrawal states, or the effects of drug-drug interaction.

Consider lab evaluation of serum electrolytes, hepatic, and renal function, urinalysis. Consider imaging with a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia as a cause of altered mental status and/or head CT for concern of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). If none of these explain the cause of altered mental status, consider an evaluation of thyroid function, serum B12 levels, syphilis status. Additionally, lumbar puncture can be performed to rule out meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
