Milia are benign and transient subepidermal keratin cysts. These white appearing bumps are common, present in many different ways, and can develop in any area of the skin, most commonly the face. The lesions are seen in about half of full-term newborns, and due to a lack of clinical relevance, they are paid little to no attention. The natural course of milia is self-limited and, in most cases, will resolve without leaving a scar by one month of life. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of milia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of milia.
- Describe the evaluation of milia.
- Review the management options available for milia.
