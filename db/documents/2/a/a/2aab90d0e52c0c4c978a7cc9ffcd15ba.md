Patients with an acute patellar tendon tear present to their healthcare provider with the complaint of infrapatellar knee pain, swelling, difficulty with weight-bearing, and difficulty straightening the leg. They may report an audible “pop” or the sensation of their knee giving way during an event with a sudden quadriceps contraction with the knee in a flexed position, such as with jumping sports or missing a step on the stairs. As with any presenting complaint, it is essential to obtain a detailed history of their symptoms. The history of the present illness should include the onset of their symptoms, specific location of their pain, duration of the pain and symptoms, characteristics of the pain, alleviating and aggravating factors, any radiation of pain, and the severity of their symptoms. Patients may report pre-existing pain at the level of the patella or patellar tendon, which may be indicative of underlying tendinosis. Furthermore, a thorough history may reveal an underlying risk factor or predisposition to a tendon rupture.

There are differing opinions on the definition of an acute versus chronic tendon rupture; however, in general, chronic ruptures are those presenting six weeks after injury.

Physical examination of the knee should begin with an inspection. Be sure to evaluate the surrounding skin for any signs of direct trauma. Look for any associated swelling or knee effusion. Patellar tendon ruptures often will be associated with a large hemarthrosis and surrounding ecchymosis. Inspect and evaluate the patellar height and compare the affected and unaffected sides. A patellar tendon rupture will likely be associated with an elevation of the patellar height compared to the uninjured side.

Palpation of the bony and soft tissue structures is an essential part of any knee exam. The palpatory exam can be broken down into the medial, midline, and lateral structures of the knee.

**Palpatory Exam -****Areas of Focus**

**Medial Aspect of the Knee**

- Vastus medialis obliquis

- Superomedial pole patella

- The medial facet of the patella

- Origin of the medial collateral ligament (MCL)

- Midsubstance of the MCL

- Broad insertion of the MCL

- Medial joint line

- Medial meniscus

- Pes anserine tendons and bursa

**Midline Knee**

- Quadricep tendon

- Suprapatellar pouch

- Superior pole patella

- Patellar mobility

- Prepatellar bursa

- Patellar tendon

- Tibial tubercle

**Lateral Aspect of the Knee**

- Iliotibial band

- Lateral facet patella

- Lateral collateral ligament (LCL)

- Lateral joint line

- Lateral meniscus

- Gerdy’s tubercle

Patients with a patellar tendon rupture will have a palpable defect below the inferior pole of the patella. They will also have localized tenderness about the infrapatellar aspect of the knee.

Range of motion (ROM) testing and muscle strength testing are essential aspects of the knee exam, especially in the setting of a suspected patellar tendon rupture. Patients with an acute patellar tendon rupture will have decreased ROM of the knee due to pain and disruption of the extensor mechanism. There will be a loss of active knee extension, which is the key physical exam finding. If the patellar tendon is the only portion of the extensor mechanism ruptured and the retinaculum is intact, the active extension may be possible, but there will be an extensor lag of a few degrees. Patients will be unable to perform active straight leg raise and also will be unable to maintain a passively extended knee.

Care is necessary to avoid missing a diagnosis of a patellar tendon rupture or any disruption of the extensor mechanism, as delayed diagnosis and treatment affect the outcome. If needed, aspiration of a painful knee effusion followed by an injection of lidocaine may be performed to aid in clinical diagnosis. A patient with an extensor mechanism disruption will be unable to perform a straight leg raise despite adequate local anesthesia. On the other hand, a patient with a painful effusion secondary to a different issue will be able to perform a straight leg raise.
