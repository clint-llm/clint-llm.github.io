Chemotherapy is not indicated in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ after surgical treatment. However, medical endocrine therapy is a large component of the recommended treatment for DCIS.  DCIS is staged as Tis and is Stage 0 breast cancer.

There is some thought that treating HER-2 positive patients with trastuzumab may be beneficial as well, and data available from a 2020 NRG Oncology/NSABP B-43 protocol presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) suggest a possible benefit, but differences so far are not statistically significant and more research needs to be done. This is an area that is actively being researched, with new receptors and targeted therapy being developed and studied.
