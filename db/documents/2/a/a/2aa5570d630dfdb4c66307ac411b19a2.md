Monteggia fractures account for approximately 1% to 2% of all forearm fractures. Distal forearm fractures are far more frequent than midshaft forearm fractures, which occur in about 1 to 10 per 10,000 people per year. The most significant risk factors for midshaft forearm fractures include sports (football and wrestling), osteoporosis, and post-menopausal phase. These risk factors correlate with a bimodal occurrence with the highest incidence occurring in young males (10:10,000) and elderly females (5:10,000).
