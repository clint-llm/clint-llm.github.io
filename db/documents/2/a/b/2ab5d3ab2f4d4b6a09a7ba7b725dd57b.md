Cryptorchidism (non-descent of the testis) not only leads to infertility but carries a risk of testicular cancer. If the abnormal testis is not removed, close surveillance is necessary. The primary treatment for cryptorchidism is repositioning of the cryptorchid testes which is called orchidopexy. It shouldÂ be performed before 1 year of birth in those with congenital cryptorchidism in order to best prevent cancer.

Sometimes a hydrocele (serous fluid) can result when fluid collects between the layers of the tunica vaginalis. A hydrocele may be due to an infection, trauma, or congenital factors. One common congenital factor is through incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis.
