The primary clinical focus concerning the PAG involves its antinociceptive endogenous opioid and non-opioid mediated pain control.  This concept has support from studies demonstrating both lower activation of the PAG in chronic pain states, such as lower back pain and complex regional pain syndrome, as well as distractions from pain with upregulation of the PAG.

Through its role in arousal and pain, the PAG has a major involvement in disease states, including anxiety, panic disorders, and depression. Chronic stress states have shown links to despair and depression-like behaviors in mice, for example. Tail suspension tests or forced swim tests in mice led to suppressed glutamate in vlPAG leading to maladaptive and depression-like behaviors.
