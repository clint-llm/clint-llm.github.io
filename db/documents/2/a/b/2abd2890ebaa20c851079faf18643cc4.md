Patients typically present in the fifth or sixth decade of life with fever, malaise, cough, and shortness of breath. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is unique among interstitial lung diseases in that symptoms are subacute (weeks in duration). Patients frequently fail empiric antibiotics for presumed bacterial pneumonia. Their cough may be dry or productive. Sputum may be of clear or discolored. Rarely patients develop a rapidly progressive disease with severe dyspnea and hypoxemia. Chest pain, night sweats, significant weight loss and mild arthralgias are uncommon symptoms. Hemoptysis and pneumothorax have rarely been reported.

A detailed history and physical examination should be performed to rule out connective tissue diseases, as they can be associated with organizing pneumonia. A thorough medication and exposure history should also be obtained. The respiratory exam typically discloses inspiratory crackles, but the exam can be normal.
