The kidneys are the primary excretory system; whereas, the hepatic system is the main site involved in drug metabolism. Other sites of metabolism include the gastrointestinal tract, pulmonary system, kidneys, and skin. An important concept to understand is any impairment of the described systems may alter how a therapeutic level of medication is achieved and can predispose patients to toxicity symptoms with a dose that would otherwise be well-tolerated in a healthy individual. Both metabolism and excretion are combined to form the rate constant of elimination, which is useful in determining the order of elimination. This equation appears in "Equation  No. 2", where "k" represents the rate constant of elimination, and "km" and "ke" represent the rate constant for metabolism and the rate constant for excretion, respectively.
