Sickle cell hepatopathy covers multiple entities, and healthcare professionals need to be informed about this disease spectrum. Everyone must work together to provide the patient the best care, including diagnostic workup, treatment, and management. Given the various manifestations of sickle cell hepatopathy, especially in the acute setting, emergency medicine physicians, internists, and hematologists need to identify if the patient is in an acute crisis and determine the subsequent immediate intervention.

In the outpatient setting, it is important for the healthcare professionals who are part of the patient’s comprehensive care team to be aware of when the patient needs further workup for concern for sickle cell hepatopathy and when referral to subspecialists such as transplant hepatology should be pursued.
