**Patient Protocol**

- Instructed to fast 4 to 6 hours before probe insertion

- Provided with a diary to record: time of the meal, the content of the meal, time of upright and recumbent periods, time of administration of acid-suppressing medication, time of symptom occurrence

- No clear guidelines on dietary restrictions exist; it varies from provider to provider

- Patients are encouraged to continue their usual eating habits or engage in ordinary activities that are known to induce symptoms

****Testing On/Off PPI therapy****

- The decision to perform testing on or off PPI therapy depends on the indication for testing.

- If a patient has a known history of GERD that is refractory to treatment, and the indication for MII-pH testing is to diagnose weakly acidic (non-acid) reflux, PPI therapy continues. Usually, patients remain on high-dose acid-suppressive therapy for at least one week before testing and on the day of testing.

- If it is unclear whether GERD is the cause of a patientâ€™s symptoms, MII-pH testing is done off PPI therapy to detect acid reflux events.

****Insertion Technique****

- The MII-pH probe placement is transnasally into the esophagus

- The probes are 2.1 mm in diameter and allow for pH sensors to be placed 5 cm superior to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and 10 cm below the LES

- Impedance measurements are taken at various segments throughout the esophagus with four impedance-measuring segments in the distal esophagus (3, 5, 7, and 9 cm above the LES) and two segments in the proximal esophagus (at 15 and 17 cm above the LES)

- The testing usually lasts 24 hours, and once the study is complete, the recording unit is returned to the provider

- There is subsequent data analysis using a software system
