Anesthetic management of pneumonectomy is challenging, and multiple management issues should be accounted for to achieve better patient outcomes.

Monitoring - invasive hemodynamic monitoring is the American society of anesthesiologist standard monitoring.

Fluid management - under resuscitation can lead to systemic hypoperfusion, and over resuscitation can lead to ALI, ARDS.

Single lung ventilation - Anesthesia providers should be familiar with lung isolation techniques, confirming the position of a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker with FOB scope, and be able to troubleshoot hypoxia or hypercarbia resulting from one-lung ventilation.

Evidence-based management to prevent perioperative complications and early extubation.

Pain control is always an important consideration, and utilizing multimodal techniques is recommended. Thoracic epidural analgesiaÂ can be utilized provided there are no contraindications and should be used cautiously to avoid hypotension, which may necessitate more fluid administration.
