**Common Types****Pilocytic Astrocytoma**

- It is benign in nature

- Has cystic consistency

- Location is mostly infratentorial

- Presents classically in childhood

- Can be resected surgically

- Variant: Pilomyxoid astrocytoma

**Diffuse Astrocytoma**

- Grade II

- Usually seen in adults

- May progress to glioblastoma

**Anaplastic Astrocytoma**

- Grade III

- Also usually seen in adults

- There is a lack of endothelial proliferation

**Glioblastoma**

- Commonest malignant brain tumor

- Peak age is around 65 years

- Very bad prognostication

- Variants: Giant cell glioblastoma, Gliosarcoma

**Uncommon Types**

**Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)**

- Prognosis is usually good

- Age group affected: Children & adults (young)

- Has big lipidized cells

- May mimic malignant tumor

**Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma(SEGCA)**

- Located mostly intraventricularly

- Benign in nature

- Affects the adolescent age group

- Associated with Tuberous sclerosis

**Gliomatosis Cerebri**

- Old term, used for extensive & diffuse astrocytomas

- Not a distinct entity since 2016

- Radiological evidence of > 3 lobe involvement is required, bilaterally

- WHO grade III

- Division into 2 types possible on the basis of solid component presence:

1. Type 1 GC: No IDH 1/2 mutation, diffusely growing

2. Type 2 GC: IDH 1 mutation +, solid component present

- Genetically overlaps diffuse astrocytic gliomas, glioblastoma & oligodendrogliomas

**H3 K27M Mutant Diffuse Midline Glioma**

- High-grade

- Location: midline including spinal cord, brainstem & thalamus

- Adolescents & children are mostly involved

- DPIG(Diffuse pontine intrinsic glioma) is included

- New entry after 2016 WHO classification

- Poor prognosis is usually there when:

- Absence of EGFR amplification 
- Presence of unmethylated MGMT promoter

- Enhancement in MRI: may/may not be present

- Histologically may range from minimum hypercellularity to full-blown glioblastoma

**Gliosarcoma**

- WHO considers it as a variant of glioblastoma

- It is quite rare, with only about 200 case reports

- Has Glioblastoma & sarcoma components(fibroblastic, osseous, cartilage, smooth & striated muscle, fat cells)

- Similar to glioblastomas, it is usually found in temporal lobe

- Prognositicallly like glioblastoma

Immunohistochemistry:

- Astrocytic component is glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive & spindle cell negative

- Smooth muscle part (Gliomyosarcoma ) is Smooth muscle antibody (SMA) & factor VIII positive

**Gliofibroma**

- It is very rare

- Usually found in children

- Has fibroblastic part, which is non-malignant
