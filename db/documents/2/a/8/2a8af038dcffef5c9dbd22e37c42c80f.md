EMS providers are the first to arrive on the scene for most out-of-hospital emergency calls. They are the first to assess and treat the patient, and their initial impressions often have a significant influence on those of the physicians, nursing triage, and other providers at the hospital to which the patient is brought. A clean transition of care is imperative to minimize delays and promote positive outcomes. Physicians, nurses, and EMS officials work together to design and optimize field protocols that best utilize the resources and skillsets of providers in the field.

Chest injuries following blunt or penetrating trauma carry a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Potential complications of such injuries are diverse, ranging from completely benign to potentially fatal. EMS providers are typically the first trained medical professionals to encounter trauma victims on the scene.Â  Their early assessment and stabilization are critical in the survival and prognosis for each patient.
