The disease is transmitted from animals to humans by consuming unpasteurized milk and dairy products, consuming undercooked meat, or skin penetration of those in contact with livestock.

**United State Statistics**

It is one of the most common laboratory-acquired bacterial infections in the United States. It also is transmitted by inhalation of contaminated aerosols, conjunctival inoculation, blood transfusions, transplacentally from mother to fetus, and rarely from person to person. Brucella causes more than 500,000 infections per year worldwide. In 2010, 115 cases of brucellosis were diagnosed in the United States and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California and Texas were the states with the highest number of cases in 2010, and most cases in the United States are related to occupational exposure of those who work with animals. The number of reported cases in the United States has dropped significantly because of animal vaccination programs and milk pasteurization.

**Age**

Brucellosis is more prevalent in the young population, with 60% of cases in persons aged 13-40 years, 16% in those aged 40-60 years, and 2.5% in 60 years and older.

**Sex**

Brucellosis is more common in males as compared to females. Occupational exposure to animals is the most likely cause of this gender vulnerability.
