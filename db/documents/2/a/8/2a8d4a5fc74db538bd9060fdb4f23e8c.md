Measurement of electrolytes will help clinicians in the diagnosis of a medical condition, the effectiveness of treatment, and the potential side effect of medications. Examples include:

A patient with heart failure receiving diuretics needs a workup for sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and magnesium, as diuretics can exert adverse effects on electrolyte balance.

A patient that presents with weakness needs a basic electrolyte workup, as an electrolyte imbalance, especially in sodium and potassium levels, can lead to generalized weakness.

A patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease on long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy should be monitored forÂ hypomagnesemia.
