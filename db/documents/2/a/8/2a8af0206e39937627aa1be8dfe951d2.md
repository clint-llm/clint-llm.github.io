A Wood's lamp examination is a diagnostic test used in the diagnosis of many dermatologic disorders including:

1. Pigmentary disorders: Hypopigmentation or depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and melasma.

There is a modern version of Wood's light which has a wavelength of 395 nanometers and is mainly concerned with skin and appendageal tumors like basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis. Also, it can be used to detect certain benign conditions like milia and comedones.
