**Periocular Sensory Innervation**

The first and second divisions of the trigeminal nerve provide sensory innervation to the brow and midface (figure 1). The ophthalmic division (V1) runs along the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within the orbit, the nerve divides into the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves.

The maxillary division (V2) travels along the inferolateral wall of the cavernous sinus and exits through the foramen rotundum. The zygomatic nerve branches off within the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the orbit in the inferior orbital fissure before dividing into the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal nerves. After entering the orbit through the inferior orbital fissure, V2 becomes the infraorbital nerve (figure 2). Within the infraorbital canal, the anterior superior alveolar nerve branches off before the infraorbital nerve exits. Terminal nasal, labial, and palpebral branches provide sensation to the skin of the nose, eyelids, and face.
