When starting alprostadil for a patient complaining of erectile dysfunction, certain things are to be kept in mind to prevent and for the early identification of adverse effects for better overall outcomes. Alprostadil is known to cause hemodynamic instability causing hypotension/hypertension, and flushing. It is advisable to monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature before and after the use of the drug. Alprostadil is also known to cause penile pathologies such as stricture formation, fibrosis, and hematoma formation at the site of injection. Regular examination by a physician and timely attention by one on the onset of discomfort can bring about better possible outcomes. For a better understanding of drug-to-effect response, monitoring the duration of erection can be essential for tailoring management for the patient.
