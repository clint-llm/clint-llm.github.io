Educating patients at risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) related complications and open communication between them and their cardiologist for primary and secondary prevention can further improve the management of affected patients. Collaboration with shared decision making between the patient, primary care physician, and specialists are vital in achieving good outcomes for patients with HCM. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to treating HCM.
