Lynch syndrome is the most common form of hereditary colorectal cancer, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome. The mechanism underlying this disease involves inherited mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, leading to inadequate expression and function of their proteins. Mutations in mismatch repair genes have been discovered and implicated in this disease, and clinical features have been identified and tailored to identify at-risk patients. As Lynch syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, screening and identifying patients with Lynch syndrome and Lynch syndrome-associated cancers is imperative to decrease mortality and morbidity associated with this disease.
