In understanding the epithelialization process, one can begin to understand the clinical importance of using moisture-retaining occlusive dressings to enhance wound healing. A moist environment enhances epidermal cell migration, especially in reepithelialization. In a dry environment, cells dehydrate and die, leading to scab or crust formation over the wound and impairing reepithelialization.

In summary, wounds exposed to air and allowed to dry tend to heal slowly and result in poor cosmesis. On the other hand, moist wound environments improve wound healing, enhance angiogenesis, and reduce necrosis.
