The time course of progression and the severity of airway obstruction follow two distinct patterns.

- If appropriately documented, one subgroup shows a slow subacute worsening of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) over days, known as "slow onset asthma exacerbation." This patient subgroup usually has intrinsic patient-induced predisposition factors, including inadequate inhaler regimen, suboptimal compliance, and psychological stressor.

- The other phenotype, known as "sudden onset asthma exacerbation," presents with severe deterioration within hours. They often correlate with sudden massive exposure to external triggers like predisposed allergens, food articles, sulfites, among others.

Eighty percent to 85% of asthma fatalities are in the subgroup of slow-onset asthma exacerbation, perhaps reflecting an inadequate disease control over time. In contrast to the sudden onset of exacerbation phenotype, which presents mostly with clear airways, slow-onset exacerbation patients have extensive airway inflammation and mucus plugging.
