Preparation needs to occur before the patient’s arrival. This includes a code team, a resuscitation room, age appropriate equipment, and proper training in pediatric airway techniques and resuscitation. Code team assignments should occur before the patient’s arrival. Team members assigned to the following roles:

- A dedicated team leader

- Airway management

- Chest compression

- Vascular access (intravenous or intraosseous)

- Medication administration

- History (from the family and pre-hospital personnel)

- Family liaison (who can communicate with the family)

- Recorder and timekeeper

- Security officer (if available for crowd control)

It is not uncommon to perform several duties depending on staffing.

The Broselow system, a length-based resuscitation tape and/or code cart can assist in determining the proper medication doses and equipment sizes.
