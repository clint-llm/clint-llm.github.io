Many emergency departments are transitioning to protocols and flowcharts for frequently seen emergencies. This is common for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions and cerebral vascular accidents. Similarly, gastrointestinal bleeds are also frequently seen in the emergency department and can deteriorate rapidly. Having an interprofessional team-based approach and protocol for massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the emergency department can be lifesaving and create a low-stress, efficient work environment for the entire team. Being familiar with not only the procedure but also what equipment and devices the hospital stocks will save time when it matters the most. Interprofessional communication between physicians and nurses is essential for both placement of the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube and recognizing complications throughout the procedure.
