The prognosis is variable, with some patients showing spontaneous remission and others progressing to death. The duration of disease in the literature ranges from death within days, following a severe acute illness, to survival with cor pulmonale associated with the chronic illness after twenty years. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) have a mean survival rate of 2.5Â to 5 years after diagnosis. Deaths can occur acutely from massive hemorrhage or after progressive pulmonary insufficiency and right heart failure.
