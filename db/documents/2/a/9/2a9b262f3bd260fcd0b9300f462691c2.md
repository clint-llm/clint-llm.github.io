A myocardium that is dysfunctional due to ischemia but potentially salvageable upon revascularization is viable. Viable myocardium can be ‘stunned’ or ‘hibernating.’ This is believed to be due to the adaptive response of the myocardium to the ischemic milieu with the downregulation of its metabolism and contractility. Myocardial viability assessment is essential in selecting patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) for revascularization. Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of HFrEF (LVEF <40%) worldwide and is termed ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The blood supply of the epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium is by epicardial coronary arteries, and atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the most common cause of myocardial ischemia, which leads to myocardial necrosis and ischemic cardiomyopathy in the long run.

Repetitive ischemia lasting for a lesser duration causes a temporary loss of contraction with a potential for recovery in the function of viable myocardium in days to weeks, an entity called ‘myocardial stunning.’

Myocardial hibernation is an adaptation to chronic ischemia with only a little cell death in which myocardial segments supplied by the coronary artery with fixed stenosis remain noncontractile due to the downregulation of cellular metabolism but retain their potential to recover partially or entirely upon revascularization.
