Chest injuries account for nearly one-fourth of all trauma-related mortality, second only to head and neck injuries. They often require rapid intervention and stabilization, whether they are from penetrating (i.e., gunshots, lacerations, punctures) or blunt (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, crush injury, blasts, burns) trauma. In the setting of acute trauma, the aim of an emergency medical service (EMS) system is to minimize the time between injury and medical care. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of chest injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of a patient with chest injuries.
- Summarize the treatment of chest injuries.
- Describe the role of ultrasound in evaluating chest injuries.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by chest injuries.
