Negative pressure wound therapy forms a cornerstone of advanced wound care and demonstrates excellent utility for complex acute and chronic wounds.

One of the many advantages of NPWT is that once sufficient expertise is attained, this form of wound care can be implemented by multiple healthcare team members, including physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. A caveat to this is that this procedure is carried out by the operating surgeon when performed in the operating room. However, it is important to consider that this endeavor in itself requires a multidisciplinary approach, with the anesthesiologist, surgical scrub nurse, and operating room practitioners all providing their respective essential expertise.

Finally, as mentioned before, NPWT can be utilized by various specialties, including dermatology, podiatry, plastic surgery, trauma, and orthopedic surgery, general surgery, vascular surgery, and endocrinology. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the wider healthcare team involved in this process and how each member can positively impact patient care. Good communication and an appreciation of each team member's roles can significantlyÂ enhance patient care. [Level 5]
