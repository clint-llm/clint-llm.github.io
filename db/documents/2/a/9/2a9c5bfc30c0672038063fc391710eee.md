Confirmation of sample details with the test requisition form is done. Initial processing of the sample is per procedure requirements.

Serum or plasma can be separated using centrifugation from plain or anti-coagulant-containing vials. Serum and plasma are used to assess and quantify protein fractions to diagnose disorders related to their synthesis or disposal. Hemolysate can be prepared using buffers and whole blood specimens from the anti-coagulant-containing vial. Hemolysate is used to assess and quantify hemoglobin fractions to diagnose hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia.

Nucleic acid extracts and PCR products can be used after mixing them with sucrose, buffer, and tracking dye. After setting up the instrumentation and gel, the sample is applied, and the electrical supply is started. When tracking dye completes a run of approximately 80% of the gel, the electrical supply is turned off, and the separation of bands is quantified using densitometry.
