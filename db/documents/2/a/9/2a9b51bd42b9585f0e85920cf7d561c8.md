The muscle receives its nerve supply from the posterior interosseous nerve (C7-C8), a motor branch of the radial nerve. The radial nerve dives posteriorly through the heads of the supinator muscle in the antecubital fossa to form the posterior interosseous nerve. It innervates the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle in addition to the other muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm. The radial nerve arises from the brachial plexusÂ via the posterior cord, which has contributions from the spinal nerve roots of C5 to T1.
