Perforated peptic ulcers are life-threatening conditions with a mortality rate that approaches 30%. Early surgery and aggressive management of sepsis are the mainstays of therapy.

Sepsis accounts for approximately half of all mortalities in the setting of perforated peptic ulcers.

Intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPI) help bleeding cessation and facilitate healing, but efficacy in perforated ulcers has not been established. That said, intravenous PPI administration should be given to creating a neutral pH environment that aids in maintaining platelet aggregation and hence should promote rapid sealing of perforated ulcers.

The mainstay treatment for a perforated peptic ulcer is early operative intervention as mortality significantly increases with surgical delay.
