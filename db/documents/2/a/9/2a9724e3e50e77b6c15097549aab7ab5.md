Most cerebral aneurysms are acquired lesions, with an increased incidence in patients with certain risk factors such as advanced age, hypertension, smoking, alcohol abuse, and atherosclerosis. Other causes include cocaine use, tumors, trauma, and certain embolic-forming infections like endocarditis. There is also a strong genetic element with the incidence significantly increased in patients with a strong family history of aneurysms (in other words,Â more than one family member affected). Certain genetic conditions are associated with higher prevalence. This includes, but is not limited to, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, tuberous sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations (AVM), and coarctation of the aorta.
