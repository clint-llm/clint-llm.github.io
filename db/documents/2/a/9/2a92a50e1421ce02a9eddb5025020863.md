The first and most important management step in a patient with TVL is a thorough evaluation. Education of the public and the medical fraternity regarding a thorough evaluation of a patient with TVL will go a long way in reducing the risk of life-threatening vascular episodes like strokes, myocardial infarction, etc. Awareness should be increased that even though the symptoms are transient in nature but they may herald a serious underlying condition.
