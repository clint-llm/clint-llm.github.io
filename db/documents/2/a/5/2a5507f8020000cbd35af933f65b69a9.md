In non-Asian countries, Budd-Chiari syndrome is usually diagnosed in the third or fourth decade of life, predominantly in females. It is most commonly due to hepatic vein blockage. In Asian countries, it is more common in males, and the most common cause is inferior vena cava blockage or a combination of inferior vena cava and hepatic vein blockage.
