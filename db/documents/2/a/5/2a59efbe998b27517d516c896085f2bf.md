An early consideration should be the consultation of advanced pediatric care or pediatric palliative care specialists. Offering palliative care services to all patients with DIPG early in the course of the disease provides support for the immediate and ongoing physical, psychological, and social effects this lethal disease will have on the patient and the family. Combined neuro-oncologic and palliative care support maximize how patients and familiesÂ perform during their treatment and can even help to identify disease-related changes before clinically or radiographically suspected progression.
