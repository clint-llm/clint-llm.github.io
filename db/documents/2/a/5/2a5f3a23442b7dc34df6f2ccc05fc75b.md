Spider veins can be associated with CVI, andÂ other stigmas of CVI, such as varicose veins, venous eczema of the skin, stasis dermatitis, and leg ulcers may be present.

Spider angiomas can also masquerade as spider veins. They are harmless, but they often herald more serious systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid, and liver disease.
