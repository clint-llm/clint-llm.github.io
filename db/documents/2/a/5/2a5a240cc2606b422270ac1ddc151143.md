Treatment of EED is difficult because the disorder follows a chronic and recurrent course.

Dapsone, a sulfonamide antibiotic that impairs neutrophil chemotaxis and function, is the most effective treatment agent, but relapse is common upon discontinuation. It is also ineffective in nodular lesions, due to the fibrosis of the lesions. Other therapies include NSAIDs, niacinamide, tetracyclines, chloroquine, colchicine, and plasmapheresis. Topical and intralesional corticosteroids may be helpful for mild cases, but systemic corticosteroids are rarely indicated.

Antimicrobials, such as tetracyclines, are thought to alter neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis, suppressing neutrophil chemotaxis and random migration in vivo. Niacinamide, an in vitro specific inhibitor of cyclic AMP, acts as a transfer factor needed for the suppression of antigen-induced lymphocyte transformation. It is relatively non-toxic and can be used in the treatment of neutrophil-driven disorders, with fewer side effects than dapsone. Local surgical excision can be beneficial for localized fibrotic nodules of EED. Regardless of treatment, the recurrence rate of EED is high if the underlying triggering factors are not controlled.
