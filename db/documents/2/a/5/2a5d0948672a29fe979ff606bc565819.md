The definition of a wound is damage to the integrity of biological tissue, including skin, mucous membranes, and organ tissues. Various types of trauma can cause these, and it is critical to ensure wounds are cleaned and appropriately dressed to limit the spread of infection and further injury.

- Class 1 wounds are considered to be clean. They are uninfected, no inflammation is present, and are primarily closed. If the draining of these wounds is necessary, a closed draining method is necessary. Additionally, these wounds do not enter respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts.

- Class 2 wounds are considered to be clean-contaminated. These wounds lack unusual contamination. Class 2 wounds enter the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or urinary tracts. However, these wounds have entered these tracts under controlled conditions.

- Class 3 wounds are considered to be contaminated. These are fresh, open wounds that can result from insult to sterile techniques or leakage from the gastrointestinal tract into the wound. Additionally, incisions made that result in acute or lack of purulent inflammation are considered class 3 wounds.

- Class 4 wounds are considered to be dirty-infected. These wounds typically result from improperly cared for traumatic wounds. Class 4 wounds demonstrate devitalized tissue, and they most commonly result from microorganisms present in perforated viscera or the operative field.
