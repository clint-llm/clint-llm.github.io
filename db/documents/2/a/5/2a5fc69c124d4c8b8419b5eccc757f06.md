A somatic mutation describes any alteration at the cellular level in somatic tissues occurring after fertilization. These mutations do not involve the germline and consequently do not pass on to offspring. Somatic mutations are a normal part of aging and occur throughout an organism’s life cycle either spontaneously as a result of errors in DNA repair mechanisms or a direct response to stress. Mutations occurring early in development can cause mosaicism within the gene line, impacting organism development. The impacts of mosaicism on overall health due to mutations depend on the specific gene the mutation affects.

Environmental stressors and errors that occur during cellular replication increase the risk for somatic mutations to occur.

Somatic mutations have received the most study in human carcinogenesis. Various mutations in oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair mechanisms can select for increased growth advantage and tumor survival.
