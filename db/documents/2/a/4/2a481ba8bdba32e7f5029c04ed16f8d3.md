Tetracaine is an amino-ester class local anesthetic. It has been in use for a variety of purposes since the early 1930s, but its most common use today is as a topical ophthalmic anesthetic for short procedures on the surface of the eye, as well as the ears and nose. Spinal anesthesia is also another indication. The World Health Organization (WHO) lists tetracaine as an essential medication and is relatively inexpensive compared to other local anesthetic agents. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tetracaine, so providers can direct patient therapy as indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of tetracaine.
- Summarize the indications for using tetracaine as an anesthetic agent.
- Review any potential adverse events associated with tetracaine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from tetracaine anesthesia.
