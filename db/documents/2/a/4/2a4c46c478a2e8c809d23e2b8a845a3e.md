The etiology of coronary artery ectasia can be enigmatic. Atherosclerosis lays claim to the principal etiologic cause responsible for greater than 50% of cases in adults, while Kawasaki disease is the most common cause in children and young adults.

Rarely coronary artery ectasia can be genetic. Acquired etiologies include atherosclerosis, Kawasaki disease, mycotic or septic emboli, Marfan syndrome, arteritis from polyarteritis nodosa, Takayasu disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Coronary artery ectasia secondary to iatrogenic causes includes secondary to a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stents, directional coronary atherectomy.

**Risk Factors**

Some of the risk factors for coronary ectasia include:

- Hypertension

- Smoking

- Use of illicit drugs like cocaine
