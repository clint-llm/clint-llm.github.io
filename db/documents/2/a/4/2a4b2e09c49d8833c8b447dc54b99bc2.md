There is no specific treatment for cholesterol embolization syndrome. Acute treatment depends on which organ embolization has occurred to, duration of symptoms, and type of emboli. Usually, treatment in acute settings is mostly supportive. When there are no other indications, anticoagulation should be stopped in patients suspected of having CES as it can worsen the condition.

Long term treatment includes identifying the source of the emboli and preventing its further spread and risk modifications. Patients who have clots formed in heart structures are anticoagulated. Patients with atherosclerosis of the larger arteries are usually treated with antiplatelet agents and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) to stabilize the plaques.
