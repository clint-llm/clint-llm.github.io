Hypercapnia is the elevation in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) above 45 mm Hg. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a metabolic product of the many cellular processes within the body to process lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. There are a host of physiological mechanisms present which are responsible for the moderation of CO2 levels. These include the pH buffering system between hydrogen carbonate (HCO3) and CO2. Due to this relationship, hypercapnia leads to acid-base imbalance abnormalities.
