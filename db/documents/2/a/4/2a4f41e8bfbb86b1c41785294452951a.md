Histology varies based upon the source of the primary malignancy. In general, lesions are graded as low, intermediate, or high grade. The grade of the lesion is determined by the degree of cellular atypia, pleomorphism, active mitosis, matrix production, and necrosis. Lower-grade lesions are biologically less aggressive, while higher-grade lesions are more aggressive and are hence prone to further spread and metastasis.
