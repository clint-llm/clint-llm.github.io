Intravenous iron – Iron therapy in intravenous form consists of an iron-hydroxide core encased in a carbohydrate ligand. After administration, these complexes are taken up by macrophages via endocytosis. Once inside macrophages, they can either be expelled into the serum as ferrous iron (Fe2+) or incorporated into ferritin for storage. The iron expelled from the macrophage is quickly oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+) and bound to transferrin for transport to target sites, including the bone marrow for production of hemoglobin and the liver for storage.

Oral iron – Iron administered orally travels to the duodenum, where it is taken up into enterocyte cells along the brush border by the divalent metal-ion transporter 1 (DMT1). From there, it can either be incorporated into ferritin for storage or expelled into the serum by the ferroportin 1 transporter on the basolateral membrane. This transporter is bound to multicopper oxidases that oxidize ferrous iron (Fe2+) into ferric iron (Fe3+) that can bind to transferrin for transport to the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis or to the liver for storage.

Of note, these processes of active absorption can only absorb a set amount of iron at a given time. Iron consumed exceeding these limits is absorbed passively into the blood via the paracellular route.
