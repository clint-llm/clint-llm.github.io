Sinus node dysfunction is a progressive noncurable but manageable disease. In a study that followed 52 patients with sinus node dysfunction presenting with sinus bradycardia associated with a sinoatrial block or sinoatrial arrest, it took an average of 13 years to progress to complete the sinoatrial arrest and an escape rhythm.
