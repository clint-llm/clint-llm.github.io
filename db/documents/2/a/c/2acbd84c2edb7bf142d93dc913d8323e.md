The worldwide incidence of femoral shaft fractures ranges between 10 and 21 per 100,000 per year. Two percent of these fractures are open fractures.

FSFs demonstrate a bimodal distribution. Men are more likely to sustain a fracture between the ages of 15 to 35, while women begin to show a steady increase starting at age 60. Men are more likely to sustain FSFs from automobile accidents or other high-energy mechanisms. Women are more likely to sustain an FSF from ground-level falls. Automobile accidents are more prevalent in the younger population, while ground-level falls are more common in the elderly population, which is attributed to osteoporosis.
