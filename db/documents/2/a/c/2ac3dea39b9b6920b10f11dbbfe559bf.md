**Antiprotozoal Agents**

Antimalarial agents:

- Chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi can be treated with 1000 mg (600 mg base) oral chloroquine phosphate, after which, 500 mg (300 mg base) oral chloroquine phosphate administration follows at 6, 24, and 48 hours.

- P. vivax and P. ovale infections are managed using the regimen for chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum, after which 30 mg base primaquine is administered orally for 14 days.

- Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (uncomplicated infection) is treated using 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine at a dosage of four tablets taken orally, twice daily, for 3 days. Alternatively, atovaquone-proguanil 250 mg/100 mg is administered as four tablets to be taken daily for 3 days. Also, mefloquine 750 mg is administered once, followed by 500 mg in 6 to 12 hours. Alternatively, give 650 mg quinine sulfate taken three times daily with 100 mg doxycycline or 600 mg clindamycin to be taken twice daily for 7 days.

- Severe or complicated P. falciparum infection is treated using intravenous (IV) artesunate 2.4 mg/kg every 12 hours for one day, then once a day for two additional days. Subsequent to this regimen, use doxycycline or clindamycin orally for 7 days, or artemether/lumefantrine, atovaquone/proguanil, or full mefloquine treatment. Another choice of drug is 10 mg/kg IV quinidine gluconate administered over 1 to 2 hours, followed by 0.02 mg/kg/min. Alternatively, 3.2 mg/kg artemether can be administered intramuscularly (IM), then 1.6 mg/kg/d is administered, followed by a 7-day oral course of clindamycin or doxycycline. Another alternative is 20 mg/kg intravenous quinine dihydrochloride then 10 mg/kg every 8 hours. During IV administration of quinine, monitor the patients’ cardiac activity.

Antibabesial agents:

- Clindamycin 600 mg three times daily, and quinine 650 mg are administered orally for 7 days. Oral atovaquone-azithromycin is another option (give with food).

Antiamoebic agents:

- For Dientamoeba fragilis infection, 650 mg iodoquinol is administered 3 times a day for 20 days.

- Asymptomatic intestinal infection due to Entamoeba histolytica is managed using the luminal agent diloxanide furoate 500 mg three times a day for 10 days. (Not approved in the USA).

- 750 mg metronidazole for 10 days alongside luminal agents in the treatment of mild to moderate or severe intestinal infection and extraintestinal infection like hepatic abscesses.

- For hepatic abscesses, 1 mg/kg dihydroemetine or emetine subcutaneously (SC) or IM for 8 to 10 days after which chloroquine dosing follows alongside luminal agents.

- Antigiardial agents: metronidazole 250 mg is administered orally 3 times daily for 5 days or tinidazole 2 g.

Trypanocidal agents:

- Benznidazole or nifurtimox is administered orally in the treatment of Chagas disease.

- Pentamidine is only administered parenterally, by intravenous or intramuscular injection in the treatment of West African or East African trypanosomiasis.

- Eflornithine, suramin, and melarsoprol are all administered parenterally via intravenous injection.

Antileishmanial agents:

- 20 mg/kg/d sodium stibogluconate is administered via intraventricular or intramuscular route for 28 days to treat visceral leishmaniasis and 20 days in cutaneous leishmaniasis. (Only available in the USA from the CDC or Military Bases). Alternatively, 2 to 4 mg/kg IM pentamidine can be administered daily for 15 days for visceral leishmaniasis.

Anti-toxoplasma agents:

- In immunocompromised patients or patients with reactivation infection, 200 mg oral pyrimethamine gets administered once, and the weight of the patient determines subsequent doses. Patients under 60 kg take 50 mg oral pyrimethamine daily with sulfadiazine 1000 mg orally every 6 hours and leucovorin 10 to 25 mg orally daily. Patients over 60 kg are given 75 mg pyrimethamine orally daily with sulfadiazine 1500 mg and leucovorin 10 to 25 mg orally, daily for up to 6 weeks.

- Alternatively, 600 mg oral or intravenous clindamycin may be given with pyrimethamine and leucovorin four times daily. Atovaquone 1500 mg and sulfadiazine may be administered twice daily.

- For secondary prophylaxis, daily pyrimethamine 25 to 50 mg orally, with oral sulfadiazine totaling 2000 to 4000 mg, administered 2 to 4 times daily and leucovorin 10 to 25 mg for chronic maintenance.
