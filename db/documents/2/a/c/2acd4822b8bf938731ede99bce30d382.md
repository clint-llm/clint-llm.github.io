The diagnosis of NETs depends on a thorough history, clinical examination, hormone levels, imaging, and histological confirmation. Carcinoid syndrome should be diagnosed initially using the measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which is the metabolite of serotonin, or the plasma level of 5-HIAA,

The tumor extent and location can be determined using imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using new techniques and contrast media that increase sensitivity and specificity of detecting various NETs.
