Autoimmune pancreatitis is an uncommon cause of chronic and recurrent pancreatitis and is likely an under-diagnosed condition. It is reported to account for up to 2% of all cases of chronic pancreatitis, with a prevalence of less than 1 per 100,000 population. Most of the initial reports in the literature are from Asian countries, including Japan, where the prevalence is speculated to be higher; however, this may partly have been because of increased recognition.

Most of the epidemiological data about AIP has been based on estimates from small case series and study groups. It has been seen more in males with a ratio of 3:1, and the age of onset is reported to be greater than 45 years.
