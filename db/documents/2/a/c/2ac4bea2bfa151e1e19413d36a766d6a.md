Acne: While the two diseases share papules and pustules, the presence of comedones is unique to acne and helps distinguish the two.

Seborrheic dermatitis presents with erythema and greasy scaling on the scalp and face. It tends to be distributed more in the nasolabial folds and hair-bearing areas of the face. Since the two conditions are common, many patients will present with both seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. Treatment of one may unmask the other.

Keratosis pilaris rubra typically affects adolescent patients with tiny follicular papules of the lateral cheeks and neck on erythematous patches.

Flushing: Flushing in rosacea is usually limited to the face. Flushing that involves other areas warrants further attention.

Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: The malar rash of lupus can appear similar to rosacea, but it usually spares the nasolabial folds and lacks papulopustules.

Drug-induced acneiform eruption: Onset is usually abrupt and temporally related to medication intake. Lesions are typically monomorphic (all papules or pustules in the same stage) and involve the trunk.
