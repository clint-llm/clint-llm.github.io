Allergic reactions: Although there have been reports of cardiovascular side effects with the use of non-depolarizing neuromuscular agents like mivacurium and atracurium, rocuronium has been shown to be very cardiac stable and has no effects on heart rate or blood pressure. Rocuronium has been implicated in multiple IgE-induced anaphylaxes in the perioperative setting, and one paper cites the incidence of around 1 in 2500 patients.

Residual neuromuscular weakness: Residual neuromuscular blockade is a condition where the effects of the neuromuscular blocks do not completely reverse. The adverse effects of the residual neuromuscular blockade have been proven beyond doubt to increase postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy: Prolonged infusion of neuromuscular blockers can prolong skeletal muscle weakness due to the myopathy induced by critical illness in a subset of patients on steroids or who have multiple organ failure. It is advised to keep theÂ duration of paralysis to less than 48 hrs to prevent this complication.
