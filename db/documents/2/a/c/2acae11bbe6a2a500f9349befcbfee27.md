Lab workup included:

- Blood culture

- Complete blood count

- Comprehensive metabolic profile

- Inflammatory markers (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein [CRP])

- Ebstein Barr panel/monospot

- Streptococcal throat swab

Laboratory testing including HIV, EBV, TB, blood, urine, and throat cultures was all negative.

ESR and CRP were elevated at 72 and 11.7. Blood count was unremarkable and metabolic panel was notable for hypokalemia to 3.1.

Diagnostic imaging included:

- Chest x-ray

- Echocardiography (ECHO)

- Electrocardiogram

- Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Arteriogram (MRI/MRA)

- Ultrasound of the neck and soft tissue

Ultrasound of neck showed wall thickening of the left common carotid artery with possible involvement of the left internal carotid artery.

The ECHO was notable for a bicuspid aortic valve, as well as a mildly dilated left ventricle with mildly decreased left ventricular function.

MRI/MRA revealed large vessel vasculitis involving the left external carotid artery, left renal artery, superior mesenteric artery, and left subclavian artery.
