Sickle cell disease has no cure and is associated with life-threatening complications. Thus, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a hematologist, surgeon, pulmonologist, orthopedic surgeon, internist, dentist, nurse practitioner, and pharmacist. The key is patient education. By maintaining good health, getting vaccinated, and avoiding triggers, some patients can lead a decent quality of life. The outcomes for most patients are guarded, and sickle cell crises often require readmissions to the hospital. Many of these patients have chronic non-healing wounds, and hence a wound care nurse must be consulted. Overall, patients with sickle cell disease have a much shorter life span compared to the healthy population.
