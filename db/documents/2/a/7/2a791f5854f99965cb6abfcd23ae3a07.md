Holcomb et al. showed that the adoption of TCCC across the United States military services substantially improved soldier fatality rates in 2006. A study of fatality rates spanning from 1941 to 2005 showed improved from 19.1% during World War II, 15.8% during the Vietnam War, down to an all-time low of 9.4% during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.

In 2012, Eastridge et al. established the primary causes of death on the battlefield as hemorrhage, 91%; airway obstruction, 7.9%; and tension pneumothorax, 1.1%. Massive hemorrhage was found to include extremity wounds, 13.5%; junctional wounds, 19.2%; and truncal wounds, 67.3%. Because of this, the typical trauma primary survey has been rearranged from airway, breathing, circulation, and disability to follow the MARCH mnemonic of massive hemorrhage, airway, respiration, circulation, and hypothermia.
