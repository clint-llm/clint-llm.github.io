The pelvic structures are richly innervated by large nervous plexuses in the region. The pelvic splanchnic nerves supply the parasympathetic innervation of pelvic structures, while the sympathetic innervation of pelvic structures is served by the hypogastric plexus. The sympathetic innervation of the pelvic organs arises from the superior hypogastric plexus as well as the inferior hypogastric plexus. However, the inferior hypogastric plexus carries both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Parasympathetic output causes gastrointestinal peristalsis, contraction of muscles for defecation and urination, as well as erectile function. The sympathetic output is largely antagonistic to parasympathetic output in the pelvis but is also responsible for muscle contraction during orgasm.

Somatomotor and somatosensory innervation arise from two major plexuses, the sacral and coccygeal plexuses. The sacral plexus arises from L4 to S4 spinal nerves and includes the longest nerve in the body, the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve is composed of nervous fibers arising from the L4 to S3 nerve roots and innervates the entire skin and most of the leg and foot muscles. The sacral plexus also gives rise to the pudendal nerve, superior and inferior gluteal nerves, and the nerves to the quadratus femoris, piriformis, and obturator internus. Pelvic parasympathetic innervation arises from the pelvic splanchnic nerves served by the S2 to S4 spinal roots. The coccygeal plexus arises from S4, S5, and coccygeal nerves and are responsible for the innervation of the coccygeus and levator ani muscles of the pelvic floor.

The somatic innervation of the pelvic joints varies by region. The ventral and dorsal rami of the L5 and S1 spinal nerves supply the lumbosacral joint. The sacroiliac joint has variation in its innervation, but it is typically served by the ventral rami of L4 and L5 spinal nerves, the dorsal rami of L5-S2 spinal nerves, and the superior gluteal nerve. The sacrococcygeal joint is innervated by S4 and Co1 spinal nerves. The innervation of the public symphysis appears to be highly variable, with numerous reports of nervous contributions from the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, and pudendal nerves.
