The steps for performing plasmapheresis using centrifuge-based equipment are as follows:

- Initially, a waste of around 3-5 mL blood from the central venous catheter is discarded.

- After drawing baseline samples for complete hemogram, calcium, and fibrinogen, it is flushed with 5-10 mL of heparinized saline.

- The double lumen catheter is now connected to the machine tubing to start the priming procedure.

- The machine calculates total body volume (TBV), and the effective plasma volume (which equals TBV × (1 – hematocrit)) of the patient based on the operator entered height and weight.

- The replacement product to be used and its desired volume (40 - 60 mL/kg) is decided by the clinician, and entered into the machine, based on which it calculates the centrifuge speed.

- The separated plasma is discarded by the machine, and the RBCs are returned back to the patient along with the replacement fluid.

- Finally, post-procedure, tubings are connected to heparinized saline, and reinfusion is initiated.

- Post-plasmapheresis blood for fibrinogen and calcium is sent again, and lumens of central venous catheters are flushed.
