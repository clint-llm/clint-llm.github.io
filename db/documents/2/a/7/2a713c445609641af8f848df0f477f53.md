Patient education regarding the harmful effects of overusing vitamin D supplements is essential. To ensure effective treatment of underlying medical conditions, it is crucial to educate patients, particularly those on high doses of vitamin D, about the importance of adhering to their prescribed regimen. In addition, patients should be informed about the significance of follow-up appointments while taking high-dose vitamin D supplements to mitigate the risk of vitamin D toxicity. In certain situations, laboratory tests to assess calcium and vitamin D levels can be beneficial for monitoring purposes.
