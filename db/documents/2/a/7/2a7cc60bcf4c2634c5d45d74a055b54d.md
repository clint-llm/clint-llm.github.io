There is a wide array of mechanisms that cause prelabor rupture of membranes. It can result from a physiologic weakening of the membranes combined with the forces caused by uterine contractions. Intramniotic infection is commonly associated with PPROM. The major risk factors for PPROM include a history of PPROM, short cervical length, second or third trimester vaginal bleeding, uterine overdistension, nutritional deficiencies of copper and ascorbic acid, connective tissue disorders, low body mass index, low socioeconomic status, cigarette smoking, and illicit drug use. Despite a variety of etiologies, often there is no obvious cause that is identified in a patient who presents with PROM.
