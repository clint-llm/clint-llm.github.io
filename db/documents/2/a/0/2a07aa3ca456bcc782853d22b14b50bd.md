The following factors need to be considered in the preoperative evaluation:

Refraction: Both manifest and cycloplegic refraction should be performed. The best-corrected visual acuity in the undilated and cycloplegic state (after performing cycloplegia with homatropine or tropicamide) should be recorded.

Anterior chamber depth (ACD): Most phakic IOLs require ACD of at least 3 mm.

Anterior chamber angle and gonioscopy: Gonioscopy should be performed preoperatively to identify narrow or abnormal angles, which may lead to further postoperative narrowing and secondary glaucoma after phakic IOL implantation. The accepted range of iridocorneal angle aperture for phakic IOL implantation is more than or equal to 30 degrees, which corresponds to Shaffer grade 3 and 4 or Scheie grade 0 and 1.

Corneal topography should be performed as is done in all refractive workups.

Specular microscopy: Including specular microscopic measurement of endothelial cell count, cell shape (polymorphism), and variation in cell size (polymegathism). Phakic IOL implantation leads to endothelial cell loss in the postoperative period, more so for the anterior chamber IOLs (ACIOLs) and so a healthy preoperative endothelium with a cell count of at least 2300 per millimeter square should be ensured.

Sulcus to sulcus (STS) measurements: This is essential for sizing of the phakic IOL and measurement of lens vault (distance between the posterior surface of the IOL and the anterior lens capsule) in case of a phakic posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL). An approximate calculation of the size of the IOL depending on the vault is made using the white to white (WTW) measurement by adding 0.5 mm to the measured value in myopes and subtracting 0.5 mm in hyperopes. WTW may be measured using calipers, scanning slit topography, digital caliper, Scheimpflug-based devices, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), or digital ultrasounds.

Ideal vault size for phakic posterior chamber IOLs is 1 plus or minus 0.5 of the corneal thickness, which is in the range of 250 to 750 microns.

IOL power calculation: Biometry, keratometry, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, preoperative refraction need to be accurately measured, and the appropriate formula applied. Van der Hejde nomogram may be used for IOL power calculation.

Peripheral retinal examination and laser of retinal breaks are important to prevent complications of retinal detachments in the postoperative period, especially as pupil dilation remains limited with anterior chamber IOLs.
