Pneumonectomy is a complicated procedure associated with high morbidity and mortality. Most of the patients requiring pneumonectomy have either chronic lung disease with a very poor pulmonary serve or an advanced malignancy, which makes their management very challenging. Proper patient selection is of great importance. This starts with imaging studies, PFTs, and assessment of patients' functional capacity, as mentioned previously. Other conservative treatment modalities should always be sought in very sick patients who are not fit for this high-risk procedure.

The patient's condition should be properly optimized before proceeding to surgery, such as control of chronic medical problems like diabetes and hypertension, treatment of lung infections, and chemotherapy for advanced malignancy. Proper preoperative preparation is associated with improved outcome and decreased morbidity and mortality.

An integrated approach, including all healthcare team members involved in the care of these patients, is essential for the best possible outcome.
