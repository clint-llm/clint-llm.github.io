Otic ganglion, like other parasympathetic ganglia within the head, is derived from Schwann cell precursors. These precursors migrate via preganglionic axons and differentiate into peripheral neurons when they reach the site of the adult ganglionic structure into which they develop.

It has recently come to light that the otic ganglion and pterygopalatine ganglia are a single and undifferentiated cell mass till the 16th week of gestation and later get separated by growing ala temporalis. They then reconnect by secondarily-formed communicating branch, the nervus sphenopidalis.
