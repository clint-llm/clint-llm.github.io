The digastrics are a pair of muscles individually made up of two distinct muscle bellies: the anterior and posterior digastrics. They derive embryonically from the first and second pharyngeal arches. Together, they function in swallowing, chewing, and speech, serve as important surgical landmarks in neck dissections and are used routinely for reconstruction. Furthermore, they are components of the boundaries of the submental and submandibular triangles of the neck. There are numerous anatomical variants of the digastrics which can be misleading on MRI or CT. Careful consideration of theseÂ variations is critical in clinical assessment and surgical planning.
