Balance dysfunction is commonly seen in individuals above the age of 65. Individuals that have had a stroke greatly benefit from having their balance performance tested.

This test is indicated in the elderly, in neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson disease, peripheral neuropathies, and other conditions that may affect gait, such as lower extremity amputees.

The Berg Balance Scale has been shown to have both high intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Intra-rater reliability is when the same person who is administering the test can achieve the same results. Inter-rater reliability is when the test can be performed by different persons and achieve the same results.

A systematic review conducted by Downs evaluated the Berg Balance Scale for individuals with various neurological conditions, including acute stroke, recent stroke, multiple sclerosis, cognitively impaired patients, and Parkinson disease patients, in different settings such as acute inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient rehabilitation, outpatient clinic, and home visits. The intra-rater relative reliability was found to be 0.98, with a 95% conference interval (CI).
