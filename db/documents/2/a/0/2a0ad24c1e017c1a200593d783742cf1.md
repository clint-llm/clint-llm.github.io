The diagnosis of MNTI requires a very high index of suspicion. The diagnosis of MNTI must be considered in any rapid-growing mass, especially in the head and neck region. Patients with MNTI are best managed by an interprofessional team approach. Follow-up with the patient is important to detect any recurrence at the early stages of the disease and avoid delaying the diagnosis and its complications.
