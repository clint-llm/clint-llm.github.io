Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a neurological complication of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. A deficiency of vitamin B12 can occur as a result of nutritional deficiency, reduced absorption due to altered gastrointestinal anatomy or function, or due to the intake of certain drugs. Subacute combined degeneration is characterized by degeneration of the dorsal columns and the lateral columns of the spinal cord due to demyelination. It commonly presents with sensory deficits, paresthesia, weakness, ataxia, and gait disturbance. In severe untreated cases, it can lead to spasticity and paraplegia. It is crucial to promptly identify and treat vitamin B12 deficiency to prevent the development of this serious neurological complication.
