**Plain Radiographs**

Initial assessment of the shoulder should begin with plain radiographs. The views to obtain include a true AP of the scapula (Grashey), internal and external rotation views, scapular Y, and an axillary view.

**Advanced Imaging**

Advanced imaging consists of an MRI to better evaluate soft tissue pathology. Contrast enhancement [magnetic resonance arthrogram (MRA)] is the most sensitive diagnostic test for detecting posterior labral and capsular lesions.

- Type I**: i**ncomplete detachment

- Type II: incomplete and concealed avulsion (Kim lesion)

- Type III: chondrolabral erosion

- Type IV: flap tear

Computed tomography (CT) will help to delineate bony morphology better, especially when pathology is noted on plain radiographs. CT scans are indicated when that are concerns forÂ glenoid retroversion, fractures, or hypoplasia, as well as reverse Hill-Sachs lesions. Recognition of these bony abnormalities is important as they may have implications in treatment.
