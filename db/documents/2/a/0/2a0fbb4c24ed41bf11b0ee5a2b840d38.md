Simvastatin is an oral HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet, exercise, weight loss, and possibly other medications as part of an overall lipid-lowering and cardiovascular health regimen. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of lovastatin, the first FDA-approved statin. Simvastatin helps lower cholesterol production and reduce dyslipidemia-associated complications. High concentrations of LDL cholesterol can lead to artery damage, potentially leading to cardiac complications and stroke.
