Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are cell-surface receptors clinically taken advantage of in the management of bronchospasm as in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Medications targeting these receptors are either agonistic or antagonistic. Agonistic drugs used in the stimulation of the receptors are either selective to the beta-2 subtype or nonselective, which stimulates all beta subtypes, including beta-2, while there are no selective beta-2 antagonists. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action of beta-2 receptors, the indications, administration routes, adverse effects, monitoring, contraindications, and some instructions related to the use of medications aiming at the receptors, mainly on patients with bronchospastic diseases.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different types of medications that exert their effects on beta-2 adrenergic receptors.
- Describe the adverse effects associated with beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists.
- Review the toxicity of beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients receiving targeting beta-2 receptors.
