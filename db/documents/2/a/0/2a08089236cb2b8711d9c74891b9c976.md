The differential diagnosis of WMS includes Von Hippel Lindau syndrome, vasoproliferative tumors (VPT), Sturge Weber syndrome, and retinal cavernous hemangioma.

Von Hippel-Lindau disease is associated with retinal capillary hemangioma (RCH), cerebral aneurysm, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and thus, should be considered as a differential diagnosis to decrease the risk of complications including the risk of death. Clinically RCH appears as a round, circumscribed, orange to a red retinal lesion in the peripapillary or peripheral location. The RCH is associated with a prominent feeder vessel.

Vasoproliferative tumor is characterized by retinal nodules composed of glial cells interlaced with a fine capillary network and dilated hyalinised blood vessels.

Sturge-Weber syndrome should be considered if there are port-wine stains (facial angioma) or ipsilateral juvenile or congenital open-angle glaucoma. Hemangiomas of the meninges are found in Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Retinal cavernous hemangioma appears as a dark grape-like cluster of venous intraretinal aneurysms. The characteristic FFA finding is hypofluorescence till the late phase with a slow nonleaking filling of the aneurysms.
