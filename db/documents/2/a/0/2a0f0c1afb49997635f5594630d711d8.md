Many surveillance and clinical studies continue to take place to better comprehend the safety, immunogenicity, and vaccine adverse effects.

According to these trials and international reporting systems like the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration, no significant adverse reactions have been reported. Most adverse events were typically mild and related to injection site administration, like erythema, swelling, and tenderness. Post-vaccination headache, dizziness, and fever have also been reported but less frequently. Syncope has also been reported, especially in adolescents.

In some studies, the administration of multiple vaccine doses didn't increase reactogenicity, but the incidence of fever (not the grade of fever itself) was higher when the vaccine was given concomitantly with another vaccine.

Other studies demonstrate a temporal association between the vaccine administration and the occurrence of Bell palsy. However, there needs to be more clinical research to understand whether this is a coincidental finding secondary to, due to co-administered vaccination or previous medical history predisposing to Bell palsy.
