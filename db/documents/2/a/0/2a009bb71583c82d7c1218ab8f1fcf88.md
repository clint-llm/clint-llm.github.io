The long-term outcome for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder depends on one's ability to cope up with stress, substance abuse, the nature of social support, and the ability to stay compliant with the treatment plan as devised individually. About 30% of people eventually recover, and another 40% get better with the treatment, although less-intense symptoms may remain. A few of the patients receive the support to make successful adjustments and develop the coping methods to overcome the symptoms of PTSD even without formal treatment. Comorbidities with PTSD worsen the health status of individuals.
