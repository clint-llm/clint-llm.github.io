Operations involving the tracheobronchial tree require an intimate understanding of normal anatomy, common and uncommon variants, and surrounding anatomical structures. The surgeon must be prepared to secure the patientâ€™s airway if complications arise.

When performing a tracheostomy, the cannula is usually inserted between the second and third tracheal rings. The tracheostomy should not be made in the first ring as it risks subglottic stenosis. Performing a tracheostomy below the third tracheal rings increases the risks of a tracheoinnominate artery fistula. In patients with a tracheostomy and a rigid feeding tube down the esophagus, there is always a danger of forming a tracheoesophageal fistula. One serious complication of this procedure is airway fire, which occurs if highly oxygenated air present in the trachea becomes exposed to the electrocautery. Because of this possible complication, inspired oxygen should remain below 30%, and a scalpel should be used to enter the trachea.
