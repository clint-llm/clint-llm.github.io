The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and blood vessels.

- Coronary artery disease (CAD): Sometimes referred to as Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), results from decreased myocardial perfusion that causes angina, myocardial infarction (MI), and/or heart failure. It accounts for one-third to one-half of the cases of CVD.

- Cerebrovascular disease (CVD): Including stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA)

- Peripheral artery disease (PAD): Particularly arterial disease involving the limbs that may result in claudication

- Aortic atherosclerosis: Including thoracic and abdominal aneurysms
