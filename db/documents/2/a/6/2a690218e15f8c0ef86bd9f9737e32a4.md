White lesions discovered upon routine oral examination can range from benign processes to invasive malignancies. It is prudent for the clinician to collect the patientâ€™s complete medical history, to include any potential carcinogenic habits they may have, i.e., smoking, to formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis. The clinical examination is among the most crucial aspects of patient care, emphasizing appropriate and complete documentation of findings. This activity reviews the most found benign chronic white lesions of the oral mucosa and their etiologies and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating, managing, and potentially treating patients with these described conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of common benign chronic white lesions found on the oral mucosa.
- Review the potential etiologies of the most common benign chronic white lesions found on the oral mucosa.
- Identify ways to differentiate the most common benign chronic white lesions from one another and formulate appropriate differential diagnoses.
- Summarize the appropriate treatment modalities for the most common benign chronic white lesions found on the oral mucosa.
