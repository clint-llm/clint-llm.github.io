Repetitive friction between the greater trochanter and iliotibial band syndrome (ITB) causes microtrauma in the greater trochanter at the level of insertion with the gluteal tendons. Friction leads to local inflammation, degeneration of the tendons, and increased tension on the ITB. It is believed that chronic gluteal tendinopathy arises from the disorganization of the collagen bundles, hypercellularity, increased proteoglycan synthesis, and neovascularization.

Studies have shown that there is a reduction in type 1 collagen and increased production of type 3 collagen in the gluteal tendons. This combination of collagen leads to poor fiber cross-links with subsequent deterioration in the mechanical strength of the tendons.
