The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released when a neural signal propagates and excites or activates a cellular membrane. Consequently, the ACh receptor undergoes a conformational change, and the membrane releases calcium ions. These calcium ions play a role in exciting the fibers of nerves and muscles by triggering an additional change in phospholipids. Essentially, the downstream effect of a signal initiated with ACh results in the amplification and propagation of cellular signaling.
