The most common methods for evaluation of keloid scars include the use of a scoring scale (e.g., Vancouver Scar scale) for subjective evaluation and 2-dimensional photography for more objective measures.Â Less commonly used evaluation techniques include biochemical properties, ultrasound, laser-based techniques, and biopsy.
