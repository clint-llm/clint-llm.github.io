Solid pseudopapillary pancreatic neoplasms characteristically have a long asymptomatic period before the development of any signs or symptoms. Majority of the times, due to the indolent nature of these tumors, these are incidentally diagnosed when the patients undergo screening with imaging studies for other medical reasons. Clinical presentation is non-specific and includesÂ vague abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, or nausea. These tumors commonly arise in the tail of pancreas, therefore, rarely present with obstructive symptoms such as jaundice or gastric outlet obstruction. Endocrine symptoms rarely present with these neoplasms. Unlike malignant tumors, weight loss and fatigue are rare. It is most often a benign neoplasm. However, 10% to 15% of the cases are malignant. The liver was reported to be a common site of metastasis, while it could also spread distantly to other organs as well.
