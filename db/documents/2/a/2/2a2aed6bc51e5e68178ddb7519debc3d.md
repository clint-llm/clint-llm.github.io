Pearls

- The clinical course of Hartnup disease is intermittent with episodes of exacerbating cutaneous and neurological symptoms.

- The known factors to exaggerate the symptoms are sunlight, nutritional deficiency, and hot weather, but patients can present clinically even in the absence of any of the exacerbating factors.

- The exact causative factor for neurological symptoms remains unestablished yet; there is a theory that indolic compounds formed in the gut from the degradation of excess tryptophan by colonic bacteria are responsible for neurological symptoms.

- Patients presenting with pellagra like skin eruptions and neurological symptoms like ataxia, tremors, and mood disorders should be initiated with high oral niacin dose, and urine should be checked for neutral amino acids.

- There has been a case report which described a patient on a high tryptophan diet with normal niacin level presenting with photosensitive skin eruptions and neurological symptoms in summers.

- Patients are monitored regularly for long-term to assess the progression of neurological symptoms.
