From a "countermeasure" perspective, the avoidance, capture, and mitigation of error represent three patient safety lines of defense.  Simulation is most effective when there is adequate task alignment - the reproduction of required skills allows for the successful completion of the tasks.

From an adverse event perspective, multiple different applications of simulation have been suggested to aid in the investigation and mitigation process, including:

- Using the high-fidelity simulation of key activities, like an end-to-end major incident investigation, for emergency investigator training

- Bringing relevant participants together from multiple organizations for testing, reversing, and improving coordinated investigation to improve investigative infrastructure

- Exploring contributory factors, developing, and testing solutions through the simulated recreation of conditions/events underlying serious safety incidents.

- Probing systems vicariously to uncover latent safety issues while applying safety 1 and/or safety 2 principles
