In adults, fluvastatin is indicated for hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia to decrease the amount of total cholesterol in the blood. Specifically, this therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increases high-density lipoproteins. When combined with a low-fat diet, a weight-loss program, and exercise, fluvastatin may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people who have heart disease or are at risk of developing heart disease. This activity outlines the indications, dosing, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fluvastatin and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in directing patient therapy to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of fluvastatin.
- Review the indications for initiating therapy with fluvastatin.
- Outline the contraindications to fluvastatin.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with fluvastatin.
