Studies have suggested that early recognition and management play a key role in the prognosis of patients with oliguria; hence close monitoring should be done in patients with urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour for a period of two consecutive hours.

Radiographic agents used for various diagnostic imaging studies can precipitate oliguria and acute renal failure, particularly due to their vasoconstrictive effect of renal blood circulation. In a catheterized patient presenting with oliguria, catheter dysfunction should be ruled out.

Special care should be taken to avoid any potential nephrotoxic drugs to a patient with oliguria. These drugs include but are not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aminoglycosides, radiographic contrast agents, general anesthetics, angiotensin-convertingâ€“enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, amphotericin B, and numerous chemotherapeutic drugs.
