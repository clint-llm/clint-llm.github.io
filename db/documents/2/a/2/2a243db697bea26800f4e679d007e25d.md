Shields et al. introduced the staging of Coats disease in 2000, which is most widely used:

- Stage 1 is characterized by retinal telangiectasia

- Stage 2 has telangiectasia and intraretinal exudation 

- Stage 2A: extrafoveal exudation 
- Stage 2B: foveal involvement

- Stage 3 denotes exudative retinal detachment

- 3A is a subtotal detachment

- 3A1: extrafoveal
- 3A2: foveal involvement


- 3B is a total retinal detachment

- Stage 4 has a total retinal detachment plus increased intraocular pressure

- Stage 5 is an endstage disease, occasionally with phthisis bulbi
