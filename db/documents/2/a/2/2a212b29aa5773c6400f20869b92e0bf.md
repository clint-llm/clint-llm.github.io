After obtaining consent for the procedure or deeming it an emergency, the first step in preparing a patient for arterial cannulation is to place the area chosen for insertion in the appropriate position. For a radial artery cannulation, placing the hand palmer side-up with the wrist flexed approximately 45 degrees and supported by a gauze roll will allow for maximum access to the artery. Hyperflexing the wrist will potentially compress the artery thus making cannulation difficult or unsuccessful. It is recommended a Doppler be performed before radial artery cannulation. When accessing the femoral artery, it is suggested that the patient is in the supine position with the hip of the chosen side for cannulation slightly externally rotated. The artery should be palpable in the space between the pubic tubercle and the anterior superior iliac spine.
