CSF leak is a common condition due to traumatic and non-traumatic etiologies requiring an integrated multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, nurse practitioner, and laboratory technician. Many of these patients have associated trauma and require intensive care therapy and rehabilitative services. CSF leaks associated with specific underlying comorbidities like obesity need tailored specialty referrals like dieticians for dietary and lifestyle modifications.
