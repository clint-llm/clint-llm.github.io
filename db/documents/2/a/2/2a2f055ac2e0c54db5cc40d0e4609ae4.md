The rectal exam is an oft-overlooked part of the physical exam. For those practitioners who understand how to interpret it, a lot of information can is obtainable from this simple exam. Anecdotally, we have all heard during our training from experienced physicians about the utility of the rectal exam, and how it should be a part of the physical exam on every patient. And while it is true thatÂ in the era of the focused physical exam the rectal exam is no longer performed on every patient, it still has many utilities and is definitely underutilized. It is a valuable diagnostic process in cases including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, hemorrhoids, constipation, trauma, and neurological disorders.
