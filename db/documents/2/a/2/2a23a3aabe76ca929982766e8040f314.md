Treatment of penile fractures should be prompt operative repair. After demonstrating that the patient is an acceptable surgical candidate, the operator should plan for the identification of the repair of the tunica rupture. Circumcising or linear incision is acceptable for the opening of the skin. After opening the skin, the hematoma should be evacuated. Hematoma evacuation should allow for direct visualization of tunica defects. An absorbable suture is then used to repair the tunica defect. The type of suture and suture material is entirely user dependant. Buck's fascia should also undergo repair, and finally, skin closure achieved with non-absorbable suture.

This surgical repair should be prompt. Studies have demonstrated a significant change in functional outcomes with the delayed repair of penile fractures. One study showed that a delay of approximately 8 hours resulted in substantial increases in erectile dysfunction postoperatively.
