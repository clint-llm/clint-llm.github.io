HVLA has the most contraindications of all OMT techniques. The following are contraindications for HVLA techniques, including its application to the ribs:

- Anticoagulant therapy (relative contraindication)

- Connective tissue disease

- Fracture

- Malignancy (if local metastasis)

- Osteoporosis

- Patient uncooperative

- Severe rheumatoid arthritis

- Surgery (if local)

Indirect OMT techniques such as muscle energy, myofascial release, rib raising, and soft tissue techniques are a fewÂ alternative options to consider when HVLA is contraindicated. For example, in a recent study by Chin et al., the rib raising technique was used in 87 hospitalized non-intensive care unit patients admitted for respiratory issues, and the procedure was well tolerated.
