A traditional method to detect elevated ketones is to smell the patient's breath. Acetone and the other ketone bodies have a distinct fruit-like smell that is detectable by a clinician. AÂ urine dipstick test can be used to measure the presence of ketone bodies qualitatively. A nitroprusside stain detects acetone and acetoacetate in the urine. The urine test utilizes a range of 0 to +4 where zero is undetectable, and +4 stands for a high amount detected. Newer quantitative lab studies have recently become available that measure the 3HB in the serum.
