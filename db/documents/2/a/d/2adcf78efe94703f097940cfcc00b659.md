- Neurologic sequelae are the most common extra-cardiac complications in infectious endocarditis, which has been consistent over the past two decades. Neurologic complications present in twenty-five up to forty percent of infective endocarditis.

- Approximately 80% of NBTE attributed to advanced underlying malignancy, whereas systemic lupus erythematosus is the second most common cause. Of note, up to half of the NBTE patients develop systemic emboli, which is the most common clinical manifestation rather than cardiac complications.
