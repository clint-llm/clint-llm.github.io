Spinal stenosis can be caused by congenital or acquired etiologies. Only 9% of the cases result from congenital etiologies. Some common congenital causes include achondroplasia, shortened pedicles, osteopetrosis, apical vertebral wedging, spinal dysraphism, segmentation failure early vertebral arch ossification, thoracolumbar kyphosis, morquio syndrome, and osseous exostosis.

Acquired stenosis occurs primarily from trauma, degenerative changes, iatrogenic causes, and systemic processes. Trauma usually affects the vertebral canal acutely with a mechanical force. Degenerative changes occur when there is a narrowing of the central canal and lateral recess from posterior disk herniation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and spondylolisthesis. Laminectomy, fusion, and discectomy surgeries can cause iatrogenic spinal stenosis.
