While the obstetrician manages routine pregnancy, complex cases that involve placental abnormalities are usually managed by an interprofessional team that includes the intensivist, hematologists, labor and delivery nurses, and anesthesiologists. Most placental abnormalities come to light just before or during delivery. With the advent of ultrasound, most serious placental abnormalities are identified before the delivery takes place. One of the most serious morbidities with placental abnormalities is the potential for hemorrhage; hence, a team approach is necessary to ensure the mother's and the infant's safety.
