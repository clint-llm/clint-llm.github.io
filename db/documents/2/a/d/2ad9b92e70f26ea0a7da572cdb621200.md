During preparation, to place an intracoronary stent, a 6F or larger guiding catheter must be utilized to engage the coronary ostia. Anticoagulation in the form of heparin, enoxaparin, or bivalirudin may be given to obtain an anticoagulation time greater than 250 seconds. Next, a coronary wire is utilized to provide a rail to be able to deliver balloons and stents to the lesions being treated. Once at the appropriate site in the vessel the stent delivery balloon is insufflated to high atmospheric pressures via an insufflator device that is manually inflated by the technician or the head operator.
