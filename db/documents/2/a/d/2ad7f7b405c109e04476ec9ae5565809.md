The diagnosis and management of osteoporosis are best achieved with an interprofessional team that consists of a rheumatologist and/or endocrinologist, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, dietitian, and radiologist. Patients at risk should be screened as appropriate to identify those who warrant further investigation and/or treatment to prevent fractures and consequent morbidity and mortality. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner ideally should educate the patients on lifestyle interventions that include discontinuing tobacco, excessive alcohol, promoting a healthy lifestyle, including calcium and vitamin D supplementation if adequate, lean protein ingestion, and participation in physical activity. For males treated with bisphosphonates, regular monitoring is mandatory as these drugs have potential adverse effects, also to ensure adequate response and compliance.
