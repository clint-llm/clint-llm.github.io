Cutaneous cylindromas represent a benign adnexal neoplasm that is quite rare, describing a dual lineage proliferation of cells within the dermis. When these cell populations are cut in cross-section, they have a round morphology that is likened to cylinders, hence the name. Cylindromas are a slow-growing, usually small, benign entity, though there have been rare cases of malignant transformation and even metastases reported. They are usually located on the scalp or face and occur nine times more frequently in females as males. When multiple cutaneous cylindromas occur on the scalp, they can grow together and resemble a hat or turban, giving rise to the previously more common term "turban tumor." This activity reviews the workup of cylindroma and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.
