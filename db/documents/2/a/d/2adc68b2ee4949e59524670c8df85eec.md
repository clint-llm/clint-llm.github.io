Most adductor strains can be managed without consulting an orthopedic or sports medicine clinician. Patients will generallyÂ respond well to conservative treatments, physical therapy, and a graded return to athletics. In cases that do not recover quickly, referral to a specialist may be indicated to explore other treatment modalities.

Care is best supported by an interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and physical or occupational therapists with pharmacists assisting with pain management.
