The malignant potential of oral lichen planus remains a highly debated topic in the literature. The reported rate of malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma ranges from 0 to 12.5%.

A recent meta-analysis examining a total of 12,838 OLP patients found that after applying strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, the risk of malignant transformation was found to be 0.44%, significantly lower than most reported studies. Patients who smoke, consume alcohol, are seropositive for Hepatitis C or have a red OLP subtype have a higher risk of malignancy.

While the reported malignant transformation rates may vary in the literature, all studies unanimously concur that routine long-term follow-up is necessary for managing a patientâ€™s symptoms and ruling out evidence of malignancy.
