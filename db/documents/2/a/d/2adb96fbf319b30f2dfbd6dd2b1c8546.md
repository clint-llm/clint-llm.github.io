Cervical cerclage is a common obstetric procedure performed in an attempt to improve cervical integrity, prolong gestation, and prevent preterm birth. A cerclage may be indicated by history, ultrasound findings, or physical exam. They should be performed by a skilled obstetrician for the indications described above. Through a combined effort of the patient in obtaining early prenatal care, the radiologist in taking careful cervical length measurements, and the obstetrician in conducting a thorough history and physical exam, it is possible that neonatal morbidity and mortality can be reduced via cerclage placement in select populations.
