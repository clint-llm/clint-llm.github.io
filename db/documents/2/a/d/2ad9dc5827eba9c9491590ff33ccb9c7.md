The femoral triangle is a space located at the proximal thigh. Its borders are:

- Superior: inguinal ligament

- Lateral: sartorius

- Medial: adductor longus

The adductor canal is located deep to the sartorius muscle and spans the middle third of the thigh, spanning the femoral triangle proximally to the adductor hiatus distally. The contents of the adductor canal include:

- Saphenous nerve

- The nerve to vastus medialis

- Superficial femoral artery

- Femoral vein

This adductor canal allows the passage of the major thigh neurovascular bundle, traveling from the proximal thigh to the distal thigh.
