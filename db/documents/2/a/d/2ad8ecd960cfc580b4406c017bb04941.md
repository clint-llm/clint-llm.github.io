The major goal of an episiotomy is to prevent serious tears to the perineum, and therefore, it is vital to list the varying degrees of vaginal tears ranging from first to fourth degree.

- First degree: Involves the vaginal mucosa and perineal skin with no underlying tissue involvement.

- Second degree: Includes underlying subcutaneous tissue and perineal muscles.

- Third degree: The anal sphincter musculature is involved in the tear. The third-degree tear can be further broken down based on the total area of anal sphincter involvement.

- Fourth degree: The tear extends through the rectal muscle into rectal mucosa.
