For non-infected galactoceles treated with fine-needle aspiration alone, patients should be allowed to breastfeed immediately. Breast massage may also be of benefit. If breastfeeding is contraindicated for other reasons, emptying the breasts manually or using breastmilk pumps should be encouraged.Â Ice packs and breast support may be helpful.
