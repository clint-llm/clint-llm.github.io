Complications of mucormycosis subdivide into those that result from the disease itself and those that are caused by the antifungal treatment. Complications associated with the disease are cavernous sinus thrombosis, disseminated infection, periorbital destruction, palatine ulcers, osteomyelitis, and death.

Complications due to treatment are nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia, prolonged hospitalization (specifically with the use of deoxycholate amphotericin B).
