Many of the white dot syndromes are benign and self-limited, negating the need for treatment. A few white dot syndromes are persistent and progressive, with significant visual consequences if untreated (MCP, serpiginous choroiditis, and birdshot chorioretinopathy). Treatment in these conditions initially involves using local or systemic corticosteroids with a transition to steroid-sparing systemic immunotherapy.
