Lisch nodules are 1 to 2 mm yellowish-brown dome-shaped solid lesions over the iris surface. They are usually multiple, bilateral, and found in all zones of the iris surface. Few of them may not be elevated from the surface.

NF1 is clinically defined by its neural and cutaneous clinical features. The diagnostic criteria for NF1 developed by the National Institutes of Health are a useful tool for diagnosing NF1 clinically.

Two or more of the following clinical features signify the presence of NF1 in a patient.********

- More than 6 cafe au lait macules over 0.5 cm in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and over 1.5 cm in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals

- Two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma

- Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions

- Optic glioma

- Two or more Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas)

- A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia or tibial pseudoarthrosis

- A first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or offspring) with NF1 as defined by the above criteria

Neurocutaneous manifestations of NF1 are highly variable among affected individuals. Cafe au lait spots manifest due to the pathogenic melanocytes carrying a somatic or second hit mutation in the NF1 gene, and it occurs in all affected individuals.

Other rare ocular manifestations include eyelid neurofibroma (nodular or plexiform), prominent corneal nerves, congenital ectropion uveae,
