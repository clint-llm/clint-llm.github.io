The recovery process is generally relatively straightforward if the diagnosis is correct, the treatment plan is followed, and patient compliance is not an issue.

The worst complication is that the patient may fall while trying to walk. The use of orthotics can help, but in severe cases,Â using a walker might be well-advised to help the patient walk safely while learning to ambulate with her condition.

One possible complication is the possibility of a similar problem occurring in a subsequent pregnancy. In general, the risk of complications is worst in the first pregnancy. However, the short mother/big baby pattern has a genetic basis, so this is possible. Thus, while this is not a genetic condition per se, the anatomical substrate involved in foot drop can be hereditary.

Patient counseling should include diet, especially for obese patients. Trying to walk safely with a foot drop is a serious problem, without obesity complicating the process.

Instructing the patient not to sit with the legs crossed is crucial, as this could exacerbate a foot drop, especially one due to compression of the common fibular nerve. Indeed, chronic leg-crossing over the years can result in a foot drop.
