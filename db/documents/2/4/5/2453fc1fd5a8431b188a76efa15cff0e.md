Post MI VSR is a lethal disorder and carries a high mortality. The earlier the repair, the higher the mortality as the sutures do not hold in friable tissue. A longer delay allows for fibrosis to set in, and thus suturing is easier. The mortality is also high in patients with cardiogenic shock. Overall mortality is slightly lower for patients with an anterior VSR compared to a posterior VSR. Other negative prognostic factors include advanced age, multiorgan failure, and advanced New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. Predictors of mortality within 30 days include:

- Shock at surgery

- Renal failure

- Need for emergency intervention

- Significant coronary disease, especially right coronary and circumflex disease

- Duration of surgery

- Prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time

- Incomplete revascularization

The prognosis is favorable if the rupture size is small and the patient is hemodynamically stable at the time of surgical repair.
