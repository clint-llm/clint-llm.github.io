Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a class of antidepressants that are commonly prescribed for off-label use today. Although TCAs may be prescribed for MDD, they are seldom prescribed as a first-line treatment due to their unfavorable adverse effect profile, i.e., anticholinergic, antihistamine, and antiadrenergic effects, and because there are many safer alternatives available, such as SSRIs. However, TCAs may be prescribed for MDD if more conservative antidepressant pharmacotherapy has failed. Regardless of the indications for TCAs, patients who require treatment with TCAs need the involvement of an interprofessional team to help maintain patient safety.

Coordination between a patient's primary care physician, psychiatrist, and possibly cardiologist if cardiac function abnormalities are present is essential for maintaining patient stability and preventing adverse outcomes. Patient monitoring for suicidal intent is necessary to avoid toxicity and overdose.

Pharmacists should have involvement in the care of patients prescribed TCAs. Pharmacists can confirm the appropriate dosage and can recognize critical drug-drug interactions. Also, TCAs primarily undergo metabolism in the liver, so pharmacists can reduce the risk of interaction with other drugs by identifying the concomitant drugs that influence hepatic metabolism.
