As a Schatzki ring develops, it causes narrowing of the distal esophageal lumen that creates an intrinsic mechanical disorder. This will result in symptoms of dysphagia or complications like food impaction when the diameter becomes so small food is unable to pass. The ring does not cause symptoms until it reaches a diameter that obstructs food from passing. Richard Schatski developed the “Schatzki rule,” which was that a ring under 13 mm will always have symptoms, and a ring larger than 25 mm will always be asymptomatic. In cases where food becomes stuck, patients can develop odynophagia or chest pain.
