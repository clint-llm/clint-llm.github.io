Leptin's principal site of action is the brain, specifically in the brainstem and hypothalamus. The major sites of action in the brainstem are the solitary tract and the ventral tegmental area. Leptin acts here to modulate satiety and the control of reward and aversion. In the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamic area and the ventromedial, dorsomedial, ventral pre mammillary, and arcuate (ARC) nuclei are leptin’s major sites of action. The activation of these areas leads to various changes, including in the thyroid, gonadal, adrenocorticotropic hormone-cortisol growth hormone axes, and changes in whole-brain cognition, emotions, memory, and structure. Many of these relationships are still being worked out.

Taken as a whole, leptin’s function in the body pertains to regulating the balance between food intake and energy expenditure. The classic primary physiologic role of leptin is to serve as a marker of long-term energy stores for the central nervous system (CNS).
