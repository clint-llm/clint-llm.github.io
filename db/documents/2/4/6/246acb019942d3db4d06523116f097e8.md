A very experienced hand therapist plays a vital role in the postoperative care of tendon transfers for ulnar nerve palsy. Protecting the transfers with custom splints while mobilizing uninvolved joints requires strict adherence to postoperative protocols. Following most procedures, the hand is immobilized for 3 to 4 weeks, followed by a blocking splint to allow movement within the restraints of the splint for the next 3 toÂ  4 weeks. Passive exercises are started at 6 weeks and strengthening at 8 weeks for the adductor-plasty and 10 to 12 weeks for the intrinsic tendon transfers.
