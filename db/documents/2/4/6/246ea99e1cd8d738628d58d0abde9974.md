The placement of laryngeal and tracheal stents must be carefully evaluated by a multidisciplinary team involving an otolaryngologist, interventional pulmonologist, and palliative care team. Careful selection of patients should be made, and the benefit of placing a stent must be weighed against risks. The selection of the type of stent depends on the surgeon or provider's experience and patient problem. There is a lack of specific guidelines for the type of stent to be used and placement methods. Future studies are required to develop an ideal stent that should have the attributes of easy to insert and remove and cause fewer complications.
