Blockade of this nerve will result in anesthesia to the palmar aspect of the thumb, index finger, middle finger, half of the ring finger, and the area of the palm proximal to those digits. The sensation from the metacarpals and phalanges of the corresponding digits will also be affected. Motor paralysis of the lumbricals (1 and 2), opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis is likely to occur with a dense block. A more proximal block will also result in paralysis of the flexors of the forearm except for flexor carpi ulnaris which is innervated by the ulnar nerve. This block is useful for injuries to the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial aspect of the ring finger. If additional analgesia is required for injuries to the ring finger, an ulnar nerve block should be added.

This block can also be performed using anatomic landmarks by injecting between flexor carpi radialis tendon and palmaris longus at the wrist crease. However, the use of ultrasound may result in a greater rate of a successful block, as well as a more dense blockade.
