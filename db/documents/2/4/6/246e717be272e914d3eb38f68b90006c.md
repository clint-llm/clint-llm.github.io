Antibiotics-impregnated (0.054% rifampicin and 0.15% clindamycin) and silver-impregnated ventriculostomy catheters have been developed to reduce infection rates with some conflicting results.P. aeruginosa after 72 hours, with almost complete inhibition of bioform formation for E.Coli, S. aureus, and C.albicans, and reached more than 50% for Enterococcus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and P. aeruginosa after 72 hours.

The British antibiotic and silver-impregnated catheters for ventriculoperitoneal shunts multi-center randomized controlled trial (BASICS) Trial is a 1200 patient, 17 center trial comparing silicone, antibiotic-coated or silver catheters.

Controversy exists about whether the regular exchange of EVDs can reduce infection. There is a body of literature reporting that infection rates increase after 4 to 5 days of catheter insertion.
