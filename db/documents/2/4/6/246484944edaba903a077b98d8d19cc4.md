A case report highlights the significance of surgical interruption of a midline dorsal column (DCML pathway) to decrease persistent visceral pelvic pain after the elimination of uterine cancer. The case showed that punctate midline myelotomy is superior to analgesic medication in eliminating persistent visceral pain. Midline myelotomy has typically been used to interrupt the pain transmitted via the spinothalamic tract; the punctate midline myelotomy used in the study intentionally targeted the DCML pathway. The results shed light on the involvement of theÂ DCML pathway in visceral pain transmission and on the possibility of eliminating pain with surgical intervention rather than by taking analgesic medications.
