Patients need to receive counsel to engage in preventative activities, especially once they have been treated for melanoma. These actions include:

- Avoid midday sun

- Use sunscreen at all times of the year

- Don protective clothing to cover skin

- Avoid tanning beds

- Be familiar with their skin so they can promptly spot changes - this includes areas that may not receive much sun exposure
