Overall, premature ejaculation is primarily psychological in nature. However, the precise cause of premature ejaculation remains largely undetermined. Several contributing risk factors, both biological and psychological, have been identified.

Biological factors:

- Abnormal levels of the brain neurotransmitter serotonin (low serotonin levels shorten the time to ejaculation)

- Abnormal hormonal levels, e.g., LH, prolactin, and TSH

- Hypogonadism

- Inflammation and/or infection of the prostate or urethra

- Erectile dysfunction (ED)

- Ejaculatory hyperreflexia

- Genetic predisposition

- Hyperthyroidism

- Neuropathy (such as multiple sclerosis)

- Alcoholism

- Diabetes

- Recreational drug use

- Sleep deprivation (leads to low serotonin levels)

Psychological factors:

- Depression

- Anxiety

- Stress

- Guilt

- Narcissism

- Distorted thinking

- Unrealistic expectations about sexual performance

- Performance anxiety

- History of sexual repression

- Overall lack of confidence/poor body image

- History of sexual abuse or prior bad experience

- Relationship problems

- Control issues with partner

- Feeling of self-loathing

- Unrealistic fear of harm from vaginal penetration

- Hostility against women

- Other underlying mental health issues
