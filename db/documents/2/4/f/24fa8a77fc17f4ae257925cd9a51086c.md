In the case of patients with thought disorders or mood disorders with thought disturbances, health professionals can use the extent of circumstantiality as an indicator of clinical progress or treatment efficacy. The speech will become more linear and less disorganized as patients improve. In other etiologies of circumstantial or disorganized speech, such as epilepsy or intellectual disability, it is essential that the correct diagnosis is not missed or that an appropriate diagnostic workup is compromised.

In all such cases, however, when patients present with circumstantial or any other forms of disorganized speech, it is crucial that clinicians provide consistent validation and redirection so that information-gathering is efficient, empathetic, patient-centered, and productive.
