The most common risks of the procedure are similar to those seen in flexible bronchoscopy. They include transient hypoxemia, post-BAL fever (seen in up to 30% of patients), bronchospasm, and veryÂ rarely pneumothorax. Given the low incidence, routine chest x-ray after the procedure is not performed unless clinically indicated.
