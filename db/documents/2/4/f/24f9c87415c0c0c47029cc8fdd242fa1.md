The involvement of the optic nerve may result in optic atrophy in certain patients, resulting in subnormal visual acuity, color vision, and permanent field defects. Sub-optimal management of infections and inflammations may prolong the clinical course and result in frequent relapses and permanent visual disability. Irreversible vision loss may occur on the involved side in case of optic nerve damage. If it extends to involve the cavernous sinus and is left untreated, it may be potentially fatal for the patient.
