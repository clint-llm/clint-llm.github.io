Most patients are relatively asymptomatic with mild and even moderate hyperkalemia. Elevated potassium is often discovered on screening labs done in patients with nonspecific complaints or those with suspected electrolyte abnormalities due to infection, dehydration, or hypoperfusion. Historical clues include the history of renal disease, diabetes, chemotherapy, major trauma, crush injury, or muscle pain suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Medications that may predispose to the development of hyperkalemia include digoxin, potassium-sparing diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ace-inhibitors or recent intravenous (IV) potassium, total parenteral nutrition, potassium penicillin or succinylcholine. Patients may complain of weakness, fatigue, palpitations, or syncope.

Physical exam findings may include hypertension and edema in the setting or renal disease. There may also be signs of hypoperfusion. Muscle tenderness may be present in patients with rhabdomyolysis. Jaundice may be seen in patients with hemolytic conditions. Patients may have muscle weakness, flaccid paralysis, or depressed deep tendon reflexes.
