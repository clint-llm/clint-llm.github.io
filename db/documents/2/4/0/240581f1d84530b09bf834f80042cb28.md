Successful implementation of ERAS protocols requires collaboration, communication, and teamwork between medical personnel in the three different perioperative periods, including the patient, who plays a vital role in understanding and thereby facilitating the pathway. Adherence to the ERAS protocols allows for a seamless transition of the preoperative patient to when the patient is ready for discharge from surgery, whether from the same day or a few days later. The anesthesiologist plays an essential role in facilitating the implementation of the protocols because they are key decision-makers in the factors that can be debilitating to the progression of recovery from surgery.
