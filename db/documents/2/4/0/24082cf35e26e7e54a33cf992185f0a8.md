CL/P is the most common craniofacial defect of the newborn and the fourth most common congenital anomaly. The literature quotes a prevalence of anywhere from 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 650 live births, with Asians being twice as affected as Whites. Males are more affected than females, 2 to 1. A global study by the National Institute for Dental and Craniofacial Research, including over 7.5 million births, found a prevalence of CL/P of 6.64 per 10,000 births (including stillbirths and terminations). For cleft palate alone, the prevalence was 3.28 per 10,000. Of these, 77% were isolated, 16% had other malformations, and 7% had a recognized syndrome.
