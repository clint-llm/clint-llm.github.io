With a wide preliminary differential diagnosis list, evaluation should always begin with a thorough history and physical exam to focus diagnostic considerations. In all cases, arterial blood gas is necessary to diagnose the pH imbalance. Serum electrolytes should be measured with particular attention to sodium, potassium, and calcium levels as aberrations in these may lead to further complication. Magnesium and phosphate are also essential to measure. In hypoxic patients, it is important to calculate the A-a gradient to determine the etiology and further diagnosis. If the A-a gradient is wide, be suspicious of pulmonary embolism and appropriately work up the patient. A chest x-ray is important in all patients as it helps discern an anatomical or infectious cause and may rule in/out pulmonary edema. If there is a clinical reason for it, chest CT can play a vital role in achieving a diagnosis. If there is appropriate clinical suspicion for neurological insult, CT or MRI of the head may be appropriate along with lumbar puncture for WBC, glucose, and protein analysis.
