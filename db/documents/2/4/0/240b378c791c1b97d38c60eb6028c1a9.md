The most recent studies find ORN is rarely reported at a total radiation dose less than 6000 rads in six weeks. The next two dose ranges and their ORN incidences are 6000-7000 (1.8%) and > 7000 (9%) rads in seven weeks. As most head and neck cancers are treated to a cumulative dose of 70 Gy over six weeks, primarily oral and oropharyngeal cancer patients are at the highest risk of developing ORN.
