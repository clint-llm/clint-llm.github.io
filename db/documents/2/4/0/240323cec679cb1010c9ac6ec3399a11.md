The testing procedure for specific osmometers varies and is referenced in the user manual for each device. A general procedure outline can be found below.

**General Osmometry Procedure**

- Enter or scan sample ID.

- Load the sample to be tested into the osmometer. For freezing point depression osmometers, a small amount of sample is drawn in a sampler with a plunger. The sampler tip is inserted into the instrument's sample port, and the analysis begins. Loading the sample into the osmometer may start the analysis automatically. Other systems may require the lab technologist to press a button to start the process.

- Record the sample osmolality.

- Once the test is completed, withdraw the sampler from the osmometer and discard the sampler tip. Ensure the sampler and sample chamber are both cleaned appropriately.
