Congenital Varicella Syndrome defects involve the skin, the limbs, eyes, and the central and autonomic nervous systems. Characteristic scarring skin lesions known as cicatrix occur in a dermatomal distribution throughout the body. Limb abnormalities include hypoplasia, atrophy, or malformed digits. Typical ocular defects include chorioretinitis, cataracts, and nystagmus. Central nervous system abnormalities include microcephaly, cortical atrophy, seizures, and mental retardation. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction can also occur, leading to neurogenic bladder, hydronephrosis, esophageal dilation, and gastrointestinal reflux.

Infants born to mothers with varicella within the high-risk period for neonatal varicella infection are initially well appearing.Â  If they become symptomatic, they will usually present with classical vesicular skin lesions. Disseminated disease with pneumonia, hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and severe coagulopathy resulting from liver failure and thrombocytopenia can also occur.
