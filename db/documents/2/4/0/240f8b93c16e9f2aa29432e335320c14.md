A complete history and physical exam are integral to the accurate and timely diagnosis of perianal streptococcal dermatitis. History from the pediatric patient needs includes the parents. Spending time to conduct a precise history and physical exam will lead the physician to a relatively straightforward diagnosis. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis of PSD with any child who has perineal pain and changes in bowel habits.

Typical symptoms of perianal streptococcal dermatitis include:

- Perineal pain

- Pain with defecation leading to constipation

- Pruritus

- Blood in stool

- Purulent Exudate

- Lack of systemic symptoms

For the diagnosis of PSD, the anus, perineum, and genitalia require examination. PSD classically presents with varying degrees of perianal erythema with well-defined margins. Superficial erosions, anal fissures, excoriations, and purulent discharge may also be present. Once the clinician considers a diagnosis of PSD, definitive tests are necessary.
