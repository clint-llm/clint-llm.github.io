Empagliflozin has several adverse effects to be of note, including hypotension, ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, genital mycotic infections, hypoglycemia when used with insulin, dyslipidemia, Fournier gangrene, and pyelonephritis.

Empagliflozin causes osmotic diuresis and intravascular volume contraction and thus can cause symptomatic hypotension, particularly in patients on diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and the elderly, patients with renal impairment, and patients with low systolic blood pressure. Empagliflozin increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR. Renal function should thus be initially evaluated and further monitored periodically. Use of empagliflozin is not recommended if GFR is less than 45 mL/min, and when GFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73m^2, the drug is contraindicated.

Empagliflozin is associated with ketoacidosis, particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes, which is why it is not used in that patient population. Factors predisposing to ketoacidosis are pancreatic disorders, history of pancreatitis, pancreatic surgery, alcohol abuse.

Hypoglycemia risk increases when using empagliflozin in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin. Use caution if co-prescribing and consider lowering the sulfonylurea dose.

Empagliflozin increases the risk of genital mycotic infections and urinary tract infections. Evaluate for signs and symptoms and treat appropriately. Male genital mycotic infections include balanitis, balanoposthitis, scrotal abscess, and penile infection. Female mycotic infections include vulvitis and vulvovaginal candidiasis. In women, urinary tract infections and genital mycotic infections were more common than in males.

A rare but serious bacterial infection is necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum; Fournier gangrene. Symptoms begin as early as week one of treatment and as late as two years after starting the medication. Patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors should receive counseling about the risk of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum. Clinicians should report confirmed infections to the FDA.
