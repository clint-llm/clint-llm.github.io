A global review including 165 studies conducted in 54 different countries estimated the point prevalence of low back pain as 18.3% and the 1-month prevalence as 30.8%.

Low back pain is the leading cause of years lived with disability in both developed and developing countries. A review that included data from 28 countries showed that low back pain even affected children. There seemed to be an increased prevalence with increasing age. The prevalence was 27.4% in the 11 years old age group, which rose to 46.7% among 15-year-olds.

However, estimating the cost of back pain is difficult. In 1996 two different studies predicted different indirect costs as a result of back pain in the USA. One predicted the cost as being US$ 18.5 billion while another predicted the cost to be US$ 28.2 billion.
