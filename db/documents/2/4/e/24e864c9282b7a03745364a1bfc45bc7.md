CO enters the body via the lungs. Direct interactions may damage the lung parenchyma without the need for delivery of blood-borne hemoglobin. Elsewhere in the body, CO is delivered by hemoglobin. The CO causes capillary leakage of macromolecules from the lungs and systemic vasculature, and this can occur in humans who have been exposed to relatively low concentrations of CO for prolonged periods. As carboxyhemoglobin (COHgb) levels rise, the cerebral blood vessels dilate, and both coronary blood flow and capillary density increase. If exposure continues, central respiratory depression develops which may result from cerebral hypoxia. Cardiac effects, especially ventricular arrhythmias occur. Ventricular arrhythmias are implicated as the cause of death most often in CO poisoning. There is evidence that myocardial impairment begins at the relatively low level of COHgb of 20%. The overall cause of death for most animals poisoned by CO is combined hypoxia and ischemia during the acute event.
