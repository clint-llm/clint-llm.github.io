The vestibulocochlear nerve consists of the vestibular and cochlear nerves, also known as cranial nerve eight (CN VIII). Each nerve has distinct nuclei within the brainstem. The vestibular nerve is primarily responsible forÂ maintaining body balance and eye movements, while the cochlear nerve is responsible for hearing.

CN VIII injuries result from pathological processes or injuries that commonly involve the cerebellopontine angle (CPA), the internal auditory canal (IAC), or the inner ear. In such cases, symptoms such as vertigo, nystagmus, tinnitus, and sensorineural hearing loss may occur.
