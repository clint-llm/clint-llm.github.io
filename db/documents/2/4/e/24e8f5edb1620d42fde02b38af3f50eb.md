Pyloric stenosis, also known as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS), is an uncommon condition in infants characterized by abnormal thickening of the pylorus muscles in the stomach leading to gastric outlet obstruction. Clinically infants are well at birth. Then, at 3 to 6 weeks of age, the infants present with "projectile" vomiting, potentially leading to dehydration and weight loss. The radiologist plays a central role in diagnosing this condition. The treatment is surgical. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of pyloric stenosis.
- Outline the typical presentation of pyloric stenosis.
- Summarize the risk factors for pyloric stenosis.
- Describe the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of pyloric stenosis.
