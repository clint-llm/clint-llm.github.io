Maternal screening for syphilis in early pregnancy is of prime importance in preventing CS, and it is considered the standard of care in the United States. Maternal treatment of syphilis with penicillin is 98% effective at preventing CS.

The following laboratory and radiographic abnormalities can aid in the diagnosis of CS:

- Histologic examination of the placenta and cord for the typical pathological changes and presence of spirochetes

- Darkfield microscopic examination of nasal discharge if present

- Long bone radiographs that may show findings of pathologic fractures, metaphyseal serration, localized demineralization, and osseous destruction.

- Chest x-ray which may show diffuse opacification of both lung fields

- Non-treponemal tests: Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR)

- Specific treponemal tests: Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) and/or micro hemagglutination test for antibodies to T.Pallidum (MHA-TP) testing

- CSF abnormalities including reactive CSF VDRL, CSF pleocytosis, elevated CSF protein

- CSF PCR for detection of treponemal DNA

Initial workup for an infant born to a woman with reactive non-treponemal and treponemal testing should follow the recommendations of the CDC
