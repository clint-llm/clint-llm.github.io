Persistent exposure to dust mite allergens for a sensitized individual lead to the following complications:

- Sinusitis. The immune response of the body towards continuous exposure to dust mite allergens leads to chronic inflammation of the epithelium lining the sinuses. This obstructs the sinuses and causes increased vulnerability to infection.

- Asthma development. Of the various household allergens, dust mite allergens have the strongest association with the development of asthma.

- Precipitation of acute asthmatic attacks

- Atopic Dermatitis. House dust mite is also a nonspecific allergen as well as an irritant; therefore, it is an aggravating factor for people with atopic dermatitis, regardless of the sensitization to the house dust mite allergen.

- Chronic inflammation and destruction of the respiratory epithelium make the nasal and respiratory passage over-sensitive, leading to an exacerbated reaction to irritants like cigarette smoke, pollution, dry air in heated rooms, as compared with a non sensitized individual.
