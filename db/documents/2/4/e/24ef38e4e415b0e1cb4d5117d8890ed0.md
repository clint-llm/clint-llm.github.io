Generally, the following sterile equipment is required for a safe and successful procedure: cleansing agent (typically povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine), a local injectable anesthetic agent (1% or 2% lidocaine, lidocaine with epinephrine, or bupivacaine), 5 to 10 mL syringe with 25 to 40 gauge needle, 4x4 gauze, scalpel blade with a handle, curved hemostat, normal saline solution with large syringe/splash guard/bowl for irrigation, packing material (iodoform or plain gauze), swabs for wound culture (if desired), scissors and tape for dressing the wound.

Incision and drainage is a painful procedure that, in addition to local anesthetic, may also require oral or even parenteral analgesia.
