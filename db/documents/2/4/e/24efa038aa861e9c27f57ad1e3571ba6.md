The complication of myasthenia gravis includes myasthenic crisis, usually secondary to infections, stress, or acute illnesses.

Treatment complications include long term steroid effects like osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, cataracts, weight gain, hypertension, and avascular necrosis of the hip. There is also the risk of lymphoproliferative malignancies, as well as opportunistic infections such as systemic fungal infections, tuberculosis, and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with chronic immunosuppressive therapy.

Cholinergic crisis presents due to excessive ACh at nicotinic and muscarinic receptors secondary to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors. Symptoms include cramps, lacrimation, increased salivation, muscular weakness, muscular fasciculation, paralysis, diarrhea, and blurry vision.
