All patient care team members, including nursing, allied health, and the interprofessional team, play a role in assuring appropriate medication prescribing and medication monitoring. Patients talk with nurses and pharmacists when they request a refill of a medication. These team members are in an excellent position to help assess and report the possible side effects and/or efficacy of the drug to the prescribing clinician to help assist in decision making on whether or not a medication should be continued or if dose adjustments might be beneficial.

Collaborative decision-making between prescribers and pharmacists leads to improvements in medication management.
