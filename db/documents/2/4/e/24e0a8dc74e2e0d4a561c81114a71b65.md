In the United States, clinical acupuncturists are credentialed through the American Board of Medical Acupuncture. The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental medicine certifies non-clinical acupuncturists. Both of these endorse the requirement for 2000 to 3000 hours of training in a 3- to a 4-year program. Board certification encompasses a final standardized exam and the demonstration of adequate training before certification. Many states allow physicians to practice acupuncture without significant training, and others may require a few hundred hours of additions to training and certification.

Over 30% of patients in the United States who received acupuncture do so in a multidisciplinary setting.  Some examples of this could be a natural pathic office.  Physical therapy, primary care office, integrative medicine office, and pain clinics. The other 70% is largely a solo practitioner acupuncturist
