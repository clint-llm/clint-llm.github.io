Thyroid storm is aÂ true medical emergency that is fatal if left untreated. The cause of death may be heart failure, arrhythmias, or multiple organ failure. However, with treatment, most patients see an improvement within 24 hours. Risk factors for poor prognosis include:

- Advanced age

- Neurological deficits on admission

- Failure to use beta-blockers and antithyroid medications

- Need for dialysis and/or mechanical ventilation
