Patients with a change in mental status are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, psychiatrist, a radiologist, and an emergency department physician. Because there are numerous causes of mental status changes, a thorough history is necessary. While the patient is being worked up, the patient with acute mental status changes needs to be monitored by a nurse. The nursing staff should update the team about changes in the condition of the patient. The pharmacist should have a list of patient medications that may alter mental status. Specialized toxicology pharmacists may be consulted. Close communication should be made with the other healthcare professionals so that no serious cause of mental status changes is missed.
