The Maslach burnout inventory (MBI) is the most widely used tool and developed in 1980. Though there are other tools available (e.g., Copenhagen burnout inventory), the MBI is still regarded as the gold standard in measuring provider burnout. It has 22 items and consists of three domains. Increased scores on emotional exhaustion and depersonalization correlate with the greater extent of experienced burnout, as does diminished personal accomplishment. MBI can be used for single-item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and have been validated as accurate proxy measures of burnout in larger surveys.
