It should be noted that mechanical compression and compression devices are generally thought to be safe to use in all patient populations. However, they do have high hemostatic response rates and require a longer time to reach hemostasis, and a longer period of bed rest, up to 8 hours. In patients with increased bleeding risk, femoral vascular closure devices can be considered to provide faster time to hemostasis and have a decreased risk of bleeding/hemorrhage after device placement.
