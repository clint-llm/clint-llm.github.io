Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) is a syndrome characterized by a combination of clinical findings of severe disabling arthralgia and arthritis, digital clubbing, and periostosis of tubular bones, with or without synovial effusion.

With fibrovascular proliferation at the heart of the pathogenesis, it can occur as a primary familial autosomal dominant condition called pachydermoperiostosis. Much more commonly, it occurs as a secondary manifestation of pulmonary or extrapulmonary chronic diseases and malignancies. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy associated with pulmonary pathology is also known as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA).
