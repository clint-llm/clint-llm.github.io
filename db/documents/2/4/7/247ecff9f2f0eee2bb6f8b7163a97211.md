Maternal blood AFP levels are often part of triple (AFP, unconjugated estriol, and HCG) or quadruple (AFP, estriol, HCG, and inhibin A) screening tests for congenital disabilities.

Low maternal AFP levels may be suggestive of risk for down syndrome.

AFP is also useful for determining prognosis and monitoring therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Lens culinary agglutinin-reactive fraction of fetoprotein (AFP-L3), a subtype of AFP generated from malignant hepatocytes, is considered specific to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).AFP-L3 is isolated via an immunoassay and quantified using chemiluminescence on an automated platform.

A cutoff of 10% is used, and those patients with chronic liver disease and an elevated AFP-L3% have a seven-fold increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma within 21 months.

The AFP concentration is a good indicator for use in monitoring therapy and the change in clinical status. Elevated AFP concentration after surgery may indicate incomplete removal of the tumor or the presence of metastasis.

The combination of measuring the concentration of both AFP and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) helps classify and stage germ cell tumors.

One or both of the markers are elevated in about 90% of patients with non-seminomatous testicular tumors.
