The current definition of hypertension (HTN) is systolic blood pressure (SBP) values of 130mmHg or more and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) more than 80 mmHg. Hypertension ranks among the most common chronic medical condition characterized by a persistent elevation in the arterial pressure. Hypertension has been among the most studied topics of the previous century and has been one of the most significant comorbidities contributing to the development of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal failure. The definition and categories of hypertension have been evolving over the years, but there is a consensus that persistent BP readings of 140/90mmHg or more should undergo treatment with the usual therapeutic target of 130/80mmHg or less. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of essential hypertension, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the criteria for normotensive, pre-hypertensive, and hypertensive blood pressure.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of essential hypertension and its pathological sequelae on organ systems throughout the body.
- Review the various treatment options for treating essential hypertension, both pharmacological as well as lifestyle modification strategies.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of essential hypertension and improve outcomes.
