**Dosage Form and Strength**

In the market, patisiran, the disease-modifying drug, is currently available as a lipid complex injection formulation containing 10 mg/5 mL (2 mg per mL) solution in a single dosage glass vial for intravenous infusion. The patisiran solution is sterile and free of preservatives and appears white to off-white, opalescent, and homogeneous. The stopper of the vial does not contain natural rubber latex. Patisiran is available in a carton package containing a single-dose vial.

**Dosage and Administration**

**Dosing Information**

The licensed healthcare practitioners prescribe patisiran to the patients. Only qualified healthcare professionals are permitted to administer the patisiran. Patisiran has injected via intravenous (IV) infusion. Its dose is calculated based on the patient’s actual body weight. The recommended dosage for patients weighing less than 100 kg is 0.3mg per kg body weight once every three weeks. The recommended dose is 30 mg once every three weeks for patients weighing 100 kg or more.

**Missed Dose**

If an infusion misses for any reason, administer the dose of patisiran as soon as possible. If patisiran administration resumes within three days of the missed dosage, follow the patient’s original schedule for subsequent dosing. If you administer patisiran greater than three days after the missed dosage, then, from this last dosage, continue dosing every three weeks henceforth.

**Required Premedication**

All patients receive premedication routinely before administration of patisiran dosage to decrease the risk of Infusion Related Reactions (IRR). Each of the premedication regimen components is administered on the day of patisiran therapy at least one hour before the start of infusion.

The premedication regimen consists of intravenous corticosteroid (e.g., dexamethasone 10 mg, or equivalent), intravenous H1 blocker (e.g., diphenhydramine 50 mg, or equivalent), intravenous H2 blocker (e.g., ranitidine 50 mg, or equivalent), and oral acetaminophen (500 mg).

Patients must take each of the premedications. If any premedications are unavailable or intolerable via intravenous route, administer equivalents orally. If patients develop symptoms or signs of infusion-related reactions, administer additional doses of one or more of the premedications.

If patients tolerate patisiran well but experience adverse reactions related to corticosteroids, then corticosteroids may be decreased by 2.5 mg increments to a minimum of intravenously administered 5 mg dexamethasone or equivalent. Patients with a known history of infusion-related reactions may need higher or additional doses of premedications before subsequent infusions.

**Preparation Instructions**

Patisiran must be filtered and diluted before administration through intravenous infusion. The pharmacist or other healthcare professional should dilute the patisiran solution using strict sterile techniques as follows:

- Firstly, remove the vial of patisiran from the refrigerator and allow it to warm up to room temperature. Do not shake or vortex the vial.

- Visually inspect for any discoloration and particulate matter. Do not use the medicine if any discoloration or foreign particles are present. Normal patisiran is a white to off-white and opalescent homogeneous solution. In addition, a coating, white to off-white, may be seen on the inner surface of the vial, usually at the liquid-headspace interface. The quality of the product is not affected by the presence of white to off-white coating.

- Compute the required dosage of patisiran according to the recommended weight-based dose.

- Withdraw the complete contents from one or more patisiran vials into the single sterile syringe. Then, filter the patisiran using a 0.45-micron polyethersulfone (PES) syringe filter. Filter patisiran directly into a container, either a sterile glass vial or syringe.

- Withdraw the required volume of filtered patisiran from the sterile container (glass vial) into the single sterile syringe.

- Then, for dilution, transfer the patisiran from the syringe into an infusion bag containing Normal saline injection, USP, to make 200mL of volume. Do not use any other intravenous diluent to prepare diluted patisiran solution.

- Gently invert the bag containing a diluted solution of patisiran to mix entirely. Do not shake the infusion bag. Do not mix with other drugs.

- Patisiran does not contain preservatives. Therefore, after dilution, the immediate use of the patisiran is recommended. The infusion bag of diluted patisiran can be stored at room temperature, up to 86*F (30*C), for up to 16 hours, including 80 minutes of infusion time. Do not freeze.

- Discard any unused portion of the patisiran in the vial.

**Infusion Instructions**

- Use a dedicated intravenous line with an infusion set containing a 1.2-micron polyethersulfone (PES) in-line infusion filter. Use an infusion set that is free of DEHP.

- Infuse the diluted solution of patisiran intravenously through an ambulatory infusion pump for approximately 80 minutes, at about 1 mL/min of infusion rate for the first 15 minutes, and escalate to about 3 mL/min for the remaining portion of the infusion.

- Administer the patisiran only through a venous access line that is free-flowing. Monitoring of the infusion site for possible extravasation is required and as per the local standard practice for non-vesicants, manage any suspected infiltration.

- Routinely monitor the patient during the patisiran infusion and the post-infusion whenever clinically indicated.

- After the infusion is complete, flush the intravenous administration set using 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) Injection (USP) to deliver the entire drug dose.

**Storage and Handling**

Patisiran needs specific storage conditions. Store it at 36 F to 46 F (2 C to 8 C). Do not freeze; discard the vial if it has been frozen. Patisiran can be stored at room temperature up to 77 F (up to 25 C) for two weeks if refrigeration is unavailable. The infusion bag containing diluted patisiran solution can be stored at room temperature, up to 86 F (30 C), for up to 16 hours, including 80 minutes of infusion time.
