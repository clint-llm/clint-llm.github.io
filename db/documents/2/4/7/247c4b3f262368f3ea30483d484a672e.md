The main predictors of mortality include the degree of tricuspid displacement, the amount of tricuspid regurgitation, and the duration and degree of RV dysfunction.

In unoperated patients, it is estimated that survival declines significantly during follow-up, with survival at a 1-year follow-up of 86% and decreasing to 41% at a 20-year follow-up.

The Celermajer index is an established score that uses echocardiography to predict mortality. It is measured as the ratio between the area of the right atrium and the atrialized RV to the combined area of the functional RV, the left atrium, and the left ventricle at end-diastole. The higher the grade, the higher the mortality.

- Grade 1 (ratio less than 0.5) has a mortality of 0%.

- Grade 2 (ratio of 0.5 to 0.99) has a mortality of 10%.

- Grade 3 (ratio of 1.0 to 1.49) has a mortality of 4%.

- Grade 4 (ratio greater than  1.5) has a 100% mortality.

The SAS (Simpson Andrews Sharland) score is another prognostic score that uses as a weighted model to predict mortality. The cardiothoracic ratio, the Celermajer index, pulmonary valve flow, duct flow, and left-right ventricular ratio are graded 0,1,2 points each to generate a score. In studies, a score of 5 predicted 100% mortality, and a score of less than or equal to 3 predicted 91% survival.
