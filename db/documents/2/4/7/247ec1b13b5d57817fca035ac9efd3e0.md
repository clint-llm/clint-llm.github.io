PTCA is performed under local anesthesia and serves as an alternative to coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). In comparison to CABG, PTCA is associated with lower morbidity and mortality, shorter convalescence, and lower cost. It can significantly improve blood flow through the coronary arteries in about 90% of patients with relief of anginal symptoms and improvement in exercise capacity. It effectively eliminates arterial narrowing in most cases. Different modeling studies presented different conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of PTCA and CABG in patients with myocardial ischemia that do not respond to medical therapy.
