The incidence of precocious puberty is estimated to be between 1:5000 to 1:10,000.

Overall, precocious puberty is ten times more common in females than in males.

Although the traditional age cut off for precocious puberty is eight years for girls and nine years for boys, data from European studies indicate an overall decline in the age of onset of puberty in the past few decades.

A multicenter study involving subjects in San Fransisco, New York, and Cincinnati also confirmed this finding. They also found that breast development is present in 23 % in African Americans, 15% in Hispanics, and 10% ofÂ White race girls between the ages of 7 to 8 years.
