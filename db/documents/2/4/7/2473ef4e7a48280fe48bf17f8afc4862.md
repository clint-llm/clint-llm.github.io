The etiology of morphea is unclear, but genetic predisposition, autoimmune dysregulation, and environmental factors play a role in the pathogenesis of morphea. The strongest genetic associations with morphea were found with the HLA class II allele DRB1*04:04 and class I allele HLAâ€“B*37. The presence of auto-antibodies like antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-single-stranded DNA (SS DNA), and anti-histone antibodies supports the role of autoimmune dysregulation.

There is evidence from cohort studies that family members of morphea patients have an increased incidence of other autoimmune diseases, which also suggests the role of autoimmune dysregulation.

Multiple environmental factors like trauma, radiation, and friction have been reported to play a role in morphea. Radiation can cause localized secretion of interleukin 4 and 5, which induce TGF-B mediated fibrogenesis.
