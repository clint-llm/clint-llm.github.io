Prevention and treatment of tarantula-related injuries require a concerted effort from the pet enthusiast community to encourage safe practices. Eye protection should be worn when handling tarantulas. It is imperative that the medical community be able to identify injuries and refer patients to appropriate specialists if necessary. In the acute setting, patients should be referred to their local poison control center or emergency department (ED). Although patients will usually be discharged from the ED, ophthalmology follow-up may be required in some cases.
