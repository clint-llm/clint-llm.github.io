Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is defined when it presents within three months of birth. It consists of heavy proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypercoagulability, and hyperlipidemia.

The recommendation is that patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome require referral to tertiary pediatric nephrology center and treatment by an interprofessional team that includes pediatric nephrologists, pediatric nephrology nurses, pediatric hemodialysis nurses, pediatric peritoneal dialysis nurses, pediatric renal dieticians, pediatric renal transplant surgeons, renal pharmacists, neonatologist and child psychologists and social workers. Through interprofessional care coordination, open communication, and information sharing, patients will have a better chance at improved outcomes. [Level 5]
