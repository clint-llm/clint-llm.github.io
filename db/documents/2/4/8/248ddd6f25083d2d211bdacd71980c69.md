Temporal bone fractures are fortunately comparatively uncommon, occurring in roughly half of blunt head injuries; when they do occur, however, they have the potential to involve many vital structures that may result in acute and long-term disability. A large amount of force is required to fracture the temporal bone, particularly the petrous portion. For this reason, patients tend to present with concomitant trauma, such as intracranial bleeding, cervical spine fractures, and other musculoskeletal injuries.

Unlike other fractures in the head and neck region, the management of temporal bone fractures focuses on addressing functional deficits rather than reduction and fixation; the temporal bone is non-weight bearing, and cosmetic sequelae are rare secondary to fracture. However, functional deficits from the facial nerve and cochleovestibular injuries can be devastating to patients and may cause considerable decrements in quality of life.
