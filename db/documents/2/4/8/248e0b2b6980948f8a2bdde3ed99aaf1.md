Most patients with imperforate anus receive a diagnosis early in the newborn period, but few with complex malformation and perineal fistulas may evade early detection. Furthermore, anorectal malformations constitute a full spectrum of anatomical anomalies varying from simple membranous covering over anal dimple to complex cloacal defects with fistulous disease. These patients require management by experienced practitioners in tertiary care centers. Evaluation for associated anomalies is essential, and full diagnostic workup is necessary as detailed previously.
