A malincorporation theory

Two other theories, malseptation theory and entrapment theory, also explain the pathophysiology of cor triatriatum. The malseptation theory states that the fibro-muscular membrane is an abnormal growth of the septum primum; whereas, entrapment theory emphasizes the entrapment of the common pulmonary vein in the embryonic sinus venosus, thereby preventing its incorporation into the left atrium. The malincorporation theory remains the most widely accepted theory.
