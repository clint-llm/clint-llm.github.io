In 2016, approximately 1,700,000 new cases of cancer were diagnosed. It is estimated that the number of new cases of cancer is 484 per 100,000. The number of patients living beyond their cancer diagnosis is estimated to be 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to be 19 million by 2024.

It is estimated that half of the patients with cancer will receive radiation therapy, with skin injuries due to radiation therapy occurring in approximately 95%. Also, accidental and occupational exposure to radiation contributes to a number of patients with radiation injuries and skin.

Management of acute or chronic skin injuries due to ionizing radiation is a complex challenge with injuries ranging from acute redness to chronic wounds that cannot be visualized.

Chronic manifestations of radiation injuries may include radiation-induced fibrosis of the skin, nonhealing ulcers, osteoradionecrosis, compromised muscle flaps, and dehiscence of surgical closures.
