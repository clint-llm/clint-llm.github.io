Conditions that need to be considered in the differential stems from the 2 principal phenotypes of EGPA – eosinophilic lung disease and systemic small and medium vessel vasculitis.

**Eosinophilic Lung Diseases**

- Acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia

- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

- Bronchocentric granulomatosis

- Loffler’s syndrome

- Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome

**Small and Medium Vessel Vasculitis**

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Polyarteritis nodosa

- Microscopic polyangiitis

Most eosinophilic lung diseases are distinguished from EGPA by lack of multisystem involvement except idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, where peripheral eosinophilia is more than 1500/cubic mm is a chronic phenomenon lasting beyond 6 months. ANCA is completely absent in hypereosinophilic syndrome, and late-onset asthma is very uncommon. Recent molecular genetic testing has helped identify mutations specific to idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes, such as FIP1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor–alpha or T-cell antigen receptor rearrangements.

As far as differentiation from other small and medium vessel vasculitides is concerned, renal involvement is much more common in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), as is evidence of cavitary lung lesions or necrotizing upper airway lesions. Septal nasal perforation often reported in GPA does not occur in EGPA.
