The blood supply to the myenteric plexus follows that of the gastrointestinal system. The celiac artery supplies the foregut. Alternatively, blood is delivered to the midgut and hindgut by the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries, respectively. Uniquely, the capillaries that supply the myenteric layer are non-fenestrated, which differs from the capillaries supplying the other layers of the intestine.
