The Achilles reflex test is performed as part of any complete physical exam, particularly when assessing the neurologic functions of the lower extremities. When the pathology of the S1 nerve root is in question, the Achilles reflex test is the initial assessment of choice. It can aid in differentiating UMN pathology from LMN pathology as well as help in localizing the lesion.
