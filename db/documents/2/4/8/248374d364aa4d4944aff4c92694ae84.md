The adenoviruses are DNA viruses common in animals and humans, frequently occurring in both adults and children. There are more than 100 serologically different types of adenovirus, with 49 types that infect humans. The family Adenoviridae is separated into two genera: the avian adenoviruses (aviadenoviruses) and the mammalian adenoviruses (mastadenovirus).

Based on various serotypes, adenovirus is known as the etiologic mediator of multiple syndromes. It is spread via aerosolized droplets, direct inoculation to the conjunctiva, exposure to infected tissue, blood, and fecal-oral route. The virus infects multiple organ systems; though, most infections are asymptomatic. Adenovirus is recognized to be oncogenic in rodents, but that has not yet been observed in humans. In general, adenovirus infections are self-limited in immunocompetent individuals requiring supportive measures only. However, in immunocompromised individuals, the spectrum of disease is much more extensive, with outcomes potentially being fatal.
