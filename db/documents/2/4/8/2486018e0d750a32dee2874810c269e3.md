Adult tapeworms are responsive to anti-helminthic treatment, and patients have a good prognosis with complete resolution of symptoms. The largest concern is reinfection or undiagnosed parasites leading to complications or malnutrition.

NCC has a good prognosis with symptoms improving after treatment, but prognosis varies depending on the location and burden of disease. Subarachnoid and intraventricular cysts have significant morbidity and mortality while single parenchymal brain lesions have a high chance of survival with no seizure relapses.
