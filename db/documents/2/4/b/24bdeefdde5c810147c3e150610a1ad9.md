For the Tinetti Gait and Balance assessment, the interrater reliability, sensitivity, and specificity for predicting fall vary in the literature. This is primarily due to the patient populations selected in the various studies and slight variations in the assessment performed. Faber et al. suggest that the interrater reliability for the balance assessment and total score was good with an R score of 0.4 to 0.93. However, the interrater reliability for the gait assessment was lower, with an R score of 0.72 to 0.89. The sensitivity and specificity in predicting falls were 62.5 to 66.1% for the total score.

Another study suggested a sensitivity between 64 to 95.5% and specificity between 60 to 100%.

This test is a screening tool to identify a patient's fall risk. If the patient has a high total score but a low score in one of the scoring categories, then that aspect needs to be addressed as it can be a risk factor for a future fall. Furthermore, if the patient has a low total score, the practitioner should identify any underlying pathology and govern appropriate management strategies. Moreover, the practitioner should ensure these patients have appropriate support and a safe environment at home against fall risks.
