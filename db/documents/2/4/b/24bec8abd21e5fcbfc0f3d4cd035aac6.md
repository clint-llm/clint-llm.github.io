Treatment can vary significantly between cases. For example, pregnancy-related SI joint pain often resolved in the months following delivery, while traumatic SI joint injury may require prompt surgical repair.

In acute injury ice, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory should be a part of management unless they are otherwise contraindicated. Muscle relaxers can also be used for SI joint injury such as cyclobenzaprine if the suspected injury is secondary to muscle spasm. Inflammatory sacroiliitis can be treated with TNF inhibitors as well, such as infliximab or etanercept. Weak core muscles, such as oblique muscles can contribute to injury as well. Strengthening of the transverses abdominis, as well as the obliques either through a home exercise program or physical therapy, can help improve SI joint pain. Girdles and braces also help support the core in SI joint dysfunction. Braces have been shown to reduce SI joint pain. Separately, belts can limit the motion of the SI joint. However, limited studies support its clinical significance in SI joint injury.

The effectiveness of corticosteroid injections into the periarticular surface of the SI joint is controversial at best.

Radiofrequency denervation is a possible treatment option for refractory, chronic SI joint pain. Rhizotomy (radiofrequency denervation) is often complete after failed corticosteroid injections.

Interestingly at both three to six months, follow-up radiofrequency ablation was shown to have a clinically significant reduction in pain and improvement of function in patients with SI joint injury in one study.
