In the vast majority of cases, PVCs have no known cause and occur spontaneously.

Common known etiologies include excess caffeine consumption, excess catecholamines,

There are numerous cardiac and non-cardiac pathologies that areÂ causative of PVCs. Examples include cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse, and myocardial infarction. Any structural heart disease that alters conduction pathways due to tissue alterations can cause PVCs. Non-cardiac examples are hyperthyroidism, anemia, and even hypertension.

Patient populations with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and clinically poor cardiovascular markers have a higher occurrence of PVCs.

**Risk factors for PVC include:**

- Advanced age

- Male gender

- Hypertension

- African American

- hypomagnesemia

- Bundle branch block

- Hypokalemia

- Underlying ischemic heart disease
