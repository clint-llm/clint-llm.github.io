Simple cerumen removal may be performed by an emergency physician, a primary care provider, a nurse, or a technician. When anatomical abnormalities - congenital, post-traumatic, post-operative, or neoplastic - make removal more complicated, the expertise of an otolaryngologist or otolaryngology technician may be required. For some patients, such as children and the cognitively impaired, general anesthesia may be necessary in order to prevent movement during the procedure and limit the risk of damage to the external auditory canal and middle ear structures. Lastly, smaller children that require cerumen removal may be able to be placed in a papoose for restraint rather than requiring general anesthesia or sedation. Even so, holding these patients still will often require the efforts of a parent and/or an assistant to the clinician.
