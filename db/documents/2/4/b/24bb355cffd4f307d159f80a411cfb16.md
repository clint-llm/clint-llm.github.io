Facet joint injections are commonly used to diagnose facet joint pain and may provide therapeutic effects. An interprofessional healthcare team approach is critical to ensure patient safety and the proper execution of the procedure. Prior to entering the interventional suite, there should be a review of the patientâ€™s medical history, allergies, labs, and consent. The team will typically involve the physician performing the procedure, nurse, pharmacist, and imaging technician.

Communication is important as each individual plays an essential role in the procedure. The nurse will assist with bringing in equipment, administering medications, and placing monitors on the patient for vital signs. The imaging technician should position the fluoroscopy or CT in an appropriate location before the procedure and be aware of which levels are to be imaged. Communication to a pharmacist should be employed if there are any questions or concerns about the medications. Positioning of the patient is the responsibility of the entire team but is typically performed by the nurse then adjusted as needed to optimize access to the desired facet joint.

The patient is typically awake for the procedure, and thus communicate with the patient about the expectations during the procedure is important. After the procedure, the patient is monitored by the nurse for any immediate adverse effects. Before departure, the patient should be educated on common issues after the procedure, such as injection site tenderness and precautions that would warrant immediate medical attention. The clinician who performed the procedure should be available to answer any questions if the nurse cannot. The interprofessional approach amongst physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and ancillary staff will provide the best outcomes for the patient. [Level 5]
