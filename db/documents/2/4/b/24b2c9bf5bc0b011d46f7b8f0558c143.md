The diagnosis and management of neurogenic shock are not easy. Thus, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, neurosurgeon, orthopedic surgeon, trauma specialist, neurologist, and intensivist. Neurosurgery-specialized intensive care unit nurses usually monitor these patients. While fluid resuscitation is the initial treatment, one should use vasopressors cautiously since they may exacerbate any vasoconstriction; this should be done with input from the pharmacy department.

Most of these patients have other concomitant injuries that also require attention. Nurses should ensure that patients have deep vein thrombosisÂ prophylaxis, pressure sore protection, and a Foley catheter. These patients may develop a range of complications, including aspiration pneumonia, stress ulcer, and deep vein thrombosis. Close monitoring of the patient is critical, and all team members should communicate the treatment plan with each other to ensure that the patient is receiving optimal care.

The outlook for these patients depends on the severity of the injury (ASIA score), presence of neurological deficits at the time of presentation, age, concomitant other organ injuries, and a low Glasgow Coma Scale score.
