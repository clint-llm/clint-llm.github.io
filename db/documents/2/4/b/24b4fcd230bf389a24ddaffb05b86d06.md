The role of a multidisciplinary team of pulmonologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, anesthesiologist, intensivist, perfusionist, psychologists, social worker, and nurses are indispensable for the success of the program. Appropriate preoperative preparation and optimization of the patient and selecting a suitable donor are of utmost importance. The surgical team requires the necessary skill and experience to perform the technically challenging procedure as well as manage the postoperative complications.

It cannot be overemphasized that a dedicated intensive care team taking care of transplant patients is pivotal for favorable patient outcomes. The nursing staff, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, dieticians, and lastly, the family members of the patient play a very crucial role in the rehabilitation process. TheÂ pharmacist and transplant pulmonologist ensure that the patient is on appropriate formulation and dosage of immunosuppression. In summary, detailed planning and discussion with the interprofessional team are highly recommended to decrease morbidity and improve outcomes.
