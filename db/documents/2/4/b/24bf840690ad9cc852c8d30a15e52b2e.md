As innovative technology has progressed throughout the field of medicine, so too has the ability to visualize the heart and its vasculature noninvasively. Several cardiac imaging modalities have become essential in the practice of modern cardiovascular medicine not only in diagnosis but also in the management of various cardiovascular diseases as well as in the guidance of invasive procedures. These modalities include echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging via nuclear scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT). The gold standard imaging modality for the visualization of the coronary arteries remains the invasive technique of coronary angiography via coronary catheterization. Each modality can be used individually or in combination depending on desired diagnostic needs. These studies are now routinely used together with history taking, physical examination, laboratory testing and have come to define the practice of modern cardiovascular medicine. Additionally, appropriateness guidelines for the use of these imaging techniques are now standard in the assessment of the ideal imaging modality to be used in specific patient situations to optimize diagnostic and cost efficiency as well as minimize risk to the patient.
