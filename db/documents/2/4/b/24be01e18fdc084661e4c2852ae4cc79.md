The Hippocratic Oath instructs physicians and other medical providers to first, “do no harm”. Similarly, the three ethical principles laid forth in the Belmont Report ask providers to prioritize respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in their daily practice. While is it critical for providers of medical care to uphold these tenets, frequently situations arise where it is impossible to fulfill all. Medical providers are tasked with multiple roles simultaneously - healer, patient advocate, protector of hospital staff, guardian of public health, citizen, and a humanist and spiritual being. Providers must be prepared for the situation that places these roles and priorities at odds. This article will discuss relevant definitions, delve further into the ethical principles introduced above, and prepare medical providers for how to approach these complex patient encounters with the intent of maximizing benefit for all and protecting the provider(s) involved.
