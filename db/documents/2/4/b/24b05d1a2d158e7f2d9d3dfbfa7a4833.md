Optic neuritis usually presents with the acute onset of monocular eye pain and vision loss in a young adult. Pain is usually associated with eye movements and often precedes loss of vision. Patients often report having had similar events in the same or fellow eye.

The degree of vision impairment may range from near-normal acuity to no light perception

Optic disc swelling is seen on fundoscopy in one-third of patients during the active phase. In the absence of observable papillitis, signs and symptoms of ON are usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis of retrobulbar neuritis.

Bilateral presentation, profound loss of vision, and absence of eye pain prior to vision loss, together with atypical neurologic findings should prompt the search for an alternative etiology. Visual symptoms due to ON tend to resolve over several weeks to months and visual function improves to near-normal levels after six months in the majority of cases. There are, however, instances in which qualitative visual changes persist for the duration of a patientâ€™s life
