Additional muscles that either assist or are assisted by the trapezius include the latissimus dorsi (innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve), rhomboid major and minor (innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve), and the levator scapulae (innervated by the dorsal scapular nerve and some of the cervical ventral rami).Â The trapezius and semispinalis capitis muscles create the main mass of muscle at the occipital region of the base of the skull.

The latissimus dorsi is a powerful extensor of the arm at the shoulder. The rhomboid major and minor serve to adduct the scapula. They also adduct and extend the arm at the shoulder, as well as depressing the scapula, and rotating the arm medially.

The sternocleidomastoid muscle is also innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI). As the name implies, the sternocleidomastoid muscle has an origin at the clavicle (cleido) and at the sternum. It inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Acting together, the two sternocleidomastoid muscles flex the head at the neck, whereas the upper portions of the two trapezius muscles extend the head at the neck.
