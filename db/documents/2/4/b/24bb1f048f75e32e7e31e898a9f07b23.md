In the prodromal phase, patients may experience moderate-to-severe pruritus alone or associated with urticarial, papular lesions.

Childhood cases are rare. However, there have been cases of infantile bullous pemphigoid, which presents in an acral distribution in the first year of life.

Researchers debate whether bullous pemphigoid is associated with internal malignancy. However, most believe this association is due to the older age of the patient. A recent study found no increased risk for concurrent or subsequent malignancies in patients with bullous pemphigoid.
