The hypoglossal nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles and all but one of the extrinsic muscles (genioglossus, styloglossus, and hyoglossus) of the tongue.

The function of each muscle/muscle group isÂ as follows:

- Genioglossus- Draw the tongue forward from the root

- Hyoglossus- Retracts the tongue and depresses its side

- Styloglossus- Draws the tongue upward

- Intrinsic muscles (superior/inferior longitudinales, transversus, verticalis)- Changes the shape of the tongue such as shortening, narrowing, curving the tongue.
