The incidence of gallbladder cancer is high in specific populations outside of the United States (e.g., South America, India, Pakistan, Japan, and Korea) due to the high prevalence of gallstones and chronic gallbladder infections in those areas. The American Cancer Society estimates 11,740 new cases of gallbladder cancer and 3,830 deaths in the USA with a female preponderance in 2017. The overall incidence of gallbladder cancer decreased in patients older than 50 years but increased in the younger population. Gallbladder cancer is more common in Whites, Southwestern Native Americans, and Mexican Americans and less common in African Americans.
