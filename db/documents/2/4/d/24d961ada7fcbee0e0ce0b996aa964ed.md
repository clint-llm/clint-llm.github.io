IOFB can lead to several complications, such as those associated with an open-globe injury. Endophthalmitis is the most dreaded complication following ocular trauma. Post-traumatic endophthalmitis has been reported to develop in 2.1% to 11.9% of patients with open-globe injury in the absence of IOFB. In contrast, endophthalmitis associated with an IOFB accounts for 3.8% to 48.1% of cases.

Another sight-threatening complication of an open-globe injury is Sympathetic Ophthalmia (SO). It is a bilateral granulomatous pan-uveitis usually following penetrating ocular trauma or surgery. The incidence of SO is reported as 0.28-1.9% in penetrating ocular trauma.

IOFB can also be associated with several anterior segment complications such as hyphema, traumatic cataract, capsular rupture, subluxation or dislocation, and secondary open-angle glaucoma.

Siderosis bulbi can also lead to optic atrophy and cystoid macular edema.
