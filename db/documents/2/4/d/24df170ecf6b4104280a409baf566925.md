The cause of McCune-Albright syndrome is a spontaneous post zygotic missense mutation at ARG201 or Gln227 of the GNAS gene during embryogenesis. GNAS encodes the alpha subunit portion of a G-signaling complex that found in multiple tissue types, including bone, skin, and endocrine tissues.  The mutation is distributed in a mosaic pattern and presenting signs and symptoms are dependent on the time frame the mutation occurs.  Mutated GNAS results in a constitutively active alpha subunit, causing increased intracellular cAMP, and mediating the action of downstream hormones.
