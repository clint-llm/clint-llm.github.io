A detailed inquiry focusing on travel history and establishing the endemicity and chronicity of condition is critical to making a diagnosis. A complete blood count usually shows eosinophilia. Despite recent advances, a nocturnal peripheral thick smear followed by Giemsa staining demonstrating microfilariae in the bloodstream remains the mainstay of diagnosis. Newer methods include circulating filarial antigen test, which has approximately 97% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
