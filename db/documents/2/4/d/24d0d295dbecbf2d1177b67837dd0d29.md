Contraindications to BVN ablation are generally similar to other interventional spine procedures, such as systemic infections, spinal infections, pregnancy, incomplete skeletal maturity, implantable pulse generators (pacemakers, defibrillators), patients with severe cardiopulmonary compromise, patients where the targeted ablation zone is < 10 mm away from a sensitive structure not intended to be ablated, including the vertebral foramen (spinal canal), and in situations where unintended tissue damage may result based on the clinical assessment of the physician such as spine surgery at the treatment level where existing hardware is within the zone of the BVN ablation.

Additional considerations reported in the literature as an exclusion among published studies included morbid obesity (due to potential tool length limitations in accessing target with elevated levels of adipose tissue in the lumbar region), patients where symptomatic spinal stenosis or radicular pain is the primary pain source, and situations where injury may result from the procedure based on physician assessment such as osteoporosis (particularly in patients with a prior vertebral compression fracture and/or who are actively taking hormonal therapy), in patients with metastatic disease or local malignancy, and in patients with risk for bleeding such as those diagnosed with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy disorders.
