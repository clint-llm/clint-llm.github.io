Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a drug class that was first released to the market in 1959 as a pharmacotherapy for major depressive disorder (MDD).

In treating major depressive disorder, TCAsÂ display equivocal efficacy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but TCAs cause more significant adverse effects due to their anticholinergic activity and a lower threshold for overdose.
