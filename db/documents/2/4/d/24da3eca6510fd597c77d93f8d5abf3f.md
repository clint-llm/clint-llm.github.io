There are different methods used for the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Ultrasound between 14 and 24 weeks of gestation can be used as a tool for diagnosis based on the soft markers like increased nuchal fold thickness, small or no nasal bone and large ventricles.

Several other methods have also been developed and are used for the rapid detection of trisomy 21 both during the fetal life and after birth. The most commonly used is FISH of interphase nuclei by either using Hsa21 specific probes or whole of the Hsa21.

A relatively new method called as paralogue sequence quantification (PSQ) uses the paralogue sequence on Hsa21 copy number. It is a PCR based method that uses the paralogue genes to detect the targeted chromosome number abnormalities which are known as paralogue sequence quantification.

There are non-invasive prenatal diagnostic methods which are being studied to be used for the diagnosis of Down syndrome prenatally. These are based on the presence of fetal cells in the maternal blood and the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal serum.

Cell-free fetal DNA makes up 5% to 10% of the maternal plasma, and it increases during pregnancy and clears after delivery. Though this method has been used to determine fetal Rh status in Rhive women

Few other recent methods like digital PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are also being developed for the diagnosis of Down syndrome.
