Hot tub folliculitis should be differentiated from other causes of rash and skin infections. Malignant otitis externa is often confused with other ear infections. Bone involvement leading to osteomyelitis in malignant otitis externa and pseudomonal puncture wounds may need more aggressive interventions for diagnosis e.g., tissue or bone biopsy to differentiate other causes of infection. In systemic infections, other organisms that can cause overwhelming infections and sepsis should always be considered. Broad coverage is needed initially until culture and sensitivity results are obtained.
