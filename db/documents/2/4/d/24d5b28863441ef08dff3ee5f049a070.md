The neuropathological hallmark of this disease is the presence of TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein 43) containing ubiquitinylated proteinaceous inclusions in motor neurons.

Skeletal muscle and cortical motor atrophy, corticospinal, and corticobulbar tract hyalinization and sclerosis, hypoglossal nerve, and ventral root thinning have been observed on gross examination in pathology specimens.

The high expression of Ephrin type a receptor 4 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 along with lower expression osteopontin and Insulin-like growth factor 2 along with the large size of the cell and the need to maintain long axonal projections could make the motor neuron more vulnerable to the effect of these derangements.
