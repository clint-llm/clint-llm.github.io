A giant cell tumor of bone is a relatively rare neoplasm, accounting for approximately 3 to 5% of all primary bone tumors. It generally affects young adults, with peak incidences in the 20s and 30s, mildly more prominent in females. Risk factors are not fully understood, but there are increased incidents in patients with Paget disease, typically developing in the pelvic or skull bones.
