Close monitoring of clinical response, and measurements of von Willebrand factor activity, is required for dose adjustments and intervals. The standard parameters essential to monitor are factor VIII coagulant (FVIII:C), vWF antigen (VWF:Ag), and ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo). It is primarily the FVIII: C assay and the VWF:RCo essay required to monitor replacement therapy. The general goal is to sustain the activity of factor VIII and of VWF (which is generally measured as VWF:RCo) between 50 to 100 percent for 3 to 14 days in patients with significant bleeding episodes or before major surgery. It is important to note that the half-life of infused VWF is short in AVWS, especially in patients with AVWS associated with the presence of inhibitors or Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).

It is essential to obtain levels of vWF:RCo and factor VIII activity immediately before and soon after the infusion to determine the half-life of the infused products. Levels are then measured at 4, 8, and 12 hours after the first infusion to obtain half-life information, with more spaced out testing performed subsequently (every 12 hours to 24 hours) depending on the clinical status and response of the patient. In major surgeries, it is recommended to obtain plasma levels of FVIII:C (and vWF:RCo) initially every 12 hours on the day of surgery, subsequently every 24 hours.

It is also important to monitor Factor VIII activity to ensure that it is maintained below 200 international units/dL; high levels of FVIII increase the risk of thrombosis. Post-infusion, the half-life of FVIII:C is approximately double that of vWF:Ag (20 to 24 vs. 10 to 14 hours). This is because of the endogenous increase of FVIII levels, which is stabilized by the additionally infused exogenous von Willebrand factor.

Continuous infusion of factors can be used in patients whose levels cannot be maintained with intermittent infusions and who fail to respond clinically. And such patients will require closer monitoring.
