Contraindications for tympanoplasty can be categorized into relative or absolute. Relative contraindications include patient age (extremities of age), a non-functioning Eustachian tube, dead (non-hearing) ear or consideration of tympanoplasty in the patient’s better hearing ear. Absolute contraindications include uncontrolled cholesteatoma, uncontrolled complications or sequelae of otitis media such as intracranial abscess, meningitis or lateral sinus thrombosis, malignancy, or patient-specific anesthetic contraindications.
