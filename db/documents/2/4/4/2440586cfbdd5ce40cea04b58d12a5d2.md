Disruption of cell communication or signaling can lead to pathologic states. For example, Graves disease is an autoimmune disease with antibodies (autoantibodies) directed against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors. Autoantibody and TSH receptor binding results in the production and release of thyroid hormones. Under physiological circumstances, TSH activates the TSH receptor, leading to the production and secretion of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). In Graves disease, an excess of these hormones causes tachycardia, hyperreflexia, fine resting tremor,Â exophthalmos, and pretibial myxedema. Autoantibody also stimulates the growth and proliferation of thyroid-producing cells leading to diffuse goiter.
