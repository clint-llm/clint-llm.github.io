Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy associated with elevated intraocular pressures. Glaucoma results in visual field loss, and in its end-stage, may lead to complete blindness. Anatomically, glaucoma is classified into open-angle glaucoma and closed-angle glaucoma. A closed-angle is an anatomical configuration in which there is a mechanical blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris. Etiologically, it can be classified as primary or secondary angle closure. Primary angle-closure is not associated with any other ocular condition, while secondary angle closure is associated with one or more other ocular conditions.

Clinically, angle-closure can be considered acute or chronic. Chronic angle-closure can occur with or without symptoms, and thus it can be described as ''silent" closed-angle glaucoma. Because this condition mainly consists of irido-trabecular contact leading to synechiae formation and subsequent angle closure, it has also been described as "creeping" angle closure.
