Patients with weber syndrome present with drooping of the eyelid, diplopia associated with contralateral partial or complete weakness of upper limb and lower limb. The presence of crossed deficits, either sensory or motor, along with occasional association with ataxia (involvement of the red nucleus) and parkinsonian rigidity (involvement of the substansia nigra) are the characteristic neurological findings in this syndrome.

On neurological examination, higher mental functions are usually normal and not commonly affected in an isolated Weber syndrome. Ptosis may be present, and on opening the affected eye, the eye is mostly shifted downwards and outwards, due to the unopposed action of superior oblique and lateral rectus muscles.

Dilated unresponsive pupils may occur if both upper and middle midbrain are affected, pupils may be spared if only lower midbrain is affected by the inciting insult. Contralateral ataxia and sometimes parkinsonian type of rigidity may be seen associated with the weakness.

Khalil et al. reported the association of Weber syndrome with vertical gaze palsy owing to the involvement of the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) in the midbrain, dorsal to the red nucleus.

The fascicular arrangement of the midbrain oculomotor nerve is speculated to be a pupillary component, extraocular movement, and eyelid elevation in that rostrocaudal order.****
