Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), is a T-cell lymphoma characterized by large, pleomorphic lymphoid cells with abundant cytoplasm and horseshoe-shaped nuclei, positive for CD30. ALK+ ALCL has associated recurrent t(2;5) fusion translocation involving the ALK gene and nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene. This CME activity outlines the evaluation and management of ALK+ ALCL while highlighting the role of the interdisciplinary healthcare team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology and epidemiology of ALK+ ALCL.
- Describe the histopathology and clinical presentation of ALK+ ALCL.
- Summarize the treatment and prognosis of ALK+ ALCL.
- Discuss modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by ALK+ ALCL.
