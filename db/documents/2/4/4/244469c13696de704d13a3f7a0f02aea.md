One challenging aspect of controlling elder abuse is that it is frequently unidentified and underreported. Campaigns to reduce elder abuse should focus on educating health care workers, caregivers, patients, and the community on the prevalence, risk factors, and signs of elder abuse as well as the resources available to help. Enhancement of community resources is also needed to better support victims and families.

Identifying and minimizing risk factors as well as providing support for families could help reduce the prevalence of abuse, and subsequently, reduce the burden on emergency medical services, hospitals, medical care costs, and need for placement in a long-term care facility.

Long-term care facilities can minimize the risk of abuse by avoiding understaffing, creating a calm environment, making staff feel appreciated, and by providing more education for staff on how to deal with difficult or aggressive residents.
