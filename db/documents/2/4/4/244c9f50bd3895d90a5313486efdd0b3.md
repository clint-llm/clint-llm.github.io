Obstetric anesthesia for high-risk cardiac patients is a challenging endeavor that poses a risk to both the mother and fetus.  The physiologic changes during pregnancy are not ideal for many cardiac conditions. For example, patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis are sensitive to volume prenatally, so when pregnancy increases intravascular volume by 50%, it only exacerbates the condition. Decreases in systemic vascular resistance lower diastolic pressures and decrease coronary perfusion pressures as well—many of the typical anesthetics lower systemic vascular resistance, which can further challenge tenuous patients.

Due to the complex nature of this patient population, it is important to pursue an interprofessional approach to the care of these patients. Multiple specialties of physicians should be involved when warranted as a multifaceted viewpoint is less likely to miss potentials for improvement in care. A cardiac anesthesiologist and cardiologist can work in conjunction with the obstetric team to help guide the successful delivery of a child to a mother with pulmonary hypertension or a significant right to left shunt.  Without the teamwork behind the scenes, the care of such complex patients could be compromised.  Pregnancy is a stressful experience for the mother, only compounded by potentially life-threatening heart disease. Clear communication between the entire healthcare team is important to optimize outcomes for these high-risk patients.
