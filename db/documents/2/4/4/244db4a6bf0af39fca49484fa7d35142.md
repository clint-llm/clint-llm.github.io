Corneal dystrophies are a collection of inheritable diseases leading to cellular dysfunction of the cornea.

Patients with corneal dystrophy range from being asymptomatic to displaying symptoms such as painful corneal erosions, photophobia, and visual acuity loss, and can be associated with other systemic symptoms based on the genetic abnormality.

Physical exam findings, especially biomicroscopy, histologic exam, and genetic testing, are vital to the accurate diagnosis of corneal dystrophies.

Treatment can vary from conservative measures to corneal transplantation and is dependent on disease onset and progression.
