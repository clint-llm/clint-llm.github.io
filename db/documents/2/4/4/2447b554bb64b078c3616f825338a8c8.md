Clinically, the arterial supply to the hand and fingers are essential. While collateral circulation often remains intact in the event of the occlusion or damage to the ulnar or radial artery, patients with anatomical vascular variations may develop ischemia and limb compromise if collateral circulation is inadequate. Studies have highlighted that clinicians must be aware of, and report significant anatomical vascular variants to prevent potential consequences associated with them.
