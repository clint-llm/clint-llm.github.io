All patients should undergo routine preoperative evaluation by an anesthesia provider.  Patients with a concerning cardiac or complex medical history should receive preoperative medical clearance.  Any patient on anti-coagulation needs to have a clear plan for managing this medication perioperatively.

If there is a concern for significant airway obstruction due to disease, anatomy, or pre-existing treatment (i.e., previous radiation or cervical spine surgery), awake fiberoptic intubation or awake tracheostomy may need to be planned and coordinated with the anesthesia team.

All patients should have a complete oncologic workup completed prior to surgery.  This should include a biopsy with a diagnosis of cancer, imaging of the head and neck, and PET-CT or chest CT to evaluate distant metastasis and accurately stage the disease.
