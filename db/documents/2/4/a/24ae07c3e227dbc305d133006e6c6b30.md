The radial artery supplies the posterolateral aspect of the forearm as well as vascular territories, including the elbow joint, carpal bones, thumb, and lateral index finger. It passes beneath the brachioradialis. In the distal forearm, the brachioradialis narrows to its insertion on the styloid process of the radius. The radial artery then travels in the anatomical snuffbox (la tabatiere anatomique de Cloquet) to pass between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseus muscle.
