Photodynamic therapy involves the application of a topical photosensitizing agent over a target area, followed by activation of the agent by light irradiation. It leads to the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates in the presence of oxygen. These intermediates act on essential cellular components leading to apoptosis and necrosis due to irreversible oxidization.When being used for ophthalmic purposes, the abnormal endothelial cells in the proliferating blood vessels selectively accumulate verteporfin.

The photochemical reaction is then initiated by irradiating verteporfin by the light of wavelength 689 nm. The light of wavelength 689 nm is chosen as it reaches the pathological endothelial cells within the choroid even with overlying blood, fibrotic tissue, and melanin. The far-red light has good penetration.
