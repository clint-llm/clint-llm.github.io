About 80% of familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome results from inherited defects in both alleles of the lipoprotein lipase gene. The rest, 20%, is the result of a mutation in other genes related to the function of lipoprotein-lipase such as apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5), high-density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GP1HBP1), and lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1). Other unidentified mutations also exist.
