Cervical dislocations have a bimodal distribution, and the mechanism of injury varies depending on the patient's age. Younger patients are typically associated with a more high injury mechanism, such as a motor vehicle collision. While elderly patients are more commonly associated with low injury mechanisms such as a ground-level fall.
