Based on the clinical findings, the major differential diagnoses consist in carcinoid tumor and squamous cell carcinoma. Microscopic diagnosis is mandatory to rule out both diagnoses. Based on the microscopic features, the major pitfalls of squamous cell papilloma are represented by inflammatory polyp and squamous cell carcinoma. Inflammatory polyp lacks a true papillary structure in spite of the possible presence of squamous metaplasia. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor characterized by nests of tumor cells centered by squamous pearls. Some dyskeratotic cells are also noticed. When the keratinization is not obvious, the immunohistochemical studies, especially the P63 and P40 antibodies, are useful to keep the diagnosis.

The differential diagnoses of glandular papilloma include primary and metastatic adenocarcinoma and other adenomas. Carcinomas display malignant feature consisting of cytological atypia and the invasion of the basal lamina and lack basal, ciliated and mucinous cells which are characteristic in a glandular papilloma.
