Z-plasty is a common transposition flap technique used in plastic and reconstructive surgery to revise scars. The technique can also be used to prevent the contracture of linear scars, decrease scar length, realign malpositioned tissues, close cutaneous defects, and alleviate stenosis. While a single Z-plasty may be employed to manage a small scar, a serial/compound Z-plasty may be used to address longer or wider scars. Understanding the fundamental principles and surgical techniques of basic Z-plasty and its variants provides the surgeon with a powerful tool for scar management.
