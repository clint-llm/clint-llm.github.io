The exact pathophysiologic basis of this disorder is not completely understood, but it has been reported that Caroli disease is a genetic disorder involving a mutation of the PKHD1 gene that is also responsible for the fibrocystin protein. It is a large gene present on chromosome 6p12 and is expressed primarily in the kidney and with lower levels in the liver and pancreas. More than 100 mutations in this gene have been recorded, and the majority of the affected patients have compound heterozygosity for this gene, meaning both their alleles have 2 different mutations rendering the gene defective and leading to an abnormal fibrocystin protein. This reflects the diversity of the mutation base that the PKHD1 gene experiences.

In the liver, this protein is part of the cilia on the luminal side of cholangiocytes and is an important receptor in the protein signaling pathway which controls bile composition. It senses mechanical, chemical, and osmotic stimuli in the bile which, through complex intracellular signaling pathways, alter the composition of the bile. This protein also has a role in the normal development of the liver and kidneys through controlling cell proliferation. Therefore, it is understandable that complete absence, or a major abnormality of this protein, would cause structural damage to the liver parenchyma as seen in gross cystic dilatations seen in Carolis disease ultimately leading to liver fibrosis. This cystic dilatation leads to biliary stasis and sludge, which cause intra-hepatic lithiasis and obstruction, which present early in the form of cholangitis.
