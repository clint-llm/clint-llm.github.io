The testing for Zika virus infection is based on the risk of exposure, symptoms, and pregnancy status.Â  Routine laboratory tests are frequently normal, although mild leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated hepatic transaminases may be seen.

As of April 25, 2017, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing recommendations are:

- Test everyone with Zika exposure (living or traveling in areas with Zika or having sex with someone without a condom who has lived or traveled in a Zika area), and symptoms of Zika.

- Test pregnant women with Zika exposure.

- Test pregnant women with a fetus whose ultrasound demonstrates findings that might be associated with Zika infection.

- Zika testing should be part of the routine obstetrical testing at the first prenatal visit and during the second trimester for pregnant women with Zika exposure.

Test selection for detecting Zika virus infection is guided by the duration of symptoms (less than 14 days, more than 14 days) and pregnancy status.

The virus infection is detected with PCR and antibodies.
