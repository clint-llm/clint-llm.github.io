Since the end manifestations of many diseases can produce atrophie blanche-like lesions, excluding these other causes is necessary to diagnosis true atrophie blanche, i.e., livedoid vasculopathy. Many studies will help a clinician to rule in or rule out other disease etiologies. The following is not an exhaustive list:

- Doppler studies and ankle-brachial index are aids to rule-out venous stasis and arterial occlusion

- A skin biopsy to rule out cutaneous vasculitis

- Screening coagulation studies to evaluate for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome

- Lab work should include hemoglobin A1C

- Complete blood count with differential

- Basic metabolic panel

- Antinuclear antibody (ANA)

- Rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein (CRP) to aid differentiation of diabetes mellitus, autoimmune syndromes, and malignancy
