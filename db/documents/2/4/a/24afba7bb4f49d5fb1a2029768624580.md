The brain is enveloped by three membranes, the pia mater, arachnoid mater, and dura mater.  These three membranes are collectively called the meninges.  The dura mater is the strong, fibrous outermost membrane which provides a double layer of protection within the cranial cavity.  The two layers of dura mater within the neurocranium are the periosteal layer which adheres directly to the inner neurocranium and meningeal layer which surrounds the brain tissue along with the arachnoid and pia mater.  The meningeal dura mater invaginates between brain regions to form dural partitions - the falx cerebri, falx cerebelli, tentorium cerebelli, and sellar diaphragm.

The falx cerebri separates the cerebral hemispheres and provides channels, known as dural sinuses, for blood and cerebral spinal fluid to drain. The falx cerebri is a sail-like structure which is anchored posteriorly at the internal occipital protuberance, superiorly to the periosteal dura mater, and anteriorly to the crista galli which sits above the ethmoid bone.
