Tamoxifen should not be used in patients with a known allergy to the drug or any component in its formulation or concomitantly with warfarin. For patients taking tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction at high risk for breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, it should be avoided if the patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). In patients that have been diagnosed with breast cancer, the benefits outweigh the risks, but it should still be used with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic events.

Caution is recommended in patients who are poor CYP2C9 metabolizers.

Tamoxifen also has many drug-drug interactions, so a comprehensive medication list is crucial for all patients receiving it.

Tamoxifen use should be avoided in pregnancy; based on limited human data, the risk of teratogenicity and fetal harm exists. Women should avoid breastfeeding during treatment and for three months following discontinuing therapy due to the risk of infant harm. Tamoxifen also reduces milk production, particularly during the early post-partum period.
