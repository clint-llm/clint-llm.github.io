The clinical presentation of the pelvic abscess is highly variable. Patients may present with a high-grade fever, general malaise, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, retention of urine, and change in bowel habit. Leukocytosis with a left shift along with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high C-reactive protein is present in blood workup.

The complete physical exam includes a thorough abdominal, vaginal, and rectal examination. Superficial or deep abdominal tenderness on abdominal palpation may be indicative of peritonitis. The comprehensive vaginal examination consists of the bimanual and speculum exam. The bimanual vaginal exam should assess the size of the uterus, mobility, consistency, and adnexa. Usually, the cervical motion tender is present, the uterus is tender, boggy, and most likely pushed anteriorly.
