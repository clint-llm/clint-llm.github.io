Tricuspid valve disorders are rare findings; and, if discovered, should be treated as long as the patient is symptomatic or has severe findings. As we become more advanced with replacement or repair of tricuspid valve disorders using endovascular techniques, we should have more involvement and interprofessional care from multidisciplinary teams. An interprofessional team should include an anesthesia team, cardiologists, cardio-thoracic surgeons, and cardiac intensivists. Preoperative echocardiographic evaluation of the tricuspid valve requires coordination between the ultrasound sonographer and the cardiology team. The intraoperative repair of the valve requires closed-loop communication between the cardiac surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, circulating nurse, and cath lab techs.

Close communication is vital for successful endovascular tricuspid valve repair. Postoperative care requires skilled intensivists and intensive care nurses. The untreated severe or symptomatic disease leads to poor outcomes with the patientâ€™s overall health. Percutaneous techniques for tricuspid repair/replacement are likely to increase in the future due to improvement in technology and new studies showing improved long term outcomes in the treatment of tricuspid valve disease.
