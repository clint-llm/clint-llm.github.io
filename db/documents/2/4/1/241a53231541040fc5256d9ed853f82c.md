Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO2) is relatively safe with the most common side effect by far related to barotrauma of the ears or sinuses. The only absolute contraindication is an untreated pneumothorax. Caution must be used in patients with respiratory infections, seasonal allergy symptoms, sinusitis, or recent surgeries or emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with open gas pockets or blebs. HBO2 should not be administered in conjunction with doxorubicin, Sulfamylon, or disulfiram and for an extended time following discontinuation of either bleomycin or cisplatinum. Patients with asthma should be evaluated for air trapping but can be successfully treated with education and training. Patients with confinement anxiety may need sedation. Patients with implantable devices may need the device to be cleared by the manufacturer for effective deliveryÂ under pressure.
