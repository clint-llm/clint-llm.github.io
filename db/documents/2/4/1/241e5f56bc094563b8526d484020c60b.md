According to the American academy of orthopedic surgeons (AAOS), three primary types of arthritis affect the human wrist: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic arthritis.

- Osteoarthritis (OA): This is a common cause of wrist pain in the elderly population, although it can affect any age group. Aging, hereditary factors, high BMI, joint anatomy, and gender are the risk factors linked to the development of osteoarthritis. In young adults, it usually happens secondary to preceding joint injury.

- Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory condition that affects the peripheral joints symmetrically. The exact etiology of rheumatoid arthritis remains unknown, but it is thought to be multifactorial.

- Post-traumatic arthritis develops because of traumatic events such as injuries to the ligaments or fractures of the wrist bones. Despite adequate treatment, damage to the bones increases the risk of developing arthritis over time.

Other causes of wrist arthritis are infection (septic arthritis), crystal-induced arthritis, reactive arthritis, and systemic diseases like sarcoid arthropathy, myelodysplastic, and leukemic disorders.
