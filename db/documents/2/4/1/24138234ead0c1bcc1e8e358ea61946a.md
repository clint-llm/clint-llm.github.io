As the primary site of Salmonella invasion is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gut complications are not surprising. Gastrointestinal irritation results in diarrhea, and Payer patch hypertrophy causes obstruction of lumen and constipation. In severe cases, necrosis of Payer patches leads to ulceration and bleeding. Sequelae of ulceration are eventually perforation of the terminal ileum. Diarrhea is usually non-bloody and loose. However, large-volume watery stools, bloody stools, and symptoms of dysentery may occur. The temperature may drop falsely at a normal or subnormal level due to intestinal hemorrhage.

While seeding can occur in nearly every organ system, it is uncommon to see complications outside of the GI tract. Widespread dissemination of bacteria causes multiorgan failureÂ due to septicemia.

Typhoid encephalopathy can occur in up to 17% of patients with a mortality as high as 55%.
