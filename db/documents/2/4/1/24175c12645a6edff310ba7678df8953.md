In open-angle glaucoma, particulate matter can lodge into the fine openings in the trabecular meshwork and thus increase the passive resistance to aqueous humor drainage.

Lens proteins: During cataract surgery, high-molecular-weight lens proteins produced as a by-product of phacolysis can lodge into the trabecular meshwork and increase drainage resistance.

Red blood cells: In the event of a traumatic injury to the eye, senescent red blood cells can become lodged in the trabecular meshwork- a variant of open-angle glaucoma known as "Ghost cell glaucoma."

Pigment granules: pigment from the epithelium of the iris can detach and become lodged in the fine trabecular meshwork, pigmentary glaucoma, and pigment dispersion syndrome.

Tumor debris: Necrotic tumor debris from necrotic tumors can also clog the trabecular meshwork in a variant known as melanomalytic glaucoma.

Corticosteroids: Steroid therapy of any kind can contribute to elevated intraocular pressure, however, topical eye and periocular steroids aÂ most likely to increase intraocular pressure.
