As described above, four main mechanisms can lead to intestinal perforation. A thorough understanding of these mechanisms is critical to guide the appropriate workup and management.

Numerous etiologies can lead to ischemia and perforation. In the case of bowel obstruction (small or large), the physical distention of the bowel wall results in decreased perfusion.

The most common infectious causes of perforation are appendicitis and diverticulitis. Appendicitis can be considered at any age; whereas, diverticulitis is more common beyond middle age.

Erosive diseases, such as the local invasion of the wall of a viscus by a tumor or ulcerative disease, also can cause perforation. In peptic ulcer disease, there is direct erosion through the layers of the bowel wall by the ulcer itself, usually due to Helicobacter pylori infection, acid overproduction, or lack of acid protective mechanisms.

Mechanical injury to the wall of a hollow viscus can be caused by penetrating or blunt trauma to the abdomen, or iatrogenic injury from instrumentation, for example, endoscopy.

In addition to the mechanism, the variation in bacterial flora between the upper and lower intestinal tract must also be considered. For instance, upper intestinal perforations proximal to the ligament of Trietz result in significantly less bacterial contamination than distal colonic perforations. In the treatment of distal perforations, antibiotics must include gram-negative and anaerobic coverage.
