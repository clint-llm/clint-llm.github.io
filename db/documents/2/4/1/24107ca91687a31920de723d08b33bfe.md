Lichen striatusÂ exhibits a histological pattern of inflammation known as lichenoid infiltrate of the epidermis, specifically, showing diffuse epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis). There may also be several melanophages present in the uppermost layer of the dermis, and apoptotic keratinocytes are also typically observed throughout the epidermis. The infiltrate typically extends to involve eccrine structures.
