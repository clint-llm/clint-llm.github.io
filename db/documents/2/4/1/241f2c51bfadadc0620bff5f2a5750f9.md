A thorough history will likely include the following:

- whether there is visible hairlessness (alopecia) or an increased amount of hair falling out daily (effluvium)

- age at onset of hair loss

- time course

- progression

- distribution, such as focal (patchy), patterned, or diffuse

- accompanying symptoms

- gynecological and obstetrics history for females

- dietary history

- family history of hair loss

- recent or current medications

Recent environmental exposures and surgical history may also be part of a relevant history.

A complete skin evaluation, including the scalp, face, and nails, should be conducted. When examining the scalp, position the patient in a chair rather than on an exam table, and use good lighting and possibly magnification to ensure proper inspection.

The hair pull test may help evaluate patients with excessive hair shedding. Grasp a group of approximately 40 to 60 hairs, apply firm but gentle traction away from the scalp, and repeat in 3 to 4 areas. Traditionally, more than 10% of hairs (4 to 6) pulled from the scalp is a positive test. A more recently recommended cutoff for a positive test is more than 3 hairs per 60 hairs removed.

Extracted hair can be examined with light microscopy to determine the phase (anagen or telogen) and whether the hair is broken or dystrophic. The roots in each growth phase can be counted, with more than 20% in the telogen phase indicating increased hair shedding.

**Nonscarring alopecias**

Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern hair loss) in males usually presents as a receding hairline and hair miniaturization on the vertex, bitemporal, and mid-frontal scalp. Females typically present with prominent central scalp and minimal frontal hairline involvement. The hair pull test is usually negative, and dermoscopy will likely show an increased number of thin and vellus hairs, heterogenous hair shaft thickness, perifollicular pigmentation, and a variable number of yellow dots (sebaceous glands) without scarring.

Alopecia areata commonly presents with patchy hair loss on the scalp and, less commonly, total scalp hair loss (alopecia totalis) or complete loss of all body hair (alopecia universalis). The skin within the alopecic area(s) is smooth and intact without scarring or signs of inflammation. The hair pull test is performed at the border of a patchy lesion and the contralateral clinically unaffected side. A positive test indicates active disease, and a negative test indicates the disease is stable or resolving. A positive pull test on the clinically unaffected side may indicate disease progression toward alopecia totalis. Dermoscopy will likely show vellus hairs (associated with remission or long-standing disease), broken hairs, black dots, and yellow dots. Exclamation mark hairs, usually seen in the periphery of active lesions, are pathognomonic for alopecia areata. Nail pitting and, in severe cases, trachyonychia (rough, longitudinally ridged nails) may be seen.

The Severity of Alopecia Tool or SALT score can help guide therapeutic decision-making and monitor the therapeutic response in patients with alopecia areata.

Telogen effluvium typically presents with hair loss over the entire scalp. The presence of inflammation, scaling, pustules, or scarring suggests other diagnoses. A positive hair pull test performed on multiple scalp sites strongly suggests active shedding associated with telogen effluvium. Examining the hair shafts with light microscopy can confirm the loose hairs are telogen hairs; dermoscopy may help distinguish chronic telogen effluvium (hair loss for more than 6 months) from female pattern hair loss, with the latter demonstrating more variability in hair diameter.

**Scarring alopecias**

Vano-Galvan et al and Tolkachjov et al have proposed FFA diagnostic criteria.

Major Criteria:

- Cicatricial alopecia of the frontal, temporal, or frontotemporal scalp on examination, in the absence of follicular keratotic papules on the body

- Diffuse bilateral eyebrow alopecia

Minor Criteria:

- Typical trichoscopic features: perifollicular erythema, follicular hyperkeratosis, or both

- Histopathologic features of cicatricial alopecia in the pattern of FFA and LPP on biopsy

- Involvement (hair loss or perifollicular erythema) of additional FFA sites: occipital area, facial hair, sideburns, or body hair

- Noninflammatory facial papules

LPP characteristically presents as multiple, pruritic, patchy alopecic areas on the scalp vertex, with follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema along the periphery of the scarring lesions. The hair pull test may demonstrate anagen hair with thick root sheaths. Scalp dermoscopy may show peripilar casts (concentrically arranged scale encircling an emerging hair shaft), perifollicular erythema and scaling, and follicular keratotic plugs.

In 2010, an LPP activity index was introduced by Chiang et al to assess clinical activity.
