The complexity of the anatomy of the supraclavicular fossa allows for an extensive differential diagnosis for regional pathology, which categorizes into neoplastic, congenital, and infectious etiologies. Neoplastic conditions can result in supraclavicular lymph node enlargement due to either a primary neoplasm (such as lymphoma) or metastatic spread from an external location. Primary malignancies that can metastasize to the region include but are not limited to those from the breast, lung, reproductive organs, gastrointestinal tract, or thyroid. FNA can be used to establish the primary neoplasm. Of note, a left-sided enlarged node in the supraclavicular fossa referred to as Virchow’s node can herald advanced gastrointestinal malignancy.

Congenital anomalies that result in supraclavicular masses can be due to abnormal development of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.

Finally, an infection can cause lymphadenopathy resulting in cystic supraclavicular masses. The causes of infection vary based on location and include but are not limited to streptococcal, staphylococcal, fungal, and mycobacterial sources.
