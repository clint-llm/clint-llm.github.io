Once deformity is corrected by manipulation and serial casting, there is still a high chance of relapse. Hence postoperative rehabilitation plays a significant role in preventing this, which includes bracing and stretching. Parents must ensure that their child wears a brace for at least 23 hours a day for the initial three months and then a minimum of 12 to 14 hours a day for at least two years.

Parents are also trained in stretching exercises for their child’s foot, which need to be performed every time when changing the diaper to maintain foot flexibility.
