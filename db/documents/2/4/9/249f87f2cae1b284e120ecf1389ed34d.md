According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incidence of SIDS in 2017 was 35.4 per 100,000 live births in the United States. Prior to the introduction of campaigns to reduce SIDS deaths, death rates were noted to vary significantly between Asian populations, aboriginal people in Australia, the population of the United Kingdom, the population of the United States, and the population of New Zealand. Death rates varied from as low as 0.3 deaths per 1000 live births (among Asian populations in the US and Bangladeshi's in the UK) to 7.4 deaths per 100 live births (in the Maori people in New Zealand). Cultural norms, child-rearing practices, and socioeconomic factors appear to explain the variation.

Studies suggest that 95% of the SIDS cases were associated with at least one risk factor, and 78% of the cases were associated with at least two risk factors.

A history of apnea and upper respiratory infection is not SIDS risk factors. Although controversial, studies identify parents sleeping in the same room (in a different bed) breastfeeding, pacifier use, fan use, and immunization as protective factors.

Siblings of SIDS infants have an increased risk of dying as a result of SIDS. Siblings are 5-6 times more likely to die from SIDS than the general population.
