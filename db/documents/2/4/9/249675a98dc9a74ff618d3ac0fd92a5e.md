The evaluation of persistent sinus tachycardia at rest involves a careful assessment of first whether tachycardia is an appropriate response and then focus on identifying the underlying cause. The assessment can include an electrocardiogram, 24-hour Holter recording, pulse oximetry, echocardiogram, arterial blood gas, lactic acid level, chest radiograph, D-dimer, chest computed tomography with angiography,ventilation-perfusion scan, cardiac enzymes levels, glucose level, electrolytes, complete blood count, and/or a toxicology screen.

Clinicians often first perform an electrocardiogram to confirm the presence of sinus tachycardia and to rule out the presence of other tachydysrhythmias.
