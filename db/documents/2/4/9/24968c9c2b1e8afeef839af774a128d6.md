The variation in the size of the cerebral ventricles has been known to be associated with schizophrenia. Studies have shown that the ventricular-brain ratio (VBR) of chronic schizophrenic patients is larger than their age-matched controls. The VBR is also directly correlated to the cognitive impairment of schizophrenic patients. But, whether the increased ventricular size isÂ the cause or the effect of schizophrenia is a topic for further investigation.
