The majority of children with cow's milk allergy are first seen by the primary caregivers including the pediatrician, family physician, and nurse practitioner. In most cases, avoidance of milk can solve the problem but since milk products are ubiquitous, the risk of an allergy cannot always be eliminated. Patients with continued allergies need to be referred to a specialist.

An allergist is best to diagnose a cow's milk allergy, but usually, the primary care provider will handle long-term care and monitoring. The patient and family should receive counseling and education on the medical condition and the importance of avoidance of foods containing cowâ€™s milk protein. Parents need to be educated by the primary clinicians that cow's milk allergy can be a medical emergency, and if there is a history of rapid reaction or anaphylaxis, then epinephrine should be carried at all times.

Cow's milk allergy requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists (most notably an allergist), specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. The family may be educated by the pediatric nurse, who provides updates to the rest of the team. Pharmacists may be involved in formula selection and assist in medication review. [Level 5]
