Researchers previously hypothesized that the faster dissociation of atypical antipsychotics from the dopamine receptor, compared to typical antipsychotics, explained the reduced incidence of EPS. However, a recent study by Sykes utilized a novel time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer assay to demonstrate that binding kinetics and association rates, not dissociation, correlate more with EPS.
