Electrodiagnostic testing is a valuable technique to evaluate a patient with a suspected myopathy. The standard test usually includes nerve conduction studies and needle EMG examination. The care of patients with disorders of muscle often involves different specialties, including neurologists, rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, primary care providers, physical and occupational therapists, speech pathologists, cardiologists, and others.

The traditional approach to diagnosis has evolved in the era of breakthroughs in molecular genetics and neuroimaging and requires a tailored approach to each patient where an electrodiagnostic study is required. Enhancement of knowledge about electrodiagnostic studies and their role in diagnosing neuromuscular disorders among different healthcare providers will improve the appropriateness of referrals and yield of the tests.

Overall, electrodiagnostic testing is safe and well-tolerated by most patients.Â  However, sometimes it can cause sufficient patient discomfort leading to aborted study or inconclusive results. It has been shown that a lack of information or incorrect information about the test is associated with higher anticipated pain and test failure in some patients.

Improving communications, expanding knowledge of principles, indications, and limitations of the electrodiagnostic evaluation and its role in the patient workup, and further management help make timely clinical decisions and improve treatment outcomes.
