The presence of cardiac calcifications is age-dependent. Around 90% of men and 67% of women older than the age of 70 years have such calcifications (particularly the coronary artery calcifications). According to one study, the prevalence of coronary calcification in Whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and Chinese males is 70.4%, 52.1%, 56.5%, and 59.2%, respectively, and in females is 44.6%, 36.5%, 34.9%, and 41.9% respectively.
