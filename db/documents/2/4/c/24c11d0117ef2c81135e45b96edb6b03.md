Cricothyrotomy is probably the most extensively used medical technique involving a small incision in the cricothyroid membrane to establish an airway in life-threatening situations. Nevertheless, the most critical surgical consideration of the laryngeal surgery is the iatrogenic injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve in thyroid surgery. Usually, before and following thyroid surgery recurrent laryngeal nerve integrity is confirmed by an indirect laryngoscopy. Hence, surgeons rely heavily on intraoperative landmarks to identify and evade the recurrent laryngeal nerve. These landmarks include but are not restricted to, ligament of Berry, inferior thyroid artery and tubercle of Zuckerkandl, among others.
