Zidovudine is a synthetic analog of the nucleoside thymidine classified as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI). Zidovudine functions as an anti-viral agent by being incorporated into newly made viral DNA in place of thymidine and acting as a viral DNA chain terminator. This inhibits the ability of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase to make viral DNA from the RNA template, which interferes with the HIV-1 life cycle.

Zidovudine requires intracellular conversion by host cell kinases to be transformed to the active triphosphate form.

The antiretroviral effects of zidovudine seen with HIV-1 are also the assumed mechanism of action for adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, caused by the retroviral human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1).

The bioavailability of zidovudine is around 64%, with food only slowing the absorption and not reducing the amount absorbed. About 14% of zidovudine is renally excreted unchanged, and 74% is renally excreted as zidovudine 5'-glucuronide after being glucuronidated. A small portion is also metabolized by other microsomal pathways.
