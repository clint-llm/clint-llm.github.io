Abscesses can occur when the worms migrate to other tissue sites like lung, pericardium, spinal cord. Occasionally sepsis can occur due to systemic infections and cellulitis. If the worm breaks before it is completely extruded from the skin, this can lead to severe inflammatory reaction, pain, swelling, and cellulitis. In some cases, the worm can die before it emerges from the skin and it can become calcified and encapsulated, this causes chronic recurrent pain and swelling. When the worms pass through the joints, it can cause joint pain and contractures.
