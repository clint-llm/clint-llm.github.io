- Uncal herniation occurs because of a lesion that overwhelms the ability of the three components in the cranium to compensate for pressure increases.

- The cardinal signs of uncal herniation are an acute loss of consciousness associated with ipsilateral pupillary dilation and contralateral hemiparesis.

- Anisocoria is a cause for concern, and its cause should be sought.

- CT scan is the preferred imaging technique over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the emergent setting as it can be completed quickly and  CT imaging technology is more available

- Uncal herniation can is reversible if recognized early and treated aggressively.
