Uterine corpus cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy in American women with over 60,000 new cases expected during the next year and accounting for nearly 11,000 deaths.****Endometrial carcinomas account for the greatest number of these cases, as fewer than 10% of uterine corpus cancers are sarcomas. Endometrioid carcinomas compose more than 83% of uterine corpus cancers. More virulent serous and papillary serous carcinomas make up some 4% to 6% of endometrial carcinomas, and 1% to 2% are clear cell carcinomas.
