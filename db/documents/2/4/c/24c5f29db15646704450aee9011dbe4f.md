The new classification of ASD in the DSM-5 presents challenges and limitations for monitoring ASD prevalence over time.

Co-existence with other psychiatric and physical disorders is a common phenomenon in ASD (>70%), particularly in young children. This may have great effects on the patient and family functioning as well as clinical management. Intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), tic disorders, anxiety, depression, and epilepsy are common co-occurring conditions associated with ASD, while ADHD, depression, bipolar disorders, anxiety, and tic disorders, are common co-occurring conditions associated with AS and HFA subpopulation of ASD.
