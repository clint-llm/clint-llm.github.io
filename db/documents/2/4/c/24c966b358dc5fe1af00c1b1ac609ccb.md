Exercise has demonstrated many health benefits.

- Cognition: Studies have shown exercising subjects to have higher concentration scores than non-exercising subjects.

- Flexibility and mobility

- Cardiovascular health

- Improved glycemic control and insulin sensitivity

- Mood elevation

- Lower risks of cancer

- Increased bone mineral density

Through a properly executed exercise program, the body adapts and becomes more efficient at performing various exercises.

Some of these adaptations are:

Musculoskeletal system

- Increased muscle capillary perfusion

- Increased strength due to muscle hypertrophy

- Increased endurance due to increased muscular mitochondrial content

- Increased bone density

Cardiovascular

- Improved contractility

- Increased blood vessel diameter

- Increased capillary density

- Improved vasodilation

- Decreased average blood pressure at rest or submaximal activity due to the increased efficiency
