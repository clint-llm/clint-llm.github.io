Donepezil is most commonly used for the treatment of Alzheimer dementia and is FDA approved for use in mild, moderate, and severe Alzheimer disease. It is crucial to educate the family and caregivers that donepezil does not alter the progression of Alzheimer disease. However, it can alleviate some symptoms by improving cognition and/or behavior. Healthcare professionals, including clinicians, need to be aware of the benefits and limitations of donepezil when prescribing to older adults. After starting treatment, prescribers should follow up for cognition and behavior assessments to assess treatment efficacy, drug tolerance and check cholinergic excess symptoms. A pharmacist consult should include verifying dosing, performing medication reconciliation, looking for drug-drug interactions, and reporting to the prescriber if any issues. Nurses should monitor for adverse effects, evaluate medication compliance and therapeutic effectiveness. Management of dementia needs an interprofessional team approach, including health care professionals such as clinicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, pharmacists, family, and caregivers, all engaged in the collaborative activity and open communication to drive optimal patient outcomes.
