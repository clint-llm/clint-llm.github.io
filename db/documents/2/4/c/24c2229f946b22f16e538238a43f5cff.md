Cosmetic injury is a common complication of Basidiobolomycosis and Conidiobolomycosis, which occurs due to progressive disfigurement from intractable fibrosis and scarring. Fibrosis and scarring can cause lymphatic obstruction and lymphedema, leading to further disfigurement with loss of function of the infected area. Conidiobolomycosis can be complicated with facial elephantiasis, i.e., enlargement and hardening of tissue due to edema, hypertrophy, and fibrosis of the subcutaneous and skin tissue due to obstruction of lymphatic vessels. Facial elephantiasis is associated with persistent or progressive rhinofacial conidiobolomycosis.
