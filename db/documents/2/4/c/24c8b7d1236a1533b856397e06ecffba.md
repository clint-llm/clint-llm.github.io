Patients are encouraged to seek guidance and support from advocacy groups for patients and family members with spinal cord injury. The Christopher and Diana Reeve Foundation provides resources for both patients and caregivers of people with spinal cord paralysis including information on insurance, disability, and rehabilitation services. Online community support is also available. Additional resources include the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA.org), which promotes research, awareness, community support, and adaptive sports competitions. The United Spinal Association (unitedspinal.org) also serves as a large advocacy organization online and is replete with resources for patients and those hoping to support spinal injury patients with donations, peer support, and political advocacy for disability rights.
