This may involve modifications in valve leaflets, annulus, chordae tendineae, or papillary muscles. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tricuspid regurgitation and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the tricuspid valve and how it is affected by insufficiency.
- Recall the causes of tricuspid insufficiency.
- Summarize the treatment options for tricuspid insufficiency.
- Examine the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by tricuspid insufficiency.
