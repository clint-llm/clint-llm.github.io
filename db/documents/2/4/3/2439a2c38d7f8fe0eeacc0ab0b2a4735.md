The origin of each condition varies by type and is influenced by multiple factors. The development process for each variation is not entirely understood.

Malformation occurs in embryogenesis, during days 30 to 56 of gestation.

Environmental factors also influence cardiac structural formation. Risk factors include:

- Increasing parental age

- Phenylketonuria, pregestational diabetes, febrile illnesses, influenza, maternal rubella, anticonvulsants, ibuprofen, sulfasalazine, thalidomide, trimethoprim-sulfonamide, retinoids, marijuana, and organic solvents

- Lithium is associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, specifically at higher doses and with use during the first trimester

Key univentricular variations and typical features:

- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS): The left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve, and aorta are underdeveloped.

- Tricuspid atresia: The tricuspid valve fails to develop, leading to an underdeveloped right ventricle.

- Ebstein anomaly: Abnormal development of tricuspid valve leaflets causes right ventricular atrialization. The anomaly is associated with various cardiac structural abnormalities, including pulmonary valve pathologies, septal defects, and electrical conduction lesions.

- Double outlet right ventricle: The aorta and the pulmonary artery exit from the right ventricle, leaving the left ventricle underdeveloped.

- Double inlet left ventricle: Both atria connect to the left ventricle, resulting in an underdeveloped right ventricle.

- Atrioventricular canal defect: An atrial or ventricular septal defect forms large enough to make a functionally single ventricle.
