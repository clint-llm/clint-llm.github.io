The typical clinical features that a patient with diffuse esophageal spasm presents with are:

1. The most prominent and imminent feature for DES is the presentation of dysphagia that can occur with both solids and liquids.

2. Globus hystericus in which the patient presents with a sensation of an object getting trapped on the back of the throat.

3.  Chest pain which is noncardiac in nature, retrosternal in presentation, and with the possibility of radiating to the back. It accounts for less than 10% of cases of noncardiac chest pain. In some instances, it can even present with a much more severe presentation than characteristic anginal features.

4. Patients with DES can also complain of occasional regurgitation of the undigested food.

5. The association of DES with GERD can also lead to heartburn which can sometimes lead to a challenging diagnosis.

The usual presentation is intermittent dysphagia with occasional chest pain. Pain might manifest upon eating quickly or consuming hot or cold beverages. DES is commonly associated with comorbidities like anxiety and depression.
