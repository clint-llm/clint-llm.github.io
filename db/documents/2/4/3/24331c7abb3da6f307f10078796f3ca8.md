Berger disease is a common cause of primary glomerulonephritis and it involves the deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium. It is a cause of progressive kidney disease in many of the affected patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Berger disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Berger disease.
- Identify the role of IgA in the pathophysiology of Berger disease.
- Summarize the use of urinalysis and renal biopsy in the evaluation of Berger disease.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to educate the patient on blood pressure control and proper diet in preventing kidney disease from progressing improving outcomes for patients affected by Berger disease.
