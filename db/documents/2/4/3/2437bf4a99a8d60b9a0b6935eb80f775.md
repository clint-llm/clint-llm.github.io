Although present at any stage in life, Eustachian tube dysfunction is more prevalent in children due to the need for further growth of the Eustachian tube. Compared to adults, pediatric Eustachian tubes have a shallow angle to the horizontal plane, increasing the risk of poor middle ear secretion and resulting otitis media with effusion.

Sequalae of ETD include episodes of acute otitis media or otitis media with effusion- with subsequent progression towards speech and hearing problems, disturbances in attention, limited vocabulary, and sleep deprivation. This reduces the child’s overall quality of life, in addition to causing stress and concern for the parent/caregiver.

Often schoolteachers or parents may highlight initial concerns regarding the child's hearing or disruptive behavior within the class setting, prompting the family physician to perform a thorough otology examination and subsequent referral for further investigations.

Audiologists perform a pivotal role by determining the severity, type, and laterality of hearing loss in the patient, enabling clinicians to appropriately counsel families regarding reduced hearing and the potential impact. Speech and language pathologists may discuss strategies for minimizing the impact within the home and learning environment (e.g., preferential seating in the front of the classroom, facing the child and speaking clearly, using visual cues, etc.).

With this holistic care between different health professionals, the physician can focus on patient-based care and appropriately decide between conservative, medical, or surgical (e.g., adenoidectomy and tympanostomy tube insertion) management based on the patient’s own needs.
