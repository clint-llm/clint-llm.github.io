Transanal excision of rectal cancer is indicated for treating benign polyps or early-stage cancers in selected patients.

For malignant lesions, local excision using transanal microsurgery is accepted for T1N0 rectal cancers. T1 rectal cancers are further subdivided into sm1 (submucosal invasion of fewer than 1000 micrometers), sm2, and sm3 (submucosal invasion of greater than 1000 micrometers), depending on the depth of submucosal invasion. Nodal involvement in sm1 is 0 to 1.8% compared with 12.8 to 13.8% in sm2 or sm3, thereby significantly increasing the chance of recurrence.Â As a result, the European Society for Medical Oncology recommends local excision for T1 sm1 rectal cancers and rectal resection with total mesorectal excision for sm2 and sm3.

Furthermore, rectal microsurgery can treat a variety of benign or premalignant lesions, including rectal polyps, solitary rectal ulcers, rectal stenosis, and prolapse.
