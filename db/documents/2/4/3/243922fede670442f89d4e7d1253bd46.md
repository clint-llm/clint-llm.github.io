IgA nephropathy is an autoimmune disease causing antibody-mediated destruction of the glomerular basement membrane.

**Familial**

- Less than 10% of cases are due to familial IgA nephropathy

- Genome-wide linkage analysis revealed an association of IgA nephropathy to 6q22-23 and gene locus IGAN1

- There are no obvious genes within the linked interval

- It is unclear that genetic findings in these families will have a direct bearing on typical sporadic cases of IgA nephropathy

**Sporadic/idiopathic**

- More than 90% of cases are sporadic, and the underlying etiology is unknown

- No evidence to suggest the involvement ofÂ a particular infectious agent despite the association between macroscopic hematuria and mucosal inflammation

- No evidence to point toward hypersensitivity to food antigens, with the exception of a small group of patients with celiac disease

- Abnormal O-glycosylation of the IgA1 hinge region promotes the formation of circulating IgA immune complexes leading to mesangial cell activation and deposition

- IgA nephropathy may also be seen in hepatitis, cirrhosis, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
