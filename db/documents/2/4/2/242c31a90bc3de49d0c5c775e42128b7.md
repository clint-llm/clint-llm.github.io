Hunt and Rankin first named this disease in 1915 after noting it was distinct from typhoid, dengue, and relapsing fever.Rickettsia was made in 1919 when Arkwright et al. detected that when lice fed on patients with the disease, they excreted Rickettsia quintana, unlike when feeding on those who were not suffering from trench fever. Finally, Arkwright et al. noted that via direct inoculation by volunteers, the rickettsial connection to lice showed increased virulence.Rickettsia quintana to Rochalimaea quintana and is now known as Bartonella quintana.

Trench fever caused an epidemic and became a significant source of morbidity and mortality in World War I, affecting more than 1 million soldiers. It then re-emerged in World War II but did not have the same morbidity and mortality as in World War 1. Since it has caused several other outbreaks around the globe, including Ethiopia in 1964, Poland in 1949, Mexico in 1954, USSR in 1960, and Tunisia in 1961.
