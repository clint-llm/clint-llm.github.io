The most important aspects of preparation are elicitation of patient preferences in NAC reconstruction and assessing the contralateral native NAC (if present). While there are aesthetic ideals for the NAC position in the literature, it is useful to allow the patient to mark the position of the new NAC using an electrocardiogramÂ lead pad in front of a mirror. In unilateral reconstruction, it is important to study the NAC on the unoperated breast to guide the positioning, orientation, size, and shape of the new nipple.

Informed consent should discuss complications of NAC reconstruction, which include partial or total nipple necrosis and loss of nipple projection.
