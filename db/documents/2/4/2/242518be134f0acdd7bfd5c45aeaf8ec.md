A systematic and thorough evaluation of the laryngeal structures and the patient's voice is vital in order to determine an effective strategy for vocal therapy exercises. Clinical evaluation for dysphonic patients is carried out in three steps:

- 
**History Taking**

- 
**Physical Evaluation**

- 
**Examination**

The history-taking involves ascertaining medical, surgical, psychological, or traumatic information that leads to diagnosing and tailoring treatment to the patient. Part of this process is the vocal evaluation, which requires understanding the anomaly and how it affects activities of daily life, such as professional commitments or personal communication. Listening to the pitch, volume, and quality of the voice will help the clinician determine the type of problem. Detailed vocal evaluation leads to a better understanding of the underlying pathology and, therefore, a more appropriate intervention.

Physical examination includes a complete ear, nose, and throat examination after assessing voice quality, loudness, and range. The purpose of the assessment is to focus on nasal airway patency, pharyngeal function, and velopharyngeal competency. Some patients may need pulmonary function studies if they exhibit insufficient expiratory force or volume that leads to an alteration of the voice, compromising the normal pattern of synchronized respiration and phonation. Hearing evaluation may also be important, as hearing loss can influence a patient's perception of their own voice and therefore alter its production.

Laryngoscopy is the most important step in the diagnosis of vocal dysfunction. There are multiple methods of visualizing the larynx, including mirror laryngoscopy, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, distal chip laryngoscopy, digital transoral laryngoscopy, and stroboscopy. Stroboscopy provides the greatest amount of information when evaluating the mucosal wave of the vocal cords.

Due to the heterogeneity of functional voice disorders, assessment should also be evaluated for psychogenic and muscle tension pathologies. Psychogenic voice disorders and muscle tension voice disorders are treated by speech-language pathologists (SLPs) who use symptomatic behavioral voice therapy along with counseling and, potentially, psychotherapy.

The presentation of functional voice disorders can take many forms (dysphonia, stuttering, or prosodic abnormalities) and may mimic organic disorders, such that diagnosis can be difficult. A thorough examination, correct diagnosis, and proper treatment are critical. Functional or psychogenic disorders and behavioral movement disorders can be challenging to differentiate based solely on observable speech and voice disturbances; many behavioral and neurological conditions can mimic symptoms of organic voice conditions.
