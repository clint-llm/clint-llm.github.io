The NETT, published in 2003, was a randomized control trial across 17 institutions with over 1,000 patients enrolled to determine the effect of medical therapy compared to medical therapy and LVRS. Inclusion criteria for NETT included:

- Body mass index (BMI) less than 32 kg/m2

- Forced-expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 45% predicted

- The arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of less than 60 mm Hg

- The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of greater than 45 mm Hg

- A 6-min walk test distance of greater than 140 m

- No smoking for at least 4 months before initial screening

Surgical patients in NETT had an average PaO2 of 64 (+/- 10) mm Hg and PaCO2 of 43 (+/- 6) mm Hg.
