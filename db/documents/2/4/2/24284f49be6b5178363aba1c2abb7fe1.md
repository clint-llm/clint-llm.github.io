Subungual hematomas are injuries of the nail bed in which bleeding develops under the nail. Patients usually complain of pain and discoloration of the nail. The damage is caused by a direct blow or a crush injury to the distal phalanx, for example, getting a finger pinched in a doorway. As blood enters the space it applies painful pressure to the nail-bed. The injury may also be accompanied by distal phalanx fractures, nail avulsion, or finger-tip avulsions. Most subungual hematomas can be relieved with simple trephination, a procedure which involves making a small hole in the nail. Unless the pressure is relieved, the patient may experience severe pain. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of nailbed injuries and discusses how the interprofessional team provides evaluation, treatment, and patient education in regards to this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify indications for subungal hematoma trephination.
- Describe anatomy pertaining to the injuries of the finger that result in subungal hematoma.
- Describe appropriate follow up instructions for the management of subungal hematoma.
- Outline the techniques and management of subungual hematoma and address how an interprofessional team can improve care.
