Organizations like USPSTF and ACS are periodically reviewing the available evidence and are updating their recommendations as more trials continue to see the real benefits of screening and early diagnosis in terms of survival and mortality benefits. It is essential for primary care providers to keep up with the changes in screening guidelines. Primary care physicians have an essential role to play in terms of determining the screening eligibility and engaging in informed decision making discussion and coordinating care with a specialist. Issues with insurance and affordability should be addressed at the institutional level and nonprofit organizations and patients should be guided to them appropriately when available. Having handouts in clinics, pharmacies and common public places including grocery shops have created huge awareness among the public. It is up to the providers now to make the right recommendations of screening for our patients based on age and risk factors.
