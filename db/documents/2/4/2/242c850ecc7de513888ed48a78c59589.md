Amino acids are organic compounds that consist of alpha carbon in the center, hydrogen (H), amino (-NH2), carboxyl (-COOH), and specific R (side chain) groups. One linear chain of amino acids is called a polypeptide, and one or more polypeptides make up a protein. There are 20 major types of amino acids found in proteins, of which the differences are the side chains (R groups) that contain various chemical structures. This R group gives each amino acid and, finally, each protein-specific characteristic. These features include size, shape, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, interactions, polarity, and pH level. Each of these characteristics is crucial for the stability of the proteins in the human body and environment.
