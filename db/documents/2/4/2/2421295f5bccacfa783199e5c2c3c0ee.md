Cryoanalgesia was once used by several healthcare professionals to manage pain. However, today its use is limited because of better options. Healthcare workers like the primary care provider, pain specialist, anesthesiologist, anesthesia nurse and internist who use cryoanalgesiaÂ should educate the patient on possible complications that includes neuroma formation, which can be more painful than the original pain. Follow up of patients is important to ensure that they have acquired pain relief.
