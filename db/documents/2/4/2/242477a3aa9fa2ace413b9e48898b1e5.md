A perinephric abscess can result from complications of pyelonephritis or hematogenous spread of infection. An abscess is usually diffuse liquefaction between the Gerota’s fascia and renal capsule. Symptoms are nonspecific and usually include flank pain, fever and sometimes dysuria. Laboratory evidence of pyuria and proteinuria may also be present. Inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP are usually elevated.

A perinephric abscess should be considered in a patient who does not improve despite appropriate antibiotics therapy. CT with contrast is the best imaging modality for diagnosis of perinephric abscess and evaluation of abscess extension into surrounding organs.

Surgery is indicated in the setting of anatomic abnormality and when the abscess is too large for effective percutaneous catheter drainage and antibiotics treatment.

Empiric treatment depends on causative organism and should cover gram-negative organisms and S. aureus. Initial antibiotic therapy should be given parenterally. Fever can persist for up to 4 to 5 days on appropriate antibiotic therapy. Parenteral therapy should be continued till final susceptibilities are available. Therapy can be de-escalated to oral antibiotics 48 hours after resolution of symptoms such as fever.
