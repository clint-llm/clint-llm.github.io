In 2013 the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) published guidelines on TT insertion in children:

- "Bilateral chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) for three months or longer AND documented hearing loss.

- Unilateral or bilateral OME for three months or longer AND reduced quality of life, ear discomfort, poor school performance, behavioral problems, vestibular problems, or other symptoms that could be attributable to OME.

- Recurrent acute otitis media (RAOM), defined as three episodes of AOM in 6 months or four episodes in 12 months treated with antibiotics, WITH unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy.

- At-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME, which is unlikely to resolve quickly for three months or longer. At-risk children are defined as those with permanent hearing loss independent of OME, speech and language delay, developmental disorders including autism, syndromes or craniofacial disorders which include cognitive, speech, or language delays, blindness or an uncorrectable visual impairment, cleft palate, or developmental delay."

In children undergoing repeat TT placement, or children age four years and older receiving their 1 set of TT, adenoidectomy should be considered at the time of TT placement to decrease the risk of repeat surgery.
