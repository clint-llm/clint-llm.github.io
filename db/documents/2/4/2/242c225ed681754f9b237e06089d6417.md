The dive reflex has been shown to be an effective means by which to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). Current medical literature supports several techniques that can trigger the dive response, the most common being a cold application to the face to increase vagal tone. However, at this present time, there is no data or studies that support a best practice approach in terms of equipment to use, duration of application, or optimal temperature range for therapeutically treating PSVT. Thus, further studies and research must be conducted to provide evidence-based information that reveals the optimal methods of inducing the dive reflex to alleviate PSVT.

In addition to further research needed to determine the most effective maneuver in the clinical setting to elicit the dive response, there are other limitations of study for the dive reflex. Although there have been significant advancements in current research equipment and technology the dive reflex has proven difficult to study in its entirety due to the aquatic conditions a subject must be present in to trigger the response. Specifically, cardiovascular adaptations in mammals during water submersion are only moderately understood due to the technical difficulty of studying mammals while completely submerged in water.
