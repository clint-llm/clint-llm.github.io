The pathophysiology involves blood flow diversion from the brain territories to the arm, causing symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, especially during the vigorous exercise of the arm or sudden sharp turning of the head in the direction of the affected side. The symptoms arise due to two types of mechanisms by which the arm "steals" blood flow from the vertebrobasilar territory; 1) a lack of blood supply because of subclavian artery stenosis or 2) rarely malformation disease, that may include an arteriovenous distal arm shunt.

The severity of subclavian steal is classified into three grades

- Grade I (pre-subclavian steal) - reduced antegrade vertebral flow.

- Grade II (intermittent/partial) - alternating flow - antegrade flow in the diastolic phase and retrograde flow in the systolic phase.

- Grade III (permanent/advanced) - permanent retrograde vertebral flow.

Coronary subclavian steal syndrome is another type of subclavian steal syndrome, described in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery using internal mammary artery (IMA) graft.
