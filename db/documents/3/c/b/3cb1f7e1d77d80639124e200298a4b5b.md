HO is typically evaluated radiographically. The Brooker Staging system is the most widely accepted classification system and includes four grades based on anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the pelvis and hip

**Brooker Staging System**

- Grade 1: Bone islands in the soft tissue around the hip

- Grade 2: Exophytes in the pelvis or proximal end of the femur with at least 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces

- Grade 3: Exophytes in the pelvis or proximal end of the femur with less than 1 cm between opposing bone surfaces

- Grade 4: Bony ankylosis between proximal femur and pelvis
