Diagnosis and management of ischemic cardiomyopathy require an interprofessional approach. This is carried out by cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, nurse practitioners, radiologists, pharmacists, nurses, dietician, technicians, and medical assistants. To make the diagnosis, different modalities are used as outlined above. Once the diagnostic tests are performed, cardiologists interpret them and clinically correlated based on history and physical examination. Radiologists read some imaging modalities such as cardiac MRI and nuclear stress tests. If the patient has multivessel coronary disease amenable to coronary bypass surgery, then cardiothoracic surgeons are involved. Post-intervention, the role of nurses, pharmacists, and patient-care facilitators is crucial; pharmacists will verify all prescribed drugs, check the dosing, and look for interactions, while nursing will perform administration and monitoring. Both pharmacists and nurses need to alert the clinicians of any issues they encounter, so therapy modification can take place if necessary. It is important the healthcare practitioners have the patient on the right medication regimen, so a pharmacy consult is in order. Medication adherence and affordability is key for successful, long-term management. Patient-care facilitators and social workers can help with the process. A dietician can assist in diet modification for better cardiovascular outcomes.
