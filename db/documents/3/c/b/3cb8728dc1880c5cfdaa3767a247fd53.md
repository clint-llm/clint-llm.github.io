Ulnar neuropathy is a relatively common condition seen in the outpatient clinical setting. A thorough history and physical examination are vital in determining the diagnosis. Electrodiagnostic studies can be used by primary care physicians, physiatrists, and neurologists to aid in confirming the diagnosis. If conservative measures, such as anti-inflammatory medications and bracing or splinting, are unsuccessful, orthopedic surgical intervention may be indicated. Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks can also be performed in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, complete hand blocks, and brachial plexus blocks.

Physical and occupational therapists can also help patients to perform activities of daily living and improve functionality. Effective collaboration amongst the various disciplines is necessary to ensure the best possible outcome for patients.
