Complications include the following:

- Infection due to skin flora entering the shunt, usually from Staphylococcus epidermidis

- Intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage

- Malposition

- Abdominal perforation during placement

- Shunt erosion of the skin with exposure of the system

- Shunt over drainage (slit ventricles)

- Shunt nephritis

- Shunt disconnection

- Shunt obstruction

- Subdural hematomas

- Abdominal CSF collections (pseudocyst or CSFoma)

- Shunt breakage at any point

- Catheter perforation of viscera and rarely extrusion through the anus

- Inguinal hernia

- Seizures

In those cases of malfunction, the shunt has to be assessed for proper function. The following technique is used:

- Clean the skin with an antiseptic

- Apply a sterile fenestrated drape over the incision site

- Insert a small (23 ga) butterfly needle perpendicular to the skin into the reservoir

- Evaluate for spontaneous CSF filling the line of the butterfly needle

- Measure the opening pressure using a manometer

- Aspirate CSF with syringe

- Collect 5 mL of CSF and place into sterile specimen containers

- Withdraw the needle from the reservoir

- Gauze applied to site

- Send the cerebrospinal fluid sample for cell count, glucose, protein, gram stain, and culture

Complications of a shunt tap are:

- Bleeding from subcutaneous vessels during the tap

- Cerebrospinal fluid leak from the puncture site

- Ventricular collapse due to rapid aspiration of CSF, especially in slit ventricles

- A misplaced tap can result in the sectioning of the tubing or the reservoir.
