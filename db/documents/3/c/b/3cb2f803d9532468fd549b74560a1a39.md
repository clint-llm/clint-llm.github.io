Each and every team member is responsible for monitoring the patient and being prepared for possible complications of the pancreatectomy. Whether laparoscopic or open, many of the complications are the same. Patients are at risk for the development of pancreatic fistula, postoperative diabetes, and splenic infarction. All of these complications, if not recognized and treated early, can severely affect the recovery of the patient. As the development of a pancreatic fistula can lead to malnutrition, skin excoriation, and infection, it is important to monitor the drain output, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and white blood cell count, especially in the case of infection. While postoperative diabetes can also occur from pancreatectomy, it is essential to monitor blood glucose levels and assess the need for insulin as the patient may become insulin-dependent for life. In this case, diabetic education is extremely important both in the preoperative and postoperative settings. When blood flow to the spleen is compromised, the spleen can cause infarct and die, leading to infection. Signs and symptoms of infection are the key elements that all team members should be aware of.
