Patients must understand the seriousness of their condition and that they may not return to full pre-disease function and strength. Medication and therapy adherence is crucial, as are frequent follow-ups. Patients should be monitored closely asÂ the immunosuppressive treatment continues for more than a year, and disease activity is measured with ANCA levels. Patients must be told the adverse effects of the drugs they use and when to report them.
