Gensure et al. performed a genome-wide scan followed by fine mapping of individuals known to have the ICH's autosomal dominant form. Subsequently, genes were sequenced, and PCR amplification was performed. Gel electrophoresis confirmed that the affected individuals had a missense mutation inÂ COL1A1 gene.
