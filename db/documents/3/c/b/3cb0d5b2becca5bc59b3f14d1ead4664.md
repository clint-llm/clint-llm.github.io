Wellens syndrome describes an abnormal electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern, deeply inverted T waves in leads V2 and V3, that are secondary to proximal LAD stenosis. Patients often present to the emergency department pain-free and elevated cardiac enzymes are usually normal or only slightly elevated. This activity highlights the role the interprofessional team has in suspecting Wellens syndrome based on ECG findings.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of Wellens syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Wellens syndrome.
- Summarize the prognosis of Wellens syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Wellens syndrome.
