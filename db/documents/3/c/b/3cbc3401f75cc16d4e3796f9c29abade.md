Poly-L-lactic acid is an absorbable, semi-permanent, injectable implant that can gradually restore volume and stimulate collagen formation. It is FDA-approved for the correction of facial fat loss associated with antiretroviral therapy-induced lipoatrophy in HIV patients. While this dermal filler is usually only injected by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, primary care providers and nurse practitioners should know which patients may benefit from poly-L-lactic acid. Patients need to be educated about its side effects, potential complications, and durability. With open communication between family clinicians, specialists, and nursing staff, patients can receive optimal benefits from poly-L-lactic acid when indicated. [Level 5]
