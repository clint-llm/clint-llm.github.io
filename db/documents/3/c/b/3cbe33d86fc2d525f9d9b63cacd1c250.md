Patients with measurable phosgene exposure, unknown exposure, or pulmonary findings should be observed and/or managed in a hospital setting. If the diagnostic evaluation is consistent with acute or impending hypoxic respiratory failure, then consultation with a critical care specialist is appropriate, as well as consideration regarding the potential benefit of ECMO. The step-down unitÂ in intensive care is appropriate with stable diagnostics and trending improvement. Patients may be admitted to floor-level management after at least 6 hours of stable observation. If there are signs of ophthalmic injury, consult an ophthalmologist.
