**Growth Factors and Cancer**

Genetic alterations in signal transduction pathways contribute to many cancer phenotypes such as increased cellular growth, cellular motility, and angiogenesis. One of the key pathways activated by growth factor binding (for example, EGF or insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1]) to a surface receptor is the PI3K/AKT pathway. When activated by a surface receptor, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) can phosphorylate and activate AKT, which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. Once activated by ATK, in turn, it promotes cell survival, cell motility, angiogenesis and also inhibits apoptosis.  Apoptosis is programmed cell death. Many cancer cells show resistance to apoptosis, giving these cells a survival advantage. Many of the processes activated by AKT are known to contribute to cancer. There has, therefore, been considerable effort to develop chemotherapeutic agents that block the activation of the AKT pathway.

Angiogenic growth factors important in cancer include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), which are both proteins. Tumor growth is very dependent upon the growth of new blood vessels, and blocking this process can kill tumor cells.
