Etiologically, myoclonus can be primary or secondary. Primary myoclonus can further be subdivided into physiological myoclonus (hypnic jerks which occur in normal individuals), essential myoclonus (idiopathic or hereditary), and epileptic myoclonus, while secondary myoclonus is also called 'symptomatic myoclonus, where the myoclonus is secondary to an underlying disorder.

Moreover, myoclonus can be subdivided by its anatomical origin into the following types:

- Cortical (includes post-hypoxic action myoclonus, primary generalized myoclonic seizures, primary generalized epileptic myoclonus, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy)

- Subcortical (includes essential myoclonus, reticular reflex myoclonus, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, hyperekplexia)

- Spinal (includes propriospinal myoclonus and segmental spinal myoclonus)

- Peripheral (includes hemifacial spasm)

Since functional myoclonus is among the most common functional movement disorders, it is crucial to differentiate it from organic myoclonus. This can be done through the localization of the movements. Features in favor of an organic cause over a functional cause of myoclonus include consistent phenomenology, insidious onset, or response to benzodiazepines or antiepileptic medication.
