The etiology of dyslipidemias is divided into primary and secondary causes.

**Primary Dyslipidemias**

These are a group of disorders caused by genetic defects in the synthesis, transport, or metabolism of lipoproteins and are typically present in childhood. These defects can be monogenic or polygenic.

**Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH):**Most common lipid disorder in the pediatric population.

**Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia:**The prevalence of heterozygous FH is 1 in 250-500. It is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that leads to high LDL levels. LDL levels in children are typically up to 2 or 3 times the upper limit and approach and exceed 160 mg/dL. This disorder is caused by LDL receptor mutations, hundreds of which have been described and include defects in synthesis, intracellular transport, ligand binding, and recycling of the receptor.

Children with heterozygous FH develop coronary atherosclerosis between 30 and 60 years.

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Homozygous FH is a rare condition with a prevalence rate of 1 in 1 million. It is caused by biallelic mutations inherited from both parents and is a much more severe presentation than the heterozygous version. LDL levels are often profoundly elevated, usually 4 to 6 times the normal range (above 400mg/dL), and not very responsive to medical therapies. Children will present with xanthomas and xanthelasmas in childhood, by five years of age, and have accelerated coronary atherosclerosis with myocardial infarction in the first decade and death from coronary artery disease in the second decade.

**Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCHL):**FCHL is the most common genetic dyslipidemia with a prevalence of 1:100. It is present in 40% of myocardial infarction survivors. It is an autosomal dominant condition with variable penetrance. FCHL presents with elevated TG, LDL-C, and apo-B levels and is believed to be from an overproduction of apo-B 100 levels.

FCHL characteristically has a strong family history of dyslipidemia, and the presentation can be either isolated high LDL and non-HDL-C or isolated hypertriglyceridemia or a combination of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Apo-B 100 levels are typically over 120 mg/dl. Phenotypic expression is generally triggered by a secondary factor such as obesity, puberty, medications, or diabetes. One unique feature of FCHL is that there can be variability in lipid profile in the same patient over time, and can be affected by diet, weight, and exercise.

**Combined Dyslipidemia (CD):**CD is now the most common form of dyslipidemia seen in childhood and is characterized by moderate to a severe elevation of TG and non-HCL cholesterol levels and reduced HDL levels. 30 to 60% of youth with obesity have CD. It is associated with visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. CD is responsive to weight loss, diet, and lifestyle changes. Pharmacotherapy with statins, omega-3 fish oils, and fibrates can be considered for children who are not responsive to pharmacotherapy.

**Familial Chylomicronemia:**Familial Chlymicronemia is autosomal recessive and caused by loss of function mutation in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or LPL gene regulators. Lack of LPL activity leads to reduced or absent hydrolysis of chylomicrons and increased serum TG levels. It is characterized by markedly elevated TG levels (above 1000 mg/dl) and recurrent pancreatitis along with the characteristic lipemic-looking serum.

Other findings such as hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis along with tuberoeruptive xanthomas can be seen. Management includes keeping patient NPO, and plasmapheresis may be needed. Once TG levels are under 1000-2000 mg/dl, a stringent fat restriction of less than 15 gm per day is needed. Heterozygous mutations may present with mild to moderate TG elevation.

**Familial Hypertriglyceridemia (FHTG):**FHTG is autosomal dominant dyslipidemia with a prevalence of 5 to 10% and is expressed predominantly in adulthood. FHTG presents with a moderate elevation of TG in the 200-500 mg/dl range with low to normal LDL and HDL-C levels. It is a disorder caused by the overproduction of VLDL in the liver. Obesity and diabetes can trigger the presentation of FHTG. Fibrates are typically the first line for the reduction of TG levels.

**Sitosterolemia:**Sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia, is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations (ABCG5, ABCG8) in the ABC half-transporters that are present in enterocytes and hepatocytes. ABC half-transporters are responsible for limiting the absorption of plant sterols and cholesterol in the enterocytes and promoting biliary excretion of plant sterols and cholesterol.

Defective ABC half- transporters lead to excessive absorption and reduced excretion of plant sterols and cholesterol. This leads to markedly elevated plant sterols and mild-severe elevation of serum cholesterol. It can be differentiated from FH by 30 fold elevation of plant sterols. Children present with xanthomas and premature atherosclerotic disease, including aortic stenosis. Treatment includes avoidance of plant-based unsaturated fats and ezetimibe or bile acid sequestrants.

**Low HDL-cholesterol:**Low HDL is typically accompanied by a high TG level with or without elevation in small dense LDL cholesterol. This is commonly seen in patients with obesity, and the etiology is thought to be VLDL overproduction. Isolated low HDL is defined as HDL less than 50 mg/dl in men and less than 40 mg/dl in women. There are various genetic disorders that can cause an isolated low HDL level, including familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, mutations of the ApoA-1 protein, Tangier disease, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency. In these disorders, the rest of the lipid panel is normal.

**Familial Hypobetalipoprotenemia (FHBL):**Hypobetalipoprotenemia is caused by mutations in the apo-B gene leading to a truncated version of the apolipoprotein B protein. This leads to very low levels of Apo-B (less than 5%) and LDL-C (20-50 mg/dl). In heterozygous FHBL, the apo B levels are at 25% of normal and hepatic steatosis with mild elevation in transaminases can be seen. In homozygous FHBL, which is extremely rare, the presentation is severe with hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver, steatorrhea, and peripheral neuropathy.

**Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL):**Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) gene. The MTTP gene protein is responsible for producing VLDL, LDL, and chylomicrons in the liver and small intestine. Therefore mutation in this gene leads to very low concentrations of TG and cholesterol (under 30 mg/dl) and undetectable levels of LDL-C and Apo-B.

Reduced TG export from the liver and lipid accumulation in enterocytes leads to fatty liver, steatorrhea, diarrhea, and malabsorption. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies lead to ataxia, bleeding diathesis, and retinitis pigmentosa. HDL-C becomes the primary cholesterol carrier in these patients. Treatment involves giving high doses of vitamin E and restricting long-chain TG to less than 15 gm/day.
