In women, breast cancer is number one in incidence and mortality when compared to all cancers.

The methods of screening are:

- Breast palpation may be done by clinical breast examination and breast self-examination.

- Breast imaging techniquesÂ such as mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)

Many multiple randomized trials have come to the consensus that routine screening mammography should be offered to women ages 50 to 69 rather than that for women of the age group 40 to 49 or women over 70 years of age. Genetic mutations have been discovered, and an increase in the risk of breast cancer and the development of breast cancer risk prediction models have stimulated rigorous efforts to develop screening methods for risk stratification. For high-risk women, in addition to mammography, ultrasonography & breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been studied as screening methods.
