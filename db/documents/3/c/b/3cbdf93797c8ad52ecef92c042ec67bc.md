Most patients who have bulimia nervosa will recover from the condition.

The five-year remission rate for bulimia nervosa using DSM-IV criteria has an estimate of 74%, and among those, 47% also had a relapse within those five years. Another study based on DSM-V criteria listed a 55% five-year recovery rate for bulimia nervosa in the community. At ten years, 52% of patients with bulimia nervosa treated with placebo had fully recovered.

Bulimia nervosa is proven to be associated with an increase in all-cause mortality.
