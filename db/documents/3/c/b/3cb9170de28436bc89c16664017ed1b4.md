Most leech bites will not significantly alter coagulation pathways, although case reports do exist where prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) times were affected. If there is a concern for a significant amount of bleeding, a complete blood count (CBC) may be obtained. Leech attachments can cause significant bleeding leading to acute blood loss anemia. Imaging typically is not necessary as the leech is often found on physical exam. However, if suspicion remains for a leech infestation imaging of the area of concern may be necessary. One case report discussed the presentation and treatment of an intraperitoneal leech which was seen on abdominal ultrasound and another report described a leech which was seen over the left nasal cavity on computed tomography (CT) scan.
