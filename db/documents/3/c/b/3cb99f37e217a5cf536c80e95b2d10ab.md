Nuclear medicine imaging modalities can provide clinically useful information in the workup, diagnosis, and surveillance of many musculoskeletal conditions. In some instances, such as measuring tumor response to therapy or workup of infected implanted hardware, these nuclear medicine imaging tests offer advantages over conventional imaging. Nuclear medicine imaging provides the healthcare team with an alternative test when MRI or advanced conventional imaging is contraindicated. In many cases can be a complementary exam that offers an alternate source of clinical data for the practitioner. In general, nuclear medicine imaging is less specific than conventional imaging and requires correlation with a thorough history and physical in the context of the specific diagnosis being investigated.
