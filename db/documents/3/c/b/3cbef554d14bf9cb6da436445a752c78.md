Patients who are at continued increased risk for osteonecrosis should not undergo osteochondral allograft transplantation. This often includes patients with chronic corticosteroid use. Additionally, cigarette smoking and a history of inflammatory arthritis would be a contraindication for the procedure. Osteochondral allograft transplantation is relatively contraindicated in the setting of meniscal deficiency, which can be diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or diagnostic arthroscopy. Multiple studies have demonstrated improved graft survival after concomitant meniscal allograft transplantation.
