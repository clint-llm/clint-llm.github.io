A significant component of evaluation for a patient who presents with signs and symptoms of PSVT is history and physical exam. These should include vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature, and heart rate), a review of the patient's medication list, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram. During an evaluation, a health care provider should establish if the patient is hemodynamically stable and whether they have any underlying ischemic heart disease or heart failure. Digoxin toxicity should be ruled out.

Healthcare providers should consider thyroid function testing, pulmonary function testing, including routine blood work, and echocardiography as part of their initial evaluation of patients presenting with symptomatic PSVTs.

ECG features:

- Sinus tachycardia with a heart rate more than 100 bpm with normal P waves

- Atrial tachycardia with a heart rate between 120 to 150 bpm. The P wave morphology may be different from normal sinus rhythm.

- Multifocal atrial tachycardia with heart rates from 120 to 200 bpm with 3 or more different P wave morphologies

- Atrial flutter with a heart rate of 200 to 300 bpm

- Atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm and no visible P waves

- AVNRT with a heart rate of 150 to 250 bpm, P waves before or within the QRS complex, short PR interval

- AVRT with a heart rate between 150 to 250 bpm, narrow QRS complex in orthodromic conduction, and wide QRS complex in antidromic conduction
