Fallopian tubes are involved in several gynecologic diseases that necessitate the procedures mentioned earlier. The ampulla is the most common site of ectopic pregnancies, which are either treated medically or removed surgically with a salpingostomy (creating an opening in the tube) or salpingectomy (tube excision and removal). Removal of the fallopian tubes may be necessary for malignancies involving the ovary, fallopian tube, or uterus, as well as benign conditions, including hydrosalpinx and tubo-ovarian abscess.

Fallopian tubes have a unique significance in the context of ovarian cancer. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most common type of ovarian cancer,Â is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, leading to poor prognosis. Recent evidence has shown that most cases of HGSOC originate in the fallopian tubes years before the presentation of ovarian cancer.

A tubal ligation is an option for patients desiring permanent sterilization. This procedure is regarded as very safe and highly effective. Patients should, however, understand that it is permanent, and clinicians should be aware of the risk factors for post-procedure regret, including age less than 30, lower parity, sterilization performed in the immediate postpartum period, and low socioeconomic status.
