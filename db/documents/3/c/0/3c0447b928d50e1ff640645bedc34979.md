Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) is an effective treatment for unilateral LSCD. Clear communication with the patient or referring provider is essential to establish the underlying cause of LSCD. SLET is also a more affordable and less complicated alternative to CLET, so it may prove to be the ideal treatment for patients in areas with inadequate resources. SLET utilizes an autologous transplant and does not require immunosuppression; however, allogenic SLET will require coordinated care among the health care team to monitor and treat any adverse reactions from immunosuppression.
