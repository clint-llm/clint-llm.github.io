Aflibercept is a humanized recombinant fusion protein that functions as a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, thus preventing choroidal neovascularization. The VEGF signaling pathway is implicated in the induction of gene expression, regulation of vascular permeability, proliferation, and survival.****

Studies demonstrate increased levels of VEGF-A in the aqueous and vitreous fluid of eyes with diabetic macular edema and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Aflibercept was first FDA-approved in 2011 for neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD).

Since then, additional FDA approval has been granted for macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic macular edema (DME), myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).
