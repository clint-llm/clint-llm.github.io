The determining factor that directs whether or not the bladder remains relaxed to store urine or contracts to release it is the autonomic nervous system.  Parasympathetic stimulation encourages micturition, while sympathetic stimulation prevents it.

Conversely, continence is maintained by stimulation provided by sympathetic innervation that initially arose from the thoracolumbar spine.

Somatic innervation also plays a role in the micturition response.  These neurons arise from Onuf's nucleus, located in the anterior horn of the sacral region of the spinal cord, and coalesce to become the pudendal nerve, which utilizes acetylcholine to contract the external urethral sphincter through stimulation of a nicotinic receptor at that site.

The inclusion of the somatic nervous system, and thus a degree of conscious control over urinary retention and release, hints to the role that higher-order centers within the central nervous system play in this process.  The dorsal pontine tegmentum has been known for nearly a century to be the central coordinating center for the micturition process, and stimulation of this center induces bladder contractions and relaxes the urethral sphincter.
