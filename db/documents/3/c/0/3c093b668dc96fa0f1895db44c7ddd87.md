Prescribing glasses for children is a responsibility that starts at the homefront, even before it gets to the clinic. Parents must be observant of tell-tale signs of poor vision. Children with visual problems tend to sit relatively close to the television or hold books close to their eyes to read. Some children may complain of asthenopic symptoms, while preverbal toddlers may have difficulty reaching for objects. These signs may be helpful to parents in seeking early vision testing to screen for uncorrected refractive errors. When spectacles are prescribed for children, parents can also be influenced by the price, quality, and type of frames (Level 3).

It is advisable to book children forÂ morning appointments at the clinic when they will be more alert compared to evenings. Weekend appointments may also be better compared to weekdays, considering that school can make children tired and less collaborative. Numerous clinics have a child-friendly section that helps children relax during eye examinations and improves cooperation. The clinician must be efficient and thorough when examining children, considering that these age groups tend to bore easily and be less cooperative if not properly stimulated.
