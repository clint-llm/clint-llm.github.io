Ashman phenomenon was initially described by Dr. Gouaux and Dr. Ashman in 1947. They described that the earlier in the cycle a premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs, and the longer the preceding cycle is, the more likely that the PAC will be conducted with aberration and the conduction deviates from the normal pathway. This activity discusses the etiology and the pathophysiology of the Ashman phenomenon and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of Ashman phenomenon.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Ashman phenomenon.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of Ashman phenomenon.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with Ashman phenomenon.
