Unexpected negative results associated with presbyopia management usually arise from inadequate clinical work-up, incorrect frame selection, poor optical work and fitting, and wrong treatment options. Systemic conditions may also interfere with the success of presbyopia management and should be properly investigated. These may include systemic and ocular evaluations such as blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, exophthalmometry, intra-ocular pressure, pupil assessment, and anterior and posterior segment assessment.

Patients who may require contact lenses must have optimum blink amplitudes, no existing ocular infection or inflammation, no existing cornea, and conjunctival inflammation, possess adequate tear function, no existing dry eye disease, and, more importantly, be willing to adhere to all clinical instructions including hours of use and proper hygiene. Frames that meet the optical and aesthetic needs of the patient should be selected; however, the optical requirements of a frame should supersede its aesthetic need when selecting an ophthalmic frame.
