There are no specific signs or symptoms associated with PRCA. The most common presentation is the same as that of anemia. Generalized fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, palpitations, and in extreme cases, presyncope or syncope (when associated with cardiac stress due to increased work of function). The physical exam is also non-specific. Pallor is a feature in all patients. A thorough skin exam is necessary to look for erythema infectiosum, which correlates with parvovirus B19. A prodromal rash is sometimes present in children where a reticular and lacy body eruption is visible. The systemic examination should look for swollen lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. None of these signs or symptoms are definitively diagnostic of PRCA by themselves but will provide vital clues in establishing etiology.

Diamond-Blackfan syndrome is associated with physical anomalies in up to a third of all patients.
