Patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism should follow up with an endocrinologist. Regular testing of serum calcium levels is necessary, as well as screening for other hormone resistance. Each patient's care requires individualization to their specific expression of hormone resistance.

Diagnosing, treating, and managing pseudohypoparathyroidism requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach. The patient's family doctor will enlist the services of an endocrinologist, as stated above. A specialist in genetics is also a necessary consult. The involvement of other healthcare team members will vary based on individual patient presentation. If IV interventions are required, the nurse will administer those and monitor the effectiveness of treatment, reporting their findings to the treating clinician. The pharmacist will prepare the IV and, in cases of oral therapy, can counsel the patient on dosing and administration. As treatment progresses, the team must be able to adapt based on patient response and coordinate with the next steps as described above in the Treatment section. With open communication and collaborative effort, the interprofessional team can help drive outcomes to the best possible result for the patient. [Level 5]
