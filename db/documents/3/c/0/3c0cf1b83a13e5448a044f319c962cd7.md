Patient and family education plays a key role in the management of pain at the end of life. Patients and their family members should be invited for meetings to have robust goals of care discussions. This has been a proven methodology in bolstering interpersonal relationships between family and aiding in survivor mental health. The topicsÂ requiring discussion include the medications prescribed, their potential side effects, toxicity, and allergic reactions. We should also discuss the signs of pain if the patient is nonverbal or unable to communicate effectively.

If the family is considering discharging the patient back to their home surroundings, they should be educated about caring for the patient at home. A good balance between interventions like suctioning and turning should be explained to maintain appropriate comfort without causing undue pain. When the patient and their caregivers are on the same page regarding goals of care, we avoid readmissions or calls to the emergency services, which may lead to further distress.
