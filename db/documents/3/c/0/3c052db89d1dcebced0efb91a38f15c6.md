There are no clear contraindications to performing an electroencephalogram. However, electrode placement could be challenging following a craniotomy, and in case of breaches in the skull or open wounds. The EEG should be performed after a detailed history and if there are concerns for seizures or epilepsy. Activation procedures should be omitted in individuals with certain underlying conditions. For example, hyperventilation is a relative contraindication in patients with a history ofÂ strokes, myocardial infarction, surgeries (transplants), acute respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, Moyamoya disease, and sickle cell anemia.
