Patients with anxiety can pose a diagnostic challenge, as somatic symptoms are more common than psychologic symptoms. Most patients present with vague or nonspecific somatic complaints, including, but not limited to, shortness of breath, palpitations, fatigability, headache, dizziness, and restlessness.  Patients may also describe psychologic symptoms such as excessive, nonspecific anxiety and worry, emotional lability, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia.
