Craniofacial distraction osteogenesis is a technique to elongate the bones of the mandible, midface, and cranial vault. It is successful in treating a variety of conditions, including mandibular hypoplasia, midface hypoplasia, and craniosynostosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of craniofacial malformations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the physiology of normal craniofacial development and osteogenesis.
- Identify the various craniofacial abnormalities that serve as indications for craniofacial distraction osteogenesis.
- Describe the techniques and complications involved in craniofacial distraction osteogenesis.
- Outline how the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team can enhance patient care when performing craniofacial distraction osteogenesis.
