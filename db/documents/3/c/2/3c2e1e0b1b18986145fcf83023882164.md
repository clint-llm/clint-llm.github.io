Patients with tympanic membrane rupture are typically initially seen by their primary care provider or in the emergency department setting. For the patients who have large perforations, posterior location of the injury, hearing loss, or other severe symptoms, the patient wouldÂ benefit from referral to an otolaryngologist for an interdisciplinary approach to patient care. Ultimately, timely diagnosis and referral help to improve long term outcomes and decreased overall morbidity.
