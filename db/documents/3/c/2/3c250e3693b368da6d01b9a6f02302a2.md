Reporting of antiglobulin agglutination test results can be on a qualitative or quantitative basis. For qualitative methods, the interpreter examines the test tube and assigns a score based on a graded scale:

- M: Mixed field – any degree of agglutination in a sea of non-agglutinated cells

- W: Siny aggregates, turbid reddish background

- 1: Small aggregates, turbid reddish background

- 2: Small to medium-sized aggregates, clear background

- 3: Several large aggregates, clear background

- 4: Aggregate or clump of cells

In patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the degree of agglutination typically correlates with the severity of hemolysis. If no macroscopic agglutination appears, the sample will be examined microscopically to assure that there are no aggregates. A sample exposed to a reagent that demonstrates aggregates of at least 3 to 5 cells under microscopic examination is considered a positive result. Agglutination typically takes around 5 to 10 minutes to occur after the addition of the reagent. Direct antiglobulin testing may also be measured quantitatively using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, or other immunoassay techniques.
