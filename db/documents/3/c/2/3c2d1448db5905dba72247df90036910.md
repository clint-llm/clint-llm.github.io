After ingestion of the infective forms, the organism invades the intestinal epithelium and subsequently disseminates throughout the body. At the tissues, which often is the brain but can affect any tissue, they then encyst and lie dormant until immunity wanes. The dormant forms are called bradyzoites while the actively replicating forms are called tachyzoites. Primary toxoplasmosis is often subclinical but could rarely present symptomatically in an immunocompromised seronegative person who became recently exposed to the infective forms. In this scenario, IgM to aÂ toxoplasma is often positive, but IgG is not, unlike most reactivation cases, when IgG is the only positive serology test. As previously outlined, in most situations, clinical toxoplasmosis in the HIV patient is due to reactivation of latent infection as immunity wanes.
