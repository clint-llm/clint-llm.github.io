**Prevention of Postoperative Urinary Retention**

The best treatment for postoperative urinary retention is prevention and should involve the entire treatment team in identifying and optimizing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors.

Preoperative:  Patients at greatest risk of developing POUR should be identified preoperatively based on risk factors such as age, sex, comorbidities, and surgery type. In fact, these risk factors are reproducible enough to generate a receiver operating characteristic curve with a predictive accuracy of POUR with an area under the curve of 0.70.

Intraoperative:  Intraoperative risk factors leading to POUR include operative time, intraoperative intravenous fluid volume, and type of anesthetic used. Operating time greater than 2 hours was a significant predictor of POUR in one study.

Postoperative:  Postoperative risk factors for the development of POUR include a slow time to ambulation and systemic opioid use. One study demonstrated early ambulation decreased the rates of POUR from 52% to 19%.

**Management of Postoperative Urinary Retention**

If postoperative urinary retention does develop, the bladder requires draining. There is some controversy in the literature regarding the placement of an indwelling catheter versus managing retention with intermittent catheterization. Some centers propose intermittent catheterization for the reduced risk of bacteriuria and theoretical infection.

Regardless of catheterization choice, the patient should be placed on an alpha-blocker, such as tamsulosin, if they are not already. Tamsulosin can take up to 72 hours to reach maximal therapeutic effect. Therefore the recommendation for catheter removal and/or voiding trial is within 1 to 3 days of catheterization.
