The number one differential diagnosis is probably carbon monoxide inhalation. Patients with only carbon monoxide poisoning will improve when removed from the smoke-filled area and placed on 100% oxygen. Seizures are common in cyanide poisoning but are rare in carbon monoxide poisoning. Also, carbon monoxide does not affect the pupils, but cyanide poisoning causes pupillary dilation.

Tricyclic antidepressants, isoniazid, organophosphates, and salicylates also are possible ingestions to consider when a patient presents with altered mental status, seizures, hypotension, and lactic acidosis.
