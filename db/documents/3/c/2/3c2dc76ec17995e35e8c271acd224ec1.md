Most patients with nephrolithiasis form calcium stones (80%), most of which are composed primarily of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate. The other main types include uric acid, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and cystine stones. Of note, one patient may have a stone that contains more than one type of crystal.

**Risk Factors -**Influenced by certain diseases, habits, composition of urine.

- Personal history of prior kidney stones increases the risk of kidney stones

- A family history of kidney stones increases the risk by 2.5 times.

- Increased enteric oxalate absorption, typically due to malabsorption, leads to increased formation of calcium oxalate crystals.

- Urinary tract infections altering urinary pH in the setting of urease-producing bacteria, producing struvite crystals

- Low fluid intake

- History of diabetes, obesity, gout, and hypertension

- Acidic urine (pH< 5.5), which promotes uric acid formation in the setting of chronic diarrhea and gout
