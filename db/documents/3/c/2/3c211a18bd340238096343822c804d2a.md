Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is a hereditary condition due to inactivating GNAS1 gene mutation. AHO is characterized by a round face, short stature with a stocky habitus, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossification, and dental anomalies. AHO may be associated with hormonal resistance in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A and 1C and is often the first clue for their diagnosis. In addition, one or more features of the AHO phenotype may be present in other disorders which should be distinguished from AHO. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiopathogenesis of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
- Summarize the evaluation of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
- Outline the management options available for Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve the outcomes of patients with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
