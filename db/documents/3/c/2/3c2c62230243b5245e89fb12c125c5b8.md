The healthcare team, i.e., clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, must work together to make sure that patients on pharmacotherapy correctly take their medications, e.g., ciprofloxacin, and importantly, to discuss any serious drug side effects they encounter, e.g., tendinitis, etc. This includes knowledge of any FDA-boxed warnings. A complete medication list for the patient is necessary before prescribing medications to prevent clinically significant drug interactions, and a pharmacist can perform medication reconciliation to answer any questions or address concerns other healthcare team members may have.
