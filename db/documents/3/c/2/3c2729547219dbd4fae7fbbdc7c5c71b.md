Tenecteplase is a bioengineered alteplase variant, a recombinant DNA-derived version of naturally occurring tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The drug is derived from three amino acid substitutions at three sites (T, N, and K represent the three regions changed from the natural tPA protein). Native tPA is a serine protease found in endothelial cells. Tenecteplase binds to the fibrin component of a blood clot (thrombus). It acts within the endogenous fibrinolytic coagulation cascade to selectively catalyze the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin. The activated plasmin subsequently degrades fibrin, resulting in clot dissolution and recanalization of blood flow.

Tenecteplase exhibits much higher fibrin specificity, increased resistance to inactivation by endogenous inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and a longer half-life compared to native tPA. Due to its long half-life, Tenecteplase can be administered as a single intravenous bolus injection.
