Orbital atherectomy (OA) is contraindicated in the following conditions:

- Unable to pass the guidewireÂ  across a lesion

- The lesion is within a graft or stent

- The patient is not a candidate for atherectomy, coronary angioplasty, or bypass surgery

- The patient has evidence of thrombus on angiography

- The patient has a multi-vessel disease with only one open coronary vessel

- There is evidence of coronary dissection on the angiogram

- The patient is pregnant

- The patient is a child

Other warnings and precautions for consideration before utilizing OA include:

- Very tortuous vessels which are at increased risk for vessel damage

- Treating lesions in the right coronary or left circumflex regions as there is an increased risk for heart block and need for temporary pacing

- On-site and available cardiothoracic surgery staff if needed

- Patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction less than 25%
