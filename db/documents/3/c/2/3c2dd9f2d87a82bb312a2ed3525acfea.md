Once the need to perform PPS has been identified, a thorough medical evaluation should be performed to mitigate risk during and after the procedure. A standard checklist should be performed, and guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics are useful:

- Physical status evaluation based on the ASA classification system.  In general, PPS in the emergency setting should be limited to ASA class I or II.  For children with ASA class III or higher or anatomic airway or cervical spine anomalies, anesthesiology or another appropriate subspecialty should be consulted.

- Obtained informed consent

- Obtain comprehensive health evaluation to determine baseline status and identify any specific health conditions that require additional considerations or consultation.  This includes sex, age, weight, current medications, allergies, and relevant personal or family medical history.

- Consider the NPO status of the patient in the context of the urgency of the indicated procedure.

- Assess airway patency using the Mallampati score and assess mouth opening, tonsillar hypertrophy, mandibular anomalies, lingual anomalies, and cervical spine mobility.

- Ensure equipment is available, appropriately sized, and functional.
