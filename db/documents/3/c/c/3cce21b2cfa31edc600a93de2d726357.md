A patient with Liddle syndrome often presents with secondary or resistant hypertension. Laboratory investigation may reveal hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

Once the patients are diagnosed with low-renin and low-aldosterone levels, they should be prescribed aldosterone for two months and stay under close observation by a healthcare provider. Some conditions like glucocorticoid resistance syndrome, apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia all respond well to this drug. If the patient does not respond to aldosterone, then the clinician should suspect Liddle syndrome.

Ultimately the final diagnosis is made by genetic analysis of the gene that regulates the ENaC.
