Forty years ago, Ettinger et al. described the association between binge alcohol use and atrial fibrillation. These events occurred in close proximity to weekends and holidays when alcohol consumption increased

As the majority of studies included in these systematic reviews and meta-analyses are retrospective, relying on self-reported alcohol consumption data obtained via questionnaires, there exists a potential for confounding due to recall bias. To address this confounding factor, Marcus et al. did a prospective study that utilized wearable monitors to capture alcohol consumption events in real time and demonstrated a causal association between acute alcohol intake and the incidence of atrial fibrillation in individuals with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

In their study, they included 100 participants. 56% of them experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation. When monitored over four hours, participants who consumed two or more drinks had an odds ratio (OR, 3.58 [95% CI, 1.63 to 7.89]) of experiencing an atrial fibrillation episode. Participants who consumed a single drink had an odds ratio of (OR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.38 to 3.17]). Additionally, analysis of the transdermal alcohol sensor measurements of blood alcohol concentration during the 12 hours preceding the AF episode revealed a 38% greater odds of AF per 0.1% increase in peak blood alcohol concentration.
