All patients presenting with a transient, apparent loss of consciousness should be assessed for the possibility of cardiac syncope. However, they could also have any of the many other causes of loss of consciousness. In cases of head trauma preceding loss of consciousness, a patient is considered to have had a concussion. Nontraumatic transient loss of consciousness can occur from other sources of syncope or non-syncopal events such as seizures; metabolic disturbances like hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypoxia, or hypocapnia); vertebrobasilar cerebral transient ischemic events; alcohol intoxication or other central nervous system depressant substance use; pseudoseizures; or psychogenic pseudosyncope. In these instances, loss of consciousness or presumed loss of consciousness is not due to global cerebral hypoperfusion, as is the case in syncope. Among transient loss of consciousness events deemed syncopal, any event that reduces either cardiac output or peripheral vascular resistance can result in this common outcome.

The following are several noncardiac etiologies:

**Reflex (Neurogenic)**

- Vasovagal - typically preceded by an inciting stressful event such as fear, seeing blood, hearing bad news, emotional stress, or pain

- Situational - preceded by a specific action such as sneezing, laughing, coughing, urinating, defecating, eating, or exercise

- 
Carotid sinus stimulation

**Orthostatic Hypotension**

- Autonomic dysfunction - usually a symptom of another degenerative disease such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body dementia or can be a primary disease on its own; can also occur as a direct result of diabetes, amyloidosis, and spinal cord trauma

- Drug-induced - in the setting of diuretics, vasodilating agents, alcohol, antidepressants, or any other medications that reduce cardiac output or vascular resistance.

- Volume depletion - traumatic hemorrhage, atraumatic blood loss, diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, decreased oral hydration
