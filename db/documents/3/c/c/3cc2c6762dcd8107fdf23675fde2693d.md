Many patients with microscopic colitis will have a chronic, intermittent course of disease symptoms. Diarrhea can sometimes resolve without treatment or will often resolve with treatment within weeks. Relapses of symptomatology are frequent. It is currently unclear if one form is worse than the other. At present, there is no associated increased risk of colorectal cancer with microscopic colitis.
