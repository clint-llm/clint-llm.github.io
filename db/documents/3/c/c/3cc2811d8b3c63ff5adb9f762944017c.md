R.akari is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes infectious disease specialists, pathologists, and nurses. Because the condition is self-limited, no treatment is generally required.Â  However, treatment with antibiotics will decrease the duration of systemic symptoms from approximately seven to ten days without treatment to less than 48 hours with therapy. The drug of choice to treat R. akari is doxycycline. The majority of patients see a clinical improvement in 24 to 48 hours.
