Facet joints form from the superior and inferior articular processes of two adjacent vertebrae. They are synovial joints as a fibrous capsule encompasses the bone and articulating cartilage and is continuous with the periosteum. The joint also contains synovial fluid which is kept in place by an inner membrane. The function of these joints is to allow for flexion and extension of the spine while limiting rotation and preventing the vertebrae from slipping over each other. The sensory nerve of these joints is the medial branch of the dorsal spinal ramus. Facet joint disease, also known as facet syndrome, is a condition in which these joints become a source of pain. Facet joint mediated pain is a common source of disability amongst our population with significant economic impact. Chronic low back pain often results from facet joint disease, with a prevalence of 15 to 41%.
