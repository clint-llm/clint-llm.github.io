In autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-MUC1, the MUC1 gene is located on chromosome 1q21. It is thought that most MUC1 mutations are caused by cytosine duplication within a seven-cytosine stretch in the variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) region that usually produces a frameshift mutation. This mutated gene produces an abnormal protein known as the MUC1 frameshift protein (MUC1fs). Accumulating this abnormal protein (MUC1fs) in the renal tubular epithelial cells may be considered an important pathogenic factor in the pathophysiology of ADTKD-MUC1; in addition, positive staining of (MUC1fs) in the urinary exfoliated cells and renal tubular epithelial cells could help to diagnose this condition.

In ADTKD-UMOD, endoplasmic reticulum stress may occur due to the retention of the mutant uromodulin (mUMOD) protein inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of tubular epithelial cells in the thick ascending limb of the renal tubules. This will lead to tubular cell death, decreased cellular release, urinary excretion of the wild-type protein, and chronic kidney disease.

In autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-SEC61A1, this condition is associated with missense mutations in SEC61A1. It is responsible for encoding the alpha subunit of endoplasmatic reticular membrane translocon SEC61. Many studies confirmed that the normal function of the SEC61 complex and its translocon is essential for normal kidney development.

In autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-REN, the disease is mainly caused by non-truncating mutations in the first exon of the REN gene that affect the protein leader peptide residues. The type of the mutation is either missense changes like (L16R, W10R, W17R, and C20R) or an in-frame deletion (L16del). Another study identified a new novel renin mutation in exon 10 of the REN gene. These mutations can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response activation, leading to improper renal development.

In autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease-HNF1B, the HNF1B gene has an essential role in early embryonic development. It is also known as transcription factor-2 (TCF2). This gene is located on chromosome 17q12, which codes for protein hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B. Since HNF1B is expressed in the body's variable tissues like the kidney, liver, pancreas, and genitourinary tract, this may explain the variable clinical presentations of the HNF1B-related disorders. It was found that loss of HNF1b could induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This transition will ultimately lead to kidney fibrosis by up-regulation of the expression of transforming growth factor−β ligands in renal epithelial cells.
