Acutely, the physiologic effects of cannabis use include decreased systemic vascular resistance, elevated heart rate, decreased intraocular pressure, nystagmus, conjunctival injection, lethargy, decreased concentration and generalized psychomotor impairment. Whereas tachycardia may occur in acute use, slowing of the heart rate has been reported with more chronic use. Cannabis toxicity in children can be more concerning and can lead to decreased muscle coordination, lethargy, seizures and even obtundation. Synthetic cannabinoid toxicity is associated with similar symptoms. However, sympathomimetic toxicity, acute psychosis, and agitation, as well as seizures and sedation can occur. In severe cases, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure have occurred. Synthetic cannabinoids are commonly adulterated, leading to these worsened effects. Liberalization of marijuana laws have led to an increased incidence of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome which presents with cyclical vomiting, usually reported to be relieved with warm showers and cessation of cannabis abuse. Other chronic effects of prolonged cannabinoid use include lung disease, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, reduced fertility, and deficits in cognition and memory.
