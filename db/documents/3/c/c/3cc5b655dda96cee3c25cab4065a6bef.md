All antiarrhythmic drugs are also potentially pro-arrhythmic; hence, intravenous administration should be done only under cardiac monitoring. Each agent in the Vaughn-Williams classification includes distinctive side effect profiles that require individual consideration. For example, procainamide may induce a lupus-like syndrome, while quinidine is known to produce cinchonism. The benefit of the classification is in the primary mechanism of action and the broad, predictable side effects brought about by the primary mechanism. An example would include the class III K+ channel blockers or "repolarization" blockers producing a prolonged phase 3 of the action potential and, by definition, also leading to a prolonged QT interval on the corresponding EKG. It is important to note that, Bazett's formula for QTc calculation leads to an overestimation of the QTc during atrial fibrillation, consequently reducing antiarrhythmic doses and drug efficacy.

During the administration of beta-blockers, an electrocardiogram and heart rate monitoring are more useful than TDM.
