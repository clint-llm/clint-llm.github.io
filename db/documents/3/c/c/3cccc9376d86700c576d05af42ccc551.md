Radiotherapy is a widely used treatment modality for managing carcinomas in the head and neck region, either alone or combined with chemotherapy. Although effective in managing malignancies, radiotherapy induces undesirable side effects in the oral cavity. Some develop soon after initiating treatment, and others may appear after months or even years of completion of treatment. This activity describes the dentist's role in evaluating and managing patients before, during, and post-radiation therapy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients undergoing radiation therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the impact of radiation therapy on the oral cavity.
- Summarize dental treatment considerations for the patient with head and neck cancer pre-radiotherapy.
- Identify common oral complications of head and neck radiation therapy.
- Review the management strategies available for oral complications of head and neck radiation therapy.
