Oral melanoacanthoma is a rare, benign macular brown-black lesion, which is usually asymptomatic, and distinguished by the sudden appearance and rapid growth. It is found to be secondary to tissue trauma and is self-limiting in nature. In the literature, up to 75% of reported cases are labeled as reactive.

Histologically it presents with acanthosis of the superficial epithelium and proliferation of dendritic melanocytes.

The most common location of oral melanoacanthomas is the buccal mucosa, but they can also be seen in labial mucosa, palate, gingiva, alveolar mucosa, and oropharynx.
