Aphasia is caused by lesions to the language areas of the brain, which are typically located in the dominant hemisphere. For the majority of the population, the dominant hemisphere is on the left side.

In addition, aphasia can be caused by progressive deterioration of brain tissue such as Alzheimer, Pick disease, vascular dementia, some forms of Parkinson disease, or from direct physical injuries, as seen in traumatic brain injury. Other causes of injuries to language areas can include infection and mass effects from brain tumors.
