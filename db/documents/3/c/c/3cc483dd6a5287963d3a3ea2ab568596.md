Corn was the staple food in China, India, Africa, and Latin America, yet pellagra was common in African nations.

In the United States, pellagra is very rare due to the enrichment of processed flour with B vitamins. In the past, native people in North, Central, and South America consumed maize treated with lime or wood ashes, which increased the bioavailability of niacin in maize.
