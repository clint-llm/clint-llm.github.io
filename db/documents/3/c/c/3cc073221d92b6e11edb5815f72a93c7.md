Patients with a stroke are usually managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, neurologist. intensive care unit nurses, radiologists, physical therapists, occupational and speech therapists, and other specialists depending on the functional deficit. The key is to restore the patient to pre-stroke functioning levels, if possible. For patients with a minor stroke recovery is good but those who have gross neurological deficits at the time of admission usually require prolonged rehabilitation and there is often no guarantee of full recovery.
