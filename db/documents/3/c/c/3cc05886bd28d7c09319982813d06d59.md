Some organs, such as the brain, the eye, and the kidney, contain tissues that utilize glucose as their preferred or sole metabolic fuel source. During a prolonged fast or vigorous exercise, glycogen stores become depleted, and glucose must be synthesized de novo in order to maintain blood glucose levels. Gluconeogenesis is the pathway by which glucose is formed from non-hexose precursors such as glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and glucogenic amino acids.

Gluconeogenesis is essentially the reversal of glycolysis. However, to bypass the three highly exergonic (and essentially irreversible) steps of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis utilizes four unique enzymes.
