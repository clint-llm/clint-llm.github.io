**Ultrasonography**

The most common ultrasonographic findings of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma include

- Solid masses

- Marked hypoechogenicity

- Irregular margin

- Internal calcification

- Wider than tall shape

- Cervical lymph node involvement

**Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)**

A fine-needle biopsy is a useful diagnostic modality. However, the diagnosis of anaplastic carcinoma must be established by surgical biopsy or during surgery.

Cytologic findings of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma include:

- Biphasic population: tumor and uninvolved thyroid

- Highly cellular with single cells and focal clusters composed of remarkable atypical cells

- Mitotic figures are prominent

- Background necrosis and inflammatory cells may be present

**Intraoperative Frozen Section and Pathology Consultation**

Intraoperative consultation provides a rapid diagnosis to determine the ongoing operative extent and approach.

**Computed Tomography Scan**

Anaplastic thyroid carcinomas usually present as large isodense or slightly hyperdense masses relative to skeletal muscle. Calcification and necrosis are present and often are extensive.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

Magnetic resonance imaging can be useful to best assess tumor extension, particularly in the esophagus musculature, trachea, and carotid vessel.

**F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET)**

Staging assessment with F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) fused coincident computerized tomography scan (FDG-PET/CT) is uniquely valuable in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma due to its enhanced expression of glucose transporter (GLUT-1), resulting in increased glucose uptake.
