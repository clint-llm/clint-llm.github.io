The differential diagnosis includes:

- Post-surgical devascularization of parathyroid glands

- Accidental removal of all parathyroid glands with permanent postsurgical hypoparathyroidism

- Long-term suppression of nonpathological parathyroid glands

When considering the possible etiologies for hypocalcemia, specifically in the postoperative period, the state of the parathyroid glands requires evaluation. Post-surgical devascularization or accidental destruction and removal of the remaining parathyroid glands are possibilities. In other cases, the remaining parathyroid glands need time to recover from the previous constant overproduction of PTH from the hyperactive adenoma that was suppressing their production of PTH. In those instances, in contrast to HBS, although hypocalcemia will be evident, the PTH level will be low, and the phosphorus level will be high.
