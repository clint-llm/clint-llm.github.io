The form of administration varies with estrogen therapy and depends on the specific symptoms the treatment is targeting. Essentially, certain symptoms, such as the vasomotor symptoms experienced during menopause, would best be controlled with estrogen therapy that acts systemically. Conversely, symptoms involving the vaginal lumen, such as dyspareunia, vaginal itching, and vaginal dryness, experience more control with locally acting estrogen therapy. Typically, women with an intact uterus receive combination estrogen and progesterone therapy. Women who have had hysterectomies receive estrogen alone. Usually, estrogen therapy divides into two main routes administered either orally or transdermally.

Estrogen therapy further subdivides specifically into four common forms of application: oral estrogen in the form of pills, transdermal estrogen, estrogen creams, and estrogen suppositories. Examples of oral estrogen include esterified estrogens, conjugated equine estrogens, ethinyl estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol. The non-oral estrogen therapy is produced in the form of 17 beta-estradiol. Oral and transdermal estrogen are both equally equipped to provide menopausal symptom relief while sparing the bone. While many women would prefer the oral route, it requires a higher dose as its bioavailability is due to the first-pass metabolism in the liver.
