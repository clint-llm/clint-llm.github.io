Bacillus cereus is a facultatively anaerobic, toxin-producing gram-positive bacterium found in soil, vegetation, and food. It commonly causes intestinal illnesses with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, it has been associated with serious infections in immunocompromised hosts and can cause septicemia as well as endophthalmitis, which can lead to vision loss. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of Bacillus cereus and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different types of foods that may carry Bacillus cereus.
- Describe the pathophysiology of food-borne Bacillus cereus infections.
- Summarize the typical patient history and physical examination findings associated with Bacillus cereus infections.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes in patients affected by Bacillus cereus infections.
