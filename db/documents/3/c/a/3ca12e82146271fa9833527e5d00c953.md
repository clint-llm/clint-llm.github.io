Pit vipers are generally not aggressive and typically strike in a defensive manner or when provoked. Pit viper envenomation is almost exclusively unintentional.Â Causative factors resulting in envenomation are either while handling snakes or during outdoor activities resulting in unintentional exposure to the snake. In one registry of north American snakebites, about half of all bites were on the lower extremity. Of these, 27% of patients were not wearing shoes.
