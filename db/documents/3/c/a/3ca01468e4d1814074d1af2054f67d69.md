Having a wide variety of stent diameters and lengths is optimal. It is preferable to have both soft double J stents and rigid ones, but if you have to choose only one, pick the rigid type but insist on the largest possible selection of widths and lengths. The most commonly used size is a 6 French, 26 cm stent. Some very large patients will need longer stents, and some patients with a horseshoe or pelvic kidney will require very short ones.

Getting the guidewire or the open-ended catheter into the distal ureter can sometimes be challenging. Start by using the right size cystoscope sheath. Too small a sheath will not allow a 7 or 8 French stent, but if the cystoscope is too large, it will be challenging to secure and direct the open-ended ureteral catheter, stent, and guidewire. Consider using an Albarran deflecting bridge which allows for a little adjustable deflection at the tip of the cystoscope. This will permit approaching the ureteral orifice at a more acute angle, which will often work much better. The Albarran bridge will also provide additional intravesical stabilization of guide wires, ureteral catheters, and stents. Our personal preference is to use an Albarran bridge with a 70-degree lens and a 19 to 22 French cystoscope sheath for double J stent placement.

Be careful when advancing an open-ended catheter up the ureter without a guidewire. The edges of the catheter can be sharp enough to cause significant and unnecessary bleeding if pushed or forced up the ureter even with a guidewire. Some open-ended ureteral catheters have a slightly tapered tip, and these are preferable as they will tend to cause less ureteral trauma and reduce bleeding.

Ureteral balloon or solid dilators may occasionally be necessary and should be readily available. If a specific strictured area is identified on retrograde pyelography or fluoroscopy, it is helpful to place a marker (such as a sticky note or a signature request tab) directly on the fluoro screen to identify and mark its exact location. This is particularly helpful for balloon dilation. If such dilation is not successful for any reason, it may be preferable to leave a stent for passive dilation and return another day to complete the procedure.

Guidewires are a matter of personal taste. Hydrophilic wires are generally preferred but need to be kept moist for optimal performance. For this purpose, we always keep a wet sponge on the field to quickly moisten the wire and the stent. Always wipe from the outside (distal) end towards the urethral (proximal) end to avoid inadvertent dislodgement of the stent or guidewire.

- Straight wires are generally preferred for routine use, but if the anatomy is abnormal, tortuous, or unusual, an angled tip wire will probably work better.

- Stiff shaft wires will help straighten a tortuous ureter more than standard wires.

- Use of a torque vise to secure a tight grip on the distal end of the guidewire can be very helpful in severe or challenging cases. This is especially useful with angled or curved tip guidewires.

- Use the open-ended catheter as a stabilizer for the guidewire and advance the wire from that point. Advance the open-ended catheter slowly over the guidewire as the wire advances.

- Place the open-ended catheter close to the ureteral stricture or obstruction. About 1 cm is optimal.

- Injection of contrast, lubricant, or lidocaine jelly through the open-ended catheter can often help facilitate passage of the guidewire. We like to use a combination of contrast and lidocaine gel. A smaller syringe (3 or 5 mL) is recommended for injection as the mixture may be quite viscous and very hard to inject withÂ a larger needle.

- Advance the wire through the open-ended catheter while turning or twisting it with the torque vise. Monitor with fluoroscopy. Remember that the guidewire only has to pass through the obstructed area once. Confirm this passage fluoroscopically.

- Once the guidewire has passed the obstruction, advance the open-ended catheter. Alternatively, ureteral dilation can be performed with a balloon or sequential solid ureteral dilators.

- If the ureter remains tortuous, try placing a second, stiff guidewire. This can be introduced with a dual lumen catheter or directly through the cystoscope. An open-ended catheter can also be advanced over the guidewire for additional stiffness to help straighten a tortuous ureter. Be sure to re-measure the ureteral length after straightening as it is likely to become shorter.

- If it proves to be impossible to pass a guidewire, do not try to place the double J stent as this is likely to cause further ureteral damage and trauma. Consider a percutaneous nephrostomy and an antegrade approach instead.

- Metallic stents can be used when long-term drainage will be required, such as in obstructions caused by malignancy. They can typically remain in place without clogging for up to 1 year.
