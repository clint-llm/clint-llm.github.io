Niacin deficiency results in the condition of pellagra, which, although uncommon in industrialized nations, may be seen in individuals living in poverty or those with extremely low niacin and protein-deficient diets.

Corn was the staple food in China, India, Africa, and Latin America, yet pellagra was common in African nations.

In the United States, pellagra is rare due to the enrichment of processed flour with B vitamins. In the past, native people in North, Central, and South America consumed maize treated with lime or wood ashes, which increased the bioavailability of niacin in maize.

Within the United States and industrialized nations, pellagra is rarely seen with the enrichment of foods and an overall decrease in nutritional deficiency-related diseases.
