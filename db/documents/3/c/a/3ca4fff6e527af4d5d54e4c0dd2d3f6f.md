Overall, patients with penetrating extremity trauma can be safely discharged to home if pulses are present and equal bilaterally at the wrist (or ankles) or ABI to API ratio = 0.9 in an injured extremity.  The WTA notes that this includes patients that are post-reduction for posterior knee dislocations. Discharged patients should have close follow up as 1% to 4% will have progression of a small injury not seen at the time of initial evaluation that requires operative intervention.
