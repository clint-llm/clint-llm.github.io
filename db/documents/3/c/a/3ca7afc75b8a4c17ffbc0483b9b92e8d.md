By the completion of the fourth week of embryonic development, four limb buds arise from somites and mesenchyme of the lateral plate mesoderm that is covered by a layer of ectoderm.

Development of the hand begins with flattening of the distal upper extremity buds around days 34-38 of embryonic development. Somites form the limb musculature while mesenchyme of the lateral plate mesoderm forms bone and cartilage. Somitic mesoderm of the hand divides into superficial and deep layers, with the superficial muscles developing earlier than deep muscles. The lumbrical muscles originate from the deep layer of this mesoderm, and by the twelfth week of development, tendons are fully developed and functional.
