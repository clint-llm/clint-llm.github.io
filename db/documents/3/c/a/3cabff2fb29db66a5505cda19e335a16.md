Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) complicates the already existing kidney disease. The complications of NSF include:

- The most debilitating NSF sequelae are the fibrosis of the visceral organs such as the heart, lungs, renal tubules, and skeletal muscles. Even though visceral fibrosis is often asymptomatic, it may contribute to the development of pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and skeletal muscle weakness.

- Patients with NSF may experience blood vessel thrombosis; as the disease progresses, these patients may develop significant hypotension, affecting their ability to tolerate the hemodialysis.

- Flexion contractures may lead to wheelchair dependence within weeks in many patients.

- Falls are common in these patients and fractures can also occur.
