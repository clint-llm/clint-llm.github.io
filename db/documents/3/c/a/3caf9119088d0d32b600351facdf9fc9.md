True Brown syndrome is due to congenital causes, with a constant limitation of elevation and a positive traction test secondary to a tight superior oblique tendon. Pseudo-Brown syndrome encompasses acquired and intermittent cases, as well as cases not due to superior oblique muscle-tendon pathology. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients suffering from Brown syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Brown syndrome.
- Outline appropriate processes for the evaluation of Brown syndrome.
- Review management options available for Brown syndrome.
- Identify conditions similar to Brown syndrome and how to differentiate these conditions, and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in providing the best patient outcomes.
