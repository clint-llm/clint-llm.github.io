In vitro, mean-inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies have reported A. haemolyticum is sensitive essentially to all classes of antibiotics utilized to treat respiratory tract infections with the exception of trimethoprim/sulfamethazine.

Additionally, for patients with beta-lactam allergies, antibiotics such as vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and doxycycline should be considered. In addition to medical management with antibiotics, patients with systemic infections may require vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, and surgical intervention as needed.
