The interpretation of slides can be difficult if the microscopic smear is thick and clumped. Decolorization time should have very close monitoring to avoid under-decolorization or over-decolorization. Thicker smears require longer decolorizing time. Similarly, cultures should undergo evaluation while they are still fresh. Old cultures tend to lose the peptidoglycan cell walls, which predisposes gram-positive cells to be gram-negative or gram variable. Gram stain is not useful for organisms without a cell wall like Mycoplasma species, and for smaller bacteria like Chlamydia and Rickettsia species.

**Gram stain may not falsely reveal organisms in the following scenario:**

- Use of antibiotics before collecting a specimen

- Inappropriate age of culture: too young or too old

- Fixing the smear before its dry

- The smear is too thick

- Low concentration of crystal violet

- Excessive heat fixation

- Excessive washing between steps

- Insufficient exposure to iodine

- Prolonged decolorization

- Excessive counterstaining

- Lack of experience in preparing the slide, and reviewing the slide

Sometimes results of Gram-stain may not match the final results of cultures and could potentially lead to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
