The toxicokinetics of opioid drugs varies within the class. Half-lives range from minutes (heroin) to many hours (methadone). Potencies of opioids also vary drastically, with more potent synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, carfentanil, and newer compounds causing overdose deaths and necessitating large doses of naloxone for reversal.

Opioids tend to be lipophilic and metabolized in the liver by both phase 1 (modification) and phase 2 (conjugation) reactions.
