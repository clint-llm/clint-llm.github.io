# Learning Outcome

- List the causes of hematuria

- Describe the presentation of hematuria

- Summarize the workup of a patient with hematuria

- Recall the nursing management of a patient with hematuria

# Introduction

Hematuria is the presence of blood in the urine. Hematuria can be gross or microscopic. Gross hematuria is visible blood in urine. Microscopic hematuria refers to the detection of blood on urinalysis or urine microscopy. Hematuria can be intermittent or persistent.

# Nursing Diagnosis

- Blood in urine

- Frothy urine

- High blood pressure

- Anxiety

- Abdominal or flank pain

- Dark urine

- Recent throat infection

- Weight gain

- Fluid retention

# Causes

Hematuria is usually caused by a genitourinary disease although systemic diseases can also manifest with blood in urine. Hematuria is divided into glomerular and non-glomerular hematuria to help in evaluation and management.

Some common glomerular causes are:

- Alport syndrome

- Thin basement membrane disease

- Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

- IgA nephropathy

- Pauci immune glomerulonephritis

- Lupus nephritis

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

- Goodpasture syndrome

- Nephrotic syndrome

- Polycystic kidney disease

Non-glomerular causes include:

- Febrile illness

- Exercise

- Menstruation

- Nephrolithiasis

- Cystitis, urethritis, prostatitis

- Malignancy: renal cell Carcinoma, bladder cancer, prostate cancer

- Genitourinary mucosal injury by instrumentation

- Trauma

- Bleeding tendency: thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, use of blood thinners, hematological disorders like sickle cell anemia.

# Risk Factors

Hematuria is one of the most common presentations in outpatient and Emergency department. Asymptomatic hematuria is thought to be much more prevalent than symptomatic hematuria.

# Assessment

Hematuria can be painful or painless. Patients can have various presentations, most of the time they notice red or dark-colored urine, or passing blood clots.  Associated symptoms include:

- Flank pain

- Lower abdominal pain

- Painful urination

- Urinary urgency or frequency

- Fever

- Active menstruation

- Passing stone or grits

- Recent throat or skin infection

- Joint pains, oral ulcers, rash

- Hemoptysis

- Leg swelling

- Hearing loss

- Flank mass

- Constitutional symptoms like weight loss, anorexia, cachexia

- Back pain

Patients should be asked about previous such episodes and family history of hematuria. Medical history and recent procedural history is essential in the evaluation. Medications should be carefully reviewed. Ascertain smoking history and use of other recreational drugs.

A complete physical examination can contribute to making a valid differential diagnosis. Important signs to look for are:

- Febrile

- Hypertension

- Periorbital edema

- Presence of pallor, icterus, oral ulcers or rash

- Hearing impairment

- Generalized lymphadenopathy

- Joints swellings

- Flank mass

- Palpable enlarged cystic kidneys

- Costovertebral angle tenderness

- Pubic tenderness

- Urethral discharge or tear

- Lower extremity edema

A thorough history and focused physical examination can lead to a proper evaluation and subsequent management.

# Evaluation

**Urinalysis**is the initial and most useful test to perform. Although urine dipstick is widely available and can be performed quickly, it can give false-positive or false-negative results and warrants urinalysis and urine microscopy to establish the diagnosis. Presence of 3 or more RBCs per High Power Field on urine sediments is defined as microscopic hematuria although there is no "safe" lower limit of hematuria.

**Urine microscopy**examines urine sediments for RBC morphology, and RBC casts are the single most significant test which can differentiate between glomerular and non-glomerular bleed.

**Renal parameters**should be obtained to rule out acute kidney injury.

**Imaging:**Initial imaging could be in the form of an ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. It can assist in diagnosing anatomical causes of hematuria such as a kidney stone or bladder or renal mass. It can also detect renal cysts. Abdominopelvic CT scan with or without contrast is the preferred modality to detect renal stones and other morphological abnormalities of kidneys. MRI abdomen and pelvis is another useful modality if CT scan is contraindicated or not helpful.

**Cystoscopy:**After ruling out urinary tract infection and having negative imaging of kidneys and ureters to detect any abnormality, cystoscopy by a urologist is the next step in the evaluation of hematuria. It can detect urothelial carcinoma, bladder wall inflammation or mucosal thickening. It can also be therapeutic to remove bladder stones.

**Urine Cytology**can be performed to detect malignant cells or to detect urothelial carcinoma, but it is not a substitute for a cystoscopy.

**Kidney biopsy:**The gold standard to diagnose a glomerular cause of hematuria is a kidney biopsy by a nephrologist or interventional radiologist.

# Medical Management

Management depends on underlying etiology. For asymptomatic intermittent hematuria with negative imaging, stable renal functions, and absence of proteinuria, observation may be a reasonable approach. Overt hematuria needs prompt management. Hemodynamic stability should be assured first. Any hematological abnormality should be corrected by blood products, transfusions, or medications. In rare instances, interventional radiology guided embolism is required to stop life-threatening bleeding from renal vasculature or for hemorrhagic cystitis refractory to conventional treatments.

**Non-Glomerular causes of hematuria:**Acute urinary tract infections are treated with a 7-14 day course of oral or intravenous antibiotics. Nephrolithiasis management is supportive, with controlling pain and administering fluids. Kidney stone size and location could warrant further management.

**Glomerular causes of hematuria:**Some hereditary diseases like Alport’s, thin basement membrane disease, and polycystic kidney Disease need monitoring of renal functions, and regular follow up. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis requires supportive care. IgA nephropathy treatment depends on degree proteinuria and renal function. Relatively normal creatinine with minimal proteinuria may be managed conservatively. High-risk features including worsening creatinine, persistent proteinuria 1000mg/day, and active disease on renal biopsy are indications to consider immunosuppressive therapy especially steroids.

# Nursing Management

- Assess vitals

- Bodyweight

- Check for the presence of edema

- Dip urine to check for blood and proteins

- Check labs to assess renal function and coagulation parameters

- Check the list of patient medications (warfarin can cause hematuria)

- Check blood pressure

# When To Seek Help

- If gross hematuria

- High blood pressure

- Edema

- Abdominal pain

- Fever

- Weight loss

# Outcome Identification

Children with isolated hematuria have a good outcome but the presence of proteinuria, hypertension or abnormal renal function usually leads to a guarded prognosis. In adults, hematuria should be taken seriously because it may signal a malignancy.

# Monitoring

- Assess vitals

- Bodyweight

- Check for the presence of edema

- Dip urine to check for blood and proteins

- Check labs to assess renal function and coagulation parameters

- Check the list of patient medications (warfarin can cause hematuria)

- Check blood pressure

- Educate patient about hematuria

- Encourage a low salt diet if patient has hypertension

# Coordination of Care

A team approach is an ideal means to evaluate and manage hematuria. In most cases, initial management will involve a primary care physician or emergency medicine physician. After getting initial workup, referral to a nephrologist or urologist may be indicated. Inpatient or outpatient referral decision depends on the severity of presentation, abnormal lab findings, and the presence of risk factors for serious etiology.

# Health Teaching and Health Promotion

Clinicians including the nurse practitioner should inform the parents that hematuria by itself should not prevent the child from undertaking sporting activities, however, the type of activity should be regulated. The pharmacist should educate the patients on some medications that may cause hematuria. However, the pharmacist should consult with the team members before making any recommendation on discontinuation of the drug.

# Risk Management

Because some of the causes of hematuria are caused by malignancies, the key is to communicate with the members of the team so that there is no delay in diagnosis.

# Discharge Planning

Hematuria is commonly seen in clinical practice. Because of the vast number of conditions that can cause hematuria, the presentation is best managed by an interprofessional team. In most cases, initial management will involve a primary care physician or emergency medicine physician. After getting the initial workup, a referral to a nephrologist or urologist may be indicated.

Inpatient or outpatient referral decision depends on the severity of presentation, abnormal lab findings, and the presence of risk factors for serious etiology.
