**Imaging**

The appearance of myofibroblastoma on imaging is non-specific.

Gynecomastia is an inconsistent finding.

However, some show a mass with a variable oval or irregular configuration and heterogeneous echo pattern, with more distal acoustic attenuation due to the incorporation of fat tissue and other types of tissue in the tumor. Applying the doppler modality may demonstrate peripheral hypervascularization of the tumor.

Although not often done, MRI findings of myofibroblastoma show a homogeneously contrast-enhanced, circumscribed mass with internal septations and hyperintense signal in T2-weighted images with diffusion restriction surrounded by a hypointense capsule and plateau kinetics.

Furthermore, some studies identified that the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) could be a useful MRI finding in distinguishing myofibroblastoma from other malignant lesions. Since low values of ADC are detected in malignant lesions, higher ADC values are likely representative of myofibroblastoma.

**Tissue Diagnosis**

Fine-needle aspiration or an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy may be performed for diagnosis. However, due to a lack of cellularity, fine needle aspiration shows non-specific whorls of spindle cells with benign ovoid nuclei or non-diagnostic results.
