Multiple genes have been shown to interact during the development of the primitive eye, as is the case with the rest of the developing embryo. In the eye, the PAX6 gene is the primary control gene, with the WNT gene and FGF gene playing a supplementary role during the development of the optic vesicles. Another prominent gene in embryonic development of the eye is the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene, which is responsible for the suppression of PAX6. If Shh becomes inhibited, then PAX6 deregulation results in cyclopia. Conversely, overexpression of Shh has been shown to result in a loss of eye structures. Retinoic acid also plays an important role in the development of the eye, mainly through its use as a paracrine inhibitor of the mesenchyme around the optic cup. Lack of retinoic acid can thus lead to defects in the anterior segment and results in blindness.

However, the interplay between genes and molecular signaling factors are so complex that it does not fit in the scope of this article. Some of the other genes involved in development include but are not limited toÂ PITX2, PITX3, FOXC1, FOXE3, LMX1B, GPR48, TFAP2A, and TFAP2B.
