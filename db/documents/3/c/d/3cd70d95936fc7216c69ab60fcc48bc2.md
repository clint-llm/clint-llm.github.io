A tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is a complex infectious mass of the adnexa that forms as a sequela of pelvic inflammatory disease. Classically, a TOA manifests with an adnexal mass, fever, elevated white blood cell count, lower abdominal-pelvic pain, and/or vaginal discharge; however, presentations of this disease can be highly variable. Should the abscess rupture, life-threatening sepsis can result, thus any clinical concern for this diagnosis requires prompt evaluation and treatment. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on the differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess
- Recall the presentation of tubo-ovarian abscess.
- List the treatment and management options available for tubo-ovarian abscesses.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with tubo-ovarian abscess.
