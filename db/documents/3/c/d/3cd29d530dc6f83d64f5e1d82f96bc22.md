As with all psychiatric diagnoses, the most important diagnostic tool is the interview. In the setting of a female patient who presents immediately after or within two weeks of delivery, a low mood and depressive symptoms that do not meet the major depressive disorder criteria can point to a diagnosis of postpartum blues. If the criteria for major depressive disorder are met or if the mood disturbances persist beyond two weeks after delivery, a diagnosis of postpartum blues should not be made.
