Benzocaine is administered in various forms for pain control and used in procedures such as awake intubations and transesophageal echocardiography. It is crucial for interprofessional healthcare team members who perform these procedures and administer benzocaine to work in a coordinated manner. Nurses, pharmacists, clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), and other healthcare workers involved in patient care should be well aware of the toxicity and adverse effects of benzocaine such as methemoglobinemia and communicate in an interprofessional team manner to ensure effective therapy and prevent toxicity or adverse events. In the case of suspected methemoglobinemia, a medical toxicologist should be present and involved in the patient's care. With an interprofessional team approach, patients can receive the pain relief they need with a reduced potential for adverse events, leading to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
