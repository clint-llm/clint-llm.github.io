The most common defects leading to Eisenmenger syndrome are ASD, VSD, and PDA defects. The following three main processes result in the ultimate reversal of a left-to-right into a right-to-left shunt:

- **Vasoconstriction**due to imbalances in pulmonary vascular tone, followed by

- **Vascular****remodeling******due to the proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle, and finally

- **Thrombosis**caused by the increased resistance of blood flow.
