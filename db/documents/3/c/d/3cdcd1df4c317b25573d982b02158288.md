The pelvis is composed of various ligaments, muscles, bones, and other structures that connect the axial skeleton to the lower extremities. When dysfunctions occur in this important part of the body, patients may experience pain in a variety of muscles, abnormalities in gait, and viscerosomatic disturbances. Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional problem that can be caused by the disturbance of either nerve in the pelvic area or due to psychosomatic issues.

Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) techniques directed at treating the pelvis in this paper will focus on muscle energy (ME). ME is considered a direct technique, a form of treatment that engages the targeted muscles and stretches them towards their restrictive barrier. One of the aspects of ME is that it requires the patient to be able to understand and participate in the treatment; therefore, it requires clear communication between them and the physician. ME is an effective technique at treating pain in various parts of the body ranging from the pelvis to the neck and even the elbow.

The educational purpose of this paper will focus on how ME can treat different types of muscular and non-muscular pain in the pelvic area.
