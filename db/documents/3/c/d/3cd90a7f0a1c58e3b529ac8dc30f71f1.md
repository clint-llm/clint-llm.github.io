**Box Warning**: According to the manufacturer's labeling, Cilostazol administration is contraindicated in patients with heart failure of any grade. Cilostazol and many of its metabolites are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase III. Several drugs with the pharmacologic effect have caused decreased survival compared to placebo in patients with class III-IV heart failure.

Drugs with vasodilator-type properties generally decrease systemic blood pressure, resulting in a reduction in lower limb perfusion pressure. These agents may also cause a steal of blood from ischemic regions in which blood vessels are already maximally dilated. Therefore, there have been questions regarding the justification for treatment with vasodilators in claudication with absolute contraindication in patients with a history of heart failure. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors have demonstrated decreased survival compared with placebo in patients with class III to IV heart failure. Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease may incur an increased risk of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction exacerbation.

Caution is also necessary when prescribing cilostazol to individuals with atrial or ventricular ectopy and those with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is another observation in patients with sigmoid-shaped interventricular septums undergoing cilostazol therapy.
