If KD is on your differential, order the echocardiogram; missing a diagnosis or diagnosing the disease late can be catastrophic.

If considering incomplete KD, order ESR, CRP, CBC, serum albumin and alanine aminotransferase and urinalysis.

Missed diagnosis is often due to vague initial presentation, typically with fever and enlarged unilateral lymph nodes.  The following rash and mucosal changes may be mistakenly blamed on a reaction to the antibiotics for presumed bacterial infection.

Children with Kawasaki disease should get an echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis, two weeks after symptom onset, and again at eight weeks after the diagnosis.  AHA recommends repeating an echocardiogram 10 to 14 days after the initial one and 4 to 6 weeks after all laboratory data have normalized.

The goal of treatment is the prevention of cardiac complications.  Therefore, all patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease should receive IVIG and aspirin.

Many children get lost to long-term follow-up as an adult leading to severe cardiac complications.
