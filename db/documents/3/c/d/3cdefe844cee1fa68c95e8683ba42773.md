Changes in the sequence of electrical activation have already been described as the underlying process that leads to primary electrical remodeling. However, even the change in the rate of electrical activation can cause electrical remodeling of the heart. Both of these changes occur in the absence of any structural insult to the heart. Right ventricular pacing in the longterm can lead to persistent changes in the direction of T-wave on the electrocardiogram. These changes were still present, even following the restoration of the normal sequence of electrical activation. The t-wave polarity remembered the polarity of the QRS complex during the period of an altered sequence of electrical activation. Therefore, this phenomenon was termed ‘cardiac memory.’
