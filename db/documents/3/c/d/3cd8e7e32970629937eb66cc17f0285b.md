No known environmental or genetic risk factors predispose to the development of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.Â Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm can occur as an isolated neoplasm or in conjunction with other hematologic neoplasms.

A prior history of hematologic malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia, has been reported in 10 to 20% of patients diagnosed with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm.
