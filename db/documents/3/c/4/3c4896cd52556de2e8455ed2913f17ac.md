Patients intubated in the field will need some form of artificial ventilation started. Bag Valve Mask (BVM) ventilation is unreliable and inconsistent and requires a dedicated provider to continue ventilation. Using mechanical ventilators in the prehospital environment allows for precise control of ventilation, particularly in areas with longer transport times. Recognition of basic respiratory physiology and ventilator settings is essential to start mechanical ventilation safely and correct the underlying respiratory derangement. Improper ventilator management can not only worsen the acute disease process but can also set off an inflammatory cascade causing worsening lung injury. This activity reviews the different ventilator modes used in intubated patients and their pros and cons.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for ventilation.
- Summarize the initial settings on the ventilator of a patient who has just been intubated.
- Describe the various classifications of ventilators.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the management of a patient needing intubation and ventilation.
