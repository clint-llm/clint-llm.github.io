Electrophysiology (EP) study is an invasive percutaneous cardiac procedure used for the investigation and treatment of certain arrhythmias. The aims of conducting an EP study are to access the function of each component of the conduction system, identify the mechanism and precise focus for arrhythmia, risk stratification and determine the need for treatment or therapy, including ablation of the aberrant circuit. This article presents an overview including anatomy and physiology, indications in common cardiac pathologies, and clinical significance ofÂ EP studies.
