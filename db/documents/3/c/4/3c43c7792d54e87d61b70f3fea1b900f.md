Early prostate cancer is generally asymptomatic, and an elevated serum PSA level is often the first indication of malignancy. Anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase are additional laboratory values that may suggest prostate cancer but are very nonspecific and suggest advanced disease, which makes them useless for screening or early detection. A digital rectal examination (DRE) should be performed on all individuals with an abnormal PSA screening even though no specific finding reliably confirms either the presence or absence of prostate cancer. It is utilized to improve the overall sensitivity of the screening and could be an important factor in deciding on management if cancer is discovered.

Overall, up to 14% of prostate cancer patients demonstrate metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The finding of metastatic prostate cancer can be correlated with elevated PSA values.Â Serum PSA values >20 ng/mL have a positive predictive value of 65% for metastatic disease and skeletal involvement. This number increases linearly with a positive predictive value for metastatic disease of 86% for PSA levels >100 ng/mL.
