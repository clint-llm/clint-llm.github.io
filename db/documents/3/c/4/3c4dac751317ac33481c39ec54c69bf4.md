Multifocal atrial tachycardia is most often asymptomatic. However, patients typically have symptoms related to their underlying condition. Therefore, this arrhythmia is often found incidentally on the routine electrocardiogram or on a cardiac telemetry monitor. Studies show most people do not report palpitations or symptoms of syncope or pre-syncope. Once a diagnosis is made, a thorough history should be obtained with a focus on commonly associated conditions including cardiac and pulmonary diseases. On physical exam, most patients will have an elevated heart rate and an irregularly irregular rhythm. Most patients are hemodynamically stable, however, due to the association with underlying conditions, it is sensible to conduct a general assessment for signs of cardiopulmonary disease, especially since this arrhythmia can trigger decompensation of underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease.
