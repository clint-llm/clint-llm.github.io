Varicella infection during pregnancy is uncommon due to widespread immunity in women of childbearing age after having chickenpox or varicella immunization which was introduced in 1995. Varicella infection in a seronegative pregnant female occurs if she acquires person-to-person transmission from direct contact with varicella-zoster lesions or respiratory droplets spread from an infected person with chickenpox. Clinical presentation and the severity of the neonate will depend on when the mother contracted the virus during the pregnancy.

Congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) results when a mother is infected with the VZV during the first half of pregnancy. The highest risk (2%) occurs in the second trimester between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation.

When a pregnant woman develops a varicella infection around delivery, neonatal varicella infection may occur. Mother to child transmission can occur in three ways: transplacental viremia, direct contact with skin lesions or blood during delivery, and post-natal contact by respiratory droplets or skin contact with infected vesicles.  Infants are at the highest risk for severe varicella infection when maternal infection develops 5 days before and 2 days after delivery. In that time period, the baby will be exposed to high viremia but will not have adequate time to acquire maternal protective antibodies.
