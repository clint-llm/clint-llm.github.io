Biopsy of an SPN with fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), either transthoracic or endobronchial, may help with the diagnosis. Most of the time, biopsies are obtained to determine if the nodule is benign or malignant. If the biopsy is positive, then one has the diagnosis and can treat accordingly, but what if the results are negative? The negative predictive value of an FNAB is around 89.4%.
