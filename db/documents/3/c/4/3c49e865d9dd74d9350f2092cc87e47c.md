Tumor and characteristics are assessed using the patient’s history, clinical exam, and imaging, most commonly computed tomography (CT). On CT scan, ameloblastomas appear as radiolucent (radiographically dark) lesions of the maxilla or mandible, often with multilocular or “soap-bubble” appearance, bony expansion and tooth root resorption. They may also be associated with unerupted teeth. A definitive diagnosis of ameloblastoma is with a surgical biopsy, which shows characteristic histologic findings. It is essential to differentiate the entity from a primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma.

The World Health Organization (WHO) classified malignant ameloblastoma into two types

- Metastasizing ameloblastoma

- Histologically similar to benign ameloblastoma but shows metastatic spread to distant sites

- Ameloblastic carcinoma

- Shows malignant features on histology
- Can be further subdivided into two subtypes:

- Primary ameloblastic carcinoma: arises de novo (from Latin meaning "anew")
- Secondary ameloblastic carcinoma: the eventual result of malignant transformation of a previously diagnosed benign ameloblastoma
