Obesity leads to peripheral insulin resistance, which in turn leads to hyperglycemia as discussed. Independent of obesity, certain ethnicities have higher risks of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Hyperglycemia leads to an osmotic diuresis (polyuria), which increases thirst (polydipsia). This diuresis causes moderate to severe dehydration. Prolonged hyperglycemia can produce two distinct emergent states in type 2 diabetes mellitus in children:

Diabetic ketoacidosis: much more common in children with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to adults. Lack of insulin inhibits the body's ability to use glucose for energy and reverts to breaking down fat for energy. This leads to ketosis, acidosis, and electrolyte abnormalities and may lead to coma and death.

Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS): characterized by hypertonicity, extreme hyperglycemia (> 600 mg/dl), and severe dehydration. The profound hyperglycemia results in continued osmotic diuresis and intravascular depletion.
