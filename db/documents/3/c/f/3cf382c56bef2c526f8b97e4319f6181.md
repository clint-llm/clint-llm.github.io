Hamstring muscle injuries are currently one of the most common injuries suffered by athletes. Patients largely report strains due to quick changes in speed and excessive lengthening of the hamstrings due to a particular inciting event or experiencing proximal tendinopathy resulting from excessive use over long periods. Two types of acute hamstring strains appear in the current literature. Type 1, involving mainly the proximal tendon muscle junction of the biceps femoris, results during the terminal deceleration of the swing phase of running as the patient prepares to plant their foot resulting in eccentric muscle contraction.

Clinically, patients typically describe hamstring muscle strains as beginning acutely during physical activities involving the lower body with a sharp or stabbing pain in the proximal posterior thigh with increasing pain with active extension of the hip or flexion of the knee. A possible pop and/or delayed appearance of ecchymosis around the area of pain presents in more extreme cases.

Treatment for hamstring injuries largely revolves around decreasing inflammation and damage near the time of injury with resting of the muscles, NSAIDs, and icing. Following initial treatment of the injury, varying progressions of physical therapy are used to progress patients back to full use of their hamstrings while avoiding re-injury, a very common occurrence with hamstring injuries.
