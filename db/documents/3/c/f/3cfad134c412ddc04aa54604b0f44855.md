Avoidance of opioid use is recommended in patients who have taken an MAO inhibitor within 14 days due to the increased risk of serotonin toxicity.

Patients with substance misuse disorder may also be a contraindication to intraoperative and perioperative opioid anesthesia/analgesia. Clinicians must carefully weigh the benefit to risk ratio in such patients when deciding how to best proceed with anesthesia for a given procedure.
