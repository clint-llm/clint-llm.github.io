Informed consent is necessary, and a careful and clear conversation had with the patient about the indications for completion axillary dissection. Typically, completion axillary dissection is not done at the time of sentinel node biopsy. However, in cases in which pathology is available to give results of a frozen section during the operation, a completion dissection can be performed. If using a radiotracer, the patient should be scheduled for injection by radiology early on the day of the procedure. Lymphoscintigraphy is optional but can be helpful if there is any concern that the sentinel node may be located elsewhere, like the internal mammary nodes. Internal mammary nodes are not retrieved. Internal mammary node involvement can be more common in tumors of the lower inner quadrant of the breast.
