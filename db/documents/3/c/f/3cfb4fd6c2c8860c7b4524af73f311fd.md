Early decelerations are very common and are a benign finding. Early decelerations appear to represent an autonomic response mediated by vagal activation in response to changes in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow during a uterine contraction.

As early decelerations are not associated with decreased fetal oxygenation or metabolic acidosis, they do not require any treatment. However, it is crucial to continue to monitor FHR tracings throughout labor to recognize any patterns that may be a concern regarding changes in the acid-base status of the fetus.

The three-tiered fetal heart rate interpretation system is as follows

Category I (Must include all of the following):

- Baseline rate: 110 to 160 beats per minute

- Baseline FHR variability: moderate

- Late or variable decelerations absent

- Early decelerations: present or absent

- Accelerations: present or absent

Category II

- All FHR tracings not categorized as Category I or III.

Category III (Includes either):

- Absent baseline FHR variability and any of the following:

- Recurrent late decelerations
- Recurrent variable decelerations
- Bradycardia

- Sinusoidal pattern

Category I FHR tracings are normal and require no specific action. Continued FHR monitoring per the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations allows the team to beÂ vigilant for more concerning FHR tracings. Category II tracings are indeterminate and require an evaluation and continued surveillance and reevaluation. Category III tracings are associated with abnormal fetal acid-base status and require prompt evaluation.
