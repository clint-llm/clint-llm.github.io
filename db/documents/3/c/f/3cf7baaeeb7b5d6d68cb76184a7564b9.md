A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in patients undergoing splenectomy as it is a major procedure associated with both intraoperative and postoperative complications. It is imperative to understand the risks involved in a splenectomy. A joint collaboration between primary care physicians, hematologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons, and pharmacists is needed in preoperative planning.

Prior to surgery, the patient should have the following done:

- Discuss with the hematologist regarding splenectomy as a treatment for a hematological disorder

- Discuss with a surgeon to discuss the possible surgical options, including open approach, laparoscopic approach, or even robotic-assisted approach. Explain the risks and benefits of each approach.

- Discuss with pharmacy regarding the vaccines and timing to administer these vaccines to prevent OPSI

- Discuss with an anesthesiologist the risks of general anesthesia. Ensure blood products are ordered and available intraoperatively in case if transfusion is needed.
