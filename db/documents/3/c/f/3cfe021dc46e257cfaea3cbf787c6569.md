Avoid rodents, wash hands and face after contact and any scratches should be cleaned, and antiseptics applied. The effect of prophylactic chemoprophylaxis following rodent bites or scratches is unknown. Animal handlers, laboratory workers, sanitation, and sewer workers must take precautions against exposure. Wild rodents, dead or alive, should not be touched.

Typically Intravenous Penicillin G at a dose of  200,000 units every 4 hours or Ceftriaxone 1 gram intravenously daily should be administered. Once the patient improves clinically, the Intravenous medications can be transitioned to either Penicillin V 500 Mg four times a day or Ampicillin 500 mg four times a day or Amoxicillin 500 mg three times a day. The total duration of antibiotics is 2 weeks. In Penicillin allergic patients, Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day either intravenously or orally can be substituted.
