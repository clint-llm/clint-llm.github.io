In cases of aortoiliac occlusive disease, classic indications for surgical intervention include the following

- Iliac artery or abdominal aorta severe atherosclerosis causing symptoms

- Acute occlusion of iliac arteries or abdominal aorta

- Severe symptoms of claudication despite optimal medical therapy

- Gangrene of leg, nonhealing ulcers

- Critical limb ischemia, which can present as rest pain or severe claudication symptoms.

- Impotence

Before the surgical intervention, a trial of smoking cessation, regular exercise, antiplatelet therapy, weight loss, treatment of underlying hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes is in order.

A classification system termed the Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus was created to help clinicians determine if an open or endovascular technique was best suited for patients based on the morphological classification of their lesions.

**Type A Lesions**

- CIA unilateral or bilateral stenosis;

- EIA single lesion of unilateral or bilateral <3cm stenosis.

**Type B Lesions**

- Stenosis less than 3m involving the infrarenal aorta

- CIA unilateral occlusion

- EIA with unilateral single/multiple areas of stenosis (totaling 3 to 10cm), sparing CFA

- EIA with unilateral occlusion (sparing origins of IIA or CFA)

**Type C Lesions**

- Bilateral CIA occlusion

- Bilateral EIA stenosis of 3 to 10cm, sparing CFA

- Unilateral EIA stenosis with the inclusion of ipsilateral CFA

- Unilateral EIA occlusion with the inclusion of origin of IIA and/or CFA

- EIA occlusion with heavy calcification with/without associated inclusion of IIA and/or CFA

**Type D Lesions**

- Occlusion of the infrarenal aortoiliac region

- Disease diffusely involving the aorta and bilateral CIA

- Multiple diffuse areas of stenosis including unilateral CIA and ipsilateral EIA, CFA

- Occlusion of unilateral CIA and ipsilateral EIA

- Occlusion of Bilateral EIA

- Iliac stenosis with co-existing AAA requiring treatment, but is unamenable to endograft

- Lesions necessitating open aortic or iliac surgery
