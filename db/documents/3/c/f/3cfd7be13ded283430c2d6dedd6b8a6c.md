**Blood Supply**

The brachial artery is the main arterial supply to the arm. It starts from the lower border of teres major muscle as a continuation of the axillary artery, and it ends opposite to the neck of the radius by dividing it to ulnar and radial arteries. The brachial artery branches are the nutrient branch to the humerus, the profunda artery and ulnar collateral arteries that supply the posterior fascial compartment.

**Lymphatics**

The superficial lymphatic vessels drain the superficial tissue upward to the axilla, those from the lateral side of the arm follow the cephalic vein to the infraclavicular nodes; those from the medial side the arm follow basilic vein to the lateral group of axillary nodes. Whereas the deep lymphatic vessels drain the muscles and deeper structures to the lateral group of axillary nodes.
