Beta-lactam antimicrobials are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections and are among the most prescribed drugs in the US.

The most common bacteria treated by beta-lactamase inhibitors are the Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella), Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Staphylococcus aureus also contains the beta-lactamase enzyme. However, beta-lactamase inhibitors are less commonly used for the treatment of staph due to the presence of an alternate antimicrobial resistance mechanism, namely the presence of a penicillin-binding protein, which is ubiquitous among gram-positive bacteria.Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are notable ESBL-producing bacteria. Research has demonstrated that beta-lactamase inhibitors can effectively treat ESBL-producing organisms, thereby improving our ability to fight these virulent bacteria.

Avibactam is used in combination with ceftazidime (a cephalosporin) to treat urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal infections, pyelonephritis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria, including ESBL-producing bacteria.****Relebactam is used in combination with imipenem and cilastatin. It is used to treat pyelonephritis, urinary tract infections, and intra-abdominal infections.****Sulbactam is used in combination with ampicillin and is used to treat skin, intrabdominal, and gynecologic infections.****Vaborbactam is used in combination with meropenem to treat urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis.Mycobacterium tuberculosis that inhibits its beta-lactamase enzyme and is the only orally available beta-lactamase inhibitor.
