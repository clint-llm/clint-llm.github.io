Histopathologically, dermoid tissue consists of a stratified squamous irregularly keratinized epithelium like epidermis. The stroma is dense and contains disordered pilar structures like sebaceous glands, sweat glands, hair follicles, vascular structures, and adipose tissue.

Depending upon the stromal structures, Zhong et al. have described four types of dermoid. The most common is limbal dermoid showing collagen fibers in the epidermis and dermis. Lipodermoid consists of collagen fiber tissue and adipose tissue. Complex choristoma comprises collagen fiber tissue, smooth muscle, and glandular tissue (lacrimal tissue, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands). Epibulbar osseous choristoma contains collagen fiber tissue, glandular, bone, and nervous tissue.****

Triolo et al. described the in vivo confocal microscopy of limbal dermoid using Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II, Cornea Module, which allows in vivo imaging of sections at different depths parallel to the scanned surface. The most superficial in vivo confocal section (18 μm depth) showed a highly regular pattern of dark gray round structures surrounded by a thin white ring, likely to be corneal epithelium. Deeper sections, at 63 μm, showed the longitudinal course of continuous, branched, tubular structures likely to be vessels.
