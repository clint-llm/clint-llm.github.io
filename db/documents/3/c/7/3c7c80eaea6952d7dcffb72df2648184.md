Hypercalcemia can be classified into

- Mild hypercalcemia: 10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL

- Moderate hypercalcemia: 12.0 to 13.9 mg/dL

- Hypercalecemic crisis: 14.0 to 16.0 mg/dL

Most cases of hypercalcemia are detected on routine testing. Work up for etiology includes obtaining serum PTH, calcitonin, Vitamin D, ionized calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase levels, renal functions, and urinary calcium-creatinine ratio. Sensitive and specific immunochemiluminometric assays should be used to measure parathyroid hormone (PTH) (i-PTH). Hyperparathyroidism is characterized by high calcium, high i-PTH levels with low phosphorous levels. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia has inappropriately normal PTH levels with high magnesium and low calcium creatinine clearance. Other causes of hypercalcemia typically have low PTH levels. Patients with hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D have high serum concentrations of calcidiol, whereas, patients with a granulomatous disease have high levels of calcitriol. In patients with hypercalcemia associated with malignancy, the PTH-related peptide levels are elevated. Imaging is indicated to identify nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. Neonates and infants who are found to be hypercalcemic in the presence of dysmorphic features should prompt evaluation for Williams or Murk Jansen syndrome.

Imaging studies are done to rule out sarcoidosis or lung cancer. A mammogram is used to rule out breast cancer and a CT scan is done to rule out renal cancer. The parathyroid glands are investigated with ultrasound and MRI.

ECG features of hypercalcemia include:

- T wave flattening or inversion

- Mild prolongation of the QRS and PR intervals

- ST-elevation

- Presence of J wave at the end of the QRS complex
