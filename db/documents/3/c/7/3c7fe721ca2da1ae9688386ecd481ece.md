**Primary Meige Syndrome**

Several studies and clinical scenarios have provoked the significance of genetic components in the generation of disease. The patients with p.Gly213Ser, or p.Ala353thr mutations have been found to have clinical manifestations of Meige syndrome. Recently GNAL (gene for guanine nucleotide-binding protein G, subunit alpha) mutations are reported to be the cause of cranial and cervical dystonia, but more evidence is needed.

**Secondary Meige Syndrome**

One-fourth of the patients who have been taking neuroleptic medications for more than a year develop alterations in receptor function, which causes facial or cervical dystonia due to denervation hypersensitivity that is thought to be due to the increased central dopaminergic activity, which is further supported by the fact that it improves with dopamine-depleting agents. Those medications which increase central dopamine activity include antiemetics (metoclopramide), antipsychotics, antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antihistamines, and dopaminergic agonists. Moreover, head trauma, stroke, demyelination of brain stem region, normal pressure hydrocephalus, cerebral hypoxia, postoperative (bilateral thalamotomy), kernicterus, space-occupying lesions, post-encephalitis. Meige syndrome can be associated with other movement disorders, like Parkinson disease, Wilson disease, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, or Lewy body disease.
