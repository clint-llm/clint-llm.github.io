Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a rare condition where an incomplete closure of the developing diaphragm results in herniation of the abdominal viscera into the thoracic cavity. The thoracic crowding and increased pressures detrimentally affect the developing cardiopulmonary system. Understanding the pathophysiology, prenatal interventions, postnatal evaluation, and intraoperative considerations is essential to guide perioperative anesthetic care.

An overview of the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and general medical management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is discussed elsewhere.
