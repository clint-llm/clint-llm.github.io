The overall prevalence of “spontaneous” RBD is estimated to be about 1% in the general population and 2% in older individuals.

Causes of “secondary” RBD, especially in younger individuals, include parkinsonism, narcolepsy, or the use of antidepressant medications. The prevalence of RBD in narcolepsy has been reported to be as high as 36%.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may mimic RBD and is referred to as “pseudo RBD.”
