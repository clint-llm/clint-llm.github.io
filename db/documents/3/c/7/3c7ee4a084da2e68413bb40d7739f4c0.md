Most women with bacterial vaginosis present with a complaint of malodorous vaginal discharge.

The clinician should elicit pertinent history regarding the risk factors for this disease, as well as a previous history of bacterial vaginosis infections.

A proper physical exam must include a pelvic exam to examine the characteristics of the vaginal discharge and to help exclude other similarly presenting diseases, including candidiasis, cervicitis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus, and trichomoniasis.

It is important to assess for fever, pelvic pain, and a history of sexually transmitted infections to rule out the more serious conditions that remain on the differential diagnosis.

Since clue cells are thought to be the most reliable diagnostic sign of bacterial vaginosis, it will be necessary to examine the vaginal fluid under a microscope.
