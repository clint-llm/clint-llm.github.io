The equipment required for flap harvest is the same as that for any free flap microsurgical case. Pre-operatively: sterile plastic sheet/drape to make a template of the defect, hand Doppler, and skin markers for marking of the perforators and the flap. Intra-operatively, surgeons will require loupes for flap dissection and an operating microscope with good optics for microsurgical anastomosis.

Instruments for flap harvest include standard plastic surgical instruments like skin hooks, self-retaining retractors, Adson forceps, Debakey forceps, fine tenotomy scissors, vessel clips, skin dermatome, and mesher. Microsurgical instruments: jeweler forceps, Castroviejo needle holder, vessel dilator forceps, microscissors (both curved and straight), microvascular clamps (both arterial and venous clamps), and micro sutures (8-0, 9-0, and 10-0 nylon sutures on tapered needles).

Heparin saline solution, 1% or 2% plain lidocaine solution, and papaverine solution are required for intraoperative irrigation of vessels to prevent vasospasm. Post-operative dressing materials required include plaster of Paris (POP) slabs, burn gauze, soft bandages and wool, elastic-crepe bandages, andÂ sterile/antiseptic dressings.
