NSAIDs like sulindac are a common therapy for patients with arthritis, spondylitis, and tendinitis. Clinicians should be vigilant while prescribing sulindac, as it has few long-term and toxic adverse effects. Nurses should understand the signs and symptoms of toxicities thoroughly and counsel the patients on the importance of adhering to scheduled dosing regimens. Pharmacists should check the dose, verify the appropriateness of the treatment with sulindac, and report to the clinicians any concerns. Nurses can counsel the patient and monitor for these adverse events, reporting to the prescriber if they note any concerns. All healthcare team members should be able to implement treatment protocols rapidly in the case of emergencies to improve patient care. SulindacÂ therapy needs an interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient outcomes.
