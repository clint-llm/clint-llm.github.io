Wyburn-Mason syndrome presents with a range of neurological symptoms that primarily depend on the location and size of the arteriovenous malformations. Neurological symptoms may include seizures, headaches, hemiparesis, visual deficits, cranial neuropathies, and hydrocephalus.

The majority of individuals have involvement of the eye at a young age and can be severely visually impaired. If theÂ arteriovenous malformations are diagnosed at an early age, the risk of systemic involvement is high.
