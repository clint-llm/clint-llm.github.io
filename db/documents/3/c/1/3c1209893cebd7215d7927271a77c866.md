The prevalence of sliding hiatal hernias ranges from 10% to 60%. Sliding hiatal hernias represent 95% of all hiatal hernias with paraesophageal hernias making the remaining. Older individuals are affected more commonly than those younger than the age of 50. There is an increased preponderance among obese patients and those who suffer from conditions that increase intra-abdominal pressure, for example, chronic constipation or excessive vomiting. Of the paraesophageal hernias, the most and least frequent are type 3 and 2, respectively.  The term "giant hiatal hernia" refers to a hiatal hernia that has 30% or more of the stomach superior to the hiatus and in the thoracic cavity.
