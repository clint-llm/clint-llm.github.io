Macroglossia may cause nasopharyngeal obstruction,Â leading to total obstruction of the airway and subsequently, cerebral anoxia and sudden cardiac arrest. This is more likely to happen in the supine position when the base of the enlarged tongue obstructs the hypopharynx and oropharynx more easily. Some patients may have difficulty in chewing, and this might cause severe pain in the temporomandibular joint. The protrusion of the tongue exposes it to trauma. It leads to mucosal drying and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections.

Other symptoms include drooling, swallowing difficulties, airway obstruction, mandibular deformities, teeth spacing abnormalities, and failure to thrive. Due to abnormal size and position, patients may suffer from speech and articulation problems. Macroglossia makes intubation difficult, and care should be taken as blind intubation may result in trauma.
