The adverse effects of anticholinergic medications divide into central and peripheral effects. Central effects result from the excess blockade of cholinergic receptors within the central nervous system, and peripheral adverse effects result from the blockade of exocrine glandular secretion,Â muscle contraction, and end-organ targets of the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system. Common central anticholinergic adverse effects include headache, impaired memory, reduced cognitive function, behavioral disturbances, anxiety, and insomnia at low dosages.

At high dosages and approaching the range of anticholinergic toxicity, central adverse effects include signs of agitation, confusion, delirium, and seizures.

- General: Hyperthermia and anhidrosis

- Cardiovascular: Tachycardia, flushing, and arrhythmias

- Gastrointestinal: Reduced gut motility, constipation, vomiting, reduced saliva, and tear production

- Genitourinary: Urinary retention

- HEENT: Blurred vision, mydriasis, narrow-angle glaucoma, and potentially vision loss

- Skin: Inhibition of sweating

- Musculoskeletal: Diminished muscle contraction

Overall, the potential to cause anticholinergic side effects is based on the drug's affinity for cholinergic receptors.
