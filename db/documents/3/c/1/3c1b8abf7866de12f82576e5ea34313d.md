Rotor syndrome, also known as Rotor type hyperbilirubinemia, is an autosomal recessive disease and a rare cause of mixed direct (conjugated) and indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia. The disease is characterized by non-hemolytic jaundice due to chronic elevation of predominantly conjugated bilirubin. This phenomenon results from impaired hepatocellular storage of conjugated bilirubin that leaks into plasma, causing hyperbilirubinemia. Its presenting symptom is jaundice, but Rotor syndrome is a benign, self-limiting disorder that does not require treatment. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of rotor syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Rotor syndrome.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with Rotor syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment for Rotor syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Rotor syndrome.
