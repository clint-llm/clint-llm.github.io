Fecal impaction is a serious GI disorder that affects many seniors. The disorder is best managed with an interprofessional team that includes a gastroenterologist, nurse, pharmacist, neurologist, social worker and physical therapist.

The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on no medications that slow down bowel movements and polypharmacy should be avoided. The dietitian should encourage an increase in fluid intake and high fiber diet. Both exercise and ambulation are vital. But it is usually the nurse who has to actually manage the patient with fecal impaction. Education of the family and patient about dietary habits and lifestyle are essential if one wants to prevent recurrences. If chronic constipation cannot be cured, then one must make attempts at improving the quality of life.

**Outcomes**

Constipation and fecal impaction can affect the quality of life. Despite the availability of medications, recurrence of constipation and fecal impaction remains a chronic problem.
