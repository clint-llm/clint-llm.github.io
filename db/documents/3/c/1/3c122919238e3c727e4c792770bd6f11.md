Objective evaluation should begin with a visual inspection of the elbow, looking for any obvious deformity or malpositioning of the extremity.Â  The elbow should have an assessment for any palpable effusion, and skin also inspected for ecchymosis. Next, the patient's elbow should be palpated to evaluate for any tenderness.

Subsequently, the neurovascular status of the extremity requires documentation. It is rare for arterial or neurologic injury to occur with elbow dislocations. However, it is crucial to document due to potential changes in neurovascular status after a reduction attempt.

Therefore, the function of the motor nerves is an essential part of the physical exam and requires testing in patients who have sustained an elbow dislocation. The median nerve is evaluated by checking the function of the flexor digitorum superficialis, or by asking the patient to make a fist.
