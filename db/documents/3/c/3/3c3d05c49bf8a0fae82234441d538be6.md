Sebaceous glands are grossly identifiable by their “foamy” appearance on microscopy. The cells appear round and empty because their plentiful lipid contents are washed away during the staining process. The lipids may be visualized by using Nile red stain, a lipophilic stain. Relatively undifferentiated sebocytes are located along with the outer layers of the gland, gradually becoming more differentiated and filled with lipid products toward the center. At the center, mature sebocytes undergo apoptosis, degrade, and form the necrosis zone, eventually releasing their contents that combine to form sebum. This process of lipid synthesis and discharge takes about one week in total.
