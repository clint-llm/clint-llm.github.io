There are several contraindications to ECT. Most contraindications are relative and need special consideration. The anesthesia provider must take into account each patient's comorbidities and address how a generalized seizure will affect them.  In most cases, pheochromocytoma and elevated intracranial pressure with mass effect at baseline are absolute contraindications.

An increase in intracranial or intraocular pressure is not tolerated very well for a patient with intracranial mass, retinal detachment, or intracerebral aneurysms. Patients with myocardial disease, cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding disorders, and pheochromocytoma may not tolerate the hemodynamic instability from extreme parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation during the procedure.
