Itching is believed to be due to a cutaneous hypersensitivity towards the louse saliva. Adult pubic lice can infect hairs of the scalp, axillary region, trunk, thighs, groin, eyebrows, and eyelashes. The eyelash involvement is rare. If present, it is primarily due to crab louse and very rarely due to head louse. Eyelash involvement by body louse is not seen. The pubic louse can quickly move from genital areas to eyelashes or other sites by themselves infecting the hair. In contrast, adult lice are transferred by means of contact with hands, dirty clothes, towels, or linen. In children, eyelashes are most commonly infected with a remote possibility of sexual abuse, which should be ruled out.
