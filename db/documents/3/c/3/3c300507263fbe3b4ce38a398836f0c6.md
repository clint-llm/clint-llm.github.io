There are three axes of development in the hand, and the biochemical role of different factors defines them. Limb growth and differentiation progress in a proximodistal manner for elongation of the limb, anteroposterior manner that defines preaxial and postaxial orientation, and dorsoventral manner which provides the dorsal and palmar orientation. The anteroposterior axis is mediated by the zone of polarizing activity, which secretes the protein Sonic hedgehog (Shh). This establishes the radial and ulnar sides of the limb and is the first axis to develop. The dorsoventral axis is not as well understood. It produces a protein called the wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family member 7a (Wnt-7a). This protein induces transcription of the factor LIM homeobox transcription factor (Lmx1), which is required for dorsalization of the limb bud. As this is occurring, a negative feedback loop occurs on the ventral side. The transcription factor engrailed-1 (En-1) inhibits the Wnt-7a expression. This establishes the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand. The apical epidermal ridge mediates the proximodistal axis. This thickened ridge secretes several fibroblast growth factors that differentiate the limb bud. This promotes elongation of the limb and is the last axis to develop.
