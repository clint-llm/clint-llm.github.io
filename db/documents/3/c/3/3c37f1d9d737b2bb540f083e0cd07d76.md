There is a well-established and recognized pathologic sequential algorithm for SLIL and SLAC wrist. The SLIL is a key stabilizer of the wrist and is a critical intercalating stabilizer to ensure normal, physiologic motion of the carpal bones, specifically the scaphoid and lunate bones.

As the normal opposing forces at the SL interval are lost, the scaphoid assumes an abnormally flexed position, while the lunate pathologically deviates into extension.

The pathologic cascade continues in an ulnar-based direction, with the final iteration yielding the collapse of the capitate proximally between a widened SL interval (known as the "Terry Thomas sign"), and end-stage patterns include capitolunate arthritis.
