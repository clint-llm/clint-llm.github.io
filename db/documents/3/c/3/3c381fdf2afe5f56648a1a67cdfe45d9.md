The mortality rate for those with an active tuberculosis infection who do not receive adequate treatment is around 50%. Those at an increased risk for worse outcomes and possible death include:

- Young children (especially infants) and elderly patients

- Those who have a delay or do not receive proper treatment

- Patients who display an extensive spread of the disease on radiologic imaging

- Patients who have a severe respiratory compromise

- Those who are taking drugs or suffer from a disease that causes immunosuppression
