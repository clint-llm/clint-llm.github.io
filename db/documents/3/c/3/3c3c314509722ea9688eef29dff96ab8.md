Cardiovascular toxicity is primarily seen in chronically milrinone patients and manifests as tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. At high dosing, patients may also experience hypotension and syncope.

It is important to note that there is no antidote to milrinone. Therefore, in case of overdose, the administration of milrinone should be discontinued until the patient’s condition stabilizes. Clinicians should treat the overdose symptomatically, focusing on hemodynamic parameters and arrhythmias.
