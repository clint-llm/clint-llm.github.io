The prognosis of type 1 halothane hepatotoxicity is much better than that of type 2 hepatitis; it is often self-remitting over several weeks, leaving little to no long-term dysfunction in most cases.Â  Type 2 halothane hepatotoxicity has a 50% mortality rate once it has progressed to acute liver failure and as high as 80% if hepatic encephalopathy has developed.
