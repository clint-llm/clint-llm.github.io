Classification based on anatomy

- Focal dystonia involves a single body part

- Segmental dystonia affects 2 or more contiguous body parts. The classic example is head and neck dystonia

- Multifocal dystonia involves noncontiguous body parts

- Generalized dystonia may involve the trunk and the limbs

- Hemidystonia is typically associated with deficits in the contralateral basal ganglia and also called unilateral dystonia.
