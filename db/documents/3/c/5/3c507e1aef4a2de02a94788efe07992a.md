Echocardiography is the use of ultrasound to evaluate the structural components of the heart in a minimally invasive strategy. Although, prior to the invention of today's routinely used 2-dimensional echocardiography, there was motion-based (M-mode) echocardiography. In 1953, Inge Edler, regarded as the father of echocardiography, first described M-mode technology, which began the era of diagnostic noninvasive echocardiography.

The most commonly used technique among these is transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). This allows the clinician to obtain real-time sizes, structure, and function of the heart during the cardiac cycle. Another useful and important use of these methods is stress echocardiography. Stress echocardiography is the combination of standard transthoracic echocardiography and either pharmacological or physical stress to the cardiac structures to assess wall motion abnormalities. Physical stresses may include running on a treadmill, and pharmacological stress, including medications.

Echocardiography is a low cost, at times minimally invasive, and readily available test that can provide information that can change the treatment course, and in some cases, provide real-time life-saving information. Many of the clinical uses of echocardiography are multidisciplinary in practice, and the overlap between the different utilities of echocardiogram is large. The addition of contrast to echocardiography, or the addition of strain to TTE are all examples of combinations of these utilities. The utilization of echocardiography is vast and can be applied in a variety of ways and a wide range of situations, and these forms will be discussed in detail.
