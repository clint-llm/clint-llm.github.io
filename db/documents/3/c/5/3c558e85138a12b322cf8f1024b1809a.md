In patients with a high degree of clinical suspicion, radiological imaging including transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS, highly sensitive and preferred) and/or abdominal and pelvic ultrasonography is done. It gives a fair idea about the size, location, and complexity of the ovarian mass. For defining tumor extension, further imaging with chest and abdomen pelvis CT scan, pelvic MRI, and/or PET scan can be done.

Measurement of CA-125 levels is usually done in adjunction with the imaging. CA-125 is elevated in most of the epithelial ovarian cancers overall, but only half of the early stage epithelial ovarian cancers.

The malignancy algorithm (ROMA) risk utilizes a mathematical formula that incorporates HE-4 and CA 125 levels adjusted for pre and post-menopausal status to determine the risk of malignancy.

Optimal staging with exploratory laparotomy and close evaluation of abdominal and pelvic region for disease, including inspection of peritoneal surfaces with biopsy and/or pelvic washings, is done. It establishes the stage using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging of ovarian cancer. It is followed by total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) with para-aortic and pelvic lymph node dissection and omentum. The tissue biopsies evaluated by a pathologist help provide the final diagnosis concerning the histological type, grade, and staging.
