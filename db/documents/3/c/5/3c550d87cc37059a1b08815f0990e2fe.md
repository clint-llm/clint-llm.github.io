The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging/UICC classification system is used for staging.

While the stage, size, necrosis score is used in localized RCC, the Memorial Sloane Kettering score or the Motzer score is the standard prognostication system used in advanced/metastatic cancer.

The new targeted therapies have led to the up-gradation of these criteria and the development of the international metastatic RCC database consortium criteria or the Heng score, which consists of the Karnofsky performance score (lower than 80 percent), hemoglobin (lower than normal lower limit), time from diagnosis to treatment (less than one year), corrected calcium (higher than 10 mg per dl), platelets and neutrophils (both higher than the normal upper limit).
