The thyrocervical trunk is near the medial aspect of the anterior scalene muscles in the supraclavicular triangle. The thyrocervical trunk ascends vertically on each side of the neck and yields four branches. The first branch is the inferior thyroid artery (ITA), which is also the largest branch of the thyrocervical trunk. The ITA traverses the vertebral artery anteriorly and the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein posteriorly to reach the posterior part of the thyroid gland. Inside the thyroid, the ITA anastomoses with the ipsilateral superior thyroid artery and the contralateral ITA. The second branch of the thyrocervical trunk is the ascending cervical artery (ACA). The ACA ascends towards the cervical vertebrae posterior to the internal jugular vein, with the phrenic nerve accompanying the ACA laterally. This artery supplies posterior structures, including parts of the spinal cord and its surrounding meninges, vertebral bodies, and prevertebral muscles. It shares anastomoses with the vertebral artery, the occipital artery, and the ascending pharyngeal artery. The third branch of the thyrocervical trunk is the suprascapular artery (SSA). This branch courses towards the shoulder along the clavicle posteriorly and supplies the rotator cuff muscles and posterior scapular muscles. The SSA is part of a rich anastomosis surrounding the scapula. This anastomosis is termed the scapular anastomosis and is comprised of several arteries along with the SSA: the transverse cervical artery, the dorsal scapular artery, branches of the subscapular artery, and branches of the thoracic aorta. The fourth and final branch of the thyrocervical trunk is the transverse cervical artery (TCA). The TCA ascends to the levator scapula accompanied by the accessory nerve and then divides to the superficial and deep branches of the TCA. The superficial branch of the TCA supplies the superficial posterior neck musculature, and the deep branch supplies the superficial muscles of the back.
