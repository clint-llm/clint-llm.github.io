Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Genetic, immunological, endocrine, and environmental factors influence the loss of immunological tolerance against self-antigens leading to the formation of pathogenic autoantibodies that cause tissue damage through multiple mechanisms. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of systemic lupus erythematosus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify when to consider systemic lupus erythematosus on the differential diagnosis.
- Describe the evaluation of systemic lupus erythematosus.
- Explain the treatment options for systemic lupus erythematosus.
- Review the importance of an interprofessional approach to enhance awareness, accurate diagnosis, and prompt treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
