Ophthalmia neonatorum is an acute eye inflammatory process that occurs in the neonatal period (first four weeks of life). When this condition is suspected, prompt isolation of the etiologic agent is warranted. If left untreated, gonococcal neonatal conjunctivitis can lead to severe complications, including corneal ulceration and perforation, resulting in permanent blindness. Early detection and initiation of treatment are crucial elements for a good outcome.

By following the above guidelines and steps, the clinician will decide if the diagnosis exists or is a possibility and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. It is prudent to include an infectious disease specialist and/or a pharmacist with infectious disease board certification for an additional consult. Neonatal specialized nursing staff will be tasked with medication administration and monitoring the progress of therapy for the infant, charting all observations, and reporting any concerns to the rest of the team.

An interprofessional team constituted by pediatricians, neonatologists, ophthalmologists, nurses, pharmacists, and infectious disease specialists, provides an integrated approach to neonatal conjunctivitis that, along with communication and shared decision making, can help achieve the best possible outcomes.Â [Level 5]
