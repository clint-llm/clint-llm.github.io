**History:**

The patient may give a history of previous episodes, corneal abrasion due to contact lens wear, or oral or nasal sores. They might be taking topical or systemic steroids. The patient might have a history of immune deficiency state, or even recent fever or sun/UV exposure.

**Presenting symptoms:**

- 
**Primary infection:**

It is commonly subclinical, and the only manifestation may be mild, self-limiting blepharoconjunctivitis, marked by inflammatory vesicles or ulcers and can include lesions in the corneal epithelium.

- 
**Recurrence:**

Dendritic/Geographical keratitis presents with pain, foreign-body sensation, light sensitivity, redness, and blurred vision.Disciform keratitis may experience similar symptoms. However, discomfort and redness tend to be milder than epithelial disease. They also complain of haloes around lights.

**Signs:**

Any or all of the following may characterize infection:

- 
**Corneal epithelial disease (dendritic/geographical keratitis):**

Signs in chronological order

- Swollen opaque epithelial cells arranged in a coarse punctate or stellate pattern

- Central desquamation results in linear branching (dendritic) ulcer

- The central part forms the ulcer bed while the ends of the ulcer have characteristic terminal buds.Â These are visible with special stains (fluorescein and rose bengal stains)

- The ulcer may progressively increase in size to give a 'geographical' or 'amoeboid' configuration

- Mild subepithelial scarring may develop after healing.

- Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)

- 
**Corneal stromal disease (disciform keratitis)**

- Occasionally eccentric lesion

- Central zone of stromal edema with overlying epithelial edema

- Keratic precipitates underlying the edema

- Folds in the Descemet membrane in severe cases.

- Subepithelial and/or stromal scarring may develop after healing

- Wessely immune ring

- Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP)

- 
**Neurotrophic ulceration**

A nonhealing epithelial defect, sometimes after prolonged topical treatment. May be associated with stromal melting and perforation.

- 
**Other signs**

Vesicles on eyelids/skin, conjunctivitis, uveitis and/or retinitis.
