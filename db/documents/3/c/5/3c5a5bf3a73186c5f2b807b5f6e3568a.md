Balint syndrome commonly results from ischemic infarctions in bilateral parietal and occipital areas.

There are also reports of Balint syndrome with other neurological disorders such as

- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

- Alzheimer disease

- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)

- Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)

- Corticobasal degeneration (CBD)

- Subacute HIV encephalitis

- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

- Head trauma

- Cerebral toxoplasmosis, and

- Brain metastasis

Two recent reports exist of cases of NMDA receptor encephalitis with a clinical presentation that was consistent with Balint syndrome.
