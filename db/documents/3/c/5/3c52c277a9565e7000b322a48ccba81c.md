Overall, the prognosis of esotropia is good. Well-planned management strategy, close follow-up, and compliance with treatment are the main factors on which prognosis depends. Though most concomitant esotropia can be managed conservatively, congenital esotropia requires surgical intervention. There are two different schools of thought for early versus late surgical intervention for congenital esotropia.

It is now considered that early ocular alignment before the age of 2 years results in better visual acuity and preservation of binocular fusion to some extent, often involving peripheral fusion. Studies have shown that better long-term stability, better stereopsis, and sensorimotor development have been associated with the early alignment of eyes. It is important to note that the reoperation rates in congenital esotropia have been reported as high as 50%.
