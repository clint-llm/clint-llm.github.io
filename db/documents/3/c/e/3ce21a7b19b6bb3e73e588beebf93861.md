The patient's clinical presentation with a meniscal tear is variable depending on the mechanism of injury and degree of concomitant tibiofemoral insults.  The sensation of a "pop," with immediate effusion of the knee during high-impact activity or trauma, is associated with an ACL tear with a possible associated medial meniscal tear. In contrast, effusion that develops more gradually over the course of 24 hours is more indicative of an isolated meniscal tear.  Symptoms can also be insidious in nature, in which low-grade effusion and stiffness develop over the course of several days despite the absence of an inciting event.  Pain is typically reported over the anteromedial or anterolateral joint line.  Depending on the type and extent of the meniscal lesion, there may also be symptoms of locking, clicking, catching, intermittent inability to fully extend the knee, or feeling of the knee giving way.

Physical examination should include inspection of the knee for edema, palpation of the joint line, standing and supine range of motion (ROM), muscle strength testing, and special testing.  Anteromedial and anterolateral joint line tenderness performed with the patient's knee at the edge of the table at 90 degrees of flexion is 83% sensitive and 83% specific for a meniscal tear.  There may be pain and deficits in either flexion or extension ROM depending on the type of tear and extent of effusion.  Deficits in open kinetic chain knee flexion/extension strength testing are unlikely. Still, antalgic gait or increased pain with single or double-leg squatting is possible due to increased compressive forces over the menisci.  There are several provocative special tests for the detection of meniscal tears.  The Thessaly test, in which the patient stands on one leg, squats down to 20 degrees of flexion, and internally/externally rotates the knee through active adduction/abduction of the hip, is 75% sensitive and 87% specific.  McMurray's test has a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 84%. It involves passively extending the supine patient's knee from a fully flexed position to 90 degrees flexion while maintaining full external or internal rotation. Apley's compression test, in which the prone patient's knee is passively flexed to 90 degrees and then externally/internally rotated with axial compressive force through the knee, is < 20% sensitive and up to 80% to 90% specific.
