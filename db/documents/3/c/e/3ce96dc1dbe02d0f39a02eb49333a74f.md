High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a severe form of high-altitude illness that, if left untreated, can lead to mortality in 50 percent of affected individuals. It occurs secondary to hypoxia, and is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. It is characterized by fatigue, dyspnea, and a dry cough with exertion. If left untreated, it can progress to dyspnea at rest, rales, and cyanosis. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of high altitude pulmonary edema and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with high altitude pulmonary edema.
- Explain potential complications of high altitude pulmonary edema.
- Review the treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema. 
- Outline modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients with high altitude pulmonary edema.
