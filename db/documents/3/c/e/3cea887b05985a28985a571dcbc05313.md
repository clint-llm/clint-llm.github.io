The etiology of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is complex. It can beÂ from motility, anatomic, immune, gastric hypochlorhydria and metalobic and other systemic disorders.

Important host defense mechanisms against bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine are gastric acid and bile, peristalsis, proteolytic digestive enzymes, intact ileocecal valve, and secretory IgA. When these protective barriers fail, SIBO occurs. Gastric acids and bile destroy and prevent bacteria from passing through the intestines after ingesting food. So SIBO is associated with achlorhydria.

An intact ileocecal valve and antegrade motility of the ileum prevent retrograde translocation of colonic bacteria.
