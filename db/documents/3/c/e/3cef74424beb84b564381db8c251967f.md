The primary differential diagnosis isÂ an arachnoid cyst. This is mainly differentiated in imaging studies from schizencephaly by the following features in the table below.

Other differentials include:

- Acquired cysts (post-traumatic, postoperative, post-hemorrhage, or postictal): These can be differentiated by areas of gliosis surrounding the lesions and based on medical history.

- Hydrocephalus

- Holoprosencephaly

- Focal cortical dysplasia may have a cleft on the cortex, not extending up to the ventricles.

- Grey matter heterotopia will be seen as a linear cleft, but periventricular grey matter generally bulges into the ventricle.

- Porencephaly extends from the cortex to ventricles but is lined by gliotic white matter; some authors would refer to schizencephaly as 'true porencephaly.'
