**Growth Hormone**

Dysfunction of the endocrine system control and release of growth hormone can result in several disorders. Hypersecretion of GH can cause acromegaly and gigantism, both of which are most commonly caused by a GH secreting adenoma of the pituitary gland.

Acromegaly

Acromegaly typically is caused by a GH secreting pituitary adenoma that occurs after the closure of the epiphyseal growth plate. It leads to characteristic facies, large extremities, frontal bossing, diaphoresis, and impaired glucose tolerance. An increased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level establishes the diagnosis. Surgical excision is the first line of treatment for acromegaly. However, further medical treatment with somatostatin analogs or radiation is necessary as complete recovery is rare.

Gigantism

Gigantism occurs when due to hypersecretion of growth hormone before the fusion of long bone epiphysis. It is characterized by tall stature and should be suspected when the patient's height is three standard deviations above normal mean height.

Growth Hormone Deficiency

The effect of GH deficiency depends on the age at which the deficiency occurs. Onset in childhood is associated with decreased growth of all skeletal structures, subsequently leading to dwarfism. Adult-onset deficiency is more difficult to diagnose as it does not have a single identifying pathognomic factor. It usually presents with increased fat mass in visceral tissues and decreased skeletal muscle, as well as decreased bone density and remodeling, leading to osteoporosis.

**Prolactin**

The pathology related to prolactin can be due to either prolactin excess or a deficiency of prolactin.

Prolactin deficiency, most commonly due to pituitary destruction, presents with failure to lactate.

Increased levels of prolactin can be physiological, pathological, or drug-induced. Physiological causes include pregnancy, exercise, sleep, stress, neonatal period, nipple stimulation and lactation, and sexual intercourse. Physiological hyperprolactinemia is transient and adaptive, and most patients may remain asymptomatic. Pharmacological and pathological hyperprolactinemia are symptomatic conditions (hypogonadism and galactorrhea) that have unwanted long-term consequences. Regardless of etiology, treatment options for prolactin excess include dopamine agonist medications such as bromocriptine and cabergoline.

**Follicle-stimulating hormone and Luteinizing Hormone**

Hyperfunctioning pituitary adenomas or unresponsive gonads can lead to increased FSH & LH. Decreased levels of FSH & LH can stem from pathology within either the hypothalamus or anterior pituitary.

**Adrenocorticotropic Hormone**

Pathophysiology of ACTH can stem from either dysfunction of the pituitary, the adrenal glands, or ectopic secretions from a pathogenic source.

Hypofunctioning or hyperfunctioning of the pituitary gland can lead to a decrease or increase of ACTH levels in the body, respectively. Common causes of decreased ACTH include pituitary insufficiency due to an adenoma compressing the pituitary gland, pituitary apoplexy, the sudden hemorrhage into the pituitary gland causing loss of ACTH, or Sheehan syndrome, a condition of pituitary infarction after blood loss during childhood.

**Thyroid-stimulating Hormone**

A TSH assay is the recommended screening test for thyroid disease. It is the test of choice in patients suspected of having a deficiency (hypothyroidism) or excess (hyperthyroidism) of thyroid hormones. Abnormal levels indicate the pathological functioning of the thyroid gland.

When TSH levels are below normal levels, the primary diagnosis is hyperthyroidism. Low levels of TSH present in patients on steroids, dopamine, and somatostatin analogs. Patients with thyroid cancer who receive treatment with thyroxine can also have decreased levels of TSH. Graves disease is another common pathology that presents with low TSH levels and is due to an autoimmune disorder, which stimulates the thyroid gland to make excess thyroid hormones. The increased thyroid hormones cause feedback inhibition of TSH secretion by the anterior pituitary gland.

**Vasopressin**

Central Diabetes Insipidus

Decreased levels of vasopressin can cause different pathological states. The most common form of pathology secondary to decreased ADH secretion from the pituitary gland is central diabetes insipidus. Low levels of ADH result in excess free water in the urine. There are no identifiable causes for the majority of the cases, and therefore, those cases are labeled as idiopathic central diabetes insipidus. Acquired forms of central diabetes insipidus include vascular and autoimmune diseases, craniopharyngioma, sarcoidosis, hypoxic brain injury, surgery, trauma, structural malformations, metastasis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or ischemia. Common presenting symptoms of patients include polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia but may also include less common findings of weakness, lethargy, fatigue, and myalgias.

Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH)

Excess ADH from an ectopic source or the posterior pituitary leads to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). The excess ADH causes increased water retention and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Common etiologies behind SIADH include malignancies, trauma, stroke, infection, medications, and/or anesthesia.

**Oxytocin**

Oxytocin insufficiency is not a common pathology but can occur rarely. Decreased levels of oxytocin slow down uterine contractions and reduce milk ejection during the birthing process. Panyypopituarism, a pathology in which both anterior and posterior hormone levels are below normal, can be the cause of oxytocin hyposecretion.

Excess oxytocin is also rarely seen and causes an overactive uterus causing hypertrophy, which further leads to difficulty in maintaining pregnancy due to insufficient space for holding the fetus.
