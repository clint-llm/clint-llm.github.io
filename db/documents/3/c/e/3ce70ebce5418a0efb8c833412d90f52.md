A thorough risk/benefit analysis and informed consent are necessary when evaluating a patient for peripheral nerve blockade. If block administration is in the emergency department, discussion with the anesthesiology can help direct preference toward a catheter if a longer block duration is preferable. Each patient’s maximum local anesthetic dose must be calculated before performing the block and never exceeded.
