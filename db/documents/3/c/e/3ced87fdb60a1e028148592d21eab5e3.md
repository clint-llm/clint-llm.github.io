The increasing number of older adults brings a growing number of late-age mentally ill. Conditions such as dementia, delirium, and old-age depression not only cause disability among their victims, they diminish the quality of life and impose an increased burden on the family and other care providers. Among the neuro-psychiatric conditions, dementia and major depression are the two major contributors to all disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in the geriatric age group. Therefore, global aging has profound implications for social, economic, and health policy. Depression is associated with many physical illnesses and affects their development and course. Therefore, awareness about the symptoms and signs of depression is necessary for patients and caregivers, which would help them to seek early treatment and management, and prevent putting their lives in jeopardy.
