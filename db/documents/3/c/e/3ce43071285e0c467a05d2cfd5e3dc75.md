Fistula-in-ano often occurs following anorectal abscess. An anorectal abscess occurs when an anal gland becomes obstructed, resulting in infection and abscess formation.  The infection is located near the sphincter complex, and therefore the fistula can traverse the sphincters. One-third of patients undergoing incision and drainage of an anorectal abscess will later develop a fistula.
