Epidemiology of right ventricular hypertrophy depends on the underlying cause. The epidemiology of PH varies among the 5 groups. Best studied is group 1 PAH; idiopathic and familial PAH, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 10 to 52 cases per million adults worldwide.

The exact prevalence of PH due to left heart failure is not well defined, in part because of variations in study design, PH definitions, and diagnostic modalities employed. Most echo-based series suggest that left heart disease causes 70% of PH.

Group 3 PH appears to be more prevalent in older adults. In one study of patients, 65 years and older with PH, group 3 PH occurred in 14%, while 28% had group 2 PH and 17% had mixed groupÂ two-thirds PH.

The true incidence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is unknown but estimated to be between 1% and 5% among survivors of acute pulmonary embolism.
