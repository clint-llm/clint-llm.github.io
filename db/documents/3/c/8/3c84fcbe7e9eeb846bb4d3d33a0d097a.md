Cytomegalovirus (CMV) endotheliitis is defined as corneal endothelium-specific inflammation triggered by CMV. The pathophysiology of this disease has yet to be fully elucidated. The diagnosis can be challenging since clinical signs resemble other conditions, such as endotheliitis caused by other viruses and corneal graft rejection in corneal transplant patients. This activity describes the presentation, evaluation, and management of CMV endotheliitis. It also highlights the importance of early detection and management by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cytomegalovirus endotheliitis.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with cytomegalovirus endotheliitis.
- Review the importance of early identification and proper treatment to prevent the ocular complications of cytomegalovirus endotheliitis.
- Outline the treatment modalities for cytomegalovirus endotheliitis by the interprofessional team.
