Postoperatively patients may experience local and systemic complications. Laboratory tests can help diagnose anemia, renal insufficiency, and other metabolic disturbances. Patients are evaluated for compartment syndrome, wound issues, and neurovascular compromise. Systemic complications include DVT, PE, and fat emboli syndrome. Shortly after surgery, patients will start physical and occupational therapy in the hospital to regain mobility and function in daily activities with continuation in the outpatient setting. Patients are typically allowed to bear weight as tolerated and return to full or near full capacity before radiographic healing, described as callus formation on three of the four sides of the bone on imaging. Patients are advised to restrain from smoking and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), although the evidence against NSAIDs is inconclusive.
