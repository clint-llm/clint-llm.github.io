Liddle syndrome: Liddle syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding ENaC subunits. Symptoms include a triad of early-onset hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Normal to low aldosterone activity and lack of response to spironolactone distinguish this syndrome from hyperaldosteronism. The clinician can achieve a definitive diagnosis through genetic testing. Treatment primarily involves maintaining a low sodium diet and the use of potassium-sparing diuretics called ENaC blockers (elaborated on in the Clinical Significance section).

Carbonic anhydrase II deficiency: In the collecting ducts, carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) mediates the formation of carbonic acid from water and carbon dioxide. Carbonic acid then dissociates into a hydrogen ion and bicarbonate, which are handled differently by type A and type B intercalated cells (as described in the Structure and Function section). CAII deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that manifests clinically as osteopetrosis, cerebral calcification, and renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The renal tubular acidosis that manifests may be proximal (type II), distal (type I), or combined (type III). No specific treatment (aside from symptomatic) for CAII deficiency currently exists.
