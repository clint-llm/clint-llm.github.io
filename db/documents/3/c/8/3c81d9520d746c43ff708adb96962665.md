Chorioamnionitis occurs in about 4% of deliveries at term but occurs more frequently in preterm deliveries and premature rupture of membranes. In evaluating women with symptoms of chorioamnionitis, studies show a strong correlation between histologic chorioamnionitis and the key clinical symptoms of fever, uterine tenderness, meconium aspiration syndrome, and foul-smelling vaginal discharge.

In deliveries between 21 and 24 weeks gestation, histological chorioamnionitis can be found in more than 94% of cases.
