Oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and calcium influx play an important role in the pathogenesis of iron-induced retinal toxicity.

“Direct siderosis’’ primarily occurs due to the hydroxyl radical formation following Fenton’s reaction (Fe + HO → Fe + HO• + OH).

“Indirect siderosis” is due to tissue destruction occurring at sites distal to the IOFB. It involves the retinal vasculature causing toxic microvasculopathy, also termed as the ‘‘vascular siderosis’’. This happens due to the affinity of iron for acid mucopolysaccharides that can result in subsequent degeneration of inner retinal layers, supplied by capillaries of the central retinal artery. Additionally, damage to RPE cells can occur indirectly by the migration of iron ions via vitreous to aqueous through the trabecular meshwork into the suprachoroidal space. Ultimately, from here, the ions diffuse across the choroid and Bruch’s membrane to reach RPE.
