Complications of euthyroid sick syndrome are mostly associated with the underlying cause of the problem and not related to the malfunction of the thyroid gland per se. After the initial medical problem that caused the euthyroid sick syndrome presentation is treated, the expectation is for the thyroid tests to become normal again without any remnant thyroid function issues. If the patient has a known thyroid problem, every effort must be placed into clarifying the current status of the thyroid function based on symptomatology and physical examination findings so that it can be treated accordingly.
