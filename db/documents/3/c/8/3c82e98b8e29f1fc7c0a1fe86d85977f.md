Due to the diffuse presence of cholinergic receptors, dysfunction can yield various outcomes. Muscarinic receptors mediate autonomic function in all major organ systems; however, receptors are also present throughout the central nervous system. Abnormal muscarinic receptor function has shown correlations in diseases such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Furthermore, research shows both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors play a role in the dopamine reward system pathway.

At the neuromuscular junction, nicotinic receptors function in signal transduction of voluntary movement. In myasthenia gravis, competitive receptor inhibition secondary to autoimmune dysfunction can lead to the life-threatening loss of function at the neuromuscular junction. This life-sustaining function works to the clinicians’ advantage during surgical cases where a patient requires paralysis with pharmacologic interference at the neuromuscular junction. However, great care must be taken in patients with disorders such as lower or upper motor neuron denervation, major trauma, severe infection, or burn injuries, as these may result in the upregulation of nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which contributes to an overabundance of receptors.
