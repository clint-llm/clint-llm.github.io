Keep the following pearls in mind:

- Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a rare pathology that occurs more commonly in premature and underweight infants.

- PIE is commonly caused by mechanical ventilation and is associated with respiratory distress syndrome.

- Clinically, PIE can progress rapidly with an increase in oxygen requirements and hemodynamically instability; however, it is diagnosed through imaging and histopathology.

- PIE is usually treated with early administration of surfactant and with the optimal mechanical ventilator setting: high-frequency oscillation ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure, low inspiratory pressure. The goal is to allow proper expiration as the lungs are over distended.

- Conservative measures include lateral decubitus positioning and CPAP if a mechanical ventilator can be avoided.

- Complications can include pulmonary air embolisms and air leaks.
