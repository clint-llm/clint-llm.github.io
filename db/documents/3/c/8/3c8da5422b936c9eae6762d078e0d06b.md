Drug-induced pemphigus is likely both a biochemical and immunologic process. The chemical structure of certain inciting agents has been found to contribute to the cell-to-cell dyshesion. Intracellular antibodies have also been demonstrated in drug-induced pemphigus.

Thiol drugs, the most common pemphigus-inducing agents, have been shown to promote acantholysis by chemically interfering with the keratinocyte membrane. The binding of drugs with the thiol group can cause a disulfide bond to form, making the cell-to-cell adhesion not possible, resulting in acantholysis. Other proposed mechanisms for biochemical acantholysis include activation of proteolytic enzymes and the production of plasmin. Both penicillamine and captopril have been shown to impair the activation of plasminogen activator inhibitors.

Medications also induce pemphigus through immunologic acantholysis via the formation of IgG autoantibody production against desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3. Desmoglein is the major glycoprotein component of cadherinsÂ that help make up the structural elements of desmosomes. Desmosomes help attach adjacent keratinocytes.
