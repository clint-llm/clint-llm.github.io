Several factors influence the results of pretransfusion testing giving rise to false positive or negative results.

Some of the causes leading to false results are mentioned below;

**False Positive Result**

- Rouleaux formation

- Passively transferred antibodies due to transfusion of platelets or administration of IVIG

- Antibodies to the preservatives present in the reagents used

**False Negative Result**

- Technical error

- The antibodies showing dosage effect may not react if the donor cells have a heterozygous expression of a particular antigen

- Loss of potency of the reagents used

- Failure to add reagents

- Equipment failure

Massive transfusion replaces a portion of the patient's blood volume with donor blood. A Â patient sample after transfusion may not accurately reflect blood type or alloantibodies, depending on the ABO type of the RBCs and plasma selected for emergency resuscitation. Hence it is imperative to continue the blood products based on the samples collected before the transfusion.
