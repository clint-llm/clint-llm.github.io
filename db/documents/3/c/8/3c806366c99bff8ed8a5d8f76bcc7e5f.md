The reason the name " bronchioloalveolar carcinoma" was destined to die was that it clubbed two very unrelated forms of adenocarcinoma in histology, immunophenotype, and invasive nature. It also became important to recognize minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, which portends a similar prognostic significance as AIS or reclassify adenocarcinoma purely from the prognostic viewpoint.

Since the introduction of the newer classification, there have been several articles with caution and counterarguments. The purpose of those is not to be ignored as they convey a valued message that identification of adenocarcinoma as one with lepidic growth does not label them as one with potential curability or 100% disease-free survival until a surgical staging has been achieved with an adequate evaluation of the specimen in its entirety along with the evaluation of pleura and lymph nodes. Finally, it has opened upÂ scope for early planning of definitive therapy with sometimes less limited resection and preservation of lung function with equally optimistic outcomes.
