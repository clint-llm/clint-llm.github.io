History of severe gastroenteritis followed hypotension with occupational or environmental hazard risk should raise clinicians index of suspicion.  Additionally, symptoms of recurrent gastroenteritis, peripheral neuropathy or hyperpigmentation may indicate chronic exposure.

**In acute known or suspected toxicity treatment should be started prior to laboratory confirmation.**

Tests to order:

The best indicator of arsenic exposure is an elevated arsenic level in a 24-hour urine collection. In emergencies, spot urine testing is an option.

Arsenic exposure is confirmed at a level of 50 micrograms/L or over 100 micrograms of total arsenic. In acute exposure, 24-hour urinary arsenic levels typically exceed several thousand micrograms. Spot urine levels typically exceed 1000 micrograms/L. Without treatment patients usually do not return to baseline levels or arsenic for several weeks.

Samples should be collected in a metal-free polyethylene container.

It is recommended to repeat 24-hour urinary arsenic level during and after treatment until arsenic levels are below 50 micrograms/L.

If non-emergent it is advised to avoid all seafood ingestion for five days prior to the 24-hour urine collection, as it has been shown to increase urinary arsenic excretion. Seafood is a known source of organic arsenic and in the levels of consumption generally is considered non-toxic. Chronic exposure levels typically range between 0.1 to 0.5mg/kg and acute toxicity has a range of 1 to 3mg/kg.

- Abdominal radiograph: may demonstrate intestinal radiopaque metallic flecks in arsenic ingestion.

- CBC: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and relative eosinophilia may present, reticulocyte count may become elevated secondary to hemolytic anemia.

- CMP: May show elevated creatinine, elevated aminotransferase, bilirubin.

- UA: May show proteinuria, pyuria, and hematuria.

- Haptoglobin level: maybe decreased secondary to hemolytic anemia.

- Peripheral smear: can show basophilic stippling.

- Type and screen: tests for possible transfusion in arsine gas exposure.

- EKG: May demonstrate nonspecific ST-segment changes, ST depression, T wave flattening, prolonged QT and QTC intervals. Arrhythmias including torsades de pointe have been reported.

- Nerve conduction studies may be warranted if peripheral neurologic symptoms are present.

Hair and nail clipping should be harvested for laboratory analysis in indeterminate chronic exposure. 200mg hair samples should be from as close to the scalp as possible, in the posterior vertex of the skull.
