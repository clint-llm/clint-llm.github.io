Patients should be referred to a health care facility for evaluation and monitoring if phosgene exposures exceed 50 ppm/ min, inhaled concentration is unknown, there is liquid phosgene exposure to the face or oropharynx, or there are respiratory symptoms. Vital signs, serial examinations, and laboratory and imaging studies are used to monitor the progression of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by phosgene ALI.Â A complete blood count, chemistries, troponin, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are also necessary.

Though not specific, case studies have reported leukocytosis, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia in patients exhibiting phosgene toxicity. Serum troponin and BNP may be used when the diagnosis is unclear and will likely be normal. Arterial blood gas measurements and chest radiographs should be trended if there are indications of pulmonary involvement. Characteristic findings may include fluffy bilateral opacities and hilar congestion. ECG often reveals sinus tachycardia, although the fulminant disease may reveal signs of right heart strain.
