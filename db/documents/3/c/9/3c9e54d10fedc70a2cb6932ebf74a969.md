Making a diagnosis of an epithelial defect is not difficult; however, identifying it as a persistent epithelial defect is more important for early intervention and prevention of destructive sequelae. An epithelial defect heals entirely in 7 to 10 days, whereas a persistent epithelial defect will not heal in even two weeks. The focus should be on identifying the underlying etiology to provide targeted treatment.
