The treatment of ATTS is based on the underlying etiology. Treatment should begin with a trial of non-operative methodsÂ such as:

- Changes to footwear and shoe-lacing technique modification

- Biomechanical modifications such as over-the-counter orthotics, custom orthotics, or padding

- Topical anti-inflammatory or compound creams

- Oral or topical NSAIDs or neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentin

- Perineural corticosteroid/anesthetic injection at the site of nerve entrapment

- Compression socks to alleviate local edema or varicosities

- A period of decreased athletic activity or immobilization via CAM boot

Surgical options should only be presented after failing a period of non-operative treatment. Surgery is based on the underlying etiology and may include:

- Release or decompression of the extensor retinaculum and any surrounding scar tissue

- Excision of space-occupying lesions (ganglion, varicose veins)

- Resection of osteophytes (bone spurs)

- Neurolysis, nerve wrapping, resection of neuroma or neurectomy of the DPN

Surgery is most commonly performed via an open approach; however, minimally invasive endoscopic approaches are also viable options.

In each surgical case, the retinaculum must be identified, and the posterior tibial nerve visualized. One should avoid injuring branches of the nerve and carefully release the fibrous bands.
