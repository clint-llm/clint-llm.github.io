- Off-label drug for Marfan syndrome

- Treatment of heart failureÂ (off-label use): A study involving elderly heart-failure patients, Evaluation of Losartan in the Elderly Study (ELITE), concluded that compared to captopril, losartan correlated with lower mortality and was tolerated better than captopril.
