Apraxia of eyelid opening, as a feature of blepharospasm, carries a complex differential diagnosis that is most consistent with late-onset dystonia phenomenon, affecting patients older than 50 years of age. Several disorders will present like apraxia of eyelid opening and must be excluded to treat them appropriately.

- Idiopathic

- Benign essential blepharospasm with or without sensory features including eye-burning pain, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, sensory trick, and photophobia
- Meige's syndrome: a triad of blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, and cervical dystonia
- Brueghel's syndrome: blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, +/- torticollis,  +/- dystonic writer's cramp, appendicular dystonic posturing of the arms, dystonic respiration, and spasmodic torticollis

- Iatrogenic

- Drug-induced: associated with tardive dyskinesias with use of mood stabilizers (antidepressants, antipsychotics, antiepileptics), antimicrobials, and antiarrhythmics
- Levodopa and apomorphine in progressive supranuclear palsy
- Deep brain stimulation on the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus for Parkinson's disease patients

- Genetic

- Primary blepharospasm and dystonias: they can be accompanied by cervical dystonia. Torsin family 1 member A polymorphism with mutation on dystonia 1 protein,

- Structural

- Vascular or traumatic injury of the midbrain, basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and motor cortex
- Hemifacial spasm: spasmodic unilateral facial contractions including eyelid blepharospasm due to facial nerve irritation

- Neuroinflammatory

- Bell's palsy: unilateral facial hemiparesis, constitutional symptoms (fever, chills), headaches, neck rigidity, retro auricular or jaw pain, hypersalivation, hyper acoustic phonophobia, dysgeusia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca
- Myasthenia gravis: oculomotor fatigue

- Neurodegenerative

- Parkinson's disease[26][27] 
- Focal, segmental or generalized dystonia: uncontrolled hyperkinetic movements, including blepharospasm
