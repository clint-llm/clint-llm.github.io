According to the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International 9 (NANDA-I), the nursing diagnosis of risk for unstable blood glucose level poses many additional risks and additional nursing diagnoses for the patient.

Making correct nursing diagnoses is strongly dependent upon knowledge of the patient's past medical and social history, physical assessment and pertinent laboratory data. The accuracy of the information gathered is also a determining factor. In the case of unstable blood glucose, it is important to know whether the patient has a medical diagnosis of type I or type II diabetes, any current pharmacologic therapy, history of unstable blood glucose or hypoglycemia, adherence to a special diet or medications, current or recent illnesses that could affect the glucose, and social history. Physical activity and other social history include alcohol intake (which could affect gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and drug use (which could inhibit the patient's desire to eat in addition to causing negative physiologic effects). A correct nursing diagnosis is vital to achieving the outcome of a stable blood glucose level, in addition to avoiding negative outcomes, such as organ damage, coma, and death. Frequent monitoring of the patient's glucose level is vital during an episode of unstable or low blood glucose.
