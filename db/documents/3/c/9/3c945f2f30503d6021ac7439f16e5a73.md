Evaluation of cutaneous endometriosis begins with clinical suspicion, which aids in diagnosis. However, the confirmation of the diagnosis can be done by biopsy of the lesion, followed by histopathological examination. History of any surgical procedures done prior is particularly helpful in classifying the disease into primary or secondary lesions.

The use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis of scar endometriosis is controversial as this may cause the seeding of the endometriotic tissue in new areas, further aggravating the condition.

Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be done and are helpful if there is suspicion of cutaneous metastases of a tumor, as in a gastrointestinal malignancy presenting as Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule, which is a differential diagnosis of umbilical endometrioma.

Some patients may undergo a secondary evaluation with biopsy whereby patients were treated with intralesional corticosteroids with no response, initially thinking that the cutaneous lesion was a keloid.

Patients diagnosed with cutaneous endometriosis may need a gynecological workup to evaluate for pelvic endometriosis, as studies in patients with endometriosis in gynecological scars have found that 14% of the total patients have associated pelvic endometriosis.
