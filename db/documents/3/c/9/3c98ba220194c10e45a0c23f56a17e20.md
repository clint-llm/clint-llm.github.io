Predictors for poor prognosis in pneumatosis intestinalis include:

- pH < 7.3

- Presence of portal venous gas

- Lactate level > 2 mmol/L

- Amylase level > 200 U/L

- Bicarbonate level < 20 ml/L

Surgical intervention is considered if patients, especially over 60 years of age, present with any obstructive symptoms, signs of sepsis and shock, or radiographic evidence of portal venous gas due to the high mortality associated. As per Greenstein et al. in 2007, the presence of emesis, leukocytosis (> 12 c/mm3), and age 60 and older are poor prognostic factors leading to surgical management. Furthermore, lactic acidosis, shock, and sepsis are also associated with unfavorable outcomes, including death.
