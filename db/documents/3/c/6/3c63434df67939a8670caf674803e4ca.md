Vitamin D intoxication is extremely rare. Vitamin D intoxication from sun exposure does not occur as the skin destroys excess vitamin D. The only way a person may get vitamin D toxicity is by ingestion of extremely high doses of vitamin D for a prolonged period. Concentrations over 150 ng/mL (325 nmoL/L) may result in vitamin D intoxication and are associated with hypercalcemia. Some symptoms associated with vitamin D toxicity and hypercalcemia include constipation, polydipsia, polyuria, and confusion.
