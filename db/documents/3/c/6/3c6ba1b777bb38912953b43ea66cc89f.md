Delayed puberty not infrequently occurs in the pediatric population and a common reason for referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. While it is usually a benign diagnosis, more serious causes should be considered and ruled out when warranted by clinical suspicion. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pubertal delay and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care to patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of delayed puberty.
- Recall the history, physical, and evaluation of delayed puberty.
- List the treatment and management options available for delayed puberty.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by delayed puberty.
