The vitreous is composed of 99% water and a few type II and type IX collagen fibers with many mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid holding water within the vitreous. The vitreous is attached to the peripheral retina and pars plana. Additionally, it is attached to the macula, optic nerve, and vessels. The strongest attachment is at the vitreous base, while the weakest attachment is along the retinal vessels. Thus, detachments and floaters are most common along the vessels and can lead to vitreous hemorrhage that coincides with the vitreous floater. Vitreoretinal junctions arise from the footplates of Mullerâ€™s cell at the internal limiting membrane.
