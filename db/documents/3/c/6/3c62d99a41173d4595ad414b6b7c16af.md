Evaluation is dependent on the suspected cause. Basic lab work including complete blood count (CBC) with differential, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free t4, cortisol levels can be ordered. If a patient is in shock STAT echocardiogram with inferior vena cava (IVC) variability can be done along with stabilizing measures. An echocardiogram will determine left ventricle ejection fraction, right ventricle pressures, and presence or absence of pericardial effusion. If left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and right ventricular function are adequate and the patient is in distributive shock, then the inferior vena cava (IVC) variability test will help in managing fluid resuscitation. Pulse pressure variation is used to determine the best fluid resuscitation plan. Saddle embolus pulmonary embolisms are a possible source of frank hypotension as well and can be ruled out via computed tomography (CT) angiogram of the chest.
