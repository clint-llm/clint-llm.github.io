Hydroquinone acts as a skin depigmentation agent by inhibiting melanin synthesis. It inhibits the conversion of L-3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) to melanin by inhibiting tyrosinase due to its structural similarity to an analog of melanin precursors.

**The Pathway of Melanin Synthesis**

- Hydroxylation of L-phenylalanine to L-tyrosine

- Tyrosinase hydroxylates L-tyrosine to 3,4 L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)

- L-DOPA oxidized to dopaquinone

- Production of eumelanin and pheomelanin resulting in black to brown and yellow to red color of skin
