If untreated, the fatality rate of postpartum endometritis is approximately 17%.

Acute endometritis alone has an excellent prognosis, however, it is frequently present with salpingitis which significantly increases the risk for tubal factor infertility.

Evidence suggests that after treatment for chronic endometritis, fertility outcomes can improve significantly. For example, in a study looking at fresh day 3 embryo transfer cycles, live birth rates were significantly higher in treated versus untreated patients (approximately 60-65% vs 6-15%).
