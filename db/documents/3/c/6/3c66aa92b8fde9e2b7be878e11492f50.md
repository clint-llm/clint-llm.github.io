The most common complications of gastrointestinal stromal tumors relate to gastrointestinal bleeding or the mass effect of the tumors. These tumors may present with acute gastrointestinal bleeding in the form of melena or hematemesis, or with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia. These tumors can also lead to intestinal obstruction, intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and rupture with peritonitis.
