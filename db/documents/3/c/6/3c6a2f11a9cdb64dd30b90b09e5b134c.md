Optimizing patient care for chronic lymphocytic leukemia requires interprofessional communication between clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPS, and PAs) of different specialties, including primary care clinicians, hematology, and oncology. Care coordination among nursing staff, home health care support teams, pharmacists, case management, and social workers is crucial.

Oncology specialized pharmacists can make critical contributions, coordinating their input with the clinicians ordering drugs, verifying appropriate dosing, performing medication reconciliation, and providing counsel to patients and nurses. Other considerations that could enhance patient-centered care include support from hospice care teams, psychiatry, therapists, or mental health professionals.

All interprofessional team members must maintain accurate and up-to-date records of every interaction or intervention with the patient, including any status changes. This will permit every team member to have the latest accurate patient case data. Any concerns must be immediately communicated to other team members to implement coordinated interventions if necessary. This interprofessional approach will yield the best possible outcomes for CLL patients. [Level 5]

Participation in clinical trials should be encouraged whenever available and feasible. Continued medical education on the latest developments, clinical trial options, and ongoing research are encouraged, given the rapidly changing nature of the field of the disease.
