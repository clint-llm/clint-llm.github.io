The sphenopalatine ganglion block is used for a variety of headache and facial pain syndromes and has variable efficacy depending on the disease process treated. Significant reduction in pain is meaningful when followed by an increase in functional capacity, reduction in health care use, and/or reduction in opioid use. If the SPGB works for a short duration of time, it can be followed by radiofrequency neurotomy or SPG stimulation to increase the duration of pain relief. Therefore, it can serve as a diagnostic block and is commonly used for this purpose.
