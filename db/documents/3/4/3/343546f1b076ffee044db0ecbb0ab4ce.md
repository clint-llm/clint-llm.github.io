There are 2 systems involved in normal REM sleep; one generates muscle atonia and the other suppresses motor-skeletal activity. Muscle atonia involves active inhibition by neurons in the medulla. Locomotion involves input from the forebrain, and the thalamus influences spinal motor neurons. Several brainstem pontine regions have been implicated in RBD pathophysiology including the peri-locus coeruleus region, pedunculo-pontine nucleus (PPN), and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTN).
