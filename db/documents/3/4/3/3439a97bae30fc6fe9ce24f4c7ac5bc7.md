An amputation not only reduces mobility but can cause significant impairment in quality of life. There is increased energy expenditure with higher levels of amputation.

Technological advancements in materials and ways to optimize the coupling between the residual limb and socket drive prosthetic development. Gel liners are used to protect the skin while allowing for the suction suspension of the prosthetic. An active suction device can also be implemented in the form of a mechanical pump that activates during ambulation. Improper fit leading to discomfort is the most common reason for rejection of prosthetic devices. However, patients may also be very self-conscious of the appearance of their residual limb, which may disincentivize its use. Therefore, a silicone cover or sleeve which mirrors the contralateral limb (including tattoos and hair) can be applied.
