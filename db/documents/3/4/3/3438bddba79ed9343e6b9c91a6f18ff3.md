Each medication administration route has unique characteristics that need to be considered by the interprofessional healthcare team when caring for patients. Specific techniques, such as central venous catheter placement and PICC lines, require more advanced skills and training, and it is essential to communicate and plan how the process will proceed. The healthcare team members involved in patient care should also be aware of and actively monitor for potential immediate and delayed medication administration complications. Informing patients about the process and involving them in decision-making whenever appropriate can improve the overall healthcare outcome. For instance, in the rectal or vaginal route, patients may prefer to self-administer the drugs. Healthcare personnel should be aware of potential personal or cultural barriers to these medication routes.

Documenting the route of administration is crucial for accurate patient record-keeping, as it communicates to all care team members how the patient is getting their drug therapy, which may affect many pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, including dosing, half-life, and other factors. The interprofessional approach to patient care is crucial to optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
