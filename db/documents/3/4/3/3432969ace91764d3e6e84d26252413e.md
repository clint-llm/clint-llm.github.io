Cosmetic botulinum toxin injections may be performed to reduce dynamic facial rhytids/wrinkles, correct facial asymmetry, and accentuate or correct gender-specific anatomic relationships. However, they are not effective in treating static rhytids or deep rhytids caused by photoaging. Botulinum toxin injections are also FDA-approved for non-cosmetic applications, such as treating migraines, blepharospasm, urinary incontinence, upper limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, severe axillary hyperhidrosis, and strabismus.

Facial asymmetry can occur when patients have a unilateral facial nerve injury (traumatic or iatrogenic), facial dystonia, or Bell's palsy. In cases of hemiparesis, botulinum toxin injection on the contralateral side can help improve symmetry. For example, injury to the frontal branch of the facial nerve can cause unequal eyebrow position and unequal wrinkling with contralateral brow elevation. Contralateral injection to the frontalis muscle is effective in reducing such asymmetry.
