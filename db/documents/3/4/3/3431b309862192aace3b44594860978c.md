The interplay between genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Psoriasis is primarily a disorder of T cells, namely CD*+ T cells in the epidermis and a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the dermis. ;

The most important gene implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is the PSORS1 gene on chromosome 6p, containing the HLA-Cw6 allele.Â  The HLA-Cw6 allele is strongly linked to both early onset plaque psoriasis and guttate psoriasis. HLA B-13 and HLA B-17 are also strongly associated with guttate psoriasis (and erythrodermic) psoriasis.
