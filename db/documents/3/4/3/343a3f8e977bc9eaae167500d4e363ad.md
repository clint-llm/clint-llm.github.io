The development of the hand occurs between 6-14 weeks of gestation and is separated into three phases. The first stage occurs between 6-10 weeks. During this phase, the initial shape of the hand can be appreciated. The second phase occurs between 10-13 weeks and is characterized by the appearance of creases in the hand. Finally during the last phase which begins at 13 weeks, the hand ridges are created.
