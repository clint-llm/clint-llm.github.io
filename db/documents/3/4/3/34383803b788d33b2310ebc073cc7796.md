When the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, internist, or pharmacist encounters a patient taking LSD, referral to a drug rehab facility is the recommended course of action. LSD has no medical benefits and is associated with several unpleasant psychiatric effects. In general, people who take LSD also take several other illicit drugs, and hence a urine screen is recommended. Unfortunately, LSD addiction is strong, and despite all therapies, success rates of treatments are low. In any case, the primary care providers should encourage the patient to cease taking LSD and/or avoid sharing needles and seek psychological assistance and treatment.
