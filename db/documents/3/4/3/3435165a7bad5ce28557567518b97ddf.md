In developed regions, with proper management, the prognosis is very good. However, data reveal an increase in diarrhea-related mortality among US children between the mid-1980s and 2006. Between 2005 and 2007, 1087 diarrhea-related infant deaths were recorded with 86% of deaths occurring in low birthweight (less than 2500 g) infants. Risk factors for these included male gender, black ethnicity, and low Apgar score (less than 7).

Dehydration and secondary malnutrition become the common causes of death. Parenteral fluids should be given for severe dehydration. Once malnutrition ensues, the prognosis becomes grave unless parenteral nutrition is started in a hospital setting.
