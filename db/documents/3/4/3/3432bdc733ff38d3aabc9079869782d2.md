Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic compound of vitamin B12 used mainly to treat vitamin deficiencies.

**FDA Approved Indications**

- Pernicious anemia: this condition is an autoimmune disorder against gastric parietal cells. These cells are responsible for the production of the intrinsic factor - as the parietal cells are destroyed, there is no intrinsic factor to which dietary B12 can bind; this leads to a deficiency of vitamin B12

- Malabsorption: Impairment of B12 absorption

- Atrophic gastritis: Impairment of intrinsic factor production, causing impaired vitamin B12 absorption

- Long-term metformin use

- Chronic acid-reducing medication use

- Small bowel bacteria overgrowth: competition for vitamin B12 leads to vitamin deficiency

- Total or partial gastrectomy: eliminates site of intrinsic factor production

- Diphyllobothrium latum infection: parasite utilizes luminal B12

- Helicobacter pylori infection

- Pancreatic insufficiency: causes failure to inactivate cobalamin-binding proteins

- Malignancy of pancreas or bowel

- Dietary deficiency of vitamin B12: eating strictly vegan foods without animal origin can lead to such deficiency

- Transcobalamin II deficiency: causes impairment in transmembrane transport of B12

**Non-FDA Approved Indications**

- Smoke inhalation

- Cyanide poisoning

- Surgery-associated vasoplegia

- Vasodilatory shock

- Folic acid deficiency

- A potentially reversible cause of cognitive impairment and dementia. However, more research is required.

- Nitrous oxide myelopathy
