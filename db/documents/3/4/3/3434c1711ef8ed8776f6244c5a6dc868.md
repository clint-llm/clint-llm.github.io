Diagnostic tests and imaging for a CCF depend on the symptoms and whether the patient presents to the emergency room or the clinic.

- Tonometry and pneumotonometry may show an increased ocular pulse amplitude in the side of the carotid-cavernous fistula compared to the fellow eye.

- A B-scan ultrasound or color Doppler will show a dilated superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) or orbital congestion.

- Patients suspected of having a CCF eventually undergo noninvasive imaging such as a standard CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan which can show a dilated SOV, orbital congestion, or enlargement of the extraocular muscles.

- A CTA (computed tomography angiography) or MRA (magnetic resonance angiography) may also be utilized as both imaging modalities are sensitive in detecting CCFs resulting in visual symptoms.

- A cerebral angiogram is the gold standard test for diagnosing a CCF, which can show filling of the cavernous sinus through the fistula, drainage pattern of the fistula, and presence of reflux into cortical veins following an injection of CCA (common carotid artery), ECA, or ICA.
