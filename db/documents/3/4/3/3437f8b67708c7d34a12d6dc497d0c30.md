Nevus anemicus typically presents as an isolated lesion with no other systemic manifestations. It is unclear if isolated nevus anemicus lesions have a genetic component. Nevus anemicus may be associated with various genetic syndromes, which include: neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), tuberous sclerosis, and phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) type II to IV. All phakomatosis pigmentovascularis types are characterized by the presence of nevus flammeus (port wine stain). In additional, phakomatosis pigmentovascularis type II has Mongolian spots (congenital dermal melanocytosis), phakomatosis pigmentovascularis type III has nevus spilus, and pigmentovascularis type IV has nevus spilus and Mongolian spots. When present in neurofibromatosis type 1, nevus anemicus tends to affect younger neurofibromatosis type-1  patients compared to neurofibromatosis type-1  patients who do not have nevus anemicus (mean age ten years versus 17 years, respectively). It should be noted that the presence of nevus anemicus in neurofibromatosis type-1 patients does not increase the risk of other neurofibromatosis type-1 manifestations such as optic gliomas. Nevus anemicus is not present in Legius syndrome, which mimics neurofibromatosis type 1 by the presence of cafe au lait macules and intertriginous freckling. Other rarely reported associations with nevus anemicus include telangiectatic nevus (with abnormal vasodilation) and Becker nevus.
