APL is a medical emergency best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an internist, intensivist, oncologist and a hematologist as well as a specialty-trained oncology nurse, dietician, and oncologic pharmacist. These patients need close monitoring by the oncology nurses as they are prone to bleeding diathesis, infections, multiorgan failure, and death. The nurse should immediately report any untoward findings to the clinical team. Due to the complexity of pharmacologic therapy, the oncology pharmacist should reconcile drugs and check for interactivity. Should there be concernings, they should address this with the attending clinician. The patient should be seen by a dietitian as a neutropenic diet is necessary. Further, the nurses should ensure that the patient's room is free of flowers and that visitors do not bring in any fruits. Clinicians should monitor the platelet count and observe for spontaneous bleeding. Prior to intrathecal therapy, the pharmacist should double-check the dose and duration of the drugs.

The outlook for patients with APL is guarded but improved with the help of an interprofessional team managing the patient.
