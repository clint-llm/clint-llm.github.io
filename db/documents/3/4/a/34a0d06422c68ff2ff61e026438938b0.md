**Lomitapide could elevate transaminases**. In a clinical trial, 34% of patients showed an elevation in ALT or AST about three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or even more. There were no significant clinically relevant elevations in alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, or the international normalized ratio (INR).

**Lomitapide can elevate liver fats.**This can occur with or without related transaminases elevations. Following 26 and 78 weeks of therapy, the median absolute rise in liver fats, from a baseline of 1%, was 6% assessed through magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Lomitapide therapy-associated liver steatosis could be a risk factor for advanced liver disease, involving both steatohepatitis or cirrhosis.

Before starting therapy, assess AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin and routinely AST and ALT as required afterward. During treatment, modify lomitapide dosage if the AST orÂ  ALT is three times the ULN or more. Stop lomitapide in case of clinically meaningful hepatic toxicity.

For the risk of liver toxicity, lomitapide is prescribed only via a controlled program below policy for assessing and mitigating risk. Prescribe lomitapide only to patients who are confirmed either clinically or by laboratory results to have HoFH. Lomitapide efficacy and safety remain unconfirmed in patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia other than HoFH.
