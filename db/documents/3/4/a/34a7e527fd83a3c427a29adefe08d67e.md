Genetics, ultraviolet radiation, trauma, infection, immunosuppression (including posttransplant) are causes of porokeratosis. There is a form of disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis that is familial. Familial DSAP has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance. Mutations in the mevalonate kinase gene (MVK) on chromosome 12q24 were seen in patients with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. MVK gene codes for mevalonate kinase, an enzyme that is part of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, that offers protection against ultraviolet light-induced cell death. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis has a high incidence and is the most common form of porokeratosis. The possibility for malignant transformation is due to overexpression of p53 and is seen more commonly in lesions that have been present for a long time, larger lesions, lesions in the elderly, or lesions in patients that are immunocompromised.
