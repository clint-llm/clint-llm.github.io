Simulation implementation for healthcare education has been growing exponentially in recent years. Medicine has learned simulation from professions with a larger experience such as aviation, space exploration, and military. The growing focus on patient safety can explain the increasing integration of simulation to healthcare professions' educational curriculum, the search for alternative learning models to apprenticeship, and the use of technology to facilitate learning.

Teamwork is an essential factor in the various healthcare professions. Teamwork training and multidisciplinary practices are essential in simulation curriculum development since success depends on effective communication and reliability of team members, similar to aviation, military, and space exploration. Teamwork between healthcare providers from different professions is critical. EvidenceÂ presented by the Joint Commission showed that ineffective communication is a contributing factor to over 60% of the reviewed adverse events.
