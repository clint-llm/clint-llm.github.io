History may allude to the recent trauma of the affected area or an occupation suspicious for a high likelihood of septic bursitis. Therefore, it is important to ask relevant questions. Clinical findings may be indistinguishable from non-infectious bursitis and sometimes even a septic joint. Patients with septic bursitis are more likely to present with pain or tenderness overlying the bursa, edema, erythema, and warmth. Patients may also have signs of trauma or wounds and lesions with or without symptoms of cellulitis. Fever may or may not be present but is more likely to be present when bursitis is infectious versus when it is non-infectious. Joint motion is usually unaffected in septic bursitis and likely limited with septic arthritis. The findings discussed above are not completely reliable in distinguishing between infectious and non-infectious bursitis, and therefore, additional diagnostic testing must be done. In a nutshell, the following should be the focus of the examination; swelling size, consistency (soft, firm, hard), fluctuance, associated cellulitis, and any lymphadenopathy. Also, the range of movement and pain of the adjacent joint should be carefully assessed and documented.
