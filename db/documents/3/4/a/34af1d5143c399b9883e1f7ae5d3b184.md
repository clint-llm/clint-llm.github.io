Alpha-methyldopa is converted to methyl norepinephrine centrally to decrease the adrenergic outflow by alpha-2 agonistic action from the central nervous system, leading to reduced total peripheral resistance and decreased systemic blood pressure. Alpha-2 agonistic activity does not affect cardiac output or renal blood flow.; hence, this drug is useful in hypertensive patients with renal insufficiency.
