As a provider, it is essential to educate patients on the likely cause of their tonsillitis and provide a thorough explanation of the diagnosis. The provider should address patients' expectations for antibiotics as well as the potential for harmful side effects. Patients should receive education on possible complications of pharyngitis and the rationale for treatment plans. Given that the majority of these infections are viral, this is an opportunity to employ antibiotic stewardship. The Centor criteria can be used to risk-stratify patients and explain the rationale for testing. Properly outlining the disease course and managing symptoms can help to reduce bouncebacks and decrease the overuse of antibiotics.

Both rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever can be prevented via treatment with antibiotics, most commonly penicillin. Given the extremely low incidence of rheumatic fever in developed, resource-rich countries, aggressive antibiotic therapy for group A strep tonsillitis may not be necessary.
