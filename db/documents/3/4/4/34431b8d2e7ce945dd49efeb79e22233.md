The anterior lateral nasal artery perfuses the intrinsic muscles of the nose, the transverse, and alar portions of the nasalis muscle, also known as the compressor naris and the dilator naris muscles. It also feeds the nearby muscles of the medial midface, specifically the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle and potentially the levator labii superioris muscle as well.
