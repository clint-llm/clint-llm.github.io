To date, there is no direct treatment strategy to treat sleep paralysis during an active episode. There have been attempts made to manage the underlying psychological and physical factors that trigger an episode, but currently, there is no treatment available to abort an episode. In one study, Focused-Attention Meditation Combined with Muscle Relaxation (MR Therapy) demonstrated some clinical benefit as a direct treatment for sleep paralysis.

Since a strong correlation exists between sleep paralysis and other sleep problems, improving sleep hygiene is a common focus to help prevent sleep paralysis. Sleep hygiene refers to a person’s daily habits and routines that influence sleep quality. For example:

- Fixed sleep schedule (going to bed and waking up in the morning), including weekends

- The bedroom should have a comfortable mattress and pillow.

- Bedroom with limited intrusion from light or noise

- Keeping a set pre-bed routine, avoid watching TV in the bedroom

- Decrease consumption of caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evening.

- Discontinue use of electronic devices, including cell phones, for at least a half-hour before bed.
