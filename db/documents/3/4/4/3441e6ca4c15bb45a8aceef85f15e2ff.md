Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that, in sequence, involves the activation of antigen-driven CD4+ T lymphocytes, chemokine-induced migration of T cells to the disease site, local macrophage accumulation, and granuloma formation.

In cases with active sarcoidosis, there is dominant expression of interferon γ (IFN γ), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF α) at the disease site. TNFα is the key granuloma-promoting cytokine.
