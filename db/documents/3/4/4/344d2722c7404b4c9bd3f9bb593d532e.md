The exact pathophysiology of AR pupils remains unknown. The current leading theory, proposed by Thompson and Kardon (2006) is that syphilis leads to a "dorsal midbrain lesion that interrupts the pupillary light reflex pathway but spares the more ventral pupillary near the reflex pathway."

Their research implicates a portion of the rostral midbrain (brainstem) located near the Sylvian aqueduct as the most likely location of the syphilitic lesion. Damage to this area would affect the efferent pupillary fibers located on the dorsal aspect of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN), which are a part of the light reflex while sparing the fibers associated with the accommodation reflex which lay more ventrally to the EWN.
