Acute patellar dislocations typically occur as a result of trauma, usually a non-contact twisting injury to the knee, or from a direct blow to the medial aspect of the knee. A common mechanism is external tibial rotation with the foot fixed on the ground. There is a group of patients that suffer from chronic laxity and recurrent subluxation of their patella. The recurrence rate following a first-time dislocation can be 15-60%. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of patellar dislocation and illustrates the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of patellar dislocation.
- Review the risk factors for patellar dislocation.
- Describe how to make the diagnosis of patellar dislocation.
- Describe how enhanced coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to a more rapid recognition of patellar dislocation, and subsequently to a more prompt evaluation and treatment.
