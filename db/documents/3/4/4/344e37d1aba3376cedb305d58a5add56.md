There is no validated gold standard diagnostic test for SIBO.

A bacterial concentration of >Â 10 is diagnostic of SIBO, but it is invasive, time-consuming, and expensive, as it is obtained during an upper endoscopy. The results are also poorly reproducible and can lead to false results from either patchy bacterial overgrowth or contamination with oropharyngeal flora.

In patients without specific risk factors for SIBO, upper and lower endoscopies are generally performed to rule out other causes like atrophic gastritis and Crohn's disease. If endoscopies are normal, imaging studies are done to rule out partial obstruction, diverticula, fistula, or other inflammatory findings. Magnetic enterography increases the sensitivity of diagnosing small intestinal bowel strictures, but it is costly.

A thorough evaluation of the cause of SIBO should be worked up as SIBO is associated with cirrhosis, kidney disease, chronic pancreatitis, and immunodeficiency disorders.
