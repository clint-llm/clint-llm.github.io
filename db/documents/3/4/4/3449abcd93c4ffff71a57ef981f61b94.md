Chlorpromazine should not be given if there is a known hypersensitivity or allergy to phenothiazines. The drug should be used cautiously in patients on antihypertensive medications due to the risk of developing severe hypotension. It should not be administered concurrently with drugs that depress the central nervous system or patients with a poorly controlled seizure disorder. The drug does not have approval for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. Chlorpromazine's D2 receptor blockade action may affect the therapeutic efficacy of the medications with dopamine agonist action, such as levodopa or cabergoline. Selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as citalopram and escitalopram are contraindicated to use along with chlorpromazine. Studies have shown that chlorpromazine qualifies as a potential drug for use during breastfeeding, but under medical supervision,Â when the benefits outweigh the risks.

Chlorpromazine occasionally may be used in low doses during pregnancy, although clinicians should weigh the risk vs. benefit of therapy during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester.
