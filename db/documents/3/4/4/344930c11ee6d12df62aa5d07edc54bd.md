Rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis is an uncommon infection caused by the angiotropic fungus belonging to the order Mucorales and has high morbidity and mortality despite treatment. Rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis almost always occurs in immunocompromised hosts, including patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hematologic cancers, and solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplants. The suspicion or diagnosis of rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis triggers a medical as well as surgical emergency with the delay in treatment, increasing morbidity and mortality. This activity will discuss the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis with special stress on the need for interaction and coordination among the interprofessional team to improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis.
- Review the diagnostic evaluation of rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis.
- Summarize the management strategies of rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis.
- Outline the importance of strong interaction and coordination within the interprofessional team to bring out the best outcome in patients with rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis.
