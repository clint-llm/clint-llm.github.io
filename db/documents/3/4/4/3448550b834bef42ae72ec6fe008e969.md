Acute and chronic cholecystitis is caused by either a mechanical blockage of the biliary system, usually of the cystic duct, or by a functional hypokinetic condition of the gallbladder.

Gallstones most often cause mechanical anatomic blockages of the biliary outlet. Other etiologies responsible for mechanical obstruction are neoplasms, external compression, and stenosis of the bile duct.

Functional obstructions are caused by the hypokinetic emptying of the gallbladder from situations of decreased stimulusÂ to the gallbladder such as in fasting states, critical illnesses, and nerve disruption associated with vagotomies, and gastric surgeries.
