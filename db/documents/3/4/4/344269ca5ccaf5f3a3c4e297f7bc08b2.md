The varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious virus of the herpes family. Chickenpox (or primary VZV infection) is a common childhood disease, and now, with universal childhood varicella vaccination, most adults in the United States and Europe are immune. This activity describes the evaluation and management of congenital varicella syndrome and neonatal varicella infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of congenital varicella syndrome and neonatal varicella infection.

- Review the risk factors for developing congenital varicella syndrome and neonatal varicella infection.
- Outline the clinical presentations of both presentations for congenital varicella syndrome and neonatal varicella infection.

- Describe how interprofessional collaboration and communication can improve outcomes for patients with congenital varicella syndrome and neonatal varicella infection.
