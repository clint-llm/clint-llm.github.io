The etiologies of presyncope are diverse, ranging from the benign to the life-threatening. Presyncope causes are the same as for syncope and include cardiac and noncardiac etiologies. Cardiac presyncope may be associated with palpitations, and may occur while in a sitting or supine position or during effort or exercise.

Most common are noncardiac etiologies that include vasovagal or neurocardiogenic, and causes related to volume shifts such as orthostatic hypotension, medication-induced, vascular and sepsis. Vasovagal presyncope is common and is often characterized by a prodrome, including nausea, flushing, diaphoresis, blurred vision, and lightheadedness. High-risk medications include antihypertensives, cardiovascular agents, and antipsychotics

Cardiac causes, which are more ominous, include mechanical (e.g., cardiac tamponade or valvular disease) and dysrhythmic (e.g., paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia or conduction system disease). Dysrhythmias, which induce hemodynamic impairment that can cause a critical decrease in cardiac output and cerebral blood flow, are the most common cardiac cause
