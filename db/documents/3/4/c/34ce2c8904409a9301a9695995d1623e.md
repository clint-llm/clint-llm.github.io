- Chronic stiffness is common after DIP dislocation treatment.

- Overtreatment, such as prolonged splinting and multiple attempts at reduction of volar PIP joint dislocations, increases the likelihood of volar plate scarring and flexion contractures.

- Chronic pain

- Reduced mobility of MCP, PIP, and DIP joints.

- Missing or delayed volar plate injuries are associated with boutonniere deformity, swan neck deformity, laxity, and contractures.

- Swan neck deformity, PIP flexion contracture, and mallet finger deformity may also occur if the dislocations of the finger are chronically unrecognized.
