Necrosis is a complication that will necessitate surgical debridement. This complication arises due to the pressure applied by the large or growing hematoma on surrounding tissues.

As with any condition managed operatively, the risk of infection is a potential complication, and patients should follow up shortly after discharge from the hospital to check for recurrence of hematoma or infection. Prophylactic antibiotics may be prescribed if clinically indicated.

Selective pelvic arterial embolization, although not readily available, is an effective procedure in competent hands.
