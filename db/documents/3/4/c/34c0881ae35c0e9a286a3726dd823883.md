The specific cause of von Economo encephalitis is unknown but is most likely related to an autoimmune reaction against neuronal proteins. The prevalence of encephalitis lethargica occurred during the Spanish influenza pandemic, and several reports attributed the etiology to the influenza virus.

Von Economo ruled out external sources such as sausage poisoning and gas poison. As there was no contact with another individual, meningitis, and polio were also ruled out. Discussions related to the etiology of influenza were still mentioned. However, his cases and a few other reports concluded that the encephalitis lethargica is a separate disorder than directly caused by the influenza infection. Still, influenza as a prodromal phase was not ruled out by von Economo.

The archival tissues of the encephalitis lethargica patients were RT-PCR tested in 2001 but failed to show evidence of the influenza virus. This disease was recently described as associated with streptococcal infection and included in pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS).
