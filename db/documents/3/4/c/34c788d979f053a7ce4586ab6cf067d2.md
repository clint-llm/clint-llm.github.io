Studies on endophthalmitis resulting from Streptococcus pneumoniae suggest a poor visual outcome. Miller et al., in their study on pneumococcal endophthalmitis, reported 3/27 (11.11%) eyes required evisceration. Pseudomonas endophthalmitis has a high enucleation rate, with one study suggesting that 64% of endophthalmitis caused by Pseudomonas will end up with evisceration and enucleation. Similarly, high evisceration rates post Pseudomonas endophthalmitis were also seen in other studies.
