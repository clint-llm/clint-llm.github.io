Laser resurfacing is a process wherein energy generated at a specified wavelength is used to ablate the most superficial layers of the skin. This process may be total, in which all portions of the treatment area are ablated, or fractional, in which smaller regions are ablated, and adjacent areas are left untreated, typically in a pattern of closely spaced ablated and non-ablated areas.

Carbon dioxide lasers emit energy with a peak wavelength of 10,600 nm, which is preferentially absorbed by intracellular water.
