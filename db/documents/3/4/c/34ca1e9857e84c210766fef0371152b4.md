Common complications associated with anterior elbow dislocations are the same as those associated with elbow dislocations in general. Stiffness with a range of motion, and more specifically loss of terminal extension, is the most common complication after an elbow dislocation. This occurs with prolonged immobilization, typically greater than three weeks, and can be improved by physical therapy focusing on a range of motion.

Persistent elbow instability is another complication that can occur after an elbow dislocation. Varus instability is the most common and is due to insufficiency of the lateral collateral ligament. Lateral collateral ligament insufficiency can be treated by splinting in pronation but may require surgical repair.

Neurovascular injury can be a complication of an anterior elbow dislocation. The three neurovascular structures of the elbow most commonly injured are the ulnar nerve, median nerve, and brachial artery. Ulnar nerve neuropraxia is the most common injury due to stretching of the nerve during the dislocation, with median nerve neuropraxia following second to it. Neuropraxias are initially managed by observation and typically resolve over time. Median nerve entrapment can occur in the instance where there is a fracture, and this warrants surgical exploration of the nerve.
