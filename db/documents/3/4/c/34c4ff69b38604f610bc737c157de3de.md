Rosacea is not a life-threatening disease, and the overall prognosis of rosacea is good. However, it can lead to depression and anxiety. If left untreated, patients can develop permanent scarring and persistent erythema. In addition, ocular sequelae could be a complication of untreated, ocular rosacea. Recent studies elaborated on the possible correlation of rosacea with neurologic, cardiovascular, endocrine, and gastrointestinal comorbidities. Consideration of these comorbidities in patients with rosacea may be warranted, though currently no evidence-based recommendations for screening have been established.
