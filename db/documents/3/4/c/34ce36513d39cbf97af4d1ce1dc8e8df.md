Hypoxia is low oxygen content at the tissue level to meet the metabolic needs of the cells. The condition can occur in a patient for a variety of reasons and the interprofessional team must be aware of the workup of such a patient.

Classic causes of hypoxia include hypoventilation, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, the low oxygen content in the air, right to left shunting, or impaired diffusion. By analyzing the arterial blood gas (ABG), calculating the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient), and determining whether administration of 100% oxygen leads to improvement, one can determine the specific type of hypoxemia plaguing a particular patient. Leaving hypoxia untreated for prolonged periods leads to permanent organ injury including death.
