One must differentiate between artery and vein before cannulation. This can be done using knowledge of anatomy as well as the different characteristics seen on US. Veins should be easily compressible when pressure is applied using the US probe, whereas arteries will generally not collapse. In addition to this, when pressure is applied there often will be a pulsatile movement of the arteries. Arteries also have slightly thicker and hyperechoic walls when compared to the veins.

With hypotension or vessel calcifications, these differences may not be as noticeable. In these cases, the color flow mode or Doppler mode may assist in differentiating between the artery and vein. When using color flow mode, it is important to remember that the different colors do not inherently represent artery or vein but instead the direction of blood flow towards or away from the probe, so the operator should be careful to slightly angle probe and interpret the color based on the probe’s angulation. When using Doppler flow, the artery should show a much greater variation in the velocity waveform as compared to the vein.

Once the proper vessel is identified, follow the path of the vessel to identify any branching or tortuosity that may complicate the cannulation. This can be done in longitudinal or transverse planes.
