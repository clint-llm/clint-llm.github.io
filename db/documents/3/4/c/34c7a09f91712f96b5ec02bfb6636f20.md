ConusÂ venom is a complex mixture of compounds that cause paralysis through multiple neuromuscular blocking steps. The combinations of peptides that comprise venom vary between species, and it has been estimated that each cone snail harbors over 100,000 different bioactive compounds within its venom. The complexity of this poison and the variation in target pathways has prevented the production of effective anti-venom.
