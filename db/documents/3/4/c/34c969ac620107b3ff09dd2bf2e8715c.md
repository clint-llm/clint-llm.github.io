The ophthalmomyiasis externa mimics adenoviral conjunctivitis. The punctate hemorrhages due to microtrauma by larval spines are very similar to those seen in adenoviral conjunctivitis.

The anterior ophthalmomyiasis interna and anterior uveitis both present with severe anterior chamber reaction. However, in the anterior ophthalmomyiasis interna, the larva can also be seen in the anterior chamber.

The posterior ophthalmomyiasis can often be confused with isolated exudative retinal detachment. So a case of exudative retinal detachment should be thoroughly examined, especially in the endemic zones with a history of exposure.

Diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN) is an important differential diagnosis of ophthalmomyiasis interna (posterior). The subretinal tracts are usually thinner, and the causative organisms here are nematode larvae.

Usual presentation in the acute phase is vitritis, disc edema, and crops of white retinal lesions with possible detection of a moving nematode.****Such nematodes must be neutralized by laser urgently as these may move rapidly and may be undetectable later.****In the late phase, there are features of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa characterized by the pallor of the optic disc, retinal arteriolar attenuation, and pigmentary changes in the retinal periphery.

Tunga penetrans (chigoe flea) burrow into the skin and may mimic Dermatobia hominis larvae.
