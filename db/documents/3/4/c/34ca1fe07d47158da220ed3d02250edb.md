The inflammatory process in postpartum thyroiditis initiates with the presence of thyroid antibodies (TPOAb and TgAb), activation of the complement cascade, increased levels of IgG1, lymphocyte abnormalities, increased activity of NK cells, and specific HLA haplotypes. The inflammatory process activates the proteolysis of the thyroglobulin within the thyroid follicles. The result is the destruction of the thyroid follicles and releasing significant amounts of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the blood and subsequently hyperthyroid state. This hyperthyroid state is transient and lasts until all thyroglobulin storages released into circulation and no more thyroglobulin left within the follicles. During the hyperthyroid state, the synthesis of new hormones becomes shutdown because excessive T4/T3 in circulation causes downregulation of TSH secretion. Synthesis of thyroid hormones will be resumed once all inflammatory process subsides.
