When a patient presents for management of symptomatic fibroids, the discussion of management options should not only be guided by treatments most likely to improve their symptomatology but also by the patient’s desire for future fertility and the overall health status that may preclude them at higher risk of complication with one treatment strategy over another.  As described in detail above, treatment strategies include medical therapy, surgical intervention, and procedures with interventional radiology (IR). Expectant management is an option for those who are asymptomatic and do not desire intervention. For patients not seeking immediate fertility, treatment strategies typically follow a “step-up approach,” which begins with minimally invasive or medical therapy before moving on to excisional surgery.

Alternatively, in patients desiring immediate fertility and expectant management is not recommended due to location and size of the fibroid, surgical intervention is typically recommended as the initial treatment modality, as this is typically the most efficient way to remove the space-occupying mass. Nonetheless, once goals of care are reviewed, the treatment strategy should be individualized for each patient through shared decision-making. Risks, benefits, and alternatives to each treatment modality should be discussed at length to ensure the patient is making an educated decision and is providing informed consent for the next steps in their care.
