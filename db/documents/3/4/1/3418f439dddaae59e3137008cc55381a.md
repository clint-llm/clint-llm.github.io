Any patient presenting with erythroderma should raise the suspicion of Sezary syndrome. Though the skin involvement is diffuse in Sezary syndrome, it is not as dense as it is in mycosis fungoides. Therefore, a skin biopsy should be performed without any interventions for the lesions, and the site with the greatest induration should be biopsied.

Excisional lymph node biopsy is preferred, and it can show reactive changes or dermatopathic changes or features suggestive of lymphoma.

Peripheral blood shows atypical circulating lymphocytes with grooved nuclei, called Sezary or Lutzner cells. A rarely smaller variant of Sezary cells can be seen in normal people or people with known malignancy.

Immunophenotyping confirming T-cell origin (CD3+ and CD4+) and lack of expression of CD2, CD3, CD5 and CD7 (mature T-cell antigens) are supportive of Sezary syndrome.

The diagnosis is made by erythroderma involving greater than 80% BSA, clonal TCR rearrangement confirmed by PCR or Southern blot, and absolute Sezary cell count of at least 1000 cells/microL, or one of the following 2 criteria:

- Increased CD4+ or CD3+ with CD4/CD8 ratio of 10 or more

- Increased CD4+ cells with abnormal phenotype: CD4+CD7- ratio of 40% or more or CD4+CD26- ratio of 30% or more.

The staging of Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides is done by evaluating the skin (T), lymph nodes (N), visceral organ involvement (M), and blood (B). Types of skin lesions and extent of its involvement determines the “T” stage. Blood involvement depends on the tumor burden of the blood. Patients with Sezary syndrome are considered to have stage IVA1, IVA2 and IVB depending on the presence of nodal and visceral involvement.
