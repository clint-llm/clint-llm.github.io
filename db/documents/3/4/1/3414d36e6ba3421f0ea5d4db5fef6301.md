Checking intraocular pressure of both eyes is a standard screening done for every complete eye exam. This along with a fundoscopic exam with careful attention to the optic nerve are important screening tests to identify glaucoma suspects early in the disease process. Glaucoma suspects that are at high risk need further testing to confirm the diagnosis of glaucoma. Patients should be educated about the causes, risk factors, and treatment for glaucoma. Patients should be aware that most glaucoma cases cause slow progressive vision loss that the patients will not realize until much of their visual field is gone. For this reason, it is highly recommended that patients have regular eye exams for the purpose of identifying high-risk patients and preventing irreversible vision loss.
