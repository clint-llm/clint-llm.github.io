The risk factors for the progression of pinguecula include exposure to ultraviolet light, trauma, wind, dust, sand, working outdoors for a long duration, and advancing age.

Contact lens wear is an additional risk factor for the development of pinguecula. The cause for nasal predominance could be due to the actinic damage which occurs in this area because of reflection from the side of the nose.

Gaucher disease may be associated with pinguecula that is pigmented (brown) and triangular. Histology of such lesions reveals Gaucher cells (lipid-laden macrophage). Other lysosomal storage disorders can also have pinguecula.
