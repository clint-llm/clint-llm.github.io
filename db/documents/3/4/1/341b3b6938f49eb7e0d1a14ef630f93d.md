Patients suspected of having scleritis should have a thorough systemic evaluation and a full ophthalmic examination.

On examination, patients commonly have episcleral and conjunctival hyperemia (98%), and scleral necrosis (93%). Patients additionally present with calcified plaques (38%), anterior segment inflammation (25%), corneal involvement (25%), and multifocal scleral abscesses (23%).

The use of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) has also been used for the examination of infectious scleritis. UBM allows for early detection of choroidal and retinal detachment, ciliary body rotation, and elimination of the ciliary sulcus due to infectious scleritis.
