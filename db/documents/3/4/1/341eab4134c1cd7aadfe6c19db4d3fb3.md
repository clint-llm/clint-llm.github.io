Patients with Turner syndrome have a lot of comorbidities and require many specialty fields to be involved in care, functioning as an interprofessional team. Although the primary provider should be following and managing many of the screening and follow up care, the other specialties involved should include cardiology, endocrinology, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, audiology, nephrology, and orthopedic surgery. It is essential for the different specialists to communicate well with each other and especially the primary team, so that they can address all the potential complications. Nurses who have specialized training in genetics provide patient education, monitor patients, and coordinate referrals and communication between team members. Pharmacists review hormonal therapies and work with patients and their families about administration and compliance. The interprofessional team approach will lead to optimal outcomes for Turner syndrome patients. [Level 5]
