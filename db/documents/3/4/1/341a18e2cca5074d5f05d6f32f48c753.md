The parathyroid gland's composition is primarily chief cells that are rich in mitochondria and are connected by desmosomes. When these cells are active, many dense, irregularly-shaped secretory granules are visible within the cytoplasm on electron microscopy. Also, a large Golgi complex and numerous free ribosomes are present in the active cell.
