In a retrospective study conducted on 44 patients with renal infarction and atrial fibrillation, Hazanov et al. found that the 30-day mortality in renal infarction was 11.4%.

Yang et al. reported that 34.8% (31 of 89) of patients diagnosed with renal infarction also experienced acute kidney injury, and 27.1% developed chronic kidney disease during the follow-up period.

The prognosis was found to be better in patients diagnosed early. Warm ischemia time, collateral flow, and preexisting kidney disease tend to influence prognosis following treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis.

Prognosis can also be influenced by embolic infarction in other organs like the spleen, intestine, liver, and lungs.
