In rare cases, hepatic toxicity has correlated with the use of fluconazole. Hepatic reactions range from mild transient elevations in transaminases to clinical hepatitis. There have been fatalities, primarily in patients with severe underlying medical conditions, predominantly AIDS, malignancy, or chronic liver disease, and often while taking multiple concomitant medications. There is no apparent relationship to the total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or the patient's age.

Fluconazole hepatotoxicity has typically, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Therefore, the recommendation is to carefully monitor patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during fluconazole therapy to check for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Fluconazole should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop.Â Patients on warfarin therapy who have been prescribed fluconazole need monitoring of INR, as a bleeding manifestation has been reported.
