Preparation depends on the clinical question under consideration. Preparation for evaluation for cholecystitis is different than preparation for biliary atresia.

For evaluation of cholecystitis patients are instructed to fast 3 to 4 hours before IDA injection. Fat stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin which causes gallbladder contraction and artificially absent gallbladder on the scan. Fasting 3 to 4 hours prior to injection of the radiotracer allows the passage of ingested contents and relaxation of the gallbladder.

On the other hand, fasting for more than 24 hours allows gallbladder time to resorb water from bile (a normal physiological process) which thickens and prevents radiotracer entry; this may lead to a false positive study non-visualization of the gallbladder). In the fasting population a cholecystokinin analog, sincalide, should be given prior to the study to contract and empty the gallbladder. Intravenous administration of sincalide is 0.02 micrograms/kilogram administered over one hour. Tc-99-HIDA should be injected at least 30 minutes after sincalide administration to allow adequate gallbladder relaxation.

For evaluation of biliary atresia phenobarbital-enhanced cholescintigraphy is used to differentiate neonatal jaundice and biliary atresia. Phenobarbital is a medication which induces hepatic enzymatic activity, bilirubin conjugation, and excretion. The recommended dose is 5 mg/kg/day for five days prior to the scan.
