Pediatric cataracts are one of the leading causes of treatable childhood blindness. If left untreated, it can have a significant impact socially, economically, and emotionally on the child, family, and society at large. This remains a challenging entity in ophthalmological practice because of the need to identify, diagnose and manage the condition as early as possible in order to prevent amblyopia.

Routine screening and awareness among parents about leukocoria and strabismus lead to early diagnosis and management. A good pre-op evaluation, intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation, meticulous surgery, and equally efficient postoperative care and visual rehabilitation are important for a favorable outcome. An interdepartmental effort involving pediatrics, anesthesia, ophthalmology, and optometry help in the proper and effective management of pediatric cataract.
