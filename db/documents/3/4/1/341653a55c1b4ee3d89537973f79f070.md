In fibromyalgia, there appears to be a problem with the processing of pain in the brain. Patients often become hypersensitive to the perception of pain. The constant hypervigilance of pain is also associated with numerous psychological issues. Abnormalities noted in fibromyalgia include

- elevated levels of the excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate and substance P

- diminished levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the descending anti-nociceptive pathways in the spinal cord

- Prolonged enhancement of pain sensations

- Dysregulation of dopamine

- Alteration in the activity of brain endogenous opioids.

Fibromyalgia is more common in women than men because of the following:

- Higher levels of anxiety

- Use of maladaptive coping methods

- Altered behavior in response to pain

- Higher levels of depression

- Altered input to the CNS and hormonal effects of the menstrual cycle
