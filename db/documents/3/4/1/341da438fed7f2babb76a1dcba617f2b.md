Laryngeal cancers represent one-third of all head and neck cancers and maybe a significant source of morbidity and mortality. They are most often diagnosed in patients with significant smoking history, who are also at risk for cancers in the remainder of the aerodigestive tract. They can involve different subsites of the larynx, with different implications in symptomatic presentation, patterns of spread, and treatment paradigm. Early-stage disease is highly curable with either surgical or radiation monotherapy, often larynx-preserving, whereas late-stage disease has a worse outcome, warrants multimodal therapy, and is less often larynx-preserving. For patients requiring laryngectomy, speech rehabilitation methods have improved in the modern era.

Each year about 13,000 laryngeal cancers are diagnosed in the USA; the majority of which are squamous cell cancers. While in the past the treatment of laryngeal cancer was purely surgical, today the treatment approach is more towards organ preservation with chemoradiation. Many studies show that this approach produces similar results to total laryngectomy. In addition, today there are also endoscopic methods of managing laryngeal cancer.
