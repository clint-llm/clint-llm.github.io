Clinically, transportation and elimination of carbon dioxide become especially crucial in regulating the pH of the blood. Should the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increase or decrease, the bodyâ€™s pH will decrease or increase, respectively. This change can occur as a primary disorder, such as in the case of an individual who becomes apneic and develops acidosis because of the increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide, or as a compensatory reaction, such as in a person with diabetes who develops ketoacidosis and hyperventilates to decrease carbon dioxide levels and prevent the pH from dropping too low.
