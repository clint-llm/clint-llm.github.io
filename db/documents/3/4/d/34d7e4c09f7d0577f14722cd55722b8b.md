Although the cause of dermatomyositis is unknown, several genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors are implicated in this condition.

**Genetic Factors**

Multiple studies have indicated that patients with particular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types are at higher risk of dermatomyositis. High-risk haplotypes include HLA-A*68 in North American Whites

**Immunologic Factors**

Although autoantibodies are detected in patients with dermatomyositis, it is unclear whether they play a role in pathogenesis.

**Environmental Factors**

**Infections**

Viruses such as Coxsackie B virus, enterovirus, and parvovirus have been suspected of acting as triggers of dermatomyositis. There are multiple theories about the mechanisms of virus-induced autoimmunity. These include alteration of cellular proteins, breakdown of self-tolerance, an unmasking of previously hidden epitopes, autoantibody induced B cell activation, and molecular mimicry.

**Drugs**

Several drugs can trigger dermatomyositis. These include antineoplastic drugs (hydroxyurea, cyclophosphamide), anti-infectious agents (penicillin, sulfonamides, isoniazid), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (diclofenac, phenylbutazone), D-penicillamine, statins, and certain vaccines.

**Radiation**

Dermatomyositis has been observed to occur more frequently among women exposed to high-intensity ultraviolet radiation.
