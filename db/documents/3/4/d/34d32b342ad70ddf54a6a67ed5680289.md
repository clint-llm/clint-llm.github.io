Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) is one of the rare forms of congenital heart disease (CHD), accounting for less than 1% of total heart defects. This entity was first described by Hunter in 1783 and later by Peacock in 1869. As implied by the name, this disease is characterized by either membranous or long segment muscular atresia of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in the absence of communication at the level of ventricles. The spectrum of this disease range from simple membranous pulmonary atresia (PA) with normal-appearing right ventricle (RV) to hypoplastic RV with abnormal connections between the right ventricle and coronary arteries.
