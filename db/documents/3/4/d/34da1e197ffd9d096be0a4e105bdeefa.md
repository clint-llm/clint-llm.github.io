ESR can be measured by various methods, including the Westergren, Wintrobe, micro-ESR, and automated machines.

The Westergren method has classically been used to measure the ESR based on the distance RBCs settle to the bottom of an elongated tube with a 2.5 cm internal bore. It is graduated downward in millimeters, from 0 to 200, allowing the clear plasma to remain at the top of the tube after the RBCs have settled toward the bottom due to gravitational force after one hour of observation.

Many additional methods have been proposed, including the Linzenmeier method, the Graphic or Cutler method, the Wintrobe-Landsberg method, and the Landau method. Only the Westergren and Wintrobe methods are common today. The Wintrobe method uses tubes only 100 mm long with a smaller bore (thinner tube) than standard Westergren tubes. It is considered less sensitive than Westergren.

Although the Westergren method is commonly used for determining the ESR, it is time-consuming, and there is room for error. In an attempt to find faster and more reliable means of obtaining the ESR, newer methods have evolved.

The micro-ESR is a method of obtaining the ESR using capillary tubes and quicker testing times. This method uses four drops of capillary blood drawn via fingerstick, then mixed in a 4:1 ratio on a slide with a 3.8 percent sodium citrate solution. The sample is then drawn into a 7.5-centimeter heparin-free microhematocrit capillary tube.

Several new automated and semi-automated techniques have become available for determining the ESR; these methods are safer and faster with higher accuracy. The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) has reviewed the accuracy and consistency of over a dozen methods. Recommendations have been made for the manufacturers for the validation of new ESR methods.
