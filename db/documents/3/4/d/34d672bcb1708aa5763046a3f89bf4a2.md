Nuclear medicine plays a role in the diagnosis, staging/re-staging, and therapy of prostate carcinoma. Skeletal metastases can be identified with a bone scan. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an examination that assesses malignant activity and its spread in the body. In particular, choline derivative radiotracer, 18F-fluorocholine (F-FCH), is the currently used tracer for diagnosing prostate carcinoma. PET, when combined with CT (PET/CT) and MRI (PET/MRI), adds metabolic/functional data derived from PET to CT or MRI findings.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed on the cell surface of carcinoma, nodal metastasis, and metastases to the bones. Ga-labeled PSMA inhibitor is a widely used PET tracer, is now becoming popular, not only for diagnosis but also for therapy.
