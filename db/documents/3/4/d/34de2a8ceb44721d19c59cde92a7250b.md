The main complication is stress and potential harm to the patient due to an unsafe environment. Alterations not only increase the stress upon the patient, but patients can be at risk of falls, injuries, and perhaps can be a danger to themselves or to others due to their violent behaviors.  A careful evaluation is needed to ascertain the cause while assisting the patient and preventing them from any further distress or injuries.
