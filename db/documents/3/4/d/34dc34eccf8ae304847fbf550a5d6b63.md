Certain factors correlate with an increased risk of rejection of the renal allograft after the transplantation. These factors are:

- Prior sensitization - high panel reactive antibodies

- Type of transplant: Deceased donor has a higher rejection than a living transplant

- Advanced age of the donor

- Prolonged cold ischemia time

- Prolonged warm ischemia time

- HLA mismatch

- Positive B cell crossmatch

- ABO incompatibility

- Recipient’s age: Younger recipients have more rejection than older ones

- Recipient’s race: Black race greater than White race

- Delayed graft function

- Therapy non-compliance

- Previous episodes of rejections

- Inadequate immunosuppression
