Any potential ingestion or toxicity should undergo a standard primary and secondary survey, including evaluation of vital signs and thorough physical examination. An electrocardiogram, basic metabolic panel, and acetaminophen concentration should be obtained on all toxicology patients with suspected self-harm. Specific evaluation of patients with suspected toxicity is multi-factorial including evaluating for co-ingestions, the potential for pregnancy/complications, targets of the specific substance, and for any possible presenting complaints.

Specific evaluation of warfarin toxicity should involve evaluation of the patient’s PT, INR, CBC, and BMP with hepatic function, in addition to the standard co-ingestions and a focused evaluation surrounding their symptoms.  It is also important to inquire about recent medication changes, dietary or herbal supplements and recent diet changes as all of these factors have been associated with instability in patients who are taking warfarin.

It is important also to investigate how the toxicity occurred, and if focused psychiatric evaluation, or focused evaluation of activities of daily living, is required.
