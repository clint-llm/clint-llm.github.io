**Nerves and Muscles**

In the normal human anatomy, the phrenic nerve (C3-C5) is located posterior to the subclavian vein. The phrenic nerve passes anterior to the anterior scalene muscle and then courses posterior to the subclavian vein, and anterior to the internal thoracic artery as it enters the thorax to run anterior to the root of the lung and between the fibrous pericardium and mediastinal surface of the parietal pleura. Medial to the subclavian vein is the brachiocephalic trunk, thoracic duct, trachea, and vagal trunks. Lateral to the subclavian vein is the inferior trunk of the brachial plexus. The subclavius muscle and subclavian vein are also closely adherent, with the subclavius muscle lying anterior to the subclavian vein. The subclavius muscle is a small, triangular muscle originating from the first rib and inserting on the inferior surface of the lateral clavicle. The brachial plexus, subclavian artery, and subclavian vein pass below the subclavius muscle.
