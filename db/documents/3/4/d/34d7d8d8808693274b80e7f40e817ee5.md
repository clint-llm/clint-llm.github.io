- Unlike the past when all patients with DCM were empirically treated with anticoagulation, today the guidelines recommend theÂ use of anticoagulants only in patients with atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves, or known mural thrombus.

- When there is progressive end-stage heart failure despite maximal medical therapy and the prognosis is deemed poor, one may consider a heart transplant.

- All patients with DCM must be educated on the disorder and the importance of dietary restrictions in sodium and water.

- Patients with DCM should be referred for cardiac rehabilitation as this has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality by 20-30% over 5 years, including improvement in symptoms.
