Melarsoprol is an arsenical compound that must be administered in propylene glycol. Administration of the drug is painful and carries multiple adverse effects, the most serious consisting of the melarsoprol-induced encephalopathic syndrome.Â This occurs in 1.5% to 28% of treatments and results in nearly a 50% mortality rate. All patients receiving the medication should, therefore, be monitored in a hospital setting.
