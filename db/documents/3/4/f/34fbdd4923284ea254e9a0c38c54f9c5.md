Healthcare outcomes can be enhanced by the collaboration of multi-professional health workers. Some extensive diseases require interprofessional cooperation to make the correct diagnosis and treatment. Highly invasive and extensive diseases like rhinocerebral need quick diagnosis followed by immediate treatment. This would be possible if multiple healthcare workers are available and work simultaneously, especially in developed countries and tertiary care hospitals.

The interprofessional approach to rhinocerebral mucormycosis with infectious disease and medical intensivists, otolaryngologists, physicians, ophthalmologists, radiologists, histopathologists, neurosurgeons, pharmacists, neurologists escalate the diagnosis and treatment which reduce mortality snd morbidity. Even despite these measures, the result remains poor. So a high degree of suspicion is made in high-risk individuals to accomplish a multifaceted approach.
