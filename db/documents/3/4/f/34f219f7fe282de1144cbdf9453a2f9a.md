Since primary hepatic lymphoma is rare, the majority of evidence regarding treatment and tumor response comes from case series. Furthermore, the response to different strategies, i.e., surgery vs. chemotherapy, is again drawn from discrete case series.

One case series by Yang X.W. et al. demonstrated the prognosis of eight patients who have had surgical resection of the tumor.

In contrast to the above study, Page et al. determined that the combination chemotherapy helped achieve complete remission among 83.3% of patients and 5 years cause-specific and failure-free survival rates were 87.1% and 70.1%, respectively.

Prognosis and treatment response further depends on the size of the tumor; notably, tumors of greater than 7 cm in size, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels over 10% of the upper limit of the normal, raised beta-2 microglobulin levels in excess of 3 mg/dl, and presence of constitutional symptoms.

Among patients with no high-risk factors, treatment with combination chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) is usually effective in achieving remission. Among patients with the presence of at least one or more than one pre-treatment risk factors requires consideration of using altering triple combination. Alternate regimens consist ofÂ doxorubicin, methylprednisolone, cytosine arabinoside, and cisplatin, alternating with methotrexate, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and methylprednisolone.
