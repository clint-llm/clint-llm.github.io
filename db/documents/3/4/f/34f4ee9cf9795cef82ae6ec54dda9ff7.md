In general, complications after hair transplantation are rare, given the vigorous blood-supply to the scalp, which allows for quick healing and low rates of infection. Nevertheless, potential complications include

- Edema (5%)

- Bleeding (0.5%)

- Folliculitis

- Numbness of the scalp – may be temporary, and rarely permanent especially if dissection remains superficial to the galea aponeurosis and occipital fascia

- Telogen effluvium – an uncommon but concerning complication characterized by shedding of native hairs at the donor or recipient site. This “shock” loss, likely a result of stress and microtrauma sustained during HT, is transient. Patients should receive reassurance that the majority of the hairs shed will return at 3 to 4 months.

- Epidermal cysts and Ingrown Hair – these processes, although self-limited, may rarely set off a diffuse inflammatory response affecting the entire graft population. Releasing entrapped hairs should hasten resolution.

- Infection – given the robust blood supply of the scalp, infection affects less than 1% of patients. Treatment includes exfoliations with warm compresses, twice-daily shampooing, and antibiotics.
