Located in the upper abdomen near where the celiac trunk branches from the abdominal aorta, celiac ganglia are two collections of nerve cell bodies.

Celiac ganglia are the two largest ganglia in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and serve as an example of prevertebral ganglia. The celiac ganglia possess the cell bodies of the postganglionic sympathetic neurons and thus provide efferent sympathetic input to gut parenchyma via neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine in preganglionic neurons and norepinephrine in postganglionic neurons.

The ganglia are an extrinsic level of regulation because they are not present within the viscera itself.
