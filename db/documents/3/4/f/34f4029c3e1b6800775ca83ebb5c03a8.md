Clinicians should gather a detailed history, perform a thorough physical examination, and follow up with the following investigations when they suspect acute hepatic porphyria.

- Urine: Urine porphobilinogen (PBG) is the most important first-line screening test, which is both highly sensitive and highly specific. Through feedback, the reduced production of heme brings about elevated production of heme precursors, with PBG among the first substances in the porphyrin synthesis pathway.

- Plasma and feces for quantitative determination of ALA, PBG, and porphyrin levels

- Decreased erythrocyte porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) activity is seen in approximately 90% of patients. It can also be seen in asymptomatic patients.

- Basic metabolic panel: Hyponatremia is common. The probable mechanism includes the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) due to central nervous system (CNS) involvement, gastrointestinal or renal sodium loss.

- Liver function panel: mild elevation of transaminases is common, but other liver function tests generally remain normal

As acute hepatic porphyrias are very rare diseases, general hospital labs usually do not have the technology, the staff time, or the expertise to conduct testing for them. Commonly, such testing involves sending samples of blood, urine, and stool to a reference laboratory.
