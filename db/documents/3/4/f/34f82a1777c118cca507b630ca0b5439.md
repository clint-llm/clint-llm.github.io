Methimazole is available as oral tablets in 5 mg and 10 mg strengths. The starting dose is between 20 to 40 mg per day, depending upon the severity of the disease.

- The daily dose gets divided into three doses every 8 hours.

- As per the "titration regimen," the high starting dose is then tapered after 4 to 8 weeks. A maintenance dose of 5 to 20 mg follows after almost 4 to 6 months of therapy, which continues for an extra 12 to 18 months.

- As per the "block–replace regimen," a high dose of antithyroid drugs is maintained, but with levothyroxine therapy to maintain a euthyroid state. It has the added benefit of needing fewer thyroid function tests (TFTs) for monitoring, but with a slightly increased side effect frequency.

The treatment of thyroid storm includes a starting dose of 60 to 80 mg/day orally until achieving control, also given at 8-hour intervals. Adjust the subsequent doses and duration of treatment as per patient response.

Methimazole has a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore it is essential to note the maximally allowed dosage.

- Adults:40 mg/day orally; up to 60 mg/day in severe disease.

- Geriatric:40 mg/day orally; up to 60 mg/day in severe disease.

- Adolescents: Maintenance doses rarely exceed 30 mg/day orally; 1 mg/kg/day orally in severe hyperthyroidism. Patients who have attained full growth doses may approach adult dosing.

- Children: Maintenance doses rarely exceed 30 mg/day orally or 1 mg/kg/day if severe hyperthyroidism.

- Infants:1 mg/kg/day if severe hyperthyroidism.

- Pregnant Women: It is classified as Pregnancy Category D medicine. Fetal harm is reported when methimazole is administered to a pregnant woman. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking methimazole or when methimazole is used during pregnancy, the patient should be counseled on the potential risk to the fetus.

- Breastfeeding Women: As per manufacturer recommendations, methimazole is excreted in breastmilk when lactating women are administered methimazole, and hence postpartum patients receiving methimazole should not breastfeed their babies. Some experts recommend methimazole as the antithyroid drug of choice in nursing mothers compared to alternative agents. Maternal methimazole use does not affect intellectual development or thyroid function in breastfed infants with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg. To minimize the infant exposure, advise the patient to Take methimazole right after nursing or wait for 3 - 4 hours before nursing. The American Thyroid Association recommends monitoring infants for appropriate development and growth during routine health and wellness evaluations. Routine assessment of serum thyroid function in the child is not recommended. The infant should be watched for signs of infection as rare idiosyncratic reactions (e.g., agranulocytosis) might occur. In addition, monitor the infant's complete blood count and differential if there is a suspicion of a drug-induced blood dyscrasia.
