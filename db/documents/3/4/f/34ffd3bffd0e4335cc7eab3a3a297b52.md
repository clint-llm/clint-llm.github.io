SCA is a systemic disorder that affects the entire body. The disease not only manifests with physical symptoms (pain crises, organ damage, etc.) but also has numerous psycho-social implications. Most patients with SCA belong to the African-American community and a minority to Hispanic and other communities, which makes them prone to certain prejudices. Besides, the high demand for opioids to manage chronic pain makes the situation even more challenging.

Specialties like ophthalmology, orthopedics, psychiatry, gastroenterology, and cardiovascular medicine interact closely with SCA patients. However, this does not diminish the importance of other specialties. Pharmacy and nursing also play a vital role. With the advent of newer drugs and infusions and SCA affecting liver and kidney function, pharmacists and nursing experts are required to ensure safe dosage and medication delivery to the patient.
