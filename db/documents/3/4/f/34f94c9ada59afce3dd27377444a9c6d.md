Histopathologic studies from tissues of diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis patients showed several changes likeÂ loss of ICC, decreased nerve fibers, increased smooth muscle fibrosis, and abnormal macrophage-containing immune infiltrates. On electron microscopy, there is abnormal connective tissue stroma, thick basal lamina around ICCs and myocytes, and large empty nerve endings suggest more profound conduction defects, which supports the above discussion.
