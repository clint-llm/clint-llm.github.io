Historically used in military settings, phosgene today is a chemical intermediate in dye production, pesticides, livestock feed chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and organic intermediates.

Victims exposed to a large house fire or industrial fires are also at risk of phosgene poisoning due to the combustion of chlorinated products. There is a paucity of current epidemiologic data pertaining to phosgene toxicity. Reports are limited to anecdotes, case studies, simulations, and estimations.
