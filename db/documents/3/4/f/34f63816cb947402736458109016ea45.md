Pathology obtained from duodenal biopsies can affect the management of known diseases such as celiac disease or can diagnose a new disease that would prompt various management and treatment pathways. Gastroenterologists, nurses, endoscopy technicians, and pathologists participate in the acquisition and interpretation of the duodenal biopsy. Interprofessional management based on the pathology could also include primary care providers, specialties such as oncology and rheumatology, and dietitians. Consensus recommendations would optimize the patientâ€™s prognosis.
