The diagnosis of SSN injury can be challenging, given the overlap in presentation with other pathologies of the shoulder and cervical spine region. The differential diagnosis includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Cervical radiculopathy (C5-6)

- Parsonage-Turner syndrome

- Brachial plexopathy (upper trunk)

- Rotator cuff pathology (e.g., tendinitis, bursitis, partial or complete strain/tear)

- Subacromial impingement syndrome

- Scapular dyskinesia

- Labral pathology (e.g., superior labral tear from anterior to posterior (SLAP tear))

- Adhesive capsulitis

- Glenohumeral arthritis

- Facet mediated pain
