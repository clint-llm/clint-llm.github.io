Positive pressure ventilation describes the process of either using a mask or, more commonly, a ventilator to deliver breaths and to decrease the work of breathing in a critically ill patient. Positive pressure ventilation is delivered in one of two forms: non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (either through a mask) or invasive positive pressure ventilation, which requires delivering breaths either through an endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube. This activity will highlight the physiology, indications, contraindications, and other key factors for members of the interprofessional team managing the care of critically ill patients who require positive pressure ventilation.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the physiology behind positive pressure ventilation.
- Identify the indications for positive pressure ventilation. 
- Identify the most common complications associated with positive pressure ventilation.
