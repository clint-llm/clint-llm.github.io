The TFL works in concert with the gluteus medius and minimus to medially rotate and abduct the hip, as well as assist in flexing the hip with the rectus femoris.

The gluteus maximus primarily serves to extend the hip, however, also contributes to hip abduction via the ITB tract. Again, the ITB is an extension of the tendinous insertions of these muscles, and a better understanding of each of their function, will, in turn, improve one's understanding of the biomechanics of the ITB.
