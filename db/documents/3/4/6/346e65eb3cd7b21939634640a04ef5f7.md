Patient monitoring includes HCV screening which should be performed at least annually and more frequently depending on specific circumstances including STD-related proctitis. In chlamydial or gonococcal proctitis, retesting for the respective pathogen should be performed three months after treatment. Counsel about safe sex practices, including condom use during every sexual encounter is important. CRP is rarely curable.
