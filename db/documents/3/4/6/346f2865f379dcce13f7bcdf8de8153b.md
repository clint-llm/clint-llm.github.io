TSS is most commonly caused by a toxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus or Group A Strep (Streptococcus pyogenes). Other strains of streptococci also produce superantigens, which can lead to TSS. The disease occurs most often in the setting of menstruation despite the discontinuation of high absorbency tampons. However, TSS can also present in non-menstrual settings such as in soft tissue infections, post-surgical infections, burns, retained foreign bodies such as nasal packing, and dialysis catheters. Staphylococcal TSS is typically the result of a localized infection such as an abscess, whereas streptococcal TSS may result from bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, or cellulitis.
