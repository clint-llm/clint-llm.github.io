Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini is a rare, cutaneous condition that causes dermal atrophy. Pasini described it in 1923 under the name of "progressive idiopathic atrophoderma." Pierini and Vivoli later further described it in 1936, suggesting its possible link to morphea. It presents as single or multiple, sharply demarcated, hyperpigmented, non-indurated patches with no obvious inflammatory signs. This activity describes the presentation, etiology, and pathophysiology of Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
