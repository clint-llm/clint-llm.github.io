An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach for the early diagnosis and treatment of miliary tuberculosis can help achieve the best possible outcomes for the patient. Well-structured history taking and early recognition of symptoms by the physicians, proper handling of the patient by the nurses, and adequate precautions being taken by the laboratory personnel for the samples provided for detection of tuberculosis are a must for stopping the spread of the disease in the hospital and community.

Early administration of antitubercular therapy under guidance, also described as DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course), is vital for the resolution of the disease, and prompt recognition of any side-effect of antitubercular therapy is essential. The pharmacist's role becomes vital in the management of antitubercular treatment-induced complications and the usage of modified doses and other drugs to continue the treatment with minimal adverse effects of the therapy.

Collaboration, shared decision-making, and communication are critical elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to disease evaluation and management.
