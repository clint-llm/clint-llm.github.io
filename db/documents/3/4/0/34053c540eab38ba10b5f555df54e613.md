In surgery, the knowledge of the anatomy of the mandible is valuable when it comes to the jaw or even oral surgeries. The inferior alveolar artery is the predominant blood supply to the mandible. If there is a compromise of the inferior alveolar artery, this could lead to necrosis of the mandible and structures perfused by the branches of the inferior alveolar artery.

In some situations, if there is uncontrolled hemorrhaging from the dental sockets on the lower jaw. The inferior alveolar artery can be embolized to achieve hemostasis and save the patient's life.
