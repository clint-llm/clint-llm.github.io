Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease historically known as bilharzia caused by the trematode of the genus Schistosoma. Estimates place the affected worldwide population for all forms of schistosomiasis at 230 million, with an estimated 700 million at risk.Schistosoma japonicum, S. haematobium, and S. mansoni. These species are primarily responsible for the 2 major forms of schistosomiasis, intestinal and urogenital.

Schistosoma haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS). Its name is derived from hematuria or bloody urine. It is a recognized carcinogen and the 2nd leading cause of bladder cancer worldwide. It is also an underdiagnosed cause of infertility and predisposes chronically infected individuals to HIV.

Schistosoma haematobium is prevalent in regions of Africa and the Middle East. The lifecycle of schistosomes is complex and involves both snail and human hosts. Spread is perpetuated by contact with affected water in endemic areas, making control and eradication difficult to achieve.
