Histologically, the heart is mainly composed of cardiomyocytes and connective tissue. Dense connective tissue with elastic fibers is present in the cardiac/fibrous skeleton. Certain stains, such as Masson's elastic trichrome stains, can help visualize these components. The pericardium subdivides into two layers, a superficial fibrous layer, and a deeper serous layer. The fibrous layer is composed of fibrous connective tissue. The serous layer further divides into two layers, an outer layer inseparable from the fibrous pericardium and an inner layer overlying the myocardium. Both of these layers are histologically the same, composed of a continuous layer of mesothelial cells with microvilli facing the pericardial cavity. The fibrous pericardium and the outer serous pericardium combined are known as the parietal pericardium. The inner serous pericardium, known as the visceral pericardium, is also part of the epicardium. In between the outer and inner serous layer is a potential space known as the pericardial cavity containing pericardial fluid, which is produced and reabsorbed by the microvilli on the mesothelial cells.

A large part of the cardiac wall is made up of the myocardium. Cardiomyocytes join together to make up this layer. These cardiomyocytes are striated like myocytes found in skeletal muscle. However, unlike skeletal muscle cells, they are branched, contain intercalated disks, and are usually mononucleated. They are also unable to regenerate. After an insult, such as a myocardial infarction, the necrotic area gets replaced by scar tissue. This histological change is evident under light microscopy as the fibrous component of the scar tissue is stained blue with Masson's elastic trichrome stain.

The endocardium consists of a single layer of endothelial cells lining the chambers of the heart. Occasionally, small amounts of smooth muscle can also be in the endocardium. Compared to the right atrium, the left atrium has a thicker endocardium because of high pressure from the pulmonary veins. The subendothelial layer, between the myocardium and endocardium, contain loose elastic tissue, collagen bundles, nerves, and occasionally blood vessel.

The conduction system consists of specialized myocardial cells and fibers that allow for the initiation and propagation of impulses. The SA node is composed of nodal (P) cells and transitional (T) cells. These cells are looks similar to myocardial cells but contain fewer myofibrils. Dense connective tissue insulates and separates this area from the rest of the atria. The atrioventricular (AV) node, situated next to the fibrous skeleton of the heart, has specialized muscle fibers that receive impulses from the SA node. Purkinje fibers, branches from the atrioventricular nodes, can be located within the epicardium. These fibers are rich in glycogen and also contain fewer myofibrils.

Valves have three layers: spongiosa, fibrosa, and ventricularis. Identifying these layers can help orient the valves on microscopy. The spongiosa is on the atrial side of atrioventricular valves or the arterial side of semilunar valves. Large amounts of proteoglycans, such as glycosaminoglycan, and loose connective tissue, are characteristic of the spongiosa layer.
