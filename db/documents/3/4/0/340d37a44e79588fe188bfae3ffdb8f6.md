The spine and the body function within a cone of equilibrium with the focus of maintaining sagittal and coronal alignment with minimum energy expenditure. This happens with a harmonious relationship involving cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and pelvic anatomy. The purpose is mostly to maintain a mechanical balance in the sagittal plane and coronal plane centered from the center of cranial mass, femoral heads, and lower extremities. Traditional scoliosis or spinal deformity surgery focused on coronal plane alignment. While the coronal plane is important, multiple studies have shown that restoring the balance in the sagittal plane confers more clinical relevance in terms of function and pain than in the coronal plane in deformity correction surgery. This activity examines when sagittal balance should be considered in differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate it. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with issues with sagittal balance.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the importance of sagittal balance as compared to coronal balance in the spine.
- Identify the various etiologies of improper sagittal balance as pertains to spinal alignment.
- Review treatment strategies for sagittal balance issues based on specific etiology.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected issues that affect or are affected by sagittal balance concerns.
