The prognosis for renal mass depends on the tumor identified. RCC accounts for about 15,000 deaths or 80% of kidney and renal pelvic cancers. As with most other cancer, the survival rate improves with early diagnosis and treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, the localized disease in stages 1 and 2 has an above 90% survival rate, while distant metastasis, such as in stage 4, has a 13% 5-years survival rate. In stage 3, the survival rate for patients who underwent nephrectomy is up to 70%. However, invasion into the renal vein indicates a poorer prognosis.

For other types of tumors, classical variant angiomyolipomas have a prolonged growth rate. In one case report, 90% of tumors with a size of less than 1.5cm have no growth over the five-year follow-up.

Oncocytoma is mostly benign and well organized compared to RCC. They are encapsulated and not invasive. However, RCC can be seen in up to 30% of patients who have oncocytoma. As a result, they should be closely monitored for renal malignancy.

A metanephric adenoma is mostly benign; however, they can present similarly to RCC in symptomatology. Patients can present with the classical triad of flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable mass. The critical difference is that they present more frequently in females than males, unlike their RCC counterparts. Histology is the primary way to diagnose this type of mass. Up to 90% of the adenoma have a BRAF V600 mutation.
