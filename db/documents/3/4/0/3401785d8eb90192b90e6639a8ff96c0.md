The clinical presentation of insulin resistance is variable with respect to both history and physical exam findings. It is dependent on the subset of insulin resistance present, duration of the condition, level of beta-cell function, and the individual’s propensity for the secondary illnesses due to insulin resistance. Common presentations include:

- The asymptomatic patients with obesity, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia

- Those with metabolic syndrome

- Prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus

- Those with symptomatic microvascular disease (retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy)

- Those with macrovascular disease (stroke, PAD, and CAD)

- Those with PCOS

- Those with type A or type B insulin resistance

- Elevated blood pressure

- Gender and race-specific increased waist circumference

- Those with xanthelasma or xanthomas

- The stigmata of PCOS (menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, acne, and alopecia)

- Acanthosis nigricans, a patchy velvety brown pigmentation around the neck axilla and groin regions.

- The stigmata of one of several genetic syndromes that include insulin resistance
