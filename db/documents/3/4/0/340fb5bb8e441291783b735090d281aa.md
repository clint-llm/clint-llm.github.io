Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS) refers to an array of neurological manifestations that are seen during or following dialysis. The symptoms can range from mild symptoms such as headache, nausea, or blurred vision, as well as other CNS symptoms such as restlessness and confusion, to severe manifestations with coma and seizures in rare cases. This activity reviews the epidemiology, clinical presentation, management, and prevention of DDS in patients undergoing dialysis. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome.
- Identify patients who are at risk of developing dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome.
- Outline the severe manifestations of dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome and its prevention and management.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome.
