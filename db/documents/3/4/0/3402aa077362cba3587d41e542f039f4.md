The primary complication of subfalcine herniation is the compromise of the blood flow through the anterior cerebral artery, resulting in ischemia in the frontal and parietal lobes. This ischemia and the progressing cerebral herniation will eventually lead to decreased consciousness, hemiparesis, respiratory difficulty, coma, and death. Seizures may result from ischemic tissue.
