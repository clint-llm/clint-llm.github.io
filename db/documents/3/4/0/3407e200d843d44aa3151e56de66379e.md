Quinoline derivatives have a multitude of side effects, including neural, retinal, gastrointestinal, and auditory toxicity. Quinoline derivatives are toxic to the auditory system, presumably due to the disruption of cochlear hair cells and the blockade of ion channels of neurons in the auditory system, causing hearing loss and tinnitus. In addition, it causes ataxia, tremor, and dystonic reactions. In a mouse study, a dopaminergic pathway to assess these symptoms was explored. It was found that quinine depolarized resting membrane potential gives a possible underlying mechanism for the movement disorders of cinchonism as well as a role in hearing loss and tinnitus.

There is also a role of retinal and optic nerve toxicity, causing permanent blindness in some. Originally, it was believed this was secondary to vasoconstriction; however, later studies allude to direct toxicity to the retina and optic nerve.

Toxicity with quinine derivatives can also occur in babies during pregnancy or after birthÂ due to the transplacental movement of the medication during pregnancy or exposure of the baby to the drug from breast milk.

Quinoline derivatives are rapidly absorbed with a 70% bioavailability. They are usually highly protein bound in adults but not as much in the pediatric population (hence increased risk in children).
