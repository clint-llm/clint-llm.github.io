Prevalence and frequency of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) are 8% and 1.1% to 16.7% of pregnancies, respectively. Different rates have been reported worldwide. Multiple factors are affecting the rates such as length of follow up in the postpartum period, iodine status of studied populations. In Thailand, the reported rate is 1.1%, whereas the incidence rate in Brazil is reported at 13.3%. Both of these regions have low iodine intake. Prevalence of postpartum thyroiditis in the high-risk group, including diabetes mellitus type 1 and positive family history, reported 19.1% and 20.0%, respectively. The recurrence risk of postpartum thyroiditis in a patient with the previous history of PPT is reported at 42.4%.
