Approximately 0.3% of newborns are affected by nevus sebaceus, and the incidence is equal between male and female patients. The disorder affects all races and ethnicities. Usually, nevus sebaceus appears as a solitary lesion at birth. Sometimes, it may not be identified until after puberty once its classical wart-like appearance has fully developed.
