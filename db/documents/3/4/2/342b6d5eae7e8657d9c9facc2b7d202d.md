The discovery of a white lesion on the oral mucosa can present a variety of challenges to the practitioner, as they can range from benign to malignant processes. The most common benign chronic white lesions are pseudomembranous candidiasis, erythema migrans, morsicatio buccarum, linea alba, leukoedema, and lichen planus. White lesions can be found anywhere in the oral cavity, but the above-mentioned lesions typically present either on the dorsal aspect of the tongue or on the buccal mucosa.
