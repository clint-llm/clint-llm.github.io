The exact etiology of EoE is unknown; however, it is thought to be a result of the interactions of environmental, genetic, and host immune factors. A food allergy may trigger EoE, but food anaphylaxis is a rare phenomenon among these patients. There is a strong correlation between atopy and EoE, with patients commonly reporting a history of chronic seasonal allergy, asthma, atopic dermatitis, or other allergic/immunologic conditions.
