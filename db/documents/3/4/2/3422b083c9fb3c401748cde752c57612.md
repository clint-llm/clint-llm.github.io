In the setting of an emergency laparotomy with an unstable patient, the surgeon may decide to temporarily close the abdomen to facilitate the resuscitation of the patient. The anatomy most relevant to temporary closure includes the following layers of the midline abdominal wall:

- Skin

- Subcutaneous tissue

- Superficial fascia

- The linea alba or midline of the rectus sheath (aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal oblique)

- Transversalis fascia

- Preperitoneal space

- Peritoneum

A key concept in temporary abdominal closure is to prevent the lateral retraction of the oblique musculature to preserve the ability to re-approximate the linea alba.
