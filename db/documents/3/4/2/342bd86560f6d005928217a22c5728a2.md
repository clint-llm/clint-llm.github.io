Many neurological conditions affect the CNS. They range dramatically in scope, impact, and nature of the effect. Some conditions can lead to progressively impaired movement such as in Parkinson disease. Huntington chorea and hemiballismus cause excessive movement among other symptoms. The demyelination in multiple sclerosis can cause acute attacks, and over time, chronicÂ degradation of function. Others may impact cognition such as the various dementias. Epilepsy can cause uncontrolled excitation. Headaches often impair the daily function of patients. Traumatic injuries can cause plegia or paresis and may result in any number of deficits depending on the location and extent of the lesion.
