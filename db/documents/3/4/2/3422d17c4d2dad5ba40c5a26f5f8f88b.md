LH deficiency results in infertility and absence of puberty. The patient must receive education about the underlying mechanism of the process. The patients and their families must understand that hormone replacement can help achieve puberty. For this purpose, hormone replacement must start as soon as the diagnosis of delayed puberty and the underlying cause is determined. Older men must be counseled for gonadotropin therapy for fertility and should also realize that response to therapy is varied. Fertility may or may not be achieved depending on their response and adherence to treatment.

Women with LH deficiency should receive estrogen replacement therapy. If they desire fertility, they should receive a referral to reproductive endocrinology.

Patients must be knowledgable about the side effects of hormone therapy.
