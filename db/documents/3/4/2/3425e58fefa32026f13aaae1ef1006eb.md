This activity aims to review "jersey finger" injuries. Jersey finger is a distal avulsion of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon from its insertion on the volar portion of the distal phalanx. This article highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of distal flexor digitorium tendon avulsion.
- Identify the indications for acute treatment of jersey finger injuries.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with jersey finger.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to reach an early diagnosis of a jersey finger and avoid chronic functional limitations with difficult treatment options.
