Daly et al. evaluated presenting symptoms of 134 patients diagnosed with BAC. Of those, 68% were asymptomatic at presentation, with 17% presenting with a cough. Unlike other NSCLCs, bronchorrhea or excessive airway secretions were more common in this subgroup (17%), as was nonspecific chest pain (10%). Copious frothy secretions up to a few liters per day have been reported to the extent of causing a fluid-electrolyte imbalance. Its presence usually portends a poor prognosis.
