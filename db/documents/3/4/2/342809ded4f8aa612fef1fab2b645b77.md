The radial artery commonly occurs as a bifurcation in the antecubital fossa at the level of the radial neck and continues distally in the anterior forearm. Literature has documented that the brachial artery has multiple physiologic variants. These include a high origin from the axillary artery or the brachial artery, under the pronator teres, or in some patients, a congenital absence.

Rodríguez-Niedenführ et al. refer to multiple terms used to refer to the concept of "high bifurcation."

The radial artery will sometimes lie superficial in the forearm rather than passing beneath the brachioradialis. This can be a source of injury if a caustic compound is infused into the artery by a physician who believes that the artery is the cephalic vein. It is imperative to palpate a blood vessel to ensure that it is a vein rather than an abnormally-placed artery. A superficial ulnar artery can also be present in some individuals.
