The differential for suspected retinal detachment includes:

- Retinoschisis

- Choroidal effusion

- Choroidal mass

- Suprachoroidal hemorrhage

The clinician can differentiate these with a dilated fundoscopic exam and appropriate imaging techniques. If the patient has a quadrantanopia or hemianopia in both eyes, a cerebrovascular event should be in the differential.
