Patients undergoing surgical procedures that require deep relaxation for long periods of time are best suited for general anesthesia as long as there are no contraindications. Surgeries that cannot be adequately anesthetized with local or regional anesthesia require general anesthesia. Operations likely to result in significant blood loss or in which breathing will be affected necessitate general anesthesia. Uncooperative patients are also better treated with general anesthesia, even for more minor procedures. Patient preference can also influence the decision to undergo anesthesia.
