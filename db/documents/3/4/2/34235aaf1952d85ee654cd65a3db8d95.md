The beta-1 receptor is an integral part of the normal function of the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system, more colloquially known as the ‘fight or flight’ system, is the body’s way of recruiting extraordinary function in a short amount of time. When a person experiences fear or extreme excitement, the body will quickly releases catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) that will target one of many receptors including the beta-1 receptor. By increasing heart rate and contractility, for example, the blood pumps faster throughout the body allowing a person to run faster, jump higher, and accomplish things not typically within their physiologic capacity for a short duration; it is a primary survival mechanism.

Day-to-day maintenance of blood pressure is accomplished with the constant opposition of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Baroreceptors

Although these are only two examples, the sympathetic nervous system, through the activation of adrenergic receptors, helps maintain a constant blood pressure.
