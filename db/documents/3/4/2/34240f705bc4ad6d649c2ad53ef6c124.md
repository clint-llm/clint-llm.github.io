- The characteristics of each category of hypoxemia are as follows:

- Hypoventilation presents with an elevated PaCO2 with a normal A-a gradient.

- Low-inspired oxygen presents with a normal PaC02 plus normal A-a gradient.

- Shunting presents with a normal PaC02 and elevated A-a gradient that does not correct with the administration of 100% oxygen.

- V/Q mismatch presents with a normal PaC02 and elevated A-a gradient that does correctly with 100% oxygen.

- Oxygen supplementation varies between FiO2 of 0.21 and 1.00. A variety of low and high flow devices exist to facilitate this process, each with unique advantages and disadvantages.

- The delivery of oxygen depends on two variables:

- FiO2

- Flow rate

- There are several devices designed to deliver oxygen at different rates and concentrations as described above.

- Oxygen toxicity may result if oxygen is delivered at a higher concentration for a long duration of time.

- Decreased body temperature decreases metabolic rate, which lowers oxygen consumption and minimizes the adverse effects of tissue hypoxia (especially brain) Therapeutic hypothermia is based on this principle.

- Long-term oxygen therapy can reduce mortality, and it is indicated in these patient populations:

- Group 1 (Absolute): PaO2 55 mm Hg or SaO2  88%

- Group 2 (In the presence of cor pulmonale): PaO2 55 to 59 mm Hg or SaO2 89%, ECG evidence of right atrial enlargement, hematocrit greater than  55%, congestive heart failure
