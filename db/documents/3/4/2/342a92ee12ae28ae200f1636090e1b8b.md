Since 1860, and more recently, in 1972, low carbohydrate (low-carb) diets have been a strategy for weight loss. Today, there continues to be an interest in low-carb approaches. While all low carbohydrate approaches reduce the overall intake of carbohydrates, there is no clear consensus on what defines a low-carb diet. There are three macronutrients—carbohydrates (4 kcal/gm), fat (9 kcal/gm), and protein (4 kcal/gm) found in food. Therefore, studies have defined low carbohydrate as a percent of daily macronutrient intake or total daily carbohydrate load. This article will define it as:

- Very low-carbohydrate (less than 10% carbohydrates) or 20 to 50 gm/day

- Low-carbohydrate (less than 26% carbohydrates) or less than 130 gm/day

- Moderate-carbohydrate (26% to 44%)

- High-carbohydrate (45% or greater)

For reference, the institute of medicine proposes Americans obtain 45% to 65% of calories from carbohydrates.
