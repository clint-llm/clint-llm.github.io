Patients diagnosed with hearing loss, vestibular schwannoma, or brainstem lesions on ABR should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, neurologists, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, pediatricians, and primary care physicians. Children with hearing loss should be immediately referred for hearing augmentation with hearing aids, cochlear implants, and/or speech rehabilitation to promote long-term speech and language outcomes. Long-term monitoring of childhood development should be monitored by the pediatrician with regular follow-ups with audiology for routine hearing aid and audiogram assessments. Formal peer support groups with hearing loss can aid children and parents in addressing their concerns. The school system should also be involved to provide an optimal learning environment for children with hearing impairments.

Patients with vestibular schwannoma or brainstem lesions will need a referral to otolaryngology, neurosurgery, and neurology to determine management. If resection of the brainstem lesion is recommended, intraoperative ABR by an audiologist can help preserve auditory function. If resection is not recommended, long-term monitoring by the primary care physician, neurologist, neurosurgery, and otolaryngologist is recommended.
