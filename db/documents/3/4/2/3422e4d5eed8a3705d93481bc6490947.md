Patient safety remains the priority in any event. The nurse should monitor the patient closely during and following a hypoglycemic episode. It is important to avoid leaving the patient unattended, due to the risks of worsening symptoms and the potential for falls.

In addition to patient safety, documentation is a key responsibility of the nurse with regard to reducing liability risks. Documentation should always be specific and clear to the reader. Following a hypoglycemic episode, the nurse should document glucose levels, signs and symptoms, actions performed, the patient's response to those actions, the name of the provider who was contacted, orders given and any events that preceded, followed or occurred during the time of the hypoglycemic episode. It is important to also document vital signs, any medications administered before, during or after. If the patient consumed a meal prior to the episode, this should also be documented. This will help cue the provider if the patient has possibly experienced postprandial hypoglycemia. Remember, if it hasn't been documented; the assumption is it hasn't been done.

Another key factor in reducing nursing liability risks is documentation of patient education. After appropriately educating the patient, the nurse should request the patient repeat the information back that was taught, also known as a "repeat back", or that the patient acknowledges understanding. The nurse should then document the education provided. For instance, document, "The patient verbalized understanding that a blood glucose level below 70 is considered low." An alternative is to document what the patient stated word for word. There may be instances when the patient may demonstrate an action, such as self-monitoring. This information should be documented.
