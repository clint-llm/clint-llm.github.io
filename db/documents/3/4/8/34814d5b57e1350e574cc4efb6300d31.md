Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disorder with no cure. It can affect many organs and leads to poor quality of life without appropriate management. Premature death is common for a variety of causes. To reduce morbidity and mortality, an interprofessional team should educate and manage patients with SLE.

The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on avoiding triggers that cause flare-ups. In addition, the patient should be told to avoid UV light and minimize exposure to the sun. Appropriate garments, sunglasses, and a wide brim hat are recommended when going out. The dietitian should educate the patient on the importance of a low-fat diet to prevent hyperlipidemia. In addition, because patients with lupus are told to avoid the sun, vitamin D supplements are recommended. The physical therapist should educate the patient on the importance of exercise. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance and avoiding smoking. The nurse practitioner should counsel the patient on family planning and contraception. Many drugs used to treat are teratogenic, and thus, contraception is highly recommended. Multispeciality involvement is often needed in managing and monitoring SLE. While the involvement of a rheumatologist is crucial, other specialties including dermatology, cardiology, neurology, pulmonology, ophthalmology, nephrology, gastroenterology, and gynecology may be needed. Close communication between the providers and the patient and family and consideration of patient preferences while deciding therapy is strongly recommended. [Level 5]
