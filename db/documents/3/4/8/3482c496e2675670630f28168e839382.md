Infectious endocarditis can be challenging to treat and often causes significant sequelae. Antimicrobial prophylaxis is given in certain situations before dental and oral surgery to avoid infective endocarditis. However, unnecessary antimicrobial administration can cause adverse events and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. This activity will explore the indications for antimicrobial prophylaxis in the context of dental and oral surgery, the microbiology of the oral cavity, and recommended antimicrobials and their administration. It will further delve into the data informing current recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis. It will conclude by exploring the topic of dental antimicrobial stewardship and the consequences of unneeded antimicrobial use in the field.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the rationale for antimicrobial prophylaxis in dental and oral surgery.
- Identify the indications for antimicrobial prophylaxis in dental and oral surgery.
- Review the microbiology of the oral cavity.
- Outline recommended regimens for antimicrobial prophylaxis and their administration.
