Pick disease, also known as frontotemporal dementia, is the most common cause of dementia in patients under 60 years of age and is the third most common cause of dementia in patients over 65 years old. This type of dementia is characterized by a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from those that affect the patient's personality to those that cause a decline in cognitive function. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Pick disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.
