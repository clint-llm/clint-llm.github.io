Because doxylamine is available over the counter, the risk of overdose is a concern.

Other common reactions to doxylamine include constipation, dysuria, urinary retention, blurred vision, and diplopia. Many of these can be attributed to the drug's anticholinergic effects.

Doxylamine and other first-generation histamine H1 receptor antagonists can bind to and inhibit muscarinic receptor signaling in other organ systems, resulting in systemic anticholinergic effects. This non-selective receptor binding can lead to various adverse effects such as flushing of the skin, anhidrosis, hyperthermia, hallucinations, mydriasis, delirium, and urinary retention.

Doxylamine is safe for use in breastfeeding in small, occasional doses. No known fetal harm exists based on human data when it was studied in combination therapy with pyridoxine. In longer-term or higher doses, doxylamine might decrease lactation, and it could cause drowsiness or other adverse effects on the breastfed infant.
