The goal is to remove the adenomatous polyps before progression to adenocarcinoma. Hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps cannot be differentiated without pathological evaluation. Thus all polyps are usually resected during colonoscopy and examined microscopically. Total colectomy is necessary if there is evidence of malignancy or lymph node metastasis.

Pseudopolyps, which harbor an intermediate risk of malignancy, might present with bleeding or cause additional complications such as obstruction. Although a broad spectrum of medical and surgical treatment approaches have gotten introduced, debate still exists about the treatment of choice.

Treatment of familial juvenile polyposis is the surgical approach and depends in part on the degree of rectal involvement. If the rectum is relatively spared, total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis may be performed with subsequent close surveillance of the retained rectum. If the rectum is carpeted with polyps, a total proctocolectomy is a more appropriate operation. These patients are candidates for ileal pouch-anal reconstruction to avoid a permanent stoma.

There are three different main surgical approaches known for the definitive treatment of those affected with familial adenomatous polyposis: total colectomy plus ileorectal anastomosis, total proctocolectomy with ileostomy, and restorative proctocolectomy with or without mucosectomy and ileal-pouch anal anastomosis.
