Patients with precocious pseudopuberty should be offered psychological and emotional support as the physical changes of puberty may lead to emotional distress. Affected patients are often subjected to higher societal expectations based on their physical maturity rather than their age. Parents and teachers, therefore, need to be counseled and reminded to maintain age-appropriate expectations. Patients who experience early puberty may start engaging in risk-taking behavior (drugs, alcohol use, ad sexual activity) at an earlier age and require age-appropriate sex education.
