Since rifampin can cause significant hepatoxicity, baseline liver function tests (LFTs) are recommended before starting the treatment. When symptoms of hepatotoxicity (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, worsening LFTs, pruritus) occur, the dose should be decreased, or rifampin should be stopped completely. Serial blood draws to monitor LFTs are recommended in these cases. With tuberculosis, guidelines establish that rifampin has to be stopped if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increases three times the upper limit of normal (with hepatitis symptoms like jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia) or five times (when asymptomatic).

The drug concentration levels of concomitantly administered medications are to be monitored regularly due to rifampin's ability to induce microsomal enzymes.
