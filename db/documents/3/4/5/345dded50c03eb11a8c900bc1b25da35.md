In the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which operates as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), controls emergency management. Initially, management of all disasters is at the local level via facility groups, police, fire, and EMS. Once local authorities become overwhelmed, the disaster management transitions to the state level, with FEMA acting as an assisting agency rather than an authoritative leader. FEMA organizes the nation and its territories into ten regions. The Citizen Corps is a volunteer organization that works to educate and train the public for emergency response. These services are performed locally and organized through DHS.

In the event of a terror-related disaster, the Secretary of Homeland Security starts the National Response Framework (NRF), which integrates federal resources with state and local resources for the management of resources at the lowest possible level.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides education and information regarding specific disaster types, including infectious diseases, chemical and radiation exposure, and natural disaster or weather-related incidents.
