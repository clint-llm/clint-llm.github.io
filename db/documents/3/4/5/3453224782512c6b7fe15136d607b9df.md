Hydrogen peroxide poisoning tends to be bimodal, as most household chemical ingestions are. Toxicity occurs in both young children and adults. Young children tend to be exposed accidentally to household concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.

Adults tend to have more severe exposures either due to intentional ingestion of higher quantities or accidental exposure to higher concentrations in an occupational setting. Toxicity in children is less likely to cause significant mortality or morbidity than in adults as it is often lower concentration solutions, often accidental, and more likely to be a less dangerous mode of exposure (i.e., topical). However, toxicity occurs at a much lower volume due to smaller patient sizes.
