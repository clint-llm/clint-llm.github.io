**Female Reproductive Organs**

**Ovaries**

- The ovaries are female gonads, the site of gametogenesis and the secretion of sex hormones. The outer cortex of each ovary is the site of follicular development, while the inner medulla of each contains blood vessels and connective tissue.

**Fallopian Tubes**

- The vulva describes the external female genitalia: labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vulvar vestibule, urethral meatus, and vaginal orifice.

- The vagina is a flexible, fibromuscular tubular structure extending from the vulvar vestibule to the uterine cervix. The distal vagina is the introitus. The anterior vagina abuts the posterior bladder wall, while the posterior vagina abuts the anterior rectum.

- The uterus consists of the corpus (body) and cervix. The superior aspect of the uterine corpus is the fundus, while the inferior portion adjacent to the cervix is called the isthmus/lower uterine segment. The uterine walls contain three distinct layers: the endometrium, myometrium, and the serosa. The endometrium lines the uterine cavity; its thickness and structure vary with hormonal stimulation. The myometrium consists of smooth muscle fibers and is the middle and thickest layer of the uterine wall. The serosa is the outermost lining of the uterus.

- The uterine cervix is a tubular structure contiguous with the uterine cavity and the vagina, acting as a conduit between the two. The inferior cervix opens into the upper vagina at the cervical os. The lining of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina is called the ectocervix and consists of stratified squamous epithelium. The lining of the inside of the cervical canal is the endocervix, composed of columnar epithelium. The region where the ecto- and endocervix meet, characterized by the transformation from columnar to squamous epithelium, is the transformation zone. The transformation zone is the most frequent location for cervical dysplasia and malignant transformation.

- Fallopian tubes provide a passageway for oocytes to travel from the ovaries into the uterine cavity. The part of each tube closest to the ovary contains fimbria: finger-like projections that help move the expelled oocyte further into the tube—the fimbria transition into the ampulla, the part of the tube with the widest lumen. The ampulla becomes the isthmus as the lumen narrows and projects towards the uterus. The tube then passes into the uterus, where it becomes the interstitial portion.
