The clinical complications of Castleman disease are dependant on the clinical and histopathological subtypes. A study was performed analyzing the clinical manifestations in 53 patients with CD, which revealed that only 32 developed complications involving the skin, hemopoietic and internal organs. paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) and lung abnormalities like bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) are the two most critical rare diseases occurring with the UCD.

In contrast,  hemopoietic (thromboembolic disorders and inflammatory reactions) and internal organ involvement (renal, hepatic) are mainly associated with MCD. The survival rate is significant in patients without these complications. Therefore, early diagnosis for these manifestations is necessary for tailoring appropriate therapy options, leading to a better prognosis.
