Histopathology of blue nevi varies by subtype, but general characteristics include a vertical wedge or bulbous shaped proliferation of spindle cells, dendritic melanocytes, and melanophages into a sclerotic dermis or subcutis. Histologic components of various nevi types, including blue nevus, may occur together and classify as a combined blue nevus. Additional features such as atypia increased mitotic rate, cell overcrowding, vascular invasion, and necrosis are suggestive of malignancy and more characteristic of blue nevus-like melanoma (BNLM).
