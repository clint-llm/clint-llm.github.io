This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ischemic cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify causes of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
- Describe the pathophysiology of ICM.
- Review the treatment modalities for ischemic cardiomyopathy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy and improve outcomes.
