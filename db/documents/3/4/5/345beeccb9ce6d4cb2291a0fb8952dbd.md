X-ray is often the first test utilized in SI joint injury. Weight-bearing anteroposterior views are usually all that is needed for the initial radiographic assessment of SI joint pain.

CT is utilized when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. Separately, CT of the pelvis with contrast evaluates for vascular and urogenital injures. CT is more sensitive than radiograph but inferior to MRI in detecting SI joint injury.

Local anesthetic blocks are a more invasive way to test SI joint pathology when the diagnosis is in question. An ultrasound or fluoroscopy-guided diagnostic injection assesses patient pain before the injection and directly following the injection allowing the physician to see if the pain was alleviated momentarily with short-acting anesthetics. A 75% reduction in pain is suggestive of SI joint pain. Patients who could benefit from an ultrasound-guided diagnostic injection include patients experiencing isolated SI joint pain or pain that is reproducible on three provocative tests.

Labs are a part of the assessment for possible inflammatory SI joint injury. When sacroiliitis is seen on pelvic x-ray, a CBC, CRP, and ESR are often part of the workup.
