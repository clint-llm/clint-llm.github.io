Cases of an acute red eye with painful diminution of vision must be thoroughly investigated.Â  These cases may initially present to general practitioners or optometrists. Cases of LIG should be referred to an ophthalmologist as surgery is usually required for definitive management. An aggressive IOP control strategy is needed before the lenticular extraction surgery and often requires topical and systemic medications. Post-surgery follow-up and visual rehabilitation are necessary, as intraocular inflammation and IOP elevation may require ongoing monitoring and management.
