Spinal osteotomy is an umbrella term for techniques used by spinal surgeons to correct spinal deformity. They can be performed on pediatric or adult patients. The purpose is to establish normal range spinal curvature, relieve pain, and improve quality of life. These can be broken down into posterior column osteotomy (PCO), including Ponte osteotomy and Smith-Petersen osteotomy (SPO), pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO), or vertebral column resection (VSR). The SRS-Schwab classification nomenclature grades osteotomies from 1 to 6 by the amount of bone or disc removal.
