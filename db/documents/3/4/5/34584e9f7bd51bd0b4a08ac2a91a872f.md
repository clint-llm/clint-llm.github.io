Life after myocardial infarction can be a challenge for the patients. The patients face challenges in keeping compliance with new medications, access, and adherence to medication and medication-related adverse effects that may impact patients socially and financially. As myocardial infarction is the leading cause of ventricular aneurysms, a post-MI treatment plan including patient education, communication, and exercise intends to improve patient outcomes, hospital admissions, complications, and myocardial recurrence infarction.

A commitment to cardiac rehabilitation consists of compliance to medication regimens, managing comorbidities, modifying lifestyle, including diet and weight-loss strategies, if required, and routine follow-up with primary health providers can improve patient outcomes and quality of life. All these culminate in helping the patients in preventing post-MI complications, namely ventricular aneurysms.
