ATDs can benefit a wide range of patients, from patients recovering from a stroke,

Some approaches to ATD assessment and matching include:

- The Human, Activity, Assistive Technology model (HAAT model)

- This is a model of practice that evaluates key considerations during the selection of ATDs. The HAAT model examines how ATDs are used in conjunction with individuals within the limitations of their environment.

- The Assistive technology service method (ATSM)

- This is a method based on the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) model. The ATSM includes an assessment of an individual, establishing a baseline of ability level, and development of a strategy for intervention. The ATSM method may also use the Assistive Device Classification (ATDC) tool to identify ATDs that may be beneficial to a patient passed on the gathered patient information.

- Matching person and technology (MPT)

- The MPT tool emphasizes that the approach to appropriate matching and use of ATDs is to consider the context, activity, and personal traits of the patient.

Appropriate matching of ATDs to patients is crucial because improperly ATDs can lead to nonuse or even harm to the patient or people in their surroundings.
