Patients with folic acid deficiency should be encouraged to eat a diet rich in green leafy vegetables and fruits. Folic acid supplementation at a dose of 1mg daily is usually sufficient to prevent folic acid deficiency in certain high-risk patient populations (bariatric surgery, malnutrition, chronic alcohol use, chronic hemolytic anemia, and conditions with high cell turnover). It is strongly recommended that women of childbearing age eat folate-rich foods, and receive at least 0.4 mg per day of supplemental folic acid to prevent pregnancy-related complications and fetal abnormalities, including neural tube defects
