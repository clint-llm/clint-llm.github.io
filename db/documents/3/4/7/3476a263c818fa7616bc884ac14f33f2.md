The classic mechanisms of posterior dislocation involve tonic-clonic seizures, electrical shock, or anterior-directed shoulder trauma (such as a grabbing the dashboard in a motor vehicle collision or falling on an outstretched hand). These injuries create forceful internal rotation, adduction, and flexion of the shoulder. Posterior dislocations can be subclassified into three anatomic types based on the final resting position of the humeral head: (1) subacromial, the most common, (2) subglenoid, and (3) subspinous. Posterior dislocations usually result in the humeral head being posterior to the glenoid and inferior to the acromion.
