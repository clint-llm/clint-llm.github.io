**Thiazide and Thiazide like diuretics:**mechanism of action for thiazide-type diuretics is not fully understood. Thiazides inhibit sodium transport in the distal tubule by blocking the Na/Cl channels.

**Calcium channel blockers: The**mechanism of action of CCBs is related to the inhibition of Ca2+ entry to the cells; this occurs by binding to the L-type voltage-gated calcium channels located in the heart muscle. This effect can cause peripheral vasodilation, which is seen mainly in dihydropyridines, or a negative inotropic effect on the heart muscle in non-dihydropyridines, inhibiting the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes leading to slow cardiac contractility and conduction.

**ACE inhibitors**decrease the blood pressure by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme; this causes a decline in the production of angiotensin II and increases the bradykinin level by inhibiting its degeneration, which leads to vasodilation.

**ARBs**work by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin 1 AT1 receptors, which inhibit the angiotensin II effect. In contrast to ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not affect the kinin levels.

**Beta-blockers**work by inhibiting the catecholamines from binding to the Beta 1, 2, and 3 receptors. Beta-1 receptors are found primarily in the heart muscle, beta-2 receptors are located in the bronchial and peripheral vascular smooth muscles, and beta-3 receptors appear in adipose tissue of the heart. Cardio-selective beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol succinate, metoprolol tartrate, atenolol, betaxolol, and acebutolol) inhibit only beta-1 receptors, causing fewer bronchospasms. By inhibiting the catecholamines binding to the beta receptors, the beta-blockers have a negative inotropic effect, which results in vasodilation of coronary and peripheral arteries and decreases the heart rate, which helps to reduce the oxygen consumption.

**Loop diuretics**work by increasing the sodium exertion at the level of the medullary and cortical aspects of the thick ascending limb. This action causes a decrease in volume, which leads to decreased blood pressure.

**Potassium Sparing Diuretics:**Act on the principal cells in the late distal tubule and the collecting duct; they inhibit the sodium reabsorption at this level in association with decreased excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions.****Spironolactone and eplerenone****are considered mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, inhibiting the mineralocorticoid receptor.

**Hydralazine**is an arteriolar vasodilator; it inhibits Ca2+ release in the smooth muscles of the vessels by decreasing its cytoplasmic concentration.

**Clonidine**: stimulates alpha-2 receptors located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, which reduces the sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and decreases plasma norepinephrine levels leading to decreased cardiac output.

**Minoxidil**is an arteriolar vasodilator; it opens the adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels located in the smooth muscles of the vessels.

**Alpha-blockers**act by inhibiting alpha-1 receptors, which decrease vascular smooth muscle contractions, leading to vasodilation.
