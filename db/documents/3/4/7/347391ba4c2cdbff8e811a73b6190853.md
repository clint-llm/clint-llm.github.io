Studies agree that the duration of PPS use, which correlates strongly with cumulative exposure to PPS, might be the most important risk factor for developing PPSM.

As alluded to previously, these studies include patients from when they are diagnosed as having PPSM, not when they become symptomatic, so the onset of the disease is likely earlier.

The daily dose and dose per unit of body weight are also not infrequently discussed as potential enablers of toxicity. Regarding the former, in one study, a higher mean daily dose was found among affected patients (445 g vs. 302 g).
