Other lung sounds that can be mistaken for or that overlap with wheezes are rhonchi and stridor. Rhonchi share similar characteristics to wheezes, with the main difference being a lower dominant frequency of fewer than 200 MHz. This lower frequency is described as a snoring-like sound. Stridor is a higher-pitched and higher amplitude sound due to turbulent airflow around a region of upper airway obstruction. It is typically an inspiratory sound that is far more pronounced when auscultated over the trachea than the thorax.

Possible causes of wheezing include:

- Allergies

- Anaphylaxis

- Asthma

- Bronchiectasis

- Bronchiolitis

- Bronchitis

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Emphysema

- Epiglottitis

- Foreign object

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

- Heart failure

- Lung cancer

- Drugs (i.e., aspirin)

- Obstructive sleep apnea

- Pneumonia

- Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

- Respiratory tract infection

- Smoking

- Vocal cord dysfunction
