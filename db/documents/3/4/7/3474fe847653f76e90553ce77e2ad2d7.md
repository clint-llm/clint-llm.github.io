Research has identified various microorganisms as the causing agents of this eye disease, such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, viral infections, and bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract and the skin.

Etiology of ophthalmia neonatorum classifies as either sexually transmitted bacteria, non-sexually transmitted bacteria, viral, and chemical. Neisseria gonorrhea accounts for less than 1% of ophthalmia cases worldwide; however, in babies born to mothers infected with N. gonorrhoeae, up to 48% develop ophthalmia neonatorum; in rare cases, if untreated or inadequately treated, meningitis and septicemia may develop. Non-sexually transmitted bacteria, like Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcal species, gram-negative bacteria, and Haemophilus, account for 30 to 50% of ophthalmia cases. Adenovirus and herpes simplex virus are the most common causes of viral conjunctivitis.
