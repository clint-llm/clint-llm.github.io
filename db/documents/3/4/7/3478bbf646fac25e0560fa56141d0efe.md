Treatment involves recognition of the lesion followed by complete excision. Because of its potentially benign gross appearance, a fibroepithelial tumor of Pinkus may be an under-recognized and under-reported condition. Electrodesiccation and curettage of the lesion may be effective, but since this is a rare and likely under-recognized tumor, evidence for the efficacy of these treatments is not available. Mohs surgery has been performed for this type of tumor and is indicated if the anatomic location on the body limits clear margins. There is no role for chemotherapy or radiation. FEP has not been reported to result in patient death.
