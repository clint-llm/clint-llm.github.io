MAOIs have high oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations peak within two to three hours. They irreversibly bind monoamine oxidase (except for moclobemide), removing the drug from circulation and making blood concentrations not indicative of effect. It takes two to three weeks to synthesize enough new monoamine oxidase, so clinical effects of MAOIs may last for that amount of time. MAOIs are metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.
