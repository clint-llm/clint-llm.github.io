**Benefits of Monoclonal Therapy**

The major benefits derived from monoclonal antibody therapies appear to be reduced viral load, hospitalizations, and death. Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the treatment of many diseases, including infections such as COVID-19.

Monoclonal antibodies are safe and effective and can be used as preventive and therapeutic tools.

They were able to identify 453 neutralizing antibodies, the most potent of which recognized the spike protein RBD. The "extremely potent" monoclonal antibodies (mAb) allowed for lower quantities of antibodies to reach target efficacy with decreased cost and sustainable manufacturability.

**Risks of Monoclonal Therapy**

A potential complication of human mAbs use against viral pathogens is that it may promote selection for escape mutants.

Since late 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutated drastically, accumulating several mutations and deletions in the binding domains of various mAb.

Other risks involve potential adverse reactions. Infusion-related reactions are potential complications of monoclonal antibody use.

Monoclonal antibody therapy is not indicated in severe COVID-19 illnesses requiring hospitalization.
