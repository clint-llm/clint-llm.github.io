Capsule endoscopy, also known as wireless capsule endoscopy or video capsule endoscopy,Â is a gastrointestinal study that uses a pill camera to take images of the intestinal lumen. The first capsule endoscopy was performed in 1999, and the US Food and Drug Administration approved its use in the United States in 2001. The M2A capsule (mouth to anus) was the first available pill camera and was eventually renamed as PillCam SB (small bowel). The capsule is ingested and transmits images at 2 to 6 frames per second over the course of 8 to 12 hours until the battery expires. It generates 512 by 512-pixel, high-resolution images that allow detailed inspection of the gastrointestinal mucosa. A trained gastroenterologist then reviews the images. Battery life can be a limiting factor during capsule endoscopies, and 16.5% of studies are incomplete due to battery expiration. Capsule endoscopy is a diagnostic procedure and has no therapeutic benefits. It can only localize lesions in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon but cannot be used for biopsy or therapy. It is used most often for recurrent and obscure gastrointestinal bleeding after traditional endoscopic procedures have failed to identify a bleeding source. It can be a useful study for localizing a lesion prior to angiography, surgery, or further endoscopic procedures. The diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy has been found to be higher than small bowel barium studies, CT enteroclysis, angiography, and push enteroscopy.
