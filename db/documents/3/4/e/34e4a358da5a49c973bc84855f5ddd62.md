The incidence quoted is variable worldwide but is often approximately 1 in 1000 births. A retrospective study of 13,701 antenatal scans in Turkey found an incidence of pelvic kidneys of 1 in 571, although this study only included scans with a normal amniotic fluid volume.

A Taiwanese study screening 132,000 school children found a lower incidence of only 1 in 5000, but it is thought this may have underestimated the actual incidence due to the screening method used.
