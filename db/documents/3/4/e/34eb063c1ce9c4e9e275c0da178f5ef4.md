Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs that act upon benzodiazepine receptors (BZ-R) in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines are especially important in the cessation of seizure activity, as 1% to 2% of emergency department visits annually in the United States are for seizures. Indications for benzodiazepine administration include but are not limited to anxiety disorders, insomnia, acute status epilepticus, induction of amnesia, spastic disorders, seizure disorders, and agitation. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, safe administration, adverse effects, contraindications, toxicology, and monitoring of the broad array of physiological possibilities when using benzodiazepines in the clinical setting.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs.
- Identify the FDA-approved indications for benzodiazepines.
- Review the adverse events of the benzodiazepines class of medicines.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with benzodiazepines, leading to optimal patient outcomes and minimizing adverse events.
