The superior ophthalmic vein (SOV) approach for embolization of carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) was first described over 25 years ago. Carotid-cavernous fistulas are typically divided into four subtypes, defined by etiology and nature of the lesion. This activity describes the pathophysiology of carotid cavernous fistula and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review indications for endovascular treatment of carotid cavernous fistulas.
- Summarize the relevant orbital anatomy for superior opthalmic vein cannulation.
- Describe the surgical technique to dissect the orbit and identify the superior ophthalmic vein safely.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the treatment of carotid cavernous fistula and improve patient outcomes.
