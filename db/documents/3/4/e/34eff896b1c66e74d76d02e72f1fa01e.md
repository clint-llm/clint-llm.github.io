The KB test is highly specific, with low sensitivity, having a threshold of 5 mL of FMH to be positive. Keep in mind that the amount of FMH to cause isoimmunization is only 0.01 mL to 0.03 mL. As such, it is not a test to determine if there is FMH, but rather to better estimate the amount of FMH. If positive, it is used to determine additional Rho(D) immune globulin dosing over the standard 150 or 300 mcg dosage that should be administered.
