A posterior suboccipital approach may be used when considering surgery for various diseases involving the cerebellum, spinal cord, or atlantoaxial joint. Understanding the relationship between neurovascular structures within the suboccipital region is crucial before surgery to avoid life-threatening injury. The suboccipital muscles form a suboccipital triangle, which can be used as a consistent marker for the location of the vertebral artery and suboccipital nerve.

The suboccipital triangle is outlined by the rectus capitis posterior major, obliquus capitis superior, and obliquus capitis superior. The third portion of the vertebral artery courses horizontally as it moves throughout the suboccipital triangle. Other landmarks that can be utilized during a posterior surgical approach include the spinous process of C2, the posterior arch of C1, and the transverse processes of C1/C2.

The midline suboccipital approach is a versatile neurosurgical technique. It is commonly used within pediatric neurosurgery as an approach to posterior fossa tumors but can also be employed to access Chiari malformations, vascular lesions, tumors of the foramen magnum, and those exiting the brainstem, such as hypoglossal nerve sheath tumors.
