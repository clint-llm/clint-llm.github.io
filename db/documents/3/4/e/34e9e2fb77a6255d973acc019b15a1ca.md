Continuous laboratory monitoring is not necessary for patients on simvastatin therapy. To gauge therapeutic effectiveness, a lipid profile is evaluated four weeks after initiation and periodically after that leading to potential dose adjustments. Liver function tests are also performed at baseline and subsequently, as clinically necessitated, to evaluate liver toxicities. Common symptoms include abdominal pain, yellowing of the skin, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Creatine kinase levels are also assessed at baseline and periodically after that, especially in high-risk patients such as those with renal insufficiency. Patients with complex medication profiles (polypharmacy) require close monitoring for musculoskeletal and hepatic complaints due to potential simvastatin toxicities and possible drug-drug interactions.
