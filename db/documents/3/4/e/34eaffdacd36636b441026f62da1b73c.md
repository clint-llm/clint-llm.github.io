There have been significant advances in the patient management of breast cancer patients since Halsted first described his radical surgery in the late 1800s. There has been a growing trend toward breast conservation, and numerous studies have looked at the efficacy of breast-conserving surgery when compared to standard mastectomy techniques. With the addition of adjuvant therapies, including radiation and systemic treatment with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, rates of mastectomy have declined. Twenty-year follow up data from NSABP-06 shows no difference in disease-free survival or overall survival in patients randomized between modified radical mastectomy, lumpectomy with axillary dissection, and radiation or lumpectomy and axillary dissection alone.
