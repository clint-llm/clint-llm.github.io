The HLA (human leukocyte antigens) complex is located on the short arm of chromosome 6.en bloc from each parent due to their close proximity resulting in their close physical linkage. The HLA haplotype is a combination of linked HLA genes (HLA-A, -B,-C,-DR, -DQ,-DP) transmitted on a single parental chromosome.****HLA complex is known to be highly polygenic as it is composed of many genes, which can divide broadly into three categories: Class I, Class II, and Class III.
