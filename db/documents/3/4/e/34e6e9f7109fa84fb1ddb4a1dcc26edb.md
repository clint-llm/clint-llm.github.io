Use of phentermine/topiramateÂ is contraindicated in individuals who are suffering from glaucoma, those who have shown hypersensitivity to any part of the combination drugs, those with a history of hyperthyroidism, women who are pregnant, and those who have recently used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor as it may lead to hypertensive crisis.

The inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane, desflurane, and sevoflurane are to be used cautiously in patients taking phentermine/topiramate as the risk for ventricular tachycardia increases.

The use of phentermine/topiramate is contraindicated when patients are on a current regimen of isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, procarbazine, or transdermal selegiline due to the risk of hypertensive episodes.

Phentermine-topiramate can cause dangerous interactions with drugs. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can cause serotonin syndrome when combined with phentermine/topiramate. This can lead to high body temperature, agitation, sweating, tremors, dilated pupils, hyperreflexia, and diarrhea. In severe cases, this could be life-threatening, especially with seizures, high fever, irregular heartbeat, and unconsciousness.
