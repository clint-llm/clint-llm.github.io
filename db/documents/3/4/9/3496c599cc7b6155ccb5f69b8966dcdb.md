Healthcare workers (including the primary care physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners) who prescribe oxybutynin should be familiar with its adverse effect profile. The adverse reactions of oxybutynin are often dose-related. Patients should be monitored for anticholinergic side effects related to the central nervous system, including hallucinations, agitation, confusion, and somnolence. These adverse reactions are particularly important in elderly patients and within the first few months of treatment or after increasing the dose of oxybutynin.

Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation and counsel patients on an increased risk of drowsiness with concomitant alcohol use. Patients should also be counseled that taking oxybutynin in a high-temperature environment may lead to heat prostration, manifesting as fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating. Nursing should verify the patient understanding of medicine and check the dose before administration to the patient. Open communication among interprofessional team members can improve efficacy and safety outcomes for patients treated withÂ oxybutynin. [Level 5]
