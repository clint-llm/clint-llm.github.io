Short ciliary muscles that arise from the ciliary ganglion innervate the ciliary muscle. The ciliary ganglion is a parasympathetic ganglion that is located behind the eye and contains about 2500 neurons.  These parasympathetic fibers arise from cranial nerve V, also known as the nasociliary nerve of the trigeminal. Activation of the M3 muscarinic receptors, acetylcholine receptors that are formed by G-protein complexes, trigger the contraction of the ciliary muscle and reduce the diameter of the ciliary muscle ring. Contraction allows the zonular fibers to relax and the lens becomes more spherical to improve near vision.
