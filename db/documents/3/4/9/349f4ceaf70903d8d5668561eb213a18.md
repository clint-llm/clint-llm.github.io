The Allen test may be performed with only a clinician's hands, although in some cases, a Doppler probe placed on the thenar eminence or a pulse oximeter placed on theÂ thumb may be helpful, particularly if a patient exhibits Reynaud's phenomenon with cool and pale hands at baseline. Intraoperatively, an Acland microvascular clamp and a Doppler probe may be used to confirm preoperative Allen test results prior to ligation of the radial artery.
