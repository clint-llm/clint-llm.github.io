Relapsed or refractory MM patients on treatment are monitored closely; the relapsed disease is usually diagnosed with an increase in the M-protein or free light chains only, called biochemical progression. During follow-up visits and even after achieving complete remission, patients may present with a wide range of symptoms, varying from general fatigue to more complex manifestations such as widespread metastasis, requiring careful assessment and management by clinicians. Thorough history taking, regular physical examinations, and targeted testing specific to multiple myeloma are crucial in facilitating early diagnosis and effective treatment planning for patients. The most commonly reported symptoms include bone pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

In the early stages, patients with multiple myeloma may appear physically healthy, while those with advanced disease may present as visibly ill. Patients can have severe pancytopenia, bone fractures even from minor trauma, hypercalcemia, and frequent infections due to the compromised immune system.

Clinicians face challenges in managing the effects of relapsed and treatment-resistant diseases on patients' physical and mental health, emphasizing the need for continuity of care and regular follow-up visits with the myeloma care team. This approach helps identify and address relapse or resistance to the ongoing drug regimen for multiple myeloma patients, promoting a holistic approach to their care.
