Studies related to these entities are rare since these are emergency cases that require a quick course of action. However, from the information available, early recognition and treatment are critical. This requires suspicion from all healthcare providers, especially those who encounter patients first (primary care physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants). All should be familiar with these entities and at least consider them in differential diagnosis; therefore,Â clinicians may recognize the patients quickly and be able to manage them promptly. Whenever there is doubt about the diagnosis, consult a neurosurgeon as soon as possible.
