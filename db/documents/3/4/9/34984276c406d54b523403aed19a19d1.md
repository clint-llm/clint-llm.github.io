The atlantoaxial joint is a type of synovial joint that is classified as a biaxial, pivot joint. This joint resides in the upper part of the neck between the first and second cervical vertebrae, also known as the atlas and axis, respectively. The pivot joint classification means that it allows for rotation only and is formed by a central pivoting, bony structure that rotates around craniovertebral ligaments.
