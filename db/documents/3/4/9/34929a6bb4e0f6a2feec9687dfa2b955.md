Within uterine development, Mullerian duct abnormalities can be present. These can include incomplete fusion of the Mullerian ducts during embryogenesis, leading to abnormal uterine development. There are also a host of acquired uterine conditions that can occur in any of the three uterine layers but most commonly target the endometrium and myometrium. In acquired or congenital uterine abnormalities, patients can either appear symptomatic or have associated complications such as infertility, recurrent miscarriages, and prematurity.
