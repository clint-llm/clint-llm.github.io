Benzodiazepines are among the most prescribed medications for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Unlike long-acting benzodiazepines (over 24 hours), short (0 to 6 hours), and intermediate (6 to 24 hours), benzodiazepines do not undergo oxidation by the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, short-intermediate-acting benzodiazepines like oxazepam are in an active form and undergo direct glucuronidation to produce inactive metabolites.

Benzodiazepines bind to GABA-A receptors, which consist of ligand-gated chloride ion channels that mediate inhibition of the synapses in the CNS. Benzodiazepines bind as allosteric modulators and increase the number of chloride ions crossing the cell membrane. Once benzodiazepines bind to the receptor, the GABA receptor changes conformation and has an increased affinity for GABA. This conformational change causes an increased frequency in opening chloride ion channels and, subsequently, hyperpolarization of the neuronal cell membrane occurs, resulting in a decreased rate of firing of the synapse.

Oxazepam is a short-acting benzodiazepine metabolized via glucuronidation out the liver into its inactive metabolites; hence it is a preferred drug in patients with hepatic impairment. It does not have any active metabolites. The drug has a rapid onset of action and an elimination half-life of between 3 to 21 hours. Elimination is via the renal pathway. Oxazepam is not subject to CYP interaction and does not accumulate upon CYP inhibition.
