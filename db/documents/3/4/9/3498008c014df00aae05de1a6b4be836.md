- Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) is a transitory immunodeficiency of childhood characterized by low (at least two standard deviations) IgG levels.

- THI typically presents during the first year of life with recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

- Atopy is a common manifestation.

- The primary differential diagnoses include X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency.

- The diagnosis of THI confirmed retrospectively when IgG levels have returned to expected levels.

- Antibiotic prophylaxis and immune globulin replacement therapy may be necessary for patients with severe and recurrent infections.
