Upon metabolism, a glycol ether (GE) is broken down to its respective acetoacetates or organic acids, which mediates the pathogenesis. This section separates the various pathological process by system.

**Renal**

Diethylene glycol (DEG) is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) to 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA) and diglycolic acid (DGA). HEAA is thought to be the toxic metabolite producing metabolic acidosis. DGA accumulates in the renal cells, resulting in delayed renal failure after 2 to 6 days. The proposed mechanism is that DGA enters the nephron via the sodium-dicarboxylate-1 transporter.

Additionally, it is thought that DGA selectively inhibits succinate dehydrogenase without directly affecting other isolated processes in the citric acid cycle. Ultimately, by lowering the available intermediates for the citric acid cycle, DGA disrupts oxidative phosphorylation, which reduces ATP production and general energy, thus producing proximal tubal necrosis.

**Neurological**

DEG also results in severe neurological disturbances such as peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy that resemble ethanol intoxication. The exact pathophysiology of DEG-associated neurotoxicity is not well elucidated. However, spinal fluid analysis in patients with DEG toxicity suggests that it may be DGA mediated. Also, neurotoxicity is more common in patients who develop nephrotoxicity.

Case reports demonstrated demyelinating peripheral neuropathies in patients with DEG toxicity. Animal studies on ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE) exposures suggest that neurotoxicity is caused by reduced antioxidant activity and increased lipid peroxidation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. A study found that GEs with lipophilic properties decreased antioxidant capacity, increased lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activity, and induced oxidative stress in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. In contrast, the hydrophilic GEs showed no adverse effects.

**Hepatic**

Glycol ethers are hepatically metabolized to their respective toxic metabolites. Hepatic injury is primarily through mitochondrial damage, production of reactive oxygen species, and decreased cellular metabolism. It is believed that oxidative stress upon exposure to a GE is not a direct effect of the compound or its metabolite but is caused by the induction of hemolysis and iron deposition in the liver. Kupffer cells promote this process upon activation by the Fenton/Haber-Weiss reactions, which result in TNF-alpha production.

Studies have shown that di-ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (DiEGME) and ethylene glycol monomethyl (EGME) increase microsomal protein concentrations and induce hepatic enzymes. Specifically, DiEGME increased cytochrome P-450 but not cytochrome b5 or NADPH-cytochrome c reductase.

EGME, on the other hand, had the opposite effect. It is unclear why particular glycol ethers are specific for certain hepatic enzymes, like their nephrotoxic effects and glycol ether hepatotoxic effects correlated with the concentration of DGA. These biochemical changes may manifest as hepatic steatosis and abnormal aminotransferases due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the liver. Some studies have concluded that patients with underlying liver disease would have less functional ADH to produce toxic metabolites, creating a less severe clinical presentation.

**Reproductive**

Furthermore, glycol ethers can also cause reproductive and neurodevelopmental toxicity. Numerous animal studies demonstrated changes in testicular weight, edema, and tubular atrophy. Routine exposure to glycol ethers resulted in a reduction in sperm maturation steps.

Daily administration of the GE, 2-Methoxyethanol (2-ME) to pregnant mice resulted in delayed neurogenesis and morphogenesis, specifically neural tube close and limb and digit formation. Researchers determined that the metabolism of the GE to its acetic acid was a pivotal step in causing teratogenicity. The organic acid 2-methoxyacetic acid (MAA) gets incorporated into the metabolic pathways involved in embryogenesis. During this process, MAA gets converted into a thioester by Coenzyme A, a similar step to acetate, turning into acetyl CoA, an intermediate in the TCA cycle.

Researchers found that when carbon labeled MAA was added to embryonic cultures, carbon labeled CO2 was excreted.

**Hematology**

Glycol ether toxicity has been identified as a potential cause of hematological injury, mainly due to acute exposure to butoxyethanol (BE). Studies have indicated that animal glycol ether exposure has led to hemolysis, associated with hemoglobinuria, leukopenia, and decreased bone marrow cellularity. Further investigation has revealed that beta-aminolevulinic acid (BAA) production is a critical factor in the induction of hemolysis.

In addition, in vitro animal studies have demonstrated a time- and concentration-dependent hemolytic effect, preceded by a decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and swelling of erythrocytes. Although the underlying mechanisms remain fully understood, the erythrocyte membrane may be the site of damage. Another possibility is that reactive oxygen species generated by the parent glycol ethers cause lipid peroxidation.

**Lymphatics**

Early animal studies investigated the immune system of male rats after four-day exposure to EGME through dermal application at doses of 150 to 1200 mg/kg/day. The results revealed a decline in thymus weight across all amounts and spleen weight at higher doses. In addition, lymphoproliferative responses were enhanced at 1200 mg/kg/day. However, after oral administration of EGME for four days, the antibody response was diminished at 300 and 600 mg/kg/day. This immunosuppressive response was blocked with the administration of fomepizole, suggesting that MAA is primarily responsible for mediating this process.

In a follow-up study, the impact of low and high-dose MAA on the immune system was explored, and it was discovered that immune suppression occurred only at lower doses, not higher doses. This suggests that MAA availability might not cause immune suppression in rats at high doses.

**Dermatology**

Glycol ethers are a type of solvent easily absorbed through the skin. Several factors, including molecular weight, influence the rate of this absorption. Lower molecular weight glycol ethers have resulted in higher absorption levels, with a lag time of 1.5 to 2 hours observed in human experiments.

The presence of other additives and mixtures may also impact the absorption of GEs. For example, a study showed that an aqueous mixture of BE was absorbed six times more efficiently than a pure GE solvent, with a corresponding increase in apparent permeability coefficient as the GE concentration in water decreased.

The concentration of these enzymes is generally higher in dermatomal skin compared to generalized skin. Additional research is required to understand the dermatological toxicity of GEs better.
