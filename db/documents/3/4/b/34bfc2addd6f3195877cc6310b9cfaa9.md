Rupture of the papillary muscle can occur following acute myocardial infarction as well as following traumatic injury.

As previously described, the posteromedial papillary muscle often has perfusion by only one vessel. Accordingly, the rupture of the posteromedial papillary muscle occurs more commonly than that of the anterolateral papillary muscle.

Blunt trauma leading to papillary muscle rupture has appeared in multiple case reports. It should be a consideration when a new murmur or elevated cardiac enzymes present following severe trauma.
