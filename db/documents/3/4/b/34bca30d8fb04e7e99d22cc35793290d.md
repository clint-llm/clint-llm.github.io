The epidemiology of vitamin B12 deficiency is complex due to its multiple etiologies. Generally, vitamin B12 deficiency is more common in the elderly, and its prevalence increases with age. A study on the survivors of the Framingham heart study showed 5% of elderly patients aged 67 to 96 years had low vitamin B12 levels, and an additional 6% had a functional deficiency indicated by high methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels.

In developed countries, vitamin B12 is uncommon in children but can affect breastfeeding infants whose mothers are vegan or B12 deficient. In developing regions such as Latin America, the Indian Subcontinent, and certain parts of Africa, a higher prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been observed. For example, a study conducted in Latin America concluded that approximately 40 % of children and adults have either marginal or low vitamin B12 levels.

Few studies have estimated the proportion of patients with cobalamin deficiency with clinical or radiological findings of subacute combined degeneration. A case series conducted on cobalamin deficient patients with clinical signs of subacute combined degeneration showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings consistent with the diagnosis in 14.8 % of cases.
