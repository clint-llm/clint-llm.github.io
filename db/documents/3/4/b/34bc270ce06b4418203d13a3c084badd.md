Therapeutic management must be part of an interprofessional approach. The dermatologist is usually the primary care physician, who makes the diagnosis. Dermatology nurses and nurse practitioners monitor patients, provide education to patients and their families, and inform the team about changes in status. After that, depending on the type ofÂ CL, the mode of transmission and the clinical examination data, the patient will be referred to other specialists for somatic examination and searching other associated visceral manifestations. The patient should be regularly followed-up.
