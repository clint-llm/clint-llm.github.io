The most feared complication of untreated spinal cord compression from any source is an irreversible neurologic deficit, including paralysis, gait impairment, sensory loss, urinary and fecal incontinence, or retention.

Surgical complications following spinal cord decompression are variable, but include iatrogenic spinal cord or nerve root injury, durotomy with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid leak, epidural hematoma, wound infection, and nonunion. These must be weighed against the perceived benefits of operative decompression, taking into account each patient's age, comorbidities, duration, and severity of symptoms.

In patients treated with conservative treatment, there is a possibility of acute paraplegia as a consequence of subtle occlusion of arteries that sustain the spinal cord.Â This is more possible in older patients with atherosclerosis.
