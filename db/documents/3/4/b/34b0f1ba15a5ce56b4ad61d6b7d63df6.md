Humans are homeotherms, which means we are organisms capable of maintaining our body's temperature in a specific range. While baseline body temperature is between 36.5 to 37.5°C (97.7 to 99.5°F), the body has mechanisms to address temperatures between approximately 35 to 41°C (95.0 to 105.8°F), after which it can no longer self-regulate and compensate for external thermal loads. The body’s core temperature is the sum of metabolic heat production, mechanical work, and heat exchange with the environment. A balance between internal and external variables (e.g., levels of metabolically active hormones, external temperature and humidity, and the amount of environmental convection) affects the body to cause either a net gain or a net loss of temperature. Heat exchange with the environment occurs through evaporative, convective, conductive, and radiative loss.

This process is monitored and affected through sensory receptors. Thermoreceptors found in the skin, organs, and spinal cord relay information via afferent nerve fibers to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus.
