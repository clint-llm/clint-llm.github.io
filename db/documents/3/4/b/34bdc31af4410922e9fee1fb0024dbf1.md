The mechanism of injury is critical in delineating clinical pathology.

- hand dominance

- occupation and current working status

- athletic participation (including sport-specific position)

- history of prior fracture or injury

- Patients may present with many potential preexisting deformities, which may warrant further questioning regarding previous interventions or surgeries. The provider should also document baseline functional status (e.g., chronic stiffness, deformity, or other limitations)

A thorough examination of the entire hand and digits is imperative.

It is imperative to identify rotational deformity in suspected metacarpal fractures. The rotational deformity can be diagnosed by observing for overriding of the fingers at the time of presentation.

- presence of symmetry or asymmetry between the normal and afflicted sides

- inability to make a full fist secondary to stiffness and/or pain

- rotational alignment when making a fist

- the provider can assess rotation by passively guiding the finger as the patient can tolerate
- the tips of all digits should point toward the scaphoid tubercle in cascading fashion

Assessment of neurovascular status is crucial before administering a local anesthetic.
