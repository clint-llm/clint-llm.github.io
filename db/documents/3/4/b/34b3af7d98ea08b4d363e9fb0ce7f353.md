Glenoid labral lesions present with signs and symptoms of recurrent shoulder instability with generalized shoulder pain.

**History**

Evaluation of the Bankart’s lesion requires a thorough history, including the index dislocation, number of dislocations or subluxations, and their reduction method (self or medical personnel). Clinicians must enquire about the patient’s occupation, involvement in the contact sport, mechanism of trauma, and history of the epileptic disorder.

- Demographic details

- Occupation

- Level of activity- contact sport, recreational, none

- Index dislocation

- Age at first dislocation

- Number of dislocations/subluxations

- Mechanism of dislocation

- Presence of associated injury

- Reduction of dislocation- self or medical person

- Dislocation in sleep

- History of epileptic disorder

**Examination**

Clinical examination is dedicated to diagnosing the presence of shoulder instability and associated injuries.
