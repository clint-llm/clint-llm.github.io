The diagnosis of diaphragmatic injuries is not easy, and often small injuries are missed. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a trauma surgeon, general surgeon, radiologist, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, and trauma nurses Once a diaphragmatic injury is diagnosed, surgery is recommended to prevent herniation of abdominal contents into the chest. Operating room and perianesthesia nurses are involved in care, assisting, monitoring patients.

Delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture, usually after visceral herniation through the diaphragm, should be treated with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or a thoracotomy if warranted due to retraction of the diaphragm and the extensive adhesions that may have built up over the years. A thoracic approach allows for the evaluation of any herniated contents, lysis of any pleural adhesions, and subsequent reduction. If the surgery can be doneÂ on an elective basis, the patient should receive bowel preparation prior to the procedure due to the high risk of bowel injury during adhesiolysis.

In patients who have an early diagnosis and repair of the diaphragmatic injury, the outcomes are good, but if there is a delay, the recovery can be prolonged and be associated with both abdominal and chest complications.
