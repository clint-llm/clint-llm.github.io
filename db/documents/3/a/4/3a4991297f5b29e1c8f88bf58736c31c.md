Acquired hemophilia is an uncommon but severe bleeding disorder. It is caused by the development of autoantibodies directed against one of the antihemophilic factors, most frequently factor VIII (FVIII). The diagnosis of this disease is established with difficulty because of its rarity and the complexity of the laboratory diagnosis. It must be diagnosed and treated promptly to avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of acquired hemophilia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of acquired hemophilia.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation process for acquired hemophilia.
- List the management options available for acquired hemophilia.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance acquired hemophilia and improve outcomes.
