Transfer of local flaps, such as rotational flaps, requires the surgeon to understand the involved anatomy, specifically the vascular anatomy of the skin and the directionality of the relaxed skin tension lines. The skin is perfused by the subdermal plexus, which sends vertically-oriented perforating vessels upwards through the layers of the dermis: the deeper reticular dermis and the more superficial papillary dermis. Superficial to the papillary dermis lies the epidermis, which is composed of the following layers, from deep to superficial: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. If the subdermal plexus is injured during flap transfer, whether its arterial or its venous component, the tissue is likely to die because it will be too thick to function as a free skin graft; the subdermal plexus is located either within the subdermal fat or deep within the reticular dermis itself.

Within the face, another three concepts are essential to understand to plan flap transfer in a cosmetically acceptable fashion: relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs) and the lines of maximum extensibility (LMEs), which run perpendicular to them, as well as aesthetic subunits. The RSTLs and LMEs are determined by the direction in which the mimetic muscles contract (perpendicular to RSTLs and parallel to LMEs). Rhytids often form in the RSTLs, and skin stretches most readily along LMEs; therefore, flaps are typically designed so that the incisions lie within RSTLs and/or aesthetic subunit boundaries while avoiding vectors of rotation that will distort cosmetically sensitive structures like lips, eyebrows, and eyelids. The aesthetic subunits of the face are the forehead, periorbital areas, nose, cheeks, perioral area, and chin; several of these, such as the nose and periorbital areas, are further subdivided into smaller subunits, the borders between which may also be used to hide incisions.
