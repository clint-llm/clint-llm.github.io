The anterior compartment of the lower leg is the most common site for acute compartment syndrome.

Recognition of compartment syndrome is essential for the treatment and prevention of ischemia and necrosis of the neurovascular structures and muscle. The physical exam findings in compartment syndrome are often referred to as the “5 P’s”: pain with passive stretch of the toes/ankle, paresthesias, paralysis, palpable swelling, and pulselessness.

Another surgical intervention involving the anterior compartment of the leg involves bypass surgery for peripheral arterial disease. The arteries of the lower limb are particularly susceptible to atherosclerotic plaque buildup and peripheral arterial disease where the arterial lumen of the lower extremities becomes progressively occluded by atherosclerotic plaque, which can lead to decreased arterial blood flow.
