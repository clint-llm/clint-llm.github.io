As the patient may present to a primary care clinician/surgeon as well as a specialist, including a dermatologist, dentist, or otolaryngologist, all the care providers should be cognizant about the condition and its associations. As the majority of the work on this condition has been done by dermatologists, other clinicians should not delay referring the patient early. Similarly, meticulous examination for facial paresis may need the otolaryngologist or even a neurologist. Thus, interprofessional coordination is vital in the management of this condition. The rarity of this disease explains the empiricism of therapeutic proposals and the absence of controlled studies. An effective medical treatment is not available at present. The proposed symptomatic treatments are simply intended to avoid or space recurrences, particularly in the edematous stage. The treatment aims to relieve these patients and to improve their quality of life, often very disturbed by the unsightly and distressing nature of macrocheilitis and oro-facial edema. The spontaneous disappearance of the disease is rare but has been reported.
