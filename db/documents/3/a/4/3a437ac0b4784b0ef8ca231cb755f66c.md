COX inhibitors divide into non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (c2s NSAIDs), and aspirin. NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, ketorolac, and indomethacin. C2s NSAIDs only include celecoxib. Meloxicam and diclofenac are cox-inhibitors that are not categorized.

The cox enzyme catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin.

The COX-1 enzyme regulates many cellular processes, including platelet aggregation, kidney afferent arteriole vasodilation, and gastric mucosa acid protection.

C2s NSAIDs work by preferentially inhibiting COX-2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 but, more so, inhibits COX-1 than COX-2.

There have been several other mechanisms of action attributed to COX inhibitors. Amongst them is inhibition of neutrophil function and inhibition of the inducible nitric oxide synthetase.
