The natural history of WMS is unknown and the management is controversial. Hence, the prognosis of WMS is uncertain.

Patients of WMS may remain asymptomatic both visually and systemically. However, the prognosis of visually symptomatic patients depends upon the complications causing visual symptoms. Macular edema due to exudation from the AVM can be managed with intravitreal-anti-VEGF injections. Nonclearing VH can be managed with pars plana vitrectomy. Neovascular glaucoma can be managed with retinal photocoagulation and pressure-lowering therapies. However, the prognosis remains guarded mostly.

The involvement of maxillofacial or mandibular vessels can lead to excessive hemorrhages during dental procedures.Â The treating dentist or surgeon should be aware of this potential complication.

Intracranial surgeries for AVM remains largely controversial. A few reports of good outcome has been mentioned in patients with intracranial hemorrhage due to AVM.

Many surgeons opt to treat these intracranial AVMs conservatively.
