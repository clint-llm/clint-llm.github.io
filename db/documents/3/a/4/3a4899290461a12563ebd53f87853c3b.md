Heroin is synthetically derived from the morphine alkaloid in opium and is approximately twice as potent as morphine. Heroin acts agonistically on the central nervous system (CNS) opioid receptors mu, kappa, and delta.

Heroin metabolizes in the CNS to monoacetylmorphine, which is a more potent mu-receptor agonist than morphine.

When taken orally, heroin undergoes first-pass metabolism to morphine via deacetylation. Therefore, unlike intravenous administration, oral ingestion does not cause a rapid onset of effects and is less desirable to users. 6-monoacetylmorphine and morphine activate opioid receptors.
