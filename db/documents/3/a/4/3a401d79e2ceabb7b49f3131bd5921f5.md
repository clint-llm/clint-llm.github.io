If not promptly diagnosed and treated as detailed above, HP can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and progressive respiratory failure. PresenceÂ of fibrosis and honeycombing have been associated with higher mortality.

Primary prevention at the workplace should aim to reduce exposure of agricultural workers to known organic antigens and provide safety education. This may involve better engineering techniques, maintenance, use of personal protective equipment, and health and safety education. Detection of a case of HP at the workplace should trigger a detailed review of the workplace and a survey of the other workers to diagnose additional cases early.
