The study of HIV during pregnancy holds great significance because many women are first diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy. Similarly, it is equally important in cases where one or both partners are HIV positive and wish to conceive. During the recent years, universal HIV prenatal testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART), scheduled cesarean delivery for HIV positive women with elevated viral loads, appropriate ART for infants and avoidance of breastfeeding have shown encouraging results, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now aims to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child by reducing its incidence to <1 infection per 100,000 live births.
