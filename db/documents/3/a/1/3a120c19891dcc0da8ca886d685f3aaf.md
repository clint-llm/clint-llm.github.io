Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide. It affects over 75,000 Americans yearly, and nearly 100 million people worldwide show some signs of macular edema secondary to diabetes. Some studies have shown that nearly 1 in 3 people with diabetes have some evidence of macular edema. The prevalence of DME is higher in individuals with type 1 diabetes than those with type 2 diabetes. In patients that have been diagnosed with diabetes, the ten-year incidence of DME is approximately 20% in patients that were diagnosed before the age of 30, and approximately 40% in patients diagnosed over the age of 30. Another study found that approximately 27% of patients develop signs of macular edema within 9 years of diabetes onset. Several studies that address different demographics illustrate an increasing incidence of DME.
