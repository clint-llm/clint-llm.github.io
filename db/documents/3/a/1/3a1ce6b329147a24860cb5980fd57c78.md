Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) is a congenital disorder of craniofacial morphogenesis. This spectrum is characterized by malformations of structures derived from first and second branchial arches, including eyes, mouth (lips, tongue, and palate), ear, maxilla, and mandible. The minimum diagnostic criterion includes microtia, facial asymmetry, and epibulbar dermoid or lipodermoid. This activity reviews the evaluation and management options of OAVS. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team involving multiple disciplines in managing and improving the quality of life of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the complex phenotypic abnormalities involved in the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum.
- Describe the pathogenesis of oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum.
- Review the treatment options for the early management of ocular abnormalities in patients with the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum preventing visual disability.
- Identify the importance of an interprofessional approach and collaboration among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum.
