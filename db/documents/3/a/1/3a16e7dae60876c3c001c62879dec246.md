**Major Adverse Effects**

Nephrotoxicity is the most common, occurring in 1% to 10% of patients. The nephrotoxicity is reversible if detected early and the drug discontinued. Renal damage is more likely to occur in dehydrated patients, have a low glomerular filtration rate, have diabetes, sepsis, fever, or are on NSAIDs.

Ototoxicity, vestibular, and auditory (4% to 6%) can occur when using high doses. The patient may complain of loss of balance and hearing loss, which can be permanent if drug therapy continues for prolonged periods. The ototoxicity is believed to be due to oxidative free radicals, which damage the hair cells in the cochlea. Many hospitals now routinely monitor hearing before, during, and after therapy in infants.

Neuromuscular blockade is less common.

**Minor Effects**

Increase in BUN/Cr (5% to 25%), drug fever, and rash (less common).

Neurotoxicity may present in some patients with paresthesias, tingling, and numbness.
