Splenic abscess is not a common disease, and hence the natural history has not been well studied in controlled clinical trials. The lack of trials and evidence-based medicine makes it difficult to make recommendations on diagnosis and management. However, expert opinion suggests that an interprofessional approach may help with prompt diagnosis and earlier treatment. One study revealed that a stratified approach in the emergency room led to an earlier diagnosis with improved outcomes.

Both the surgeon and the radiologist must be involved in the care of the patient. Recent data indicate that CT guided drainage is safe and an effective way to treat a splenic abscess. If surgery is taken, then a laparoscopic approach is preferred over an open approach.

If the spleen is removed, both the nurse and pharmacist play a vital role in educating the patient on post-splenectomy sepsis and vaccination. In the absence of guidelines, the healthcare workers must communicate and integrate their strategies so that the patient receives the best care possible.
