Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease transmitted by sandflies that is most commonly seen in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. As travel patterns shift it is a disease being more frequently introduced into developed areas. The disease may either be cutaneous or systemic. Identification of the organism and knowledge of endemic species will guide interprofessional team members toward accurate diagnosis and targeted therapy if indicated. This activity outlines the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of leishmaniasis. This review highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients and preparing for the potential for future cases of leishmaniasis in developed nations.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of leishmaniasis.
- Summarize the cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis syndromes. 
- Explain how to diagnose leishmaniasis.
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with leishmaniasis.
