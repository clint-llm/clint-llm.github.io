Hyperthermia is not an uncommon presentation to the emergency room. Some of these patients may require systemic cooling to prevent neurological damage. In managing heat-related illness and heat stroke, decreasing core body temperature is the most critical intervention. The cooling is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, emergency department physician, and ICU nurses

Cooling may also be performed as an adjunct to the usual therapies for numerous conditions which may cause hyperthermia secondarily. Rapidly identifying patients who would benefit from this intervention is the key to effective management.

The outcomes in most patients who are promptly treated are good.
