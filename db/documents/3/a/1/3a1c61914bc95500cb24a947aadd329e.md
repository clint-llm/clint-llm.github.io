Radiotherapy is a widely used treatment modality for managing carcinomas in the head and neck region, either alone or combined with chemotherapy. Head and neck cancer includes malignancies of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, salivary glands, paranasal sinuses, and nasal cavity. Most of these carcinomas are derived from the squamous epithelium of these regions.

Although effective in managing malignancies, radiotherapy induces undesirable side effects in the oral cavity. Some develop soon after initiating treatment, and others may appear after months or even years of completion of treatment. Oral complications of radiotherapy mainly include oral mucositis, xerostomia, dysgeusia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, radiation-related caries, and osteoradionecrosis.

All of these complications may impair eating, swallowing, and speaking, with consequent loss of weight and appetite. Severe cases require parental nutrition and pausing radiation treatment, significantly affecting patients' prognosis. Dental management strategies must be implemented before, during, and after radiotherapy to prevent or decrease the severity of these debilitating conditions.
