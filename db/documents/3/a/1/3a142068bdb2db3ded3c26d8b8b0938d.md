The following conditions can be mistaken for breast fat necrosis:

- Breast carcinoma

- Tuberculosis of breast

- Fibroadenoma

- Phyllodes tumor

- Breast cyst

Breast fat necrosis can closely mimic breast cancer in both physical examination and imaging. Therefore, it is crucial to take a detailed history, assess risk factors, and consider the age of the patient. In high-risk patients, namely, those whose primary surgery was oncologic, patients older than 40 years of age, and those with very delayed presentation of fat necrosis, a more extensive workup is necessary. It is important not to assume the diagnosis of fat necrosis when history includes breast trauma, as trauma could mask or distract from a pre-existing breast mass.
