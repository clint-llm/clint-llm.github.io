A decade after its approval in the United States, TPVI has emerged as a safe and effective non-surgical therapeutic modality for RVOT dysfunction that often results in a peak cath gradient less than 35 mm Hg and no more than mild insufficiency, with a complication rate is between 6% and 13%.

The long-term rate ofÂ re-intervention with the first-generation valve remains relatively low, with freedom of re-intervention at 1 year and 5 years are greater than 90% and 76%, respectively, excluding patients with stent fracture.
