Congenital syphilis (CS) is caused by transmission of the spirochete Treponema pallidum from the mother to the fetus, resulting in a multitude of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic, premature birth, and a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms to stillbirth. Rates for CS are on the rise, with 2017 having the most cases of CS since 1997.
