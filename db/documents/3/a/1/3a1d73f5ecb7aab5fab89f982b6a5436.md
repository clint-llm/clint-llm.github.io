The screening and management of cervical HPV infection are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, pathologist, and gynecologist. There are different degrees of dysplasia. Based on the  Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology (LAST) project, pathologists should call the specimen low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). LSIL, classically referred to as CIN1 or mild dysplasia, does not require treatment and should be followed conservatively. Patients with LSIL should return in one year for co-testing. This involves a repeat Pap smear with HPV molecular testing as the majority of the lesions will regress on their own. HSIL, classically referred to as CIN2/3 or CIS, usually requires an excisional procedure for treatment. Ablative procedures can be offered, but the majority of clinicians perform excisional procedures to give the pathologist a better specimen to evaluate. Excisional procedures provide assurance that an underlying cancer is identified, and adequate treatment for the lesion is provided. The key is for the healthcare provider to recommend positive lifestyle changes and get vaccinated against HPV.  Pharmacists often administer the vaccine and counsel patients as to the risks and benefits. Ambulatory care and pediatric nurses also administer vaccines and make sure patients follow up.
