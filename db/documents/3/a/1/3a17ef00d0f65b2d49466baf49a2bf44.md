The outcomes and prognosis in pediatric foreign body ingestion are generally good, with most patients tolerating passage of ingested objects without intervention.  Even in scenarios where intervention is needed, mortality and morbidity are low.  High-risk ingestions (button batteries, magnets) can be associated with complications, and in rare instances, death.

Systemic reactions associated with zinc allergy have been reported. Esophageal foreign bodies have been known to cause mediastinitis, perforation, and pneumomediastinum. Button batteries cause the highest morbidity, and thus, they need to be removed as soon as the diagnosis is made. Finally, procedures to remove foreign bodies can also cause complications- either from the anesthesia or the procedure.
