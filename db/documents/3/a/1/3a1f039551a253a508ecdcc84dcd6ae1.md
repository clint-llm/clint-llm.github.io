Headache is a common presenting complaint among patients of all age groups and is encountered in multiple medical fields. The disorder is frequently debilitating, can reduce a patient's quality of life, and is associated with a large socioeconomic burden.

The greater occipital nerve block is an effective treatment modality and should be considered in managing acute and chronic headaches. The GON-block procedure can be easily performed with minimal equipment and is an overall safe treatment option, even for patients with multiple comorbidities. The GON-block can be performed singularly or combined with other oral or intravenous pain regimens to increase desirable patient outcomes.
