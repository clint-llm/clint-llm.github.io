Unfortunately, with SON of the knee, satisfactory clinical outcomes are not guaranteed, and some patients are left with continued pain and reduced function, which can detrimentally affect the quality of their life. The condition is associated with high morbidity, particularly if the initial diagnosis is delayed. A patient’s clinical care can be optimized by an interprofessional approach using a team comprising of an orthopedic surgeon, a radiologist, rheumatologist, primary clinician, and physiotherapist. The synergy between healthcare professionals is vital as it allows clear communication channels to be established whereby patient management can be effectively and efficiently discussed. This allows holistic and patient-centered decisions to be made, ultimately achieving the optimum clinical outcomes.
