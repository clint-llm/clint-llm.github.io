Heparin products see frequent use in hospitals, including line flushes, catheters, to DVT prophylaxis in patients with prolonged hospitalization. It is reasonable to obtain platelet counts after heparin therapy. Any fall in platelet count requires evaluation, and a 4T score (degree of thrombocytopenia, timing relative to heparin exposure, presence of thrombosis, other causes for thrombocytopenia) should be calculated if HIT is suspected. Clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses should be aware of HIT pathology. Argatroban is indicated only in Type II HIT, not in Type I. Type I HIT can be differentiated from Type II by a milder drop in platelet count, earlier onset of thrombocytopenia, and absence of antibodies. Since argatroban is expensive and can have potential bleeding complications, it is necessary to ensure its use is in the correct clinical scenario. Patients on argatroban therapy should have frequent monitoring of PTT or ACT, and any signs suggestive of bleeding or fall in hemoglobin should be promptly reported to the healthcare team so that the clinician can promptly discontinue argatroban and initiate transfusion therapy.
