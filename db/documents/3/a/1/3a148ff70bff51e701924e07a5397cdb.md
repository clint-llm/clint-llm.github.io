Small to medium-sized defects which cannot be primarily closed may be reconstructed with rhombic flaps. This flap offers advantages over skin grafting, such as improved color and texture matching and fewer wound sites. It may be applied to a variety of anatomic regions, particularly facial defects such as those involving the cheek, eyelids, chin, temple, and nose.
