Complications from asthma do exist although long-term complications are not common.

**Common Complications**

- Interference with normal activities

- Interference with sleep

- Time missed from school and work

- Emergency department visits and hospitalizations

Long-term complications from asthma can occur due to chronic inflammation which can lead to damage to the airways.  Typically frequent asthma attacks can lead to airway inflammation and eventually medications are unable to penetrate the airway.  Death from asthma is rare the risk increases in those patients with underlying lung disease and smokers.
