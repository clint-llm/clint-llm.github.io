The atrioventricular septal defect is a congenital cardiac malformation that is characterized by a variable degree of the atrial and ventricular septal defect along with a common or partially separate atrioventricular orifice.

The incidence of atrioventricular septal defect has been estimated from 0.24 to 0.31 in 1000 live births with no significant difference in male and female gender, and it has a strong association with Downâ€™s syndrome.
