Puberty is initiated when GnRH is secreted in a pulsatile manner by hypothalamic neurons. This pulsatile release of GnRH allows pituitary gonadotrophs to release LH and FSH. LH begins androstenedione production in ovarian theca cells, while FSH allows aromatase in follicular cells to synthesize estradiol. Increased serum estradiol allows breast tissue to enlarge and influences linear bone growth and epiphyseal fusion, playing a significant role in the pubertal growth spurt.

One year before breast budding, higher peaks of LH are seen exclusively during sleep, caused by an increasing pulse amplitude of GnRH release. When breast budding occurs, LH peak amplitude increases 10-fold and FSH pulse amplitude doubles. Progression of puberty from Tanner stage II to III is marked by a further increase in LH pulse amplitude, a 20 to 40-fold increase from prepubertal levels, reflecting the rise of estradiol levels, which have now become detectable at all hours. Upon reaching Tanner stage IV, LH, and FSH pulses become diurnal and gradually mature to the adult pulsation pattern.

Menarche occurs near the end of Tanner stage IV after a year-long rise in daily estradiol output. High estradiol levels at this time exert negative feedback on the gonadotropic axis to suppress it, leading to cyclic estrogen levels and uterine bleeding.
