The most important approach to treating chronic diarrhea is to find a specific diagnosis. The differential should be kept broad. The workup should involve checking for anemia, electrolytes, infectious workup, stool studies, and serological studies to reach a diagnosis.

If the study results are inconclusive and no definitive diagnosis is reached, the patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist. The patient should undergo endoscopy and biopsies to reach a conclusive diagnosis to initiate appropriate therapy. Regular follow up visits should be scheduled with the primary physician and the gastroenterologist. Patents should be followed closely for monitoring the laboratory workup and assessing the response to treatment. Pharmacists canÂ verify the dosing of pharmaceutical agents and check for interactions. The interprofessional healthcare teams should collaborate to ensure proper care for the patients.
