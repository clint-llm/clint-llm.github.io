Clinically, type I and type II PCT are similar, and the need for differentiating the two arises only during the management and patient counseling. The patients should be asked in detail about any of the susceptibility factors discussed above, like alcohol, smoking, chemical, or estrogen exposures. Any evidence of neurovisceral symptoms can help point to other porphyrias. Family history is usually not helpful, and a detailed medication history might be beneficial to rule out any drug-related eruptions. Since the porphyrin accumulation in the PCT can change the urine color to reddish-brown, a complete history will also include questions about the patient's urine color.

**Cutaneous Manifestations**

Photosensitivity, along with the formation of skin blisters, vesicles, bullae, and increased fragility of the skin, is seen on sun-exposed parts of the body. This most commonly involves the back of the hands, forearms, neck, face, and feet. These repeated insults to the skin later resolve, leaving behind hyper- and hypopigmented scars and milia, which are small yellowish-white keratin filled papules.

Pigment changes can be seen in the facial, orbital, or malar regions ranging from blue to purplish-brown colors.

A non-virilizing type of hypertrichosis around the cheeks, temple, and forearms can be seen in women. Sometimes, this could be the only physical manifestation seen in PCT patients.
