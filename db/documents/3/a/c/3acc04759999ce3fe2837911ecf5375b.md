A study conducted by Janet M et al. examined the variation in receptor density and area among neurite-associated acetylcholine receptor patches (NARPs) induced by chick ciliary ganglion neurons on nearby myotubes in vitro. In this study variation in NARP size and intensity reflects regional variation in the ability of myotubes to respond to the neuronal influence because no gradient in NARP size or intensity with distance from the soma was evident; the intensities and areas of uninnervated receptor clusters (hot spots) were similar to those of NARPs; acetylcholinesterase was present at the same proportion of hot spots and NARPs at all times examined.
