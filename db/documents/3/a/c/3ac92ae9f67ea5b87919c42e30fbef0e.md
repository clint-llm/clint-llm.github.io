The differential diagnosis for back pain in the outpatient setting is broad and can include spondylosis (degenerative disc disease and facet arthrosis), vertebral body and pars interarticularis fracture, or muscle spasms. Febrile status does not significantly narrow the differential, as fever is common in viral syndromes, infections of the retroperitoneum, vertebral osteomyelitis, and many other causes. Nonspecific symptomatology, nonfocal physical exam, and a broad differential all increase the likelihood of delayed diagnosis.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a reasonable test in the workup of febrile back pain. Unfortunately, in vertebral osteomyelitis, this test has low sensitivity. The neutrophil count is often normal,

In endemic areas, Brucella serologic testing and M. tuberculosis testing including purified protein derivative (PPD), or an interferon-y release assay are appropriate in the workup.

Besides laboratory evaluation, imaging also plays an important role in the workup of vertebral osteomyelitis. Radiographs are insensitive for vertebral osteomyelitis identification. However, radiography is often the first imaging test because of its wide availability and acquisition speed. It may suggest an alternative diagnosis for back pain.

Computed tomography (CT) evaluation has relatively limited utility in the evaluation of vertebral osteomyelitis as it may be at the reference range early in the disease process and may underestimate the soft tissue and bony extent in advanced cases. CT is often more sensitive than radiography and may show subtle vertebral endplate erosion or soft tissue abscess. CT findings of intervertebral disc space narrowing are nonspecific, as this finding is common to degenerative disc disease and osteomyelitis. MRI evaluation can improve specificity in this setting.

While MRI is the modality of choice for vertebral osteomyelitis evaluation, some patients may have an MRI contraindication and need an alternate imaging modality. Nuclear medicine is one such tool when MRI is not an option or not available. Gallium-67 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has proven to be an excellent MRI alternative with sensitivity comparable to MRI.

In situations where imaging findings support vertebral osteomyelitis but blood cultures are negative, percutaneous aspiration or biopsy is a recommended strategy to isolate the microorganism responsible for infection before starting antibiotic therapy.
