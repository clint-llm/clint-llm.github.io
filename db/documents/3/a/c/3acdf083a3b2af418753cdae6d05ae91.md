IVUS has indications for a wide range of uses in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).

The following are the recommendations made regarding the use of IVUS for PCI, according to guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC).

CLASS IIa:

- IVUS is a reasonable option to assess angiographically indeterminant left main CAD (Level of Evidence: B)

- IVUS and coronary angiography are within reason 4 to 6 weeks and 1-year post cardiac transplantation to rule out donor CAD, detect rapidly progressive cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and provide prognostic information  (Level of Evidence: B)

- IVUS is a reasonable option to determine the mechanism of stent restenosis (Level of Evidence: C)

CLASS IIb:

- IVUS may be reasonable in assessing non–left main coronary arteries possessing angiographically intermediate coronary stenoses (i.e., 50% to 70% diameter stenosis)  (Level of Evidence: B)

- IVUS may be considered for the guidance of coronary stent implantation, especially in cases of left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenting (Level of Evidence: B)

- IVUS may be reasonable for the determination of the mechanism of stent thrombosis   (Level of Evidence: C)

CLASS III:

- IVUS for routine lesion assessment is not a recommendation if revascularization with PCI or CABG is not being contemplated (Level of Evidence: C)

European Guidelines have been updated more recently, and the 2018 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends IVUS to assess the severity and optimize the treatment of unprotected left main coronary lesions (Class IIa, level of evidence B).
