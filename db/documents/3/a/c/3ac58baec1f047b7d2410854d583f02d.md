Screening and subsequent germline mutation testing typically identify patients with Lynch syndrome. Those at risk for Lynch syndrome may be identified if they have a personal or family history of malignancy and meet clinical criteria, for example, the Amsterdam II or Revised Bethesda guidelines (Table 1), for screening. Further, patients with colorectal cancer who are found to have microsatellite instability in a tumor sample can be diagnosed with Lynch syndrome if they have a germline mutation in a mismatch repair gene. An individual with Lynch syndrome is at increased risk of colonic and extracolonic tumors, including endometrial, ovarian, upper gastrointestinal tract, urothelial, pancreatic, and brain cancers.
