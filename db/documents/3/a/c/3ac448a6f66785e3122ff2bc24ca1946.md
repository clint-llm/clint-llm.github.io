Duodenal trauma is primarily a surgical disease managed by surgeons and trauma physicians. Care, however, is complex and best handled by a robust interprofessional team. This includes emergency medical technicians, nurses, emergency room physicians, radiologists, anesthesiologists, operating room staff, and pharmacy support. Many studies have shown that a multidisciplinary team approach improves patient outcomes.

Demetriades et al. have demonstrated that level I trauma centers have better outcomes than lower-level trauma centers.
