General anesthesia requires an anesthetic machine that contains a ventilator, gas supply, reducing valves, vaporizers, flow meters, breathing circuits, and suction canisters. The anesthesia machine also contains a monitor to display vital signs. Airway accessories are also required, including a face mask, laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes, styles, and oral/nasal airways. The endotracheal tube size is based on the measurement of the inner diameter of the tube. Size 7.0 ETT and size 8.0 ETT are standard starting sizes for the adult female and male respectively. Additional intubation equipment should be available for patients with difficult airways, including a video laryngoscope, flexible fiber-optic scope, Eschmann catheter, laryngeal mask airway (LMA), and a cricothyrotomy kit for emergent situations.
