It is not indicated in the routine evaluation of nonspecific chronic spine pain when adequate conservative management has not yet been attempted in earnest, or in cases where intervertebral discs appear radiographically normal. Consideration should be given to withholding PD in patients with substantial psychosocial stressors or poorly controlled mood disorders as they may be at excessive risk of a false-positive result. The contraindications that apply to otherÂ invasive spine procedures apply equally to PD and include patient refusal, untreated infection, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. Additionally, patients with an allergy to both iodinated and non-iodinated contrast are not candidates.
