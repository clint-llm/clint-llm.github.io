Pustular psoriasis is a chronic disease marked by recurrent episodes or flares. Treatment is aimed to shorten the duration of relapse, prevent complications, and extend disease-free periods. Compared to other subtypes, the von Zumbusch subtype of pustular psoriasisÂ has a higher risk of mortality because of systemic involvement, especially with underlying comorbidities, such as cancer, renal failure, or liver failure. The localized subtypes of pustular psoriasis have a much lower risk of mortality.
