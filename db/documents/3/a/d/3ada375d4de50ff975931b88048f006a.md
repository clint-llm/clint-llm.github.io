The diagnosis of May-Thurner syndrome or iliofemoral compression syndrome requires a high index of suspicion. All clinicians, starting from the emergency department team (where most patients with DVT usually present) or those in the primary care office, must be aware of this condition. A dedicated team of radiologists and vascular surgeons, support staff (nurses, anesthesiologists, etc.) is needed to provide acute care to such patients. Also, post thrombolysis and stent placement, a dedicated team must follow up with patients to help in rehabilitation and early detection of post-thrombotic syndrome. The risk of anticoagulation must be discussed with the patient by a vascular surgeon or a hematologist. Pharmacists review prescriptions, check for interactions, and counsel patients about their use and side effects. This interprofessional collaboration and information sharing will improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
