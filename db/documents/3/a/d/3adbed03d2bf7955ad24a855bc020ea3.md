The prognosis is very good for patients presenting with ant bites as most bites are managed conservatively not requiring extensive care. Patients who seek medical care demonstrate serious systemic allergic reactions which occur in about 2% of fire ant stings. One study reported 83 deaths out of 29,300 patients. Infants and the elderly were the most at risk.
