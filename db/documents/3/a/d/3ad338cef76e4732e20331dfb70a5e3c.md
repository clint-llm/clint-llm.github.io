There are two major complications of poor management of perioperative anticoagulation. The first is bleeding, which occurs if the provider fails to interrupt anticoagulation therapy in an appropriate timeframe. On the other hand, however, patients who have their anticoagulation interrupted too early in the perioperative period are at high risk of thromboembolic events, as surgical procedures themselves induce a hypercoagulable state. Thus, appropriate interruption of anticoagulation in the perioperative period is a delicate balancing act between the potentially severe complications of bleeding and thrombosis, requiring strict attentiveness of the managing provider.
