The disease is progressive, and as no cure currently exists, patients eventually lose the ability to speak and understand both written and spoken language. In the initial years from symptom onset, patients with nfvPPA are typically expected to have predominantly aphasic and apraxic symptoms. However, other cognitive and behavioral impairments are noted as the disease progresses, usually no earlier than eight to twelve years after the initial symptom onset.

Most patients with PPA live for 3Â to 12 years after diagnosis. For nfvPPA, the median survival rate is approximately seven years.
