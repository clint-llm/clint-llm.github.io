Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare disease associated with the use of GBCAs connected to impaired kidney function. Since 1988 when gadopentetate dimeglumine was approved for clinical practice, GBCAs had been intravenously applied to improve MRI examinations' visibility. Gadolinium (Gd) is a known heavy metal, and it is considered highly toxic in biological systems. To be used as a contrast agent, gadolinium must be bound to ligands. GBCAs consist of gadolinium ions and chelating molecules, which could be cyclic or linear. The linear molecules are less stable and provide a weaker link to the gadolinium ion; thus, they are considered high-risk agents.

- Group 1 (gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadodiamide, gadoversetamide)

- Group 2 (gadobenate dimeglumine, gadoterate meglumine, gadoteridol, gadobutrol)

- Group 3 (gadoxetic acid disodium)

Data suggest that NSF may be because of the use of any GBCA, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to analyze the safety profile of each GBCA to better establish its NSF risks.

The extent of renal insufficiency that leads to the development of NSF is not known. However, some risk factors include stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and inflammatory conditions. The FDA updated the public health advisory in order to include cases with moderate renal failure, such as chronic kidney disease stage 3.
