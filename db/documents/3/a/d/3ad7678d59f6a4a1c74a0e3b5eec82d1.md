Inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis is a disease associated with high morbidity. Although the condition is considered rare, case reports have shown that IVC thromboses may be underdiagnosed. For example, most commonly, pulmonary emboli are thought to arise from a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. This activity describes the cause and presentation of inferior vena cava thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a patient with inferior vena cava thrombosis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with inferior vena cava thrombosis.
- Summarize the treatment of inferior vena cava thrombosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by inferior vena cava thrombosis.
