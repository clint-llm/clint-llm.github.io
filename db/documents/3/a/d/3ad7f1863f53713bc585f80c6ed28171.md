Ibuprofen, 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid, belongs to the class of drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and was discovered by Dr. Stewart Adams in 1961. It was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and 1974 in the United States. Ibuprofen is prescribed commonly as an analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agent in conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and acutely painful musculoskeletal conditions. Off-label uses include for conditions like cystic fibrosis to slow progression. This activity serves to review the basic pharmacological characteristics of ibuprofen, clinical presentations during an overdose, and management of ibuprofen toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of ibuprofen toxicity.
- Identify common history and physical exam findings in patients with ibuprofen.
- Summarize the treatment options for ibuprofen toxicity.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by ibuprofen toxicity.
