The pulmonary valve directs blood from the right ventricle (RV) towards the pulmonary arteries during systole. Equally important is its closure during diastole to prevent the reversal of flow into the right ventricle driven by the drop in right ventricular pressure. Any pathology associated with its structure or function can result in impedance to this forward flow. Defective coaptation of the valve, annular dilation, or fibrinoid deposits on the valve can impair flow and result in volume overload. Immediate and late responses to volume overload manifest as the clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary regurgitation (PR).
