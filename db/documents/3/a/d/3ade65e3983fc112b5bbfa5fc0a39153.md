The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show features of left ventricular volume overload and ischemic changes.

A chest x-ray can show cardiomegaly and pleural effusion due to congestive heart failure.

2D echocardiography is useful to evaluate right and left ventricular size, mean pulmonary artery pressure in left to right shunt, and evaluation of regional or global left ventricular systolic function.

Coronary angiography remains the primary diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the assessment of the fistula and embolization with coils and devices.

Multidetector computed tomography is useful for the 3-dimensional anatomic evaluation for origin, patency, and termination of the CAVF.

Magnetic resonance imaging is confirmatory, which shows detailed anatomy along with complications like myocardial fibrosis from ischemia.
