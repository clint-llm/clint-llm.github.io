For the success of this therapy, the physician performing PNS must be adequately trained in the procedure. A prior discussion is vital with the patient explaining all the risks and benefits of the procedure. A realistic expectation needs to be set with the patient about the outcomes of the therapy regarding his/her pain relief. PNS is best treated by an interprofessional team which may consist of primary care providers, neurologists, anesthesiologists, specialty pain and neuroscience nurses, and pharmacists.

There is a need for more randomized controlled trials to assess this novel therapy's full potential completely.
