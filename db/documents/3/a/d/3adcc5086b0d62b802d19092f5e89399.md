A felon is an infection that occurs within the closed-space compartments of the fingertip pulp. Â The swelling leads to intense throbbing pain. The surrounding tissues are at risk for ischemia if the blood flow is compromised by compression from edema and pus formation. Treatment involves incision and drainage of the infected pulp space and oral antibiotics. If left untreated the underlying bone, joint, or tendons may become infected.
