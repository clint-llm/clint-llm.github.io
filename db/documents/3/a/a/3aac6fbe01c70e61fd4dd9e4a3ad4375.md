Preparation for hysteroscopy includes preoperative evaluation and testing individualized for patient needs. Further testing for preoperative clearance should be undertaken if comorbid conditions exist that increase operative morbidity. Hysteroscopy may be performed at any time in postmenopausal women. For premenopausal women, it is important to consider that performing hysteroscopy during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle may lead to overdiagnosis of endometrial polyps since the endometrium may appear polypoid during this time (ACOG Committee Opinion 800). Using misoprostol for cervical dilation pre-procedure is not universally accepted and is not routinely performed.

Prophylactic antibiotics are not needed for hysteroscopy.
