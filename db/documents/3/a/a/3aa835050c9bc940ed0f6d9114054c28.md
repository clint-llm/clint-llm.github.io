- Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is an inflammatory condition characterized by shoulder stiffness and pain.

- The majority of patients have significant loss of passive range of motion, a feature that is key for diagnosis.

- The exact pathophysiology is unknown. The most commonly accepted hypothesis states that inflammation initially occurs within the joint capsule and synovial fluid.

- There is no laboratory testing indicated for diagnosis. If there is a concern for underlying systemic disease, test as needed.

- Imaging is not indicated. The diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis is primarily clinical. If there is a concern regarding an alternative diagnosis, such as evaluating for a fracture, imaging, such as a shoulder X-ray, may be useful.

- Frozen shoulder is a self-limiting condition and, if diagnosed early, has a favorable outcome. However, physical therapy must be a crucial part of treatment to achieve satisfactory outcomes.
