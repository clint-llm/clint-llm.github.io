Patient and family education is very important regarding the progressive and multisystem nature of this disease. A male with MERRF having a mutated mtDNA cannot transmit the disease to any of his offspring. A female having a mutated mtDNA will transmit the disease to all of her offspring. Further, prenatal diagnosis for MERRF is also possible if MERRF has been detected in the mother.

Affected persons with MERRF and their asymptomatic at-risk relatives should have a regular follow-up (e.g., every 6Â to 12 months initially) for disease monitoring and the appearance of new symptoms. It is recommended to have an annual neurologic, ophthalmologic, cardiology, and endocrinologic evaluations to screen for complications.
