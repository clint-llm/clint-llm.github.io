Risk factors have been identified for forming MAC:

- Ultraviolet (UV) radiation

- Previous radiation therapy

- Immunosuppressive medications

The estimate for the link to therapeutic radiation ranges from 19% to 50%, with an average latent period of 30 to 40 years. UV radiation is often implicatedÂ because most lesions appear in sun-exposed areas and those with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II.

Microcystic adnexal carcinoma has also been reported in younger individuals with a history of additional UV exposure, such as fighter pilots.

The effect of immunosuppression on the risk for the development of MAC is unclear at this time, although immunosuppression increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
