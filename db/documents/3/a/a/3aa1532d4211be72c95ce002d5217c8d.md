Currently, there is no cure for any GSD, and most treatments attempt to alleviate signs/symptoms. Key goals are to treat or avoid hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperlipidemia. Hypoglycemia is avoided by consuming starch, and an optimal, physically modified form is now commercially available. Hyperuricemia is treated with allopurinol and hyperlipidemia with statins. Some GSDs like GSD type II can now be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), using recombinant alglucosidase alfa, which degrades lysosomal glycogen.

There is ongoing research to use ERT with other forms of GSDs. Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with certain GSDs with progressive hepatic forms that have progressed to hepatic malignancy or failure. Though liver failure and hypoglycemia may be corrected with liver transplantation, cardiomyopathy associated with the GSD will not be corrected and may continue to progress.

Immediate management of acute hypoglycemia requires rapid correction with oral carbohydrates and/or parenteral glucose. Glucagon is only effective in insulin-mediated hypoglycemia and will not be helpful in patients who present with hypoglycemia secondary to a GSD.
