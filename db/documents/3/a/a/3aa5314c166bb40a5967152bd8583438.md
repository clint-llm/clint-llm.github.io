Acute paronychia is one of the most common infections of the hand. It is usually caused by a breakdown of the seal between the nail plate and the nail fold with infection resulting from subsequent inoculation of bacterial or fungal pathogens. Paronychia drainage is recommended when an abscess forms within the nail folds or beneath the nail plate. This activity reviews the clinical assessment and technical approach involved in the management and drainage of paronychia within the context of evidence-based practice.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of acute paronychia in terms of causative mechanisms and implicated micro-organisms.
- Describe clinical features and the relevant anatomy of paronychia.
- Summarize the management options available for acute paronychia.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for paronychia drainage and enhance outcomes.
