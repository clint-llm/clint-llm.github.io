The risk factors for polypharmacy-related mild cognitive impairment are age over 65, multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, Apo Îµ4 carriers, cerebrovascular accidents, low socio-economic status, and lower education. Any increase in the number of medications prescribed to individuals raises the risk of unexpected drug interactions and their side effects, leading to impaired cognitive or physical capability. Over time, the cumulative exposure of multiple drugs with changes in body homeostasis with age makes the elderly vulnerable to pronounced mental and physical decline.

The elderly with multiple comorbidities are at increased risk for adverse drug reactions and drug interactions because of age-related physiological changes in the body. Many patients see numerous specialists and may fill medications at various pharmacies. The complex and rapid changes in older adult's care in multiple settings by multiple providers contribute to polypharmacy and their undesirable outcomes.

Potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) like benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and opioids can affect cognition and frailty in the geriatric population.
