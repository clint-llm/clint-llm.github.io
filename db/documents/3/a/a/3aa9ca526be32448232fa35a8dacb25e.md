Genetic mutations in the gene BCL6 affects the signaling pathway critical for regular intestinal rotation resulting in the abnormal location of the cecum and fibrotic band formation from the cecum to the retroperitoneum passing over the duodenum creating a potential point of obstruction.

The short mesentery of the displaced mid-gut forms a pedicle around which the mid-gut may rotate, causing a volvulus andÂ subsequent mid-gut ischemia.
