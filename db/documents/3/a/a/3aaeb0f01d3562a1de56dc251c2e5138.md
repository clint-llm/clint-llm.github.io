An interprofessional care team is an established entity in cardiovascular medicine. It improves the clinical outcomes while adhering to the evidence-based practice guidelines. As many as nine specialties can be in contact with one single patient, identifying and caring for their individual needs. Improvement in communication between different healthcare disciplines helps reduce the length of stay of patients and also impacts morbidity and mortality. Through leadership commitment from the cardiologist and cardiac surgeon, a programmatic approach can improve the delivery of quality evidence-based care in managing the ventricular aneurysm. To treat cardiovascular diseases, a new concept of a heart team is set into motion and has become the subject of increasing interest. Implementing a heart team can help put various issues into perspective for patients and their families. This interprofessional team includes an experienced cardiac surgeon, interventional cardiologist, and primary cardiologist, who work together to help focus on specific patient considerations and expectations.

- A cardiologist has an essential role in managing the patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and subsequent follow-up to monitor for post-infarction complications.

- An interventional cardiologist is involved in the decision-making process for disease management that encompasses revascularization therapies for patients with ischemic heart disease.

- The cardiac surgeon's role in the heart team involves deciding the optimal timing of the surgery.

- An anesthetist holds an integral position in the team to evaluate anesthetic risks in the perioperative management of the patient.

- An interventional radiologist helps in the diagnosis of the ventricular aneurysm by carrying out various imaging modalities.

- An intensivist after the cardiac surgery is an expert in the management of noncardiac complications as well as management of severe cardiac cases requiring a combination of mechanical ventilator support, antimicrobial regimens, hemodynamic tailoring, and renal replacement therapies.

- A clinical pharmacist offer suggestions for individual patient care through prospective or retrospective review based on pharmacological principles and provide medication education for patients and health care providers at all levels.

- A cardiac nurse plays a pivotal role in monitoring the patients as first-care responders and providing immediate care with the clinician's guidance.

- A physiotherapist is the profession of choice to lead cardiac rehabilitation programs.

- Pharmacists can be invaluable resources in anticoagulation management and dosing.

This interprofessional team approach will drive better outcomes for patients with LV aneurysms. [Level 5]
