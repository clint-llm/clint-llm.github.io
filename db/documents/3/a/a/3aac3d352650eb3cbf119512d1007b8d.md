Ohm law was originally an empirical derivation based on the relationship between current and voltage; however, it has remained consistent in microscopic and macroscopic observations. Ohm law is widely used in electronics and in creating circuits, as well as in battery development and other electrochemical applications. The scope of Ohm law is not limited to circuitry, as it can also be used to create molecules and polymers. Each atom contains protons and electrons, which can be harnessed to create chemical bonds with other atoms. By applying a voltage to a material, an oxidation-reduction reaction occurs, where one electron is removed from one molecule and attaches to another. This has a host of research applications, such as energy storage, materials chemistry, organic chemistry, and more. These applications useÂ Ohm law and have allowed scientists to make materials in novel ways.

To select the correct voltage, one needs to consider the resistances as well as the amount of charge needed. If there is a lot of resistance and little voltage, there will not be enough current to apply the charge throughout. Conversely, if there is too much voltage, the current can harm the circuitry of the device or degrade the molecules. Using electricity through Ohm law requires attention to the needs of the application to have the desired output.
