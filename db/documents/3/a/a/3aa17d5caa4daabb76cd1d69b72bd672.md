Albumin is the most abundant protein in the blood and accounts for about 50 percent of all plasma proteins. It gets synthesized by the liver and secreted immediately without storage. The physiological regulators of albumin are the colloid osmotic pressure and nutritional status. The metabolism of albumin depends on the synthesis, distribution over interstitium and intravascular compartment, and excretion.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved indications for albumin colloid.
- Describe the mechanism of action and therapeutic effect of albumin.
- Summarize the possible adverse events associated with albumin colloid.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the proper use of albumin colloid and improve outcomes.
