Periapical radiographs are critical in evaluating the periodontal hard tissues. Widening of the periodontal ligaments and horizontal or vertical bone loss is often expected.

A periapical radiolucency is usually an indication of an endodontic abscess or a combination of a periodontal and endodontic abscess. The latter often demonstrates characteristic alveolar bone loss extending to the periapical lesions.

A practical way to determine the source of the infection is inserting a gutta-percha point along the sinus tract or into the periodontal pocket and identifying the point of termination with a periapical radiograph.

In some particular cases, darkfield microscopic examination of the abscess is used to rule out a periapical abscess due to the difference in the microflora. Positron emission tomography has high accuracy in detecting periodontal and other anaerobic abscesses in the oral cavity.
