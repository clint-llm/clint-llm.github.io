Expert opinion is primarily used to treat pericarditis. NSAIDs and colchicine are considered effective treatment options. Currently recommended doses are aspirin 650 mg every 4 to 6 hours or ibuprofen 400 mg every 4 to 6 hours. One study named the Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis Trial (COPE), showed colchicine to be the first-line adjuvant drug for the treatment and prevention of pericarditis (Level of Evidence A).
