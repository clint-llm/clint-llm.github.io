Patients with a new diagnosis of cirrhosis should undergo a complete laboratory workup to ascertain the etiology of cirrhosis. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis presenting with acute variceal bleeding, initial blood work with a complete blood count, comprehensive hepatitis panel that includes liver and renal function panel, coagulation profile, arterial blood gas analysis should be performed.

- **Diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)**should be performed to assess and stratify gastric varices in patients with decompensated cirrhosis or incidental findings of gastric varices on cross-sectional imaging in patients without cirrhosis.

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**is useful for better characterization of gastric varices, and also its therapeutic potential in the management of gastric varices has gained momentum in recent years.

- Noninvasive diagnostic methods such as **transient elastography**can be used to assess the severity of fibrosis in patient's or at risk of developing clinically significant portal vein hypertension (CSPH)

- Invasive diagnostic methods such as **HVPG measurement**can be used to diagnose CSPH and predict the development of gastric varices and estimate the risk of variceal bleeding.

- Imaging modalities such as **ultrasound of the liver, CT, or MRI**can be used make a diagnosis of cirrhosis and also to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

- **Hepatic Doppler sonography, CT or MRI angiography, venous phase celiac arteriography**can be used to assess the patency of the portal and splenic veins to rule out thrombosis.

- **Liver biopsy**should be considered in patients to assess the severity of fibrosis and to ascertain etiology in cirrhotic patients with negative laboratory workup.
