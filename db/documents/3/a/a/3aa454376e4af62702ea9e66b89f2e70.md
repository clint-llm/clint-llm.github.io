Carotid artery stenosis is a consequence of systemic atherosclerotic disease. Thus, any risk factor predisposing a patient to progressive atherosclerosis can potentially manifest itself as stenosis of the carotid artery with resultant ischemic stroke and or TIA like symptoms. Risks include smoking, hyperlipidemia, male gender, and age.

In a minority of patients, especially young females with stenosis of the carotid artery, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) plays a much more significant role. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic process affecting the carotid and renal arteries, although it can occur elsewhere in medium-sized vessels. Fibromuscular dysplasia usually occurs in the mid and distal internal carotid artery, sometimes extending into the intracranial region. Aneurysms may also be a component of the disease process.
