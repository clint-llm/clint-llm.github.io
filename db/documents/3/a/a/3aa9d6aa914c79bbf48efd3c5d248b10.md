The causes of renal mass are multifactorial. Specifically, studies have found that smoking increases RCC's risk in a dose-dependent fashion with renal cell carcinoma. Other classical precipitation agents such as benzene, herbicides, and vinyl are commonly known to increase carcinoma risk.

Furthermore, medications have also been implicated; A prospective study by Cho et al. showed that NSAIDs correlates with the increased risk of cancer.

Genetics plays a role in the formation of renal masses as well. The most common example is polycystic kidney disease. In this condition, there are autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms. The recessive form is more aggressive and often fatal. Both of these have a high potential for aggressive malignant kidney masses. Other examples of disorders associated with the development of renal masses include Von Hippel-Lindau and Birth-Hogg Dube syndromes.

Interestingly, medical pathologies such as hepatitis C and kidney stones are also associated with RCC.
