In addition to localized, cutaneous adverse effects, patients may experience adverse or even toxicity symptoms stemming from offending therapeutic agents as well. In the context of iontophoretic analgesia, the most used medicines are local anesthetics and fentanyl. With the use of local anesthetics (chiefly lidocaine and lidocaine/epinephrine), acute concerns arise for local adverse reactions and local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Cardiopulmonary symptoms include heart block, cardiac arrhythmia, respiratory insufficiency and arrest, and cardiac arrest. The central nervous system may similarly experience depression with symptoms such as tinnitus, ataxia, akathisia, seizures, altered levels of consciousness, and coma.

- Airway management with ventilation, oxygenation

- Cardiovascular support with epinephrine and antiarrhythmic agents

- Prophylaxis and suppression of seizures with benzodiazepines and succinylcholine

- Local anesthetic reduction from intravascular space with lipid-emulsion and bypass

With the use of fentanyl, patients may experience cardiopulmonary and CNS depressive symptoms as described before with LAST, however, due to its narrow therapeutic window and often systemic delivery, toxicity symptoms of more acute concern.

- Primary survey with airway, breathing, and circulatory support

- Administration of intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SQ), or intranasal (NAS) administration of naloxone

- If indicated, some special circumstances may require complementing the above regimen with activated charcoal, bowel irrigation, and buprenorphine.
