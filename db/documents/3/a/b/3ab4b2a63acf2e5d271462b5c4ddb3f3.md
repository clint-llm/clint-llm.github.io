Small bowel resection is done for many reasons. The surgery is usually performed by a general surgeon. However, the workup of patients with small bowel pathology usually involves an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, pathologist, surgeon, gastroenterologist, primary care provider, and nurse practitioner. Patients should be educated on the potential complications of surgery such as bowel leaks, strictures, deep vein thrombosis, abscess, and wound infections. Prior to surgery, the patient should be informed about the need for bowel preparation.
