Patients receiving atezolizumab are at risk of developing immune-mediated adverse reactions anytime during therapy and after treatment discontinuation. Early identification and management of imAEs are crucial in patients receiving atezolizumab.

- Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of exfoliative dermatological manifestations, autoimmune colitis, endocrinopathies, immune-mediated neurological and cardiovascular involvement.

- Laboratory tests such as blood glucose level, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function should be performed at baseline before initiation of treatment and during treatment to evaluate for new-onset diabetes, adverse reactions such as immune-mediated nephritis, immune-mediated hepatitis, and immune-mediated thyroid dysfunction, respectively.

- Atezolizumab must be held in Grade 2 immune-mediated adverse reactions and should be permanently discontinued in Grade 3 and Grade 4Â immune-mediated adverse reactions unless indicated by the oncology team.
