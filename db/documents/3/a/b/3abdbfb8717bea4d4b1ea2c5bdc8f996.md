The chances of a major complication can range from minimal for simple rib fractures to very likely if a major intervention is required or the degree of injury is significant. Given the number of vital structures in the chest, complications can frequently be significant, including damage to the vagus or phrenic nerves, the thoracic duct, or critical vascular structures with concomitant complications arising. The degree and mechanism of injury and the interventions taken to address them ultimately determine the type and severity of complications that may arise.
