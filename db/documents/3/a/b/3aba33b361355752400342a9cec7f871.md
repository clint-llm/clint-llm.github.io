Pheochromocytoma is a tumor that arises from chromaffin cells present in the adrenal medulla or paraganglion cells. It can present with vague symptoms like a headache (50%), palpitations (60%), and diaphoresis (50%) that can lead to a paroxysmal hypertensive crisis due to increased catecholamine production. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of pheochromocytoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing the best possible care for patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma.
- Describe the diagnostic approach for patients with pheochromocytoma.
- Outline the management of pheochromcytoma.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to provide optimal care for patients with pheochromocytoma,
