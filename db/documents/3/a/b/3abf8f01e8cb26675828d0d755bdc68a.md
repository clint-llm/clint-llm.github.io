Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) is commonly recognized as the classic example of pre-excitation, characterized by the presence of a delta wave with the presence of a short PR interval and a broad QRS complex on ECG. Multiple studies have evaluated the underlying pathway for WPW, which researchers call the bundle of Kent. The bundle of Kent takes the form of myocytes that bypass the AV node junction resulting in the direct activation of the ventricular myocardium by the accessory pathway. The current theory is that Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome may result from multiple underlying causes involving pathways that partially or completely bypass the AV node with subsequent normal conduction down the bundle of His. While WPW is commonly associated with the findings of a delta wave, this finding is typically absent in the Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern which only displays a short PR interval and a normal QRS complex on ECG.
