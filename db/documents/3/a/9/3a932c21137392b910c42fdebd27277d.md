The prognosis of napalm exposure varies markedly.  Most patients who die from exposure do so immediately by immolation, blast effect, or respiratory failure.  Those with a large surface area burn risk death by infection and multi-organ system failure in hours to days.  Patients with less severe burns will likely survive with treatment from burn centers and burn specialists.
