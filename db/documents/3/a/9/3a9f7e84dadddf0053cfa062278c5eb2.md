The child receives daily subcutaneous growth hormone (GH) injections, and are advised to take GH injections regularly, preferably within 1 hour of sleep every night, at a specific time, and not to miss more than one dose a month. The patient usually follows-up 2Â to 4 times a year. The growth rate is maximum in the first year of treatment, ranging from 8-10cm/year; this is called 'catch-up growth.' The growth rate slows in the next several years, called the 'waning effect.' If the growth rate is slower than expected, it warrants further investigation to rule out other medical conditions like Hypothyroidism or IBD. The treatment continues until the patient reaches her full adult height or reaches full bone maturity or has grown less than 2 cm in the last year.
