Hypospadias is an anatomical congenital malformation of the male external genitalia. It is characterized by abnormal development of the urethral fold and the ventral foreskin of the penis that causes abnormal positioning of the urethral opening. In hypospadias, the external urethral meatus may present various degrees of malpositioning and may be found with associated penile curvature. Depending on the location of the defect, patients may have an additional genitourinary malformation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hypospadias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the embryological abnormalities that lead to hypospadias.
- Outline the classification of hypospadias.
- Identify the interventions required once a patient has been identified with hypospadias.
- Describe the importance of prompt identification of hyspospadias in order to coordinate the appropriate timing for referral, imaging, and surgical interventions.
