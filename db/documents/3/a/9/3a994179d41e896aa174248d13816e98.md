Important differential diagnostic entities to consider when viewing possible ADH or ALH include usual ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, and flat epithelial atypia, with the most important distinguisher being whether a lesion is ADH or low-grade DCIS. These distinctions can be made on the histologic features as outlined above, noting that there are also difficult cases where particularly problematic borderline lesions may be diagnosed as “ADH bordering on DCIS” or “ADH suspicious for DCIS.”
