- Hypothenar hammer syndrome: Differentiate because there may be discoloration, fingertip ulcers, or splinter hemorrhages on the fourth or fifth digits. Angiogram may be able to diagnose this condition.

- Ulnar carpal impingement: Differentiate because this is commonly a result of ulnar shortening due to surgical resection from a prior injury.

- Ulnar extensor or flexor muscle tendonitis: Movements that cause the muscle to fire will provoke the pain. Pain may radiate along the muscle belly depending on the degree of inflammation.

- DRUJ chondral lesions or osteoarthritis: Differentiate via radiographic evidence suggestive of a chondral lesion or osteoarthritis.

- Ulnar styloid impingement syndrome: Symptoms consistent with TFCC injury, but the TFCC is intact.
