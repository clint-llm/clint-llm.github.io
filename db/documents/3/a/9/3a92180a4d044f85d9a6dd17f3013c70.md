Ampicillin is a widely prescribed antimicrobial by clinicians and other healthcare professionals working collaboratively as an interprofessional team. While the antimicrobial is effective, clinicians should not empirically prescribe for all infections as the resistance to this agent is increasing globally. Antimicrobial stewardship is a coordinated program that promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials. According to CDC, core elements of outpatient antimicrobial stewardship are commitment, action for policy and practice, tracking and reporting, education, and expertise.

Nephrology consultation is essential for hemodialysis. Pharmacists should verify dosing, look into the appropriateness of selecting ampicillin-sulbactam based on the infection type and available antibiogram data, and check for drug-drug interactions. In most cases, nurses administer this drug, monitor for adverse events, and assess therapeutic effectiveness, informing the clinician of their findings as treatment progresses. In the case of an overdose, emergency department physicians and nurses should rapidly stabilize the patient.

As outlined above, various healthcare providers, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, participate in an interprofessional team-based approach to optimize patient care. Additionally, antimicrobial stewardship is necessary for reducing global drug resistance. An observational study of eight years involving twenty-three antibiotics, including ampicillin, demonstrated that rates of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) could be reduced using interprofessional antimicrobial stewardship between clinicians, pharmacists, infection control nurses, and other healthcare professionals.
