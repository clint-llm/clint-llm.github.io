Conservative management: Lifestyle modification is the most effective, which includes weight loss, exercising, modifying dietary habits, foot care.

Medical management: Low dose aspirin, a statin, cilostazol (vasodilator for intermittent claudication), along with strict control of comorbid illnesses through antihypertensives and anti-hyperglycemic medications, with regimen compliance. Note: beta-blockers may exacerbate claudication.

Endovascular: Involves percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting. Hybrid procedures are being performed by vascular surgeons to improve outcomes and decrease mortality.

Surgical management: This includes bypass and endarterectomy. Amputation may be necessary in cases of unsalvageable tissues.

- Bypass, according to the site of obstruction - Superficial femoral artery occlusion - femoropopliteal (above the knee). Five-year patency is fifty to seventy-five percent. A bypass is more effective in proximal major arteries compared to distal.

- Infrapopliteal - Femoro-distal (below the knee). Five-year patency is fifty to sixty percent.

Great saphenous vein graft is most patent and has a low rate of infections. If the vein is unavailable, then prosthetic grafts such as ePTFE are used.

In other diseases such as Buerger disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), the first step in management is always smoking cessation.
