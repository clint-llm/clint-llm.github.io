As the prostate gland shares a close anatomical relationship with the bladder, it also shares a portion of the bladder’s blood supply.  The inferior vesical artery is the major blood supply for the prostate, and it also receives blood supply from the middle rectal and internal pudendal arteries.

Veins around the prostate form the prostatic plexus which drains into internal iliac veins. The prostate drains to the internal iliac lymph nodes and the sacral lymph nodes.
