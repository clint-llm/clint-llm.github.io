FSH is a glycoprotein dimer with alpha and beta subunits. The beta subunit is unique to FSH, while the alpha subunit is the same as in TSH, hCG, and LH.

GnRH stimulates FSH release. The hypothalamus produces GnRH, and it is released into the hypophyseal portal circulation to act on G-protein-coupled receptors at gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary. Those gonadotropic cells produce FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) and release them into the peripheral circulation.

GnRH release occurs in a pulsatile manner, with low pulse frequencies stimulating more FSH production and high pulse frequencies stimulating more LH production.

In women, negative feedback from estrogen levels inhibits FSH secretion.
