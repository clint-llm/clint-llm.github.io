Rapid Cycle Deliberate Practice has the potential to revolutionize simulation-based healthcare education. The broad impact of effective training models, such as RCDP, is significant. Through effective training of multiple levels of medical professionals, patients may ultimately receive higher quality medical care. Also, simulation allows learners to make mistakes in a controlled setting; this creates a safer clinical environment. The resuscitation and procedural skills are shown to be beneficial with teaching by RCDP are a vital piece of any medical professional's skillset.

RCDP represents an integration of several key educational principles. Mastery learning is a concept whereby the emphasis on comprehensive learning is on the individual. This concept involves an iterative process until the learner achieves mastery. An individual may take as long as they need to fulfill the prescribed mastery learning objectives. Unlike traditional learning methods, in which the time devoted to learning is more proscribed, time becomes the independent variable in mastery learning. RCDP adopts a similar approach with more time-variable learning.

Additionally, RCDP is also influenced by the concept of deliberate practice. Deliberate practice involves focusing on a specific area of weakness. Through this intentional approach, the learners can address particular areas of weakness, and learning of the overall skill is improved. RCDP repetitively applies deliberate practice. Repetitive learning has shown to be valuable in improving muscle memory and long-term memory development.

Overall, RCDP has been well-received by learners. In one study, qualitative statements reflected that learners "gained more confidence" as the exercise went on and improved teamwork. This method of teaching did meet with some criticism in the same study, however. Some participants commented upon their challenges with the exercise, including feeling "overwhelmed" with the numerous pauses.

A pre-briefing is another opportunity to normalize the change in simulation format for learners. Because there are often prescribed learning points, learners can expect stops and feedback, regardless of their performance; this alleviates the pressure for them to perform perfectly and allows them to make errors. Learners then have a unique opportunity to fix the errors as the simulation is re-performed and have a chance to apply instructor feedback immediately to the scenario. Thus, in the RCDP model, the faculty enters a role more similar to a coach than an instructor. These compound to potentially create a more psychologically safe environment for the learner.
