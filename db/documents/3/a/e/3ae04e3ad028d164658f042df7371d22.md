Spider veins are predominantly an aesthetic problem. One survey reported telangiectasias of the lower limb as the most concerning cosmetic problem for American women.

Patients may have one or more mentioned risk factors and could also have a history of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), including varicose veins or venous eczema. On examination, spider veins can appear as thin blue, red, or purple vessels depending if they are arterial or venous in origin and can be raised or flat. They can form anywhere on the body and at any age,Â although the majority of patients develop spider veins on their legs and face.
