Edema refers to excessive fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces, beneath the skin or within the body cavities caused by any of the following and producing significant signs and symptoms.

- An imbalance among the "Starling forces"

- Damage/blockage of the draining lymphatic system

The affected body part usually swells if edema is present beneath the skin or produces significant signs and symptoms related to the body cavity involved.

There are several different types of edema, and few important are the peripheral edema, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema, macular edema, and lymphedema. The atypical forms are the idiopathic edema and hereditary angioneurotic edema.

Pulmonary edema refers to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the alveolar walls and alveolar spaces of the lungs. It can be a life-threatening condition in some patients.

- Cardiogenic (disturbed starling forces involving the pulmonary vasculature and interstitium)

- Non-Cardiogenic (direct injury/damage to lung parenchyma/vasculature)
