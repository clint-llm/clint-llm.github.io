GPA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality either due to irreversible organ dysfunction or due to the consequences of intensive/prolonged use of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive agents. The average life expectancy for a patient with GPA without any treatment is 5 months, with a 1-year survival rate of less than 30%. In recent times more than 80% of patients who are treated are alive at least for eight to nine years. With advances in treatment, they have a higher long-term survival rate and have been able to lead a relatively normal life.

Even though the prognosis of GPA has significantly improved with the introduction of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, there is significant morbidity from the disease itself (86%) or due to side effects from the treatment (42%). Patients with severe renal involvement have a guarded prognosis and a higher rate of mortality.
