Obesity is a serious public health problem in the United States and globally, with an alarming increase in prevalence in the past few decades. The cause of primary obesity is an imbalance in nutritional intake versus energy expenditure. Secondary causes of obesity, like endocrine problems, genetic conditions, and head trauma, are less common but must be ruled out before making treatment recommendations.

While primary care clinicians make the diagnosis based on the history, physical examination, and review of growth charts, they should consult with an interprofessional team of specialists, including dieticians, nutrition specialists, psychologists, behavioral counselors, exercise specialists, endocrinologists, neurologists, and surgeons when appropriate. Nurse practitioners are vital to the interprofessional team, especially in pediatric primary care. They can teach and motivate the family and child to help them adopt positive health-related habits. These children require regular monitoring of height, weight, and BMI. Dieticians can educate about low-energy-dense and balanced dietary options to help parents and caregivers choose wisely. Exercise specialists can make age-appropriate recommendations for exercise and active play for the patient and family. Psychological problems may result in maladaptive eating patterns, and obesity is associated with depression, anxiety, and child behavior problems. School-based mental health professionals and behavioral counselors play a crucial role.

The expertise of the interprofessional team in pediatric weight management programs is the foundation of tertiary care consultation. When behavioral and pharmacologic interventions fail, pediatric or bariatric surgeons determine which children might benefit from a bariatric procedure. Consultations with endocrinology, neurology, and genetics may be necessary when secondary causes of obesity are present.
