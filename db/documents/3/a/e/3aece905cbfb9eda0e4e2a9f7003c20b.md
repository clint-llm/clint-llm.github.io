The normal intracranial pressure (ICP) ranges from 7 to 15 mm Hg, while in the vertical position, it does not exceed -15 mm Hg. Overnight sleep monitoring is considered the “gold standard” in conscious patients.

Typically, ICP lowering therapy initiates when ICP is greater than 20 to 25 mm Hg.

The application of multimodal monitoring (MMM) in conjunction with adherence to ICP-guided therapy has been the cornerstone in managing severe traumatic brain injury. Thus, ICP monitoring allows for judicious use of interventions with a defined target point, thereby avoiding potentially harmful aggressive treatment. Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines during patient care bundle approaches have shown positive outcomes as well as the minimized cost of acute care.
