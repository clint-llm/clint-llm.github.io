The obturator externus and internus are bilateral-triangular shaped muscles originating in the pelvis and inserting onto the greater trochanter of the femur. The obturator muscles work synergistically with surrounding muscles to provide hip mobility. Their primary function is external rotation of the hip. In addition, the obturator externus contributes to adduction of the flexed hip, while the obturator internus plays a role in the abduction of the flexed hip. ****

The obturator externus originates primarily from the bony margin of the obturator foramen, although it has been shown that some fibers originate from the obturator membrane.

Together, these findings suggest that the obturator externus may provide some reinforcement to the hip joint. The location of the obturator externus has also been shown to protect the medial circumflex femoral artery (MCFA). One study performed demonstrated that the obturator externus protected the deep branch of the MCFA from being damaged during hip dislocation in any direction.

The obturator internus has two points of origin. It originates from both the posterior surface of the obturator membrane and the rami surrounding the obturator foramen and inserts onto the greater trochanter of the femur.

It has been well established that the obturator internus is a “postural muscle” that holds the femoral head in the acetabulum.
