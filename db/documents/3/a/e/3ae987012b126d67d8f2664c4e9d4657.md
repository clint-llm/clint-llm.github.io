Chloramphenicol is associated with severe hematological side effects when administered systemically. Since 1982, chloramphenicol has reportedly caused fatal aplastic anemia, with possible increased risk when taken together with cimetidine. This adverse side effect can occur even with the topical administration of the drug, which is most likely due to the systemic absorption of the drug after topical application.

There are two different types of chloramphenicol-induced blood dyscrasias. The first type is more common and is predictable, dose-related, and reversible. It causes mild anemia, with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The second form is an idiosyncratic reaction that has a later onset and is more likely to be fatal after pancytopenia develops. This type is unpredictable, irreversible, and dose-independent.

Besides causing fatal aplastic anemia and bone marrow suppression, other side effects of chloramphenicol include ototoxicityÂ with the use of topical ear drops, gastrointestinal reactions such as oesophagitis with oral use, neurotoxicity, and severe metabolic acidosis.

Optic neuritis is the most commonly associated neurotoxic complication that can arise from chloramphenicol use.
