Tapia syndrome is a rare disease characterized by concurrent unilateral hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. The injury mechanism is closely related to airway manipulation leading to direct compression or excessive stretch of the nerves. Diagnosis is made through a process of exclusion and can be challenging for clinicians due to its relative infrequency. This article reviews Tapia's syndrome's etiology and pathophysiology with particular attention to the interprofessional team's role in the evaluation and treatment of patients suffering this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of Tapia syndrome.
- Describe the relevant anatomy of the hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerves concerning Tapia syndrome.
- Identify the main diagnostic tests for Tapia syndrome.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies that can improve care coordination and better outcomes for patients with Tapia syndrome.
