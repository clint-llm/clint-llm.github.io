Cervical nerves are spinal nerves that arise from the cervical region of the spinal cord. These nerves conduct motor and sensory information via efferent and afferent fibers, respectively, to and from the central nervous system. While classified as peripheral nerves, the motor cell body resides in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. There are eight pairs of cervical nerves, denoted C1 to C8, that emerge from the spinal cord superior to their corresponding vertebrae, except for C8 that exits inferiorly to the C7 vertebra. These nerves intertwine through plexuses that give rise to peripheral nerves that maintain a significant motor function in the head, neck, upper limbs, and diaphragm, as well as sensation in the head, neck, shoulders, and upper limbs in a dermatomal pattern.
