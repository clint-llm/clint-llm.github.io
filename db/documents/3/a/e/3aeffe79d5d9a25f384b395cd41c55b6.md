Vasectomy is an elective procedure for male sterilization and pregnancy prevention. Therefore, the performing physician must talk about the risks, benefits, and alternatives. The decision should not be made lightly or hastily. When discussing with patients, the permanency of the procedure needs to be stressed. Generally, the recommendation is that both the patient and partner should be involved in this decision, but ultimately, only the consent of the patient undergoing vasectomy is absolutely necessary. While a vasectomy can be reversed, this should not be used as an argument to have the vasectomy performed.  If a patient is considering a vasectomy and is not sure that this is an acceptable, permanent solution for him, then he should not have the procedure.  The most common reason for men requesting a vasectomy reversal is divorce and remarriage.
