The stylopharyngeus muscle originates from the medial side of the base of a bony projection from the temporal bone, i.e., the styloid process.

Some of the fibers of the stylopharyngeus muscle become lost in the superior and middle constrictor muscles. Some fibers merge with the lateral glossoepiglottic fold while others join with the fibers of the palatopharyngeal muscle and insert into the posterior border of the thyroid cartilage/lamina.

The stylopharyngeus muscle has a topographical relationship with the piriform recess, which is the major route for pharyngeal swallowing and serves as the largest pocket providing post-deglutition retention. The lateral border of this recess (lateral glossoepiglottic fold or pharyngoepiglottic fold) is composed of the stylopharyngeus muscle and the palatopharyngeus muscle.

The ninth cranial nerve curves around the posterolateral border of the stylopharyngeus muscle to pass between the superior and middle constrictor muscles and reach the tongue.
