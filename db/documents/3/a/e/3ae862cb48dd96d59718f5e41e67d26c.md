Children with scalp swelling, especially those under the age of three, warrant urgent evaluation. If the swelling remains persistent and there are associated neurological signs, the child should immediately be assessed by a pediatric neurologist or a neurosurgeon. The optimum management of a leptomeningeal cyst requires an interprofessional approach involving several specialists, such as an emergency physician, pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, pediatric neurosurgeon, pediatric epilepsy specialist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and speech therapist. In addition, as a result of the fact that neurological deficits can result in mental retardation, speech problems, weakness, and emotional distress in the parents, it is necessary to consult with a psychologist or psychiatrist. Interprofessional care coordination with open communication channels will yield the best results for these patients. [Level 5]
