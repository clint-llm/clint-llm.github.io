Summary of Guidelines

- Psoriasis is considered extensive when more than 10% BSA is involved

- When the condition occurs on the face, nails, scalp, genitals, flexures, and soles- it is also considered severe as these areas are hard to treat and associated with poor cosmesis.

- Biological therapy should be considered early if methotrexate is not well tolerated or in patients with active severe psoriasis.

- Assess response to treatment by noting a reduction in baseline disease severity and improvement in physical, social, and psychological functioning.

- Ustekinumab is the first line biological agent of choice. Secukinumab is another alternative

- Adalimumab is the first line biological agent of choice in patients with psoriaticÂ arthropathy

- Infliximab is reserved for patients with severe disease in whom other biological agents cannot be used

- Women of childbearing age who are started on a biological agent should start effective contraception.

- Live vaccines are to be avoided in people taking biological agents. All vaccinations must be completed before starting biological agents.

- Patients with demyelinating disorders should not be treated with TNF antagonists

- Patients with heart failure should not be treated with TNF antagonists
