The management of patients with Alexander disease is best when using an interprofessional team that includes primary care doctors, neurologists, neurosurgeons, feeding specialists, physical therapists, geneticists, urologists, radiologists, and pathologists. The patient most often presents during the infantile period. The diagnosis of Alexander disease is made based on imaging features and clinical presentation and then typically confirmed genetically.

The treatment of Alexander disease is largely supportive. It is centered upon controlling seizures, spasticity, mobility problems, hypotonia, scoliosis, obstructive hydrocephalus, dysphagia, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and reflux), failure to thrive, and urinary retention. This requires a wide range of specialties with a clear understanding of treatment goals.

Open communication between the interprofessional is essential for improving outcomes. It is necessary to schedule periodic checks to assess the state of growth, the nutritional structure, the neurological status and to prevent potential complications. In addition to the vast spectrum of physical manifestations, the psychological aspects should not be underestimated. In this regard, it may be important to design interventions for the improvement of communication skills and strategies focused on the patient and parents.
