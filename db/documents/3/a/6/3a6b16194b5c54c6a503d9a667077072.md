It is crucial to consider an underlying thyroid disease as a cause of the patient's symptoms of hyperthyroidism. A thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) level should be checked to rule out Graves disease. Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules should also be a consideration, but these would present with a high level of radioiodine uptake at the nuclear imaging of the thyroid. However, a diagnosis of preexisting thyroid disease does not preclude the diagnosis of Jod Basedow syndrome. In many instances, some underlying thyroid disease is a risk factor for developing iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. A detailed medical history is critical for establishing the correlation of the symptoms with exposure to ICM or other iodinated substances.
