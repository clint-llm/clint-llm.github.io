Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is considered to be a relatively safe procedure when performed by a trained physician. There is disagreement in the literature and among experts in the field about the presence of absolute and relative contraindications to the use of transesophageal echocardiography. However, many practitioners agree that the following conditions are

**Absolute**

- Perforated viscous

- Esophageal pathology including stricture, trauma, tumor, scleroderma, Mallory-Weiss tear, diverticulum

- Active upper gastrointestinal bleeding

- Recent upper gastrointestinal surgery

- Previous esophagectomy or esophagogastrectomy

- Unrepaired tracheoesophageal fistula

- Poor airway control

- Severe respiratory depression

- Uncooperative, unsedated patient

**Relative**

- Atlantoaxial joint disease

- Severe cervical arthritis

- Prior radiation to the chest

- Symptomatic hiatal hernia

- Recent upper gastrointestinal bleed

- Presence of esophagitis or peptic ulcer disease

- Thoracoabdominal aneurysm

- Barrett's esophagus

- History of dysphagia

- Coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia

- History of esophageal or gastric surgery

- History of esophageal cancer Esophageal varices or diverticulum

- Vascular ring, aortic arch anomaly with or without airway compromise

- Oropharyngeal pathology

- Post-gastrostomy or fundoplication limit imaging to esophageal windows

According to the 2010 American Society of Anesthesiologists and Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Practice Guidelines for Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography, TEE may be utilized in patients with oral, esophageal, or gastric conditions if the expected benefit is greater than the potential risk and if the necessary precautions are followed. These include limiting the exam or its duration, the avoidance of unnecessary probe manipulations, having the exam performed by the most experienced echocardiographer, acquiring a gastroenterology consult, and the consideration of other imaging options such as TTE or epicardial echocardiography.
