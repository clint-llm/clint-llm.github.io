On histology, the examination of affected tissue reveals dermal sheets of von Hansemann cells and a variable mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Von Hansemann cells are enlarged foamy histiocytes with an eccentric, hyperchromatic nucleus and eosinophilic granules. Michaelis-Gutmann bodies are intracytoplasmic laminated concretions that represent accumulations of calcified, iron-containing phagolysosomes thought to be partially degraded bacterial organisms. Michaelis-Gutmann bodies are pathognomonic for this condition. They can stain positive with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Perlâ€™s stain, and von Kossa stain.
