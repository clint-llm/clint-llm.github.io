Optical coherence tomography (OCT) helps in evaluating the optic disc anomaly. Studies have shown a well-defined epiretinal membrane pulling the retina centripetally.

Rajendran and Kumar described the spectral domain OCT features and observed that the dominant movement during contraction was the anterior movement of the walls of the peripapillary excavation.

Cennamo et al. have described the OCT angiography features in patients with contractile optic discs in MGS. They found a dense microvascular network in the peripapillary capillary layer with no difference between the superficial vascular plexus and the deep vascular plexus around the optic nerve.

Lytvynchuk LM et al. reported a case of intraoperative OCT-assisted pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment in MGS. There was no break. They found strong vitreous traction and adhesion above the optic disc and macula, which was the cause of the retinal detachment. They induced a vitreous detachment, peeled the epiretinal and internal limiting membrane, and gave an air tamponade, leading to retinal reattachment.

Peripheral capillary nonperfusion has been reported in MGS.

The diagnosis of MGS is mainly clinical, but sometimes the diagnosis can be confusing. MGS should be distinguished from optic disc coloboma. Optic disc coloboma may be associated with multisystemic congenital syndromes.

MGS can be associated with systemic anomalies. The abnormalities of the face and central nervous system should be recognized. Facial abnormalities could be capillary hemangiomas, hypertelorism, cleft lip, and cleft palate.

These defects can be misdiagnosed as nasal polyps; it is thus important not to biopsy such lesions. These encephaloceles can be treated surgically. Another associated central nervous system abnormality is agenesis of the corpus callosum.

Moyamoya disease may be associated with MGS. It is characterized by abnormal narrowing of the cerebral arteries, which can result in cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. This association was first described by Hanson et al. in 1985. Since then, many cases have been reported.

Moyamoya disease can cause stroke, seizures, intellectual impairment, and transient ischemic attacks. Patients can present with decreased vision before the onset of cerebral dysfunction. Thus all patients with MGS should be evaluated for Moyamoya disease. Also, in patients with Moyamoya disease, a retinal examination should be done. It is essential for both neurologists and ophthalmologists to be aware of the association between cerebrovascular disease and ocular manifestations to achieve a diagnosis.

Renal coloboma syndrome (RCS) or papillorenal syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by optic nerve dysplasia and renal hypodysplasia.
