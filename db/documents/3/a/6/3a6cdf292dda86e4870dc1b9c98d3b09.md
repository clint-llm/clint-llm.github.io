There are three ways in which MAOI toxicity can occur: drug-food interaction, overdose, or drug-drug interactions.

- The most common MAOI toxicity involves the interaction with tyramine-containing foods. When MAO found in the gut and liver is inhibited, dietary tyramine indirectly causes an amplification of adrenergic activity. Food rich in tyramine includes aged cheeses, aged/picked/smoked meats, beer, wine, yeast extracts, ginseng, sauerkraut, and avocado.

- MAOIs have a low therapeutic index. Ingestion of 2 mg/kg of a first generation, non-selective MAOI inhibitors such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, or tranylcypromine has the potential for severe toxicity. MAOI overdose may see a delay in symptoms of several hours or more.

- MAOI toxicity can be seen when a MAOI is combined with any drug that increases the synthesis, release, and effect or decreases the metabolism or reuptake of monoamines. These drugs include but are not limited to, dextromethorphan, linezolid, methylene blue, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotoninergic agents, and tramadol
