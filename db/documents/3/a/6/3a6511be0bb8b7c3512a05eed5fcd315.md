An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to diagnosis and treating patients with clinodactyly is imperative. By correctly diagnosing and recognizing surgical indications for clinodactyly, primary care physicians can help avoid the added healthcare costs of possible unnecessary testing, advanced imaging studies, and consultations. The vast majority of cases of clinodactyly can be treated with observation. When more severe cases present, it is important to consult a surgical specialist for any surgical intervention that may be indicated.
