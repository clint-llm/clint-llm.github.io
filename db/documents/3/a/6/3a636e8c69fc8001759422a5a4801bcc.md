Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are genes in major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) that help code for proteins that differentiate between self and non-self. They play aÂ significant role in disease and immune defense. They are beneficial to the immune system but can also have detrimental effects. Some of the immune system effects are the interaction with complement, the cytotoxic effect of T cells, and cellular humoral immunity. Additionally, they play a role in autoimmunity and continue to be the target of researchers for their further effects and interactions.
