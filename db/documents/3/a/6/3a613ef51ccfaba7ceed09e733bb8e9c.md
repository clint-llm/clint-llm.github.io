Monitoring for signs of an infusion reaction is necessary duringÂ infusions with bevacizumab. Additional monitoring includes CBC with differential, blood pressure monitoring every 2 to 3 weeks, and tracking for proteinuria. Patients also require monitoring for signs of GI perforation, epistaxis, and arterial and venous thromboembolism. When bevacizumab is used off-label for diabetic macular edema, clinicians should watch for intraocular pressure, visual acuity, and signs of cataracts and retinal detachment. Monitor for severe hemorrhage, wound healing complications, GI fistulae, non-GI fistulae, hypertension, and ovarian failure.****The healthcare team should monitor for signs of fluid overload and heart failure.
