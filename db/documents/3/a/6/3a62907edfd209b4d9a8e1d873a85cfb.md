The long axis of the cervix is rarely in line with the long axis of the body of the uterus. Commonly, the long axis of the body of the uterus is tilted forward over the long axis of the cervix, which is called anteflexion of the uterus. A backward tilt at this level is called retroflection. In 80 percent of women, the long axis of the uterus lies at the right angle to the long axis of the vagina with a forward tilt. It is called anteversion retroversion, which is present in 20 percent of women and is a backward tilt of the uterus over the vagina.

The uterus may also vary in size and shape depending on the reproductive phase of the female and its response to the female sex hormones.

- Pre-pubertal age: Uterus is small, and the cervix is longer than the body. The cervix-to-body ratio is 2:1.

- Reproductive age: Mature size, the body is bigger than the cervix, and the cervix-to-body ratio is 1:2.

- Post-menopausal: The uterus is atrophic, and the body size is smaller than the cervix. The cervix-to-body ratio is 2:1.

Also, a nulliparous uterus is usually smaller than a multiparous uterus. Furthermore, as the femaleÂ reaches menopause, the uterus starts to atrophy chiefly due to a lack of hormonal stimulation and loss of menstruation.
