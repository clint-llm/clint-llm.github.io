Complications due to 17-hydroxylase deficiency vary depending on disease severity and therapy. Severely affected patients may have hypertension and hypokalemia even with glucocorticoid therapy and require additional therapy. If excess glucocorticoid therapy is received, the patient can develop symptoms such as obesity, abdominal striae, hyperglycemia, and other findings similar to Cushing disease.
