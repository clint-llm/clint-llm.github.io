Relapsing polychondritis primarily involves cartilaginous structures, suggesting that immune mechanisms are acting against proteoglycan -- the main constituent of cartilage. Circulating and tissue-specific antibodies against collagen types II, IX and XI are seen in patients with relapsing polychondritis. In addition to humoral immunity, cellular immunity propagates inflammation of the cartilage. CD4+ cells secrete cytokines such as interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 which leads to the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages. Macrophages release proteolytic enzymes, metalloproteinase (MMP-3), cathepsin L and K which leads to the destruction of cartilage. In the early stages of disease, there is polymorphic inflammatory cell infiltration; later there is chondrocyte apoptosis, focal calcification, and fibrosis of the cartilage.
