Hydroa vacciniforme is a very rare disorder with no cure. The most significant risk is its transformation into a lymphoma. Also, due to the considerable psychosocial and emotional morbidity caused by hydroa vacciniforme, it is imperative to take an interprofessional approach in the management of these patients.

It is crucial to consider coordination with a psychologist, mental health nurse, or psychiatrist because this disease occurs during the formative years of childhood development and significantly affects facial aesthetics.

All clinicians, including nurses and pharmacists, should educate the patient on avoiding hot temperatures and the sun. When going out, the patient should wear long-sleeved garments, a wide brim hat, and sunglasses. Patients should be told to avoid alternative care remedies since there is a risk of aggravating the skin condition. Pharmacists can coordinate with the physician and nursing staff to recommend optimal sun-screening products. Nurses must be aware of watching for signs of malignant transformation, in the rare event that it happens, and communicate to the managing clinician immediately. This type of interprofessional team approach is crucial to optimizing outcomes. [Level 5]

All patients need lifelong monitoring; for those that exhibit signs of hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma, early detection is paramount and prompt referral with a hematologist/oncologist may be beneficial to survival.
