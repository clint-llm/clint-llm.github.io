Mastoiditis can subdivide into three different categories based on the mechanism of infection, as detailed below:

- Incipient Mastoiditis: Infection of the mastoid air cells alone with no continuation with the middle ear cavity.

- Acute Coalescent Mastoiditis (most common presentation): Inflammation of the epithelial lining with erosion through the boney septations of the mastoid air cells. This erosion can progress to intracavity abscess formation, which can extend further to adjacent structures.

- Subacute Mastoiditis: Persistent middle ear infection or recurrent episodes of acute otitis media with inadequate antimicrobial therapy lead to persistent infection of the middle ear and mastoid air cells resulting in erosion of boney septations between mastoid air cells.
