- Syringomyelia(SM) should be considered high in the differential diagnosis in any young person with progressive scoliosis. Early identification and treatment can cause a reversal of deformity.

- Hand involvement in syringomyelia patients is often asymmetric as the syrinx cavity itself is eccentric in most cases.

- It is important for clinicians to distinguish Chiari headaches from other similar appearing headaches. History taking skills play a crucial role.

- History of a long duration of a headache and pain relief by neck support can help in identifying headaches originating in neck muscles that may extend into the suboccipital area.
- Posterior fossa brain tumors may produce similar headaches and also cause tonsillar descent. However, these headaches are of prolonged duration and have associated projectile vomiting. Fundoscopy in these patients may also reveal papilledema.
- Headaches in fibromyalgia patients may also mimic Chiari headaches.

- Being a chronic disorder, a patient with syringomyelia not uncommonly has symptoms of anxiety, memory impairment, depression. The clinician is obligated to assess all symptoms with the right perspective, particularly the possibility of a specific symptom being mitigated by surgery.

**Challenges/Pitfalls**

Identifying and distinguishing the root cause of deficits in post-traumatic syringomyelia, the syrinx cavity, or cord injury itself, remains a challenge.
