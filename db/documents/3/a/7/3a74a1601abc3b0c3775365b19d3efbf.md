If a forearm fracture and/or dislocation are suspected, radiographs are warranted. An anteroposterior and lateral view will usually identify the injury. An additional oblique view may help better classify the injury. Additional radiographs of the distal wrist and proximal elbow should be obtained with any suspicion of coexistent injury.

Advanced imaging is not usually indicated on initial assessment. For pre-operative planning computed tomography (CT) may be utilized to evaluate for non-union and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help assess for TFCC tears and interosseous membrane disruption.
