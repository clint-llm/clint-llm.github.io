Sertoli cell-only syndrome and maturational arrest are best managed by an experienced interprofessional team, including OB-GYN, infertility specialists, urologists, primary care, genetic counseling, psychologists, and nurses. While the diagnosis is not difficult, the treatment can be lengthy, costly, and often unsatisfactory for couples who want to conceive, as the overall success rate for bringing a pregnancy to term is only about 10%. All team members must document their observations on the case so that other team members can access the same data and contribute from their area of expertise appropriately. Open communication between team members is essential to drive the patient outcomes to their optimal endpoint. [Level 5]

Currently, there is no specific treatment or cure for Sertoli cell-only syndrome or maturation arrest. However, in many cases, patients with very low sperm counts can still be considered for testicular sperm extraction (TESE) techniques and ICSI. TESE allows the removal of sperm from the patient's testes. The sperm can then be used to fertilize an egg via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Some studies have shown that recovery may be better with higher FSH levels in the blood, but this is not considered a reliable finding. Karyotype analysis, genetic testing, and counseling are important components of patient care. Patients also need to be informed that these procedures can be prohibitively expensive, are not covered by insurance, and do not guarantee fertility or a successful outcome.
