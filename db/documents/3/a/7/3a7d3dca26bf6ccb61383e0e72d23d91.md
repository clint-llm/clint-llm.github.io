Classically, optic neuritis occurs in a younger, white patient and will present with an episode of acute onset, painful, monocular vision loss, with a relative afferent pupillary defect in the affected eye. The clinical exam of a patient with acute optic neuritis should always have the visual acuity, pupils, and intraocular pressure tested, followed by a thorough neuro-ophthalmic exam. A fundus exam will typically reveal optic nerve head elevation on the affected side.

Due to the recent literature highlighting the less common but more sinister causes of optic neuritis such as NMOSD or MOG, patients with acute optic neuritis should be specifically asked additional questions on the review of systems. If the patient suffers from intractable hiccups, unexplained nausea or vomiting, or symptomatic narcolepsy, these could be clues that the optic neuritis may be caused by NMOSD.

NMOSD may alternatively present less classically, and the AQP4-IgG can be present in other disorders. These disorders can present as isolated longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis, brainstem clinical manifestations, brainstem encephalitis, monophasic optic neuritis, or recurrent optic neuritis.
