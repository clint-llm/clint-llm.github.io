Managing fibrous dysplasia involves an interprofessional team approach, primarily with pediatrics/primary care, orthopedics, and radiology.  Genetics and endocrinology should be added for cases of McCune-Albright syndrome. Craniofacial involvement should prompt neurology, ophthalmology, audiology, and possible neurosurgery consultation.
