PKU is a rare, metabolic disorder that is often detected at birth. Because of its high morbidity, healthcare workers including nurse practitioners must be aware of the screening test available to identify this disorder. In the United States, PKU is usually detected at birth by newborn screening tests and dietary therapy started in consultation with a dietitian and geneticist/metabolism specialist. Mild forms of PKU in a newborn can, however, go undetected if the mother is discharged too soon or if the newborn has not consumed any protein. The outcomes for infants treated at birth are good, but recent evidence suggests that a significant number of children may still have residual cognitive deficits despite early treatment.
