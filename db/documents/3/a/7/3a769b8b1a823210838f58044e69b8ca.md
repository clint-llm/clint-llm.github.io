Neuroleptics, also known as antipsychotic medications, are used to treat and manage symptoms of many psychiatric disorders. They fall into two classes: first-generation or "typical" antipsychotics and second-generation or "atypical" antipsychotics. Both first and second-generation antipsychotics are used in various neuropsychiatric conditions. These include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), behavioral disturbances in dementia, geriatric agitation, depression, eating disorders, personality disorders, insomnia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use and dependence disorders. For many of these conditions, the evidence for their use is equivocal. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications of neuroleptics and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the safer prescription of these drugs.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of neuroleptics.
- Describe the adverse effects of neuroleptics.
- Summarize the indicated and off-label use of neuroleptics.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safer prescribing of neuroleptics and improve outcomes.
