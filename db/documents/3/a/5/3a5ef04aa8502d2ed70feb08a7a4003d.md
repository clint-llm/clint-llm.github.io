Several chemotherapy antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and mitotic inhibitors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of anagen effluvium. Doxorubicin, the nitrosoureas, and cyclophosphamide have been implicated too. Several other drugs such as isoniazid (INH), levodopa, colchicine, cyclosporine, and toxic heavy metals such as thallium, mercury, boron, bismuth, copper, and cadmium have also been implicated in triggering anagen effluvium. Anagen effluvium can also be seen in inflammatory disorders such as alopecia areata, and syphilis secondary to inflammatory insult to the hair bulb. Pemphigus vulgaris can also cause anagen effluvium, as desmosomal proteins are expressed in the epithelium of the hair follicle. Anagen effluvium has also been described following severe protein-energy malnutrition states (e.g., Kwashiorkor). Radiation has also been shown to cause both reversible and permanent alopecia. Permanent destruction of the hair follicle occurs when hair follicle stem cells are damaged, and this usually occurs with greater than 30 Gy of deep x-rays.

Anagen effluvium has been described in a 2-year old male with severe hypotension and hypoxia requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Anagen effluvium is most often secondary to chemotherapy, but it has also been associated with radiotherapy, heavy metal poisoning, protein malnutrition, or systemic diseases. Any of these factors may cause abrupt cessation of mitosis in the hair matrix.
