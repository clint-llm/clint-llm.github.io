Hyperhidrosis is a disorder of excessive sweating due to the overstimulation of cholinergic receptors on eccrine glands. This disorder is characterized by sweating beyond what the body uses for homeostatic temperature regulation. Eccrine glands are concentrated in areas such as the axillae, palms, soles, and face; therefore, these are the areas most commonly associated with hyperhidrosis. This activity describes the pathophysiology of hyperhidrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hyperhidrosis.
- Recall the workup of a patient with hyperhidrosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for hyperhidrosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperhidrosis.
