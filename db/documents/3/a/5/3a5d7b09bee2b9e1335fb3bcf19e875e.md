Patients will present with pain and swelling localized to the involved metatarsal head region of the forefoot. They will describe the sensation they are walking on something hard such as a stone. The onset of symptoms is typically gradual, with no specific acute event. The patients will describe their symptoms worse with walking, especially when barefoot or wearing shoes with an elevated heel.

On physical exam, the affected toe may have a swollen appearance, especially near the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint.
