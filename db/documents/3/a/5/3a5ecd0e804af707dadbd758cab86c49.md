History and physical examination show abnormalities associated with an underlying intracardiac congenital heart defect such as tetralogy of Fallot or truncus arteriosus. Without an underlying intracardiac congenital heart defect, the cardiac physical examination in a patient with a right aortic arch is normal. Symptoms of a vascular ring include a history of recurrent croup and an examination finding of stridor, more often noted in double aortic arch forms of vascular rings. The history of dysphagia is a more common finding in the right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian form of a vascular ring. In "loose vascular rings," the patient could remain asymptomatic over their lifetime.
