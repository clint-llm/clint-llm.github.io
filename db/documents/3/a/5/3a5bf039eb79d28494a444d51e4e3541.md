Kaposi sarcoma: The gold standard of diagnosis is a skin biopsy for histopathology. The macular or patch, plaque, nodular KS lesions all vary in histology. However, the presence of spindle-shaped cells is confirmatory and is seen in all forms of KS. The typical characteristics of spindle cells are elongated cytoplasm and nuclei, which may have inclusions of hyaline or hemosiderin.

Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD): The lymph node histology typically shows germinal center expansion and proliferation of vascular endothelium. The infected cells significantly express IL-6.

Primary effusion lymphomas (PELs): The typical PEL histological features are consistent with anaplastic large cell and large cell immunoblastic lymphomas and significantly express CD45.
