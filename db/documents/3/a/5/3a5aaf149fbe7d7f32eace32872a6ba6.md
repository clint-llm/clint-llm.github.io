Opioids and opiates together comprise a class of medications that are widely used primarily to control severe pain. The first-line medications for mild to moderate acute pain treatment are Acetaminophen or NSAIDs. If these first-line agents are not effective to control the pain, we can use medications that target different pathways like combinations of acetaminophen and opioid. Severe acute pain is treated with potent opioids.
