Periodontal abscesses are either directly related to periodontal disease or are independent of it, developing in periodontal pocket-free sites.

Local factors that increase the risk of a periodontal abscess include invaginated tooth, root grooves, cracked tooth, and external root resorption.

Prescribing systemic antimicrobials without mechanical debridement to treat patients with periodontal disease has also been linked to periodontal abscesses.

The microbiology of a periodontal abscess is remarkably similar to that of periodontal disease - mainly gram-negative anaerobic bacteria (GNABS). The most prevalent bacteria found in periodontal abscesses are Porphyromonas gingivalis ranging in prevalence from 50 to 100%.Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema species, Campylobacter species, Capnocytophaga species, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and gram-negative enteric rods.
