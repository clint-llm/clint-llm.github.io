The incidence of alveolar osteitis varies significantly in current literature, reported between 0.5% and 68%. Studies with larger patient populations trend towards a lower incidence, commonly less than 5%.

There is a significantly higher incidence of alveolar osteitis in lower third molars than in all other dental extraction sites combined. The alveolus of posterior mandibular teeth, specifically the third molars, has greater vascularity when compared to the anterior teeth. This finding contradicts the belief that alveolar osteitis is triggered by a lack of blood supply, which is the most common hypothesis to explain why alveolar osteitis is much less common in the maxilla.

Although there is conflicting data, many studies found that patient age and female gender increased the incidence of alveolar osteitis. The prevalence was similar worldwide, and there were no documented differences in ethnicity.

Many studies show a statistically significant increase in alveolar osteitis in female patients taking oral contraceptive pills or mid-menstrual cycle, explaining the higher incidence of alveolar osteitis in females. The increased incidence of alveolar osteitis in patients taking oral contraceptives is likely a result of decreased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor and increased levels of plasminogen. This results in increased fibrinolysis and supports Birn’s fibrinolytic theory.

Several other risk factors for developing AO have been investigated, including tobacco use, poor oral hygiene, lack of operator experience, flap design, and difficulty of extraction. These factors have support in multiple publications, but the role of most others has not been demonstrated.
