Stewart-Treves syndrome was first described when Drs. Fred Stewart and Norman Treves reported a case series describing 6 patients with lymphangiosarcoma in the setting of chronic lymphedema status post mastectomy. Although the majority of cases reported are a result of post-mastectomy lymphedema, the development of angiosarcoma has been associated with chronic lymphedema of any origin. Proper diagnosis of angiosarcoma is important due to the occurrence of metastatic spread and poor prognosis.
