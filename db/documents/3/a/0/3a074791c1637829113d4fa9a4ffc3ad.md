The most clinically significant sequelae of C1 inhibitor deficiency is the potential for laryngeal edema and subsequent asphyxiation due to angioedema from unchecked bradykinin effects. The pathophysiology of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency largely stems from the increased bradykinin production. Increased levels of bradykinin then lead to smooth muscle relaxation in the walls of blood vessels which causes edema. If severe enough, the airway can be compromised and effectively swollen closed, preventing air movement into and out of the lungs.
