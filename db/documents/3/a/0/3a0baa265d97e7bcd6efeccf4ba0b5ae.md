Pseudomembranous candidiasis, also known as oral thrush, is the classic and most common presentation of oral candidiasis, but several other types exist. Candidiasis can appear in the oral cavity as white or erythematous lesions.

**Acute Pseudomembranous Candidiasis**

Pseudomembranous candidiasis is the most frequently encountered oral candidiasis, accounting for a third of cases.

It typically presents with extensive white patches that can be easily removed with gauze, leaving an erythematous mucosa surface.

**Hyperplastic Candidiasis**

Hyperplastic candidiasis presents as slightly raised and well-circumscribed white plaques, usually on the buccal mucosa, which may extend to the labial commissures.

Hyperplastic candidiasis has the potential to evolve into severe dysplasia or malignancy.

**Acute Atrophic Candidiasis**

Acute atrophic candidiasis presents as a generalized or localized erythema on the oral mucosa,

Acute atrophic candidiasis is frequently secondary to treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

**Chronic Atrophic Candidiasis**

Chronic atrophic candidiasis, also known as denture stomatitis, is localized erythema of the oral mucosa under dentures.

Lesions are typically edematous and erythematous and limited to the area in contact with the denture.

The clinical aspect of denture stomatitis can be classified into three types. In type I, there is petechial hemorrhage and local inflammation; in type II, there is erythema of the mucosa under the dentures; in type III, there is erythema of the central area of the hard palate or papillary hyperplasia of the oral mucosa under the denture.

The condition is often asymptomatic, but patients may report a sore mouth or oral burning.

**Median Rhomboid Glossitis**

Median rhomboid glossitis is a very rare type of oral candidiasis, occurring in less than 1% of the population.

A concomitant erythematous lesion can develop on the palate directly opposite the tongue's lesion, known as a "kissing" lesion, which frequently signifies immunosuppression. The kissing lesion is a potential HIV marker, and further investigations should be performed.

**Angular Cheilitis**

Angular cheilitis presents as erythematous fissured patches in one or both commissures of the mouth, but it is typically bilateral.Candida growth. But, bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal species, are also isolated from the lesions.

**Linear Gingival Erythema**

Linear gingival erythema is typically seen in HIV patients and may even reveal how the disease progresses.Candida and bacterial infections participate in its development.
