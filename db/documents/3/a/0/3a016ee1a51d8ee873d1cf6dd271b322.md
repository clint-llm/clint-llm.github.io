Toxicity from muscarinic receptor antagonists can manifest when patients consume medications or products with anticholinergic muscarinic properties. Such products include Belladonna plants and Jimson weed, which contain muscarinic receptor antagonists, such as atropine and scopolamine. Medications with anticholinergic properties can induce toxicity, such as tricyclic antidepressants (i.e., amitriptyline, imipramine), atypical antipsychotics (i.e., quetiapine, clozapine), and first-generation antihistamines (i.e., promethazine). Clinical features of muscarinic receptor antagonist toxicity include dry mouth, blurry vision, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mydriasis, delirium, and hallucinations. Physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used as the antidote for muscarinic antagonist toxicity.
