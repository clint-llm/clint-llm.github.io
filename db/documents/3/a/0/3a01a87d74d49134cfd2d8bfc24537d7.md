There is no indication for hyperbaric oxygen therapy in uncompromised flaps and grafts. Situations, where HBO2 therapy is approved for skin grafts and flaps, includes various settings where there is a vascular compromise. Areas of past radiation exposure result in decreased micro vascularization and overall poor tissue conditions. Reperfusion injuries such as with crush injuries have shown to benefit from HBO2 therapy. Thermal burns with skin grafts are also indications for HBO2 therapy.
