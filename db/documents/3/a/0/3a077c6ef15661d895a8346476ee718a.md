Triphasic waves are abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms seen with a multitude of clinical conditions including encephalopathy and structural brain lesions. They are non-specific, high amplitude, sharply contoured waves with a unique morphology. They were believed to be pathognomonic of hepatic encephalopathy. However, they can be seen with any metabolic encephalopathy and many other conditions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of triphasic waves and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this EEG finding.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the significance and key concepts of triphasic waves on an EEG.
- Describe the differential diagnosis of triphasic waves. 
- Outline the clinical significance of triphasic waves on an EEG and the management of potential underlying etiologies. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of patients with triphasic waves and improve outcomes.
