Newborns with HI pose a great challenge to families, including possible loss of the child and long-term issues that require continuous care to provide adequate quality of life. Families should be educated about HI thoroughly. They should be made to understand that the initial presentation of the neonate with HI is transient, pain can be controlled, and the underlying skin disordered can be managed. Clinicians have a duty to any expected parents with a known family history of HI to offer genetic counseling and genetic testing.
