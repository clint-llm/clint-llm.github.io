An essential step in neuroma formation is widely accepted to be the injury of the perineurium as, without an intact perineurium, the axon fibers cannot go through. As soon as perineurium is damaged, the axons will escape. Another critical step is thought to be neuroinflammation.

The injured nerve endings start to regenerate in an unregulated fashion disrupting the mostly linear organization of fibers resulting in an unorganized growth. This growth will create and transmit signals which the central nervous system can interpret as pain.
