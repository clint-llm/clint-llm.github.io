The procedure is considered generally safe, with a very low rate of adverse events (AEs) reported among all clinical studies, totaling 473 procedures. Temporary exacerbation in LBP symptoms and incisional pain were the most commonly reported self-limiting AEs post-procedure. Additional minor AEs reported include transient radiculitis, which resolved after oral medication, and rare instances of non-permanent lumbar/sacral radiculopathy, nerve root injury, and motor/sensory deficits.

Serious AEs reported in the 473 clinical procedures included one case of a vertebral compression fracture in a sham crossover-procedure patient taking hormonal therapy, and in commercially treated patients, there have been two serious adverse events that were device-procedure related, one case of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and one case of vertebral compression fracture. There have been no reports of thermal injuries, spinal cord injury, avascular necrosis, and post-procedure infections were documented. Among the AEs reported in the clinical studies that were device-procedure related, the median time to resolution was 66.5 days postoperatively.
