Acute pain is nociceptive pain. This type of pain originates in the peripheral nervous system, where pain receptors synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and travel along the spinothalamic tract until they synapse in the thalamus. When a pain signal reaches our central nervous system, action potentials fire. Once a threshold is achieved, pain is experienced. Separately, pain can be neuropathic or centralized.

As pain becomes chronic, over three to six months of acute pain, pain can become centralized. Centralized pain requires a lower threshold to experience pain. Decreased thresholds are problematic. Pain is an adaptive response to a painful stimulus. A lower threshold for pain subjectively means pain can be experienced from non-painful stimuli (allodynia), or mildly painful stimuli experienced can be experienced as severe pain (hyperalgesia). Centralized pain is a maladaptive form of pain.

Neuropathic pain is the dysfunction of the somatosensory tract of the nervous system, rather than the spinothalamic.

How we treat pain is a function of the pathophysiology of the type of patient's pain. Some types of pain respond to modulating neurotransmitters or ion channels, while others are more receptive to opioid neuroreceptors.
