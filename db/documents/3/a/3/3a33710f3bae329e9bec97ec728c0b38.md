Patients with migraines are usually managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a neurologist, nurse practitioner, primary care provider, physician assistant, pharmacist, and emergency department physician. When patients present with an acute migraine attack, one of the drugs to abort the attack is sumatriptan. The drug is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for migraines and is given intranasally, subcutaneously, or orally.
