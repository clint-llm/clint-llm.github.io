The Society for Vascular Surgery has created a classification of an acutely ischemic limb:

- Class I: Non-threatened extremity; elective revascularization may or may not be necessary

- Class II: Threatened extremity; immediate revascularization is indicated to prevent tissue loss

- Class III: Ischemia has progressed to infarction, and salvage of the extremity is not possible
