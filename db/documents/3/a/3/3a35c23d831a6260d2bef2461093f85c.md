There is no routine laboratory, radiological, or ancillary test to assess or manage Lhermitte's sign. Some prospective studies link the sign with radiographic and electrodiagnostic findings. One study showed a correlation between the clinical signs, the presence of a demyelinating lesion on cervical MRI, and the conduction delay of median and tibial somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). The results were clinically and statistically significant. However, the consensus is that the history and physical exam findings are sufficient.
