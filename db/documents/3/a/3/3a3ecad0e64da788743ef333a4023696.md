Changes in GFR are used to define and diagnose several pathologies. Acute kidney injury (AKI, previously acute renal failure) is an abrupt increase in serum creatinine (generally over days) and is largely reversible. Alternatively, chronic kidney disease is often irreversible damage and persistent over at least 3 months. Chronic kidney disease is staged as follows:

- Stage 1 normal, greater than 90 ml per minute

- Stage 2 mild, 60 to 89 ml per minute

- Stage 3a mild to moderate, 45 to 59 ml per minute

- Stage 3b moderate to severe, 30 to 44 ml per minute

- Stage 4 severe, 15 to 29 ml per minute

- Stage 5 failure, less than 15 ml per minute

While many medications are eliminated renally and are therefore relevant to a discussion of kidney function, the mechanism of several of them directly affect GFR. NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers) both decrease GFR by different mechanisms. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. PGI2 and PGE2 normally dilate the afferent arteriole, so NSAIDs are afferent constrictors. Angiotensin II normally constricts the efferent arteriole, so ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers) dilate the afferent arteriole. Note that endogenously produced compounds (PGE2 and Angiotensin II) increase the GFR, and exogenous medications decrease the GFR (NSAIDS and ACEi or ARBs). This is why taking NSAIDs on ACEi (or ARB) is a relative contraindication, especially with other renally active drugs like diuretics.
