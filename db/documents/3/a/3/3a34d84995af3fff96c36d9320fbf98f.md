- Supravalvular mitral stenosis

- Mitral stenosis

- Idiopathic pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension

- Pulmonary venous hypertension

- Total anomalous pulmonary venous return

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return

- Atrial septal defect/ ventricular septal defect

- Ventricular septal defect
