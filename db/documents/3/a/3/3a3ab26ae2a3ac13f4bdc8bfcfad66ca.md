Myofibroblastoma is a unilateral, solitary, painless, firm, and freely mobile mass on palpation that grows slowly for several months or years.

Clinical evaluation should include detailed history taking, including assessment for cyclical pain, recent trauma, nipple or skin changes, or nipple discharge. Further emphasis must be laid on past medical and surgical history, previous cancers, family history of malignancies, social history, and medications.

It is always important to assess gynecologic and obstetric history in women, including age at menarche, menopause, and any prior oral contraceptive use or hormone replacement therapies. In men, it is important to assess the use of androgen deprivation therapies if treated for prostate cancer in the past.
