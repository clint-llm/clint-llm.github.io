Fashioning a splint takes patient-specific anatomy into account. The splint should be fashioned such that it restores anatomic resting joint position to minimize adverse outcomes. Plaster or fiberglass splints are the mainstays of acute immobilization. Plaster is the preferred malleable material to maintain a position-specific reduction, but it is limited by drying time, user experience, and provider-placed mold. Fiberglass splints are lighter, easier to apply, and more porous, but are more expensive and provide a less-reliable mold. Pre-fabricated splints (such as foam splints or braces) may play a role in chronic injuries necessitating immobilization for structural support or pain control but are less commonly used in the acute fracture setting.

Upper extremity splints crossing the wrist should maintain neutral wrist dorsiflexion, and vascular status should be assessed before and after application to reduce the risk of subsequent complications. In pediatric patients with supracondylar elbow fractures, the arm should never be splinted with the elbow flexed more than 90 degrees, as this increases the risk of Volkman's ischemic contracture.

Conversely, excessive splint laxity may permit excessive movement of the injury, and, in cases of fractures, this may result in loss of bony reduction. If a splint is a definitive therapy, there must be a stable injury pattern. Fractures that are difficult to reduce, excessively shortened, or comminuted are not candidates for definitive splinting, as they usually will need operative intervention by an orthopedic surgeon. However, unstable injuries may still benefit from temporary splinting if the patient is not an immediate candidate for surgery due to concurrent medical issues or if there is an anticipated delay before definitive operative fixation. In these cases, temporary splinting is necessary to avoid further injuries, immobilize the fracture, and promote healing.
