Management is based on early diagnosis and early intervention. All such care should be provided in an unbiased, non-threatening, and non-judgmental manner as managing these patients can be a challenge. The care should be supportive, caring, and compassionate with a goal to address the needs of the patients rather than having bias and judgments on the care provided.
