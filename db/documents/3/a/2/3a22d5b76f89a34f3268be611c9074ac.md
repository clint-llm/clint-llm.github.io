Proper diabetic foot care is a crucial aspect of diabetes treatment for limb preservation. One of the leading causes of hospitalization and amputation in patients with diabetes is foot ulcerations. The majority of diabetic foot complications result from ischemia, neuropathy, and/or infection. Patients with diabetes and neuropathy have a 7 to 10% chance of developing foot ulceration each year, and the probability increases to 25 to 30% for patients with more risk factors (e.g., peripheral arterial disease, pedal deformities, previous amputation or ulcerations). 85% of amputations on Patients with diabetes are secondary to complications from foot ulcerations. Patients with diabetes over 45 years old are eight times more likely to have an amputation, over 65 years old are 12 times more likely, and 65 to 74 years old are 23 times more likely.
