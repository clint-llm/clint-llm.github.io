The reproductive system in females is responsible for producing gametes (called eggs or ova), certain sex hormones, and maintaining fertilized eggs as they develop into mature fetuses and become ready for delivery. A femaleâ€™s reproductive years are between menarche (the first menstrual cycle) and menopause (cessation of menses for 12 consecutive months). During this period, cyclical expulsion of ova from the ovary occurs, with the potential to become fertilized by male gametes (sperm). This cyclic expulsion of eggs is a normal part of the menstrual cycle.
