Documented history of different conditions could point toward identifying cryoglobulinemia. Some things commonly paired with this disease include clonal hematologic disease (myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance), autoimmune diseases, infection with Hepatitis B, C, or HIV, skin purpura on lower limbs, skin ulcers under cold conditions, and acute foot or wrist drop suggestive of neuropathy from ischemia.

The presentation of cryoglobulinemia can differ greatly, and a majority of cases can be asymptomatic. Depending on the case, there are multiple classifications that this disease can fall under:

**Type I Cryoglobulinemia**

It presents with vascular symptoms including ischemia, livedo reticularis (erythematous, reticulated pattern that appears as lace-like and blanches on pressure), and skin necrosis.

During initial studies of this specific type of cryoglobulinemia, France underwent a nationwide study involving 64 patients with expressed symptoms over 15 years.

**Type II/III (Mixed) Cryoglobulinemia**

Presentation of mixed cryoglobulinemia is commonly associated with underlying symptoms such as arthralgia, fatigue, and/or myalgia. Also, palpable purpura related to vasculitis or sensory changes due to peripheral neuropathy is common with type II/III.
