**Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)**

A femoral nerve block (FNB) and adductor canal block have been used for pain control during and after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Both techniques provide similar analgesic benefits while mitigating the risks of general anesthesia. However, FNB has fallen out of favor due to its associated quadriceps weakness in patients postoperatively. Thus, FNB theoretically delays mobilization in this subset of patients.

**Surgical Approaches to the Hip**

Chiron et al. describe a minimally invasive medial hip approach that allows for visualization and access to the iliopsoas tendon and the intraarticular region without risking injury to the nerve and vascular supply. This medial hip approach is anterior to the adductor longus, adductor brevis, pectinate, and adductor magnus muscles. This surgical approach contrasts with the traditional trans-abductor approach to the hip, which passes anterior to the adductor longus and adductor brevis muscles but is posterior to the pectinate muscle. The trans-abductor approach involves a risk to the obturator nerve, which can be avoided in the medial hip approach. It is proposed that the primary indication for this approach is psoas tendon tenotomy.

**Hip Arthroscopy**

Despite the hip joint proving to be a challenge to treat arthroscopically, the interest in arthroscopic surgery of the hip joint has increased. Major neurovascular vessels are at risk of injury, and care must be taken to preserve these structures. Specifically, medial hip portals are useful when medial hip lesions are present. The obturator nerve, medial femoral circumflex artery, and other femoral neurovascular structures are at risk of injury when medial hip portals are used.

Injury to the obturator nerve was avoided when the portals were placed in two medial locations. The first point was found by drawing a parallel line to the ilioinguinal ligament that was 3 cm distal to the ligament. This line was then crossed perpendicularly by the anterior border of the adductor longus muscle. The intersection created was the first portal location. The second portal was located 2 cm distal to the first portal along the anterior adductor longus muscle border. Injury to the medial neurovascular bundle can be further minimized by flexing the hip 40 to 50 degrees prior to inserting the medial portal.

**Acetabular Fractures**

Acetabular fractures commonly require open reduction and internal fixation and are also known to cause impingement of the obturator nerve. The modified Stoppa approach has been popularized, and its use is common in fracture patterns requiring access to the quadrilateral plate. Fracture displacement and medial comminution in this region often occur in both associated column fracture patterns.

Overall the modified Stoppa approach is less invasive than the traditional ilioinguinal approach. Moreover, the modified Stoppa approach provides equivalent access to the quadrilateral plate compared to the traditional ilioinguinal approach. A 2017 study compared the ilioinguinal and Stoppa approaches for ORIF  treatment for displaced acetabular fractures. Ultimately, both techniques achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes; the Stoppa approach demonstrated superior total operative time and intraoperative blood loss outcomes.
