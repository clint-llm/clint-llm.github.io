When discussing signs and anamnesis with patients, it is important to note complaints of headaches, unilateral or bilateral reduction in vision, and anosmia in some cases (later stages of the condition). The clinician can expect to seeÂ an elevated optic disc (papilledema; detection of papilledema can be tricky at the early stages, especially in stage 1 papilledema, which may show a C-shaped halo with preservation of the temporal margin of the disc).

The later stages of the sign papilledema are more easily identifiable due to the elevation of the disc with obscured blood vessels. These more advanced stages of papilledema can be correlated with signs of a tumor in the forebrain, including emotional lability, difficulties in moving/uncoordinated movement, and a speech impediment. ICSOL of the forebrain can extend beyond the anterior cranial fossa and, as such, present with other associated tumors affecting other parts of the brain.
