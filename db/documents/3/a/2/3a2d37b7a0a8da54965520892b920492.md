The TTF device consists of an electric field generator to generate electric fields and transducer arrays to deliver a particular electric field configuration to the patient. The electric field generator sits in a backpack that the patient can carry while going on with the daily activities. The lithium-ion battery in the device should be charged overnight, and the transducer coils are supposed to be changed every 3Â or 4 days. For patients with glioblastoma, the scalp hair needs to be removed for proper contact between the transducer arrays and the scalp.
