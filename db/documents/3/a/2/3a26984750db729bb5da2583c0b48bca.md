Venous sinus thromboses occur for similar reasons to other venous thromboses. Anything which promotes clot formation, such as increased coagulability or decreases flow within a localized region of the sinus predisposes for clot formation. There can be an underlying prothrombotic state, such as inherited coagulopathy, malignancy, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, infection, or trauma.
