It is postulated that both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the etiology of a Bochdalek hernia.  An estimated 30% of congenital diaphragmatic hernias are attributable to genetic causes, such as chromosomal anomalies, copy number, and sequence variants. The aforementioned affected genes discovered include multiple transcription factors and the retinoic acid pathway. Most of these appear to have pleiotropic effects and variable penetrance causing a range of phenotypes. As can be expected, a developmental anomaly in one organ often correlates with developmental anomalies elsewhere, and Bochdalek hernias are not an exception.  Multisystem genetic syndromes and associations are identified, such as pulmonary and cardiac defects.
