The repeated friction, trauma, and infection of the skin overlying the nape of the neck leads to acne keloidalis nuchae. Herzberg et al. proposed a series of ultrastructural events that are responsible for the formation of acne keloidalis nuchae:

- Acute perifollicular inflammation followed by a weakening of the follicular wall at the level of the lower infundibulum, the isthmus, or both.

- Formation of acute and chronic granulomatous inflammation by the release of naked hair shaft which acts as a foreign body.

- The fibroblasts will produce new collagen and fibrosis.

- Distortion and occlusion of the follicular lumen by the fibrosis results in retention of the hair shaft in the follicle.
