Patients often present with a history of a palpable mass that localizes to the region of the salivary glands. A detailed history including pain symptoms, onset and duration of the mass, growth rate, associated swallowing difficulties, and occurrence of facial weakness should be obtained. Past medical history, including a history of previous skin cancers of the head and neck, surgical history, family history of malignancies, and social risk factors such as smoking, past radiation exposure, and occupational exposures, should be elicited.

Physical exam should include a comprehensive head and neck exam with a focus directed to the salivary glands, cranial nerves, and cervical nodes. Malignant tumors can present as painless, fixed, or mobile masses, so it may be hard to distinguish from benign tumors. Advanced malignancies may present with pain, palatal fullness, parapharyngeal fullness, trismus, overlying skin ulceration, or fistulas. Minor salivary gland tumors can present as submucosal oral swelling with ulceration or with nasal obstruction and bleeding if they occur in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx. Minor salivary gland tumors in the pharynx or larynx can cause dysphagia, odynophagia, airway obstruction, vocal hoarseness, and dyspnea on exertion.

Parotid malignancies presenting as large, fixed preauricular masses can be associated with cervical lymph node metastasis. Facial nerve paralysis can be seen in up to 12 to 15% of cases and is often associated with AdCC, MEC, and salivary duct carcinoma.

Submandibular malignancies often present as painless neck masses in the submandibular triangle of the neck. Malignant lesions here are often firm, lobulated, may be fixed to skin or deeper tissues, and may exhibit associated paralysis of the lingual nerve, hypoglossal nerve, or marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve.

Sublingual gland malignancies can present as painless, non-ulcerated masses of the floor of the mouth, although about 50% of cases can present with pain and numbness.

Minor salivary gland malignant tumors, as previously mentioned, tend to present along the upper aerodigestive tract as asymptomatic submucosal masses, rare ulceration, and occasional upper airway narrowing.

Specific presentations peculiar to the salivary malignancies include:

- Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) often presents as an asymptomatic, firm mass with occasional pain and facial paralysis.

- Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (AdCC) presents as a slow-growing, solid mass with pain secondary to perineural and extra-parenchymal invasion. Cervical lymph node metastasis occurs at a rate of 20% at presentation and is more common with submandibular tumors.

- Acinic Cell Carcinoma (ACC) presents as a slow-growing, solitary mass with occasional pain.

- Polymorphous Low-Grade Adenocarcinoma (PLGA) presents as a well-circumscribed mass with pain; ulceration is present in 8% of cases.

- Carcinoma Ex-Pleomorphic Adenoma (CExPA) commonly presents in a patient with a history of a long-standing parotid mass characterized by a sudden increase in size. It can be associated with pain and nerve palsy in up to 30% of cases.

- Salivary duct carcinoma presents as a firm, poorly-defined mass with the invasion of the surrounding glandular and soft tissue resulting in associated pain and facial nerve palsy. More than 50% of patients display cervical metastasis at initial presentation.

- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can present as a long-standing mass with sudden-onset of rapid growth, pain, facial nerve palsy, or overlying skin ulceration.

- Melanoma of the parotid gland can present as an indolent and firm preauricular mass with infiltrative growth resulting in pain, facial nerve palsy, and overlying dermal changes such as ulceration and erythema.

- Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) of the salivary gland can present with unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid gland, cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, vasculitis, and palpable purpura.
