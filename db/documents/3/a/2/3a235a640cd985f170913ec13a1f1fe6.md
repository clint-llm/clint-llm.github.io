The normal L/S ratio is 2.0 to 2.5 and is significant for appropriate fetal lung development. An L/S ratio of less than 2.0 is significant for immature fetal lung development. For patients who have poorly controlled diabetes, there was a discussion for the L/S ratio to be 3.0 due to elevated maternal glucose impacting the maturity of the developing fetal lungs. However, it was later found that there was no significant difference in the L/S ratio between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
