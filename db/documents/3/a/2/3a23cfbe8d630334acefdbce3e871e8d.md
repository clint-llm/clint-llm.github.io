It is important to understand the indications of heart transplants for timely referral to the transplant list. A timely referral makes sure that the patient will be able to survive on inotropes or mechanical support until the time the heart is available. One thing to bear in mind before referring a patient is to make sure they do not have any contraindication to a heart transplant.

**Chronic Heart Failure**

In outpatient settings, the following category of patients with chronic heart failure should be referred for a heart transplant:

- Patients on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) who still have limiting symptoms on exertion. (New York heart association class 3 or 4 or American College of Cardiology stage D patients).

- Patients with frequent readmissions for heart failure exacerbation despite adherence to GDMT (two or more in 12 months).

- Worsening renal function attributed to the cardiorenal syndrome.

- Dose-limiting side effects like hypotension or contraindications like renal failure preventing the use of GDMT.

- Progressively worsening right ventricular function (cor pulmonale) or rising pulmonary artery pressure from left heart failure.

- Frequent episodes of ventricular arrhythmias despite optimal drug and electrophysiological therapy.

- Other features like anemia, weight loss, hyponatremia, or liver dysfunction that are attributable to heart failure.

**Acute Heart Failure**

In inpatient settings, patients that require urgent referral for cardiac transplant include:

- Refractory cardiogenic shock despite maximum dose inotropic treatment.

- Refractory cardiogenic shock despite percutaneous mechanical circulatory support.

- Refractory pulmonary edema not responding to diuretics and requiring ventilation and positive pulmonary pressure.

- Refractory ventricular arrhythmia not responding to medical therapy or electrophysiological procedures.
