A multifaceted process involving biomechanical and molecular inputs contributes to the complex mechanisms underlying the developing midgut. The primitive gut tube forms following the initiation of gastrulation around week 3 of embryologic development, and it continues to develop with patterning along the tube’s A-P axis. This anterior-posterior patterning process divides the primitive gut tube into distinct sections, which will function as individual segments of the future mature, functioning bowel.

Through a Sonic Hedgehog gradient that starts in the endoderm and distributes throughout the mesoderm, this signaling cascade allows for the vilification of the intestines and further development of the inner muscular layers that are found within the bowel walls.
