Proper equipment is necessary for the IDET procedure:

- Standard radiolucent table with spinal frames and foams pads

- Biplanar fluoroscopy or C-Arm fluoroscopy to localize level and guide to reach intervertebral disc

- Set of access instruments, hollow needle, straight cannulae, temperature-controlled thermal resistive heating coil probe to deliver thermal energy, and an IDET generator
