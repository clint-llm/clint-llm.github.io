Oral, live attenuated Ty21a vaccine causes a local immune response in the intestinal tract. The attenuated strain causes lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis inducing a protective immune response. The inactivated bacterial cells in the vaccine lyse before causing a virulent infection due to the intracellular build-up of lipopolysaccharide intermediates. The response requires four doses of vaccine on alternate days.

Vaccination with Typhoid Vi polysaccharide vaccine induced an increase in anti-Vi antibodies. It was 74% effective at preventing infection in children ages two to four in Katmandu, Nepal, during a 20-month follow-up.
