All healthcare professionals, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, and NPs), specialists (e.g., neurologists), nursing staff, and pharmacists, should be aware of the side effects of the combination of acetylsalicylic acid (250 mg),  acetaminophen (250 mg), and caffeine (65 mg). While the treatment is effective for migraine and tension headaches, the patient must understand the importance of medication adherence.

The use of this combination medication requires an interprofessional team approach. Regardless of discipline, the prescriber should work with the pharmacist to rule out drug interactions and account for all possible sources of acetaminophen and NSAIDs to prevent toxicity. Nurses should be familiar with the adverse events of all three components and report any concerns observed to the prescriber. This strategy relies on open communication channels between the various clinical disciplines so all interprofessional team members operate from the same data and appropriate action can be taken in the patient's case if necessary. This coordinated interprofessional methodology optimizes therapeutic results while limiting adverse effects and interactions, resulting in better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
