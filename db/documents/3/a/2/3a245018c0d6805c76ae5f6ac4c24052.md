Saxitoxin was first isolated from the butter clam. The toxin can be produced by dinoflagellates as well as by cyanobacteria. The toxin then accumulates in filter-feeding shellfish such as mussels, clams, oysters, and scallops over time. From May to August, these organisms are the primary food source for filter-feeders. There are dozens of toxins related to saxitoxin that have small structural differences but produce similar physiologic effects in humans; examples include neosaxitoxin and gonyautoxin. Domoic acid is produced by a type of algae called diatoms, and it also accumulates in filter-feeding shellfish. Okadaic acid is another dinoflagellate product that accumulates in shellfish as well as marine sponges. Brevetoxins are lipid-soluble heat-stable polyether toxins made by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, which is the organism that is responsible for the so-called “red tides” of the Gulf of Mexico.
