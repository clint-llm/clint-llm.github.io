Since the majority of patients overdosed on opiates are lethargic or comatose, the history is usually obtained from family, friends, bystanders, and emergency medical service providers. On many occasions at the scene, one may find pills, empty bottles, needles, syringes and other drug paraphernalia. Other features that one should try and obtain in the history are the amount of drug ingested, any congestion, and time of ingestion. In the prehospital setting, sometimes EMS personnel may administer naloxone, which may help make the diagnosis of opiate overdose.

**Physical Examination**

Universally, patients with opiate overdose may be lethargic or have a depressed level of consciousness. Opiate overdose will also cause respiratory depression, generalizedÂ central nervous system (CNS) depression, and miosis. However, it is important for all healthcare workers to be aware that miosis is not universally present in all patients with opiate overdose and there are many other causes of respiratory depression. Other features of opiate overdose include euphoria, drowsiness, change in mental status, fresh needle marks, seizures and conjunctival injections.

**Skin**

Examination of the extremities may reveal needle track marks if intravenous opiates are abused. Morphine and heroin are also injected subcutaneously by many addicts. In some cases, the opium oil may be inhaled, and the individual may also have patch marks on the body from the use of fentanyl. Most opiates can cause the release of histamine which can result in itching, flushed skin, and urticaria.

**Pulmonary**

In some cases of morphine toxicity, the respiratory distress and hypoxia may, in fact, present with pupillary dilatation. In addition, drugs like meperidine, morphine, propoxyphene and diphenoxylate/atropine are known to cause midpoint pupils or frank mydriasis. The breathing is usually impaired in patients with a morphine overdose. One may observe shallow breathing, hypopnea, and bradypnea. The respiration rate may be 4 to 6 breaths per minute and shallow. Since opiates can also cause bronchoconstriction, some individuals may present with dyspnea, wheezing and frothy sputum.

**Cardiovascular**

Most opiates are known to cause peripheral vasodilatation, which can result in moderate to severe hypotension. However, this hypotension is easily reversed with changes in body position or fluid administration. If the hypotension is severe and is unresponsive to fluids, then one must consider other coingestants.

**Gastrointestinal**

Both nausea and vomiting are also seen in patients with opiate toxicity;. The reason is that opiates can cause gastric aperistalsis and slow down the intestine motility.

**Psychiatric Features**

Even though opiates are generalized CNS depressants, they can cause the following neuropsychiatric symptoms:

- Anxiety

- Agitation

- Depression

- Dysphoria

- Hallucinations

- Nightmares

- Paranoia

**Neurological**

Opiates do have the ability to lower the threshold for seizures, and generalized seizures can occur, especially in young children. This is primarily due to paradoxical excitation of the brain. In adults with seizures, the 2 opiates most likely involved are propoxyphene or meperidine. In rare cases, hearing loss may be noted especially in individuals who have consumed alcohol with heroin. However, this auditory deficit is reversible.
