Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common clinical finding. While less than 0.5% of infants and toddlers have asymptomatic bacteriuria, the incidence increases with age. The incidence is 5% or less among healthy premenopausal women, up to 15% or greater in women and men age 65-80 years, and it continues to climb after age 80 to as high as 40% to 50% of long-term care residents. At any age, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is higher among females than among males. Escherichia coli is the most common bacteria identified in asymptomatic bacteriuria.
