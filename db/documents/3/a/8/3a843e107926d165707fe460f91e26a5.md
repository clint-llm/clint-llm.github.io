Anisocoria itself is unlikely to cause significant complications, although some do exist. A larger pupil may cause light sensitivity and visualÂ aberrations. A smaller pupil may cause worsened visualization through a cataract, difficulty viewing the fundus during the posterior exam, or difficulty in cataract surgery. The main complication of anisocoria is not the difference in pupil size but the complications of the underlying condition itself.
