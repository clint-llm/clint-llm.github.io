Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by raised levels of ammonia, a nitrogen-containing compound. Ammonia is a potent neurotoxin. Hyperammonemia most commonly presents with neurological signs and symptoms that may be acute or chronic, depending on the underlying abnormality. Hyperammonemia should be recognized early and treated immediately to prevent the development of life-threatening complications such as cerebral edema and brain herniation. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hyperammonemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hyperammonemia.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hyperammonemia.
- Outline the management options available for hyperammonemia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with hyperammonemia.
