Preeclampsia, formerly called toxemia of pregnancy, is a disorder that affects pregnant women, most commonly in their third trimester. Characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, it can involve nearly every organ system and often results in significant end-organ dysfunction. Preeclampsia is relatively common in pregnancy, affecting up to 3 to 8% of pregnancies worldwide.

Eclampsia is defined by the occurrence of convulsions in a previously preeclamptic woman in the absence of a pre-existing neurologic condition that could account for the seizures. With an incidence of 0.3% pregnancies, it is less common than preeclampsia but nearly always includes visual symptoms.

Visual symptoms occur in 25 to 40% of patients with preeclampsia and can involve nearly every part of the visual pathway. Symptoms can include decreased vision, diplopia, scotoma, or photopsia.

Although the numerous changes that occur in a woman's body during pregnancy usually revert to their pre-pregnant state during the puerperium, many ocular and cortical alterations caused by preeclampsia can persist after parturition. Identification of the specific etiologies of visual dysfunction in preeclampsia may meaningfully alter their management and prognosis.
