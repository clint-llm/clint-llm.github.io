Patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia often have a family history of dyslipidemia, premature cardiovascular disease, and premature death from heart disease or stroke. Aside from the positive familial history, FCH patients may exhibit symptoms such as chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, or leg pain while walking. Additionally, they may possess risk factors for cardiovascular conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.

FCH is a complex disorder with variable expression and penetrance, and the age of onset and severity of symptoms can differ among affected individuals within the same family. Therefore, obtaining a detailed family history of hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and premature death is crucial, especially among first-degree relatives.

The physical examination of a patient with FCH is typically unremarkable, with no specific physical findings associated with the disorder. However, patients with FCH may have signs of cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), or carotid bruits. Though they are rare in patients with FCH, a careful examination of the skin may reveal the presence of xanthomas. These cholesterol deposits are often associated with high cholesterol levels or triglycerides in the blood. They may indicate an underlying metabolic disorder such as familial combined hyperlipidemia or familial hypercholesterolemia.

Furthermore, a comprehensive cardiac assessment may detect the existence of a murmur, indicating potential valvular heart disease, or indications of heart failure, such as peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, and hepatomegaly. A neurological examination may reveal the presence of focal deficits, suggesting cerebrovascular disease.
