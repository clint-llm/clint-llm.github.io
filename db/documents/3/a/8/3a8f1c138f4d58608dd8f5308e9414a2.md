Varicella vaccine is safe and well-tolerated. According to some sources, injection site complaints after vaccination were slightly higher after the second dose than the first. The most commonly reported adverse effect is soreness or swelling at the injection site.

Some other mild reported reactions include fever and mild vaccine-associated varicelliform rash. The rash comprises six to ten papular, vesicular, erythematous lesions, which peak around eight to 21 days after injection. It is rare, but when an individual has this rash after getting the vaccine, other household members are susceptible to transmission.

Some of the moderate reported reactions include a fever that causes a low-grade seizure (showing jerking or staring), but this is rare and more frequently reported with the MMRV vaccine five to 12 days after the vaccine, and upper respiratory infection, which can include a cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing.

Serious reported reactions include pneumonia, low blood cell count, and severe brain reactions. These are all extremely rare, and researchers still do not understand if the vaccine causes these reactions.

After administration of the vaccine, it is recommended to avoid salicylates for five weeks due to the risk of Reyes syndrome and to avoid contact with susceptible high-risk individuals.
