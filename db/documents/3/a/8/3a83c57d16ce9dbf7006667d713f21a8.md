The pancreas derives from a dorsal and a ventral bud, both of which arise from the foregut endoderm and fuse during embryogenesis to form the exocrine and endocrine pancreas. The endocrine pancreas begins forming at ten weeks of gestation by single immature epithelial duct cells, multiplying and forming small islands of cells. These islands are vascularized by 16 weeks of gestation and become encapsulated by connective tissue at this time. The cells eventually differentiate to contain only a single pancreatic hormone each during the second half of gestation.
