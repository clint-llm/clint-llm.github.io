# Introduction

The hippocampus is the "flash drive" of the human brain and is often associated with memory consolidation and decision making, but it is far more complex in structure and function than a flash drive. The hippocampus is a convex elevation of gray matter tissue within the parahippocampal gyrus inside the inferior temporal horn of the lateral ventricle. One can describe it more holistically as a curved and recurved sheet of the cortex that folds into the temporal lobe's medial surface. The hippocampus has three distinct zones: the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus proper, and the subiculum—the dentate gyrus and hippocampus proper form two C-shaped rings that interlock. The subiculum is thus a transition zone, linking the hippocampus proper with the dentate gyrus. The parahippocampal gyrus and cingulate sulci are located on the medial surface of the hemisphere, forming a C-shaped ring. The medial temporal lobe cortex includes major subdivisions such as the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. This five-centimeter-long hippocampus (from the anterior end at the amygdala to the posterior end near the splenium of the corpus callosum) divides into a head, body, and tail.

The fornix, which is the main outflow bundle out of the hippocampus, wraps around the thalamus, where it then becomes separated by the choroidal fissure and the choroid plexus. The hippocampus contains parts like the fimbria, crus, body, and column—the fimbria forms where alveus fibers converge along the medial portion of the lateral ventricle's inferior horn. The white matter of the fimbria separates to form a crux of the ipsilateral fornix at a point beyond the splenium of the corpus callosum. The Cornu Ammonis (CA) is a seahorse-like or ram's horn-like structure that describes the different layers of the hippocampus. There are four hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4. CA3 and CA2 border the hilus of the dentate gyrus on either side. CA3 is the largest in the hippocampus and receives fibers from the dentate granule cells on their proximal dendrites

# Structure and Function

Three phases of memory include (1) registration, (2) storage, and (3) retrieval of information. The hippocampus, parahippocampal region of the medial temporal lobe, and the neocortical association have been shown through the autopsy and imaging studies to be essential for memory processing. Impairment of short-term memory leading up to an inability to form new memories occurs when there is bilateral damage to the above mention regions

In lower animals, the hippocampus helps them determine if they will eat certain foods, based on olfactory discernment, avoid danger; respond to sexual invites through pheromones, or react to life and death decisions. The hippocampus is a site for decision-making and committing information to memory for future safety uses. Thus it has a mechanism to convert short-term memory into long-term memory, consolidating the verbal and symbolic thinking into information that can be accessed when needed for decision making.

# Embryology

The hippocampus originates in the isocortex as part of the fifth limbic lobe of the brain in the cerebral hemisphere's medial surface. It is also considered part of the olfactory cortex.

- Rotation of the lateral parts of the developing telencephalon dorsocaudally, then ventrally and rostrally, forming the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes.

- The hippocampal sulcus then invaginates into the medial wall of the temporal lobe

- Finally, the hippocampal sulcus rotates along a longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, forming a complex structure that is present in the medial aspect of the temporal lobe.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The anterior choroidal artery runs medially and superiorly to the uncus, between the ambient and semilunar gyrus.

The P2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery and the basal vein supply and drain the caudal part of the head of the hippocampus that faces the crus cerebri and crural cistern.

Internal cerebral veins drain into thalamostriatal basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, tela choroidea of 3 ventricles, and hippocampus. The veins on each side unite to form the internal cerebral vein.

# Surgical Considerations

A hippocampectomy is a surgical procedure to excise the hippocampus in patients with medial temporal epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis

# Clinical Significance

Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by early dysfunction and loss of synapses, prominently affecting excitatory transmission in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.

Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s
