The management of fetal macrosomia could be somewhat challenging. The interprofessional team that consists of obstetric providers, pediatricians, neonatologists, endocrinologists, mental health practitioners, and registered dietitians plays a crucial role in caring for pregnant patients with macrosomia. The nurse should assist the obstetric provider in delivering the best standard of care for pregnant women during the preconception, antenatal, and postnatal periods. The nurse has a central role in educating pregnant women about the optimal control of their diabetes. The nurse should help the obstetric provider in the evaluation and monitoring of pregnant women with macrosomic babies. The nurse should keep a record of all maternal observations as well as clinical and ultrasound fetal weight estimations. Liaison between the members of the interprofessional team is essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.

Registered dietitians should be included early on during the care of pregnant women with diabetes mellitus and women with a previous history of macrosomic infants. Educating pregnant women and their families about the risk factors and the maternal as well as fetal complications associated with macrosomia can not be overemphasized. Pregnant women with suspected fetal macrosomia should be encouraged to report any symptoms of reduced fetal movements to their providers. The nurse and diabetic educator should educate the women about the importance of the optimal control of their blood sugar, the importance of keeping logs of their blood sugar levels, and the attainment of proper weight gain during pregnancy. The members of the interprofessional team should support women and their families, and respect their views, concerns, and expectations about the timing as well as the mode of delivery at all times. The effective communication and harmonious coordination among the various members of the interprofessional team is the key to the successful management of pregnant women with suspected macrosomia.[Level 5]
