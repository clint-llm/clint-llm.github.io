Mild acalculous cholecystitis may present similarly to calculous cholecystitis. Patients may have right upper quadrant abdominal pain, reproduced with deep palpation (Murphy's sign). Nausea, food intolerances, bloating, and belching may also be present. Signs of acute acalculous cholecystitis exhibit an abrupt onset of symptoms of severe right upper abdominal pain. There may be a palpable distended gallbladder. These patients present as being very ill, possibly septic and are in an ICU setting. Their white blood cell count is usually, but not always, elevated. Often they have been in the hospital for other significant illnesses or are recovering from major surgery.
