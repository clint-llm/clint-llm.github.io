An interprofessional healthcare team, consisting of emergency department clinicians, toxicology specialists, and intensive care professionals, is crucial for the optimal management of tetramine poisoning. Early and aggressive treatment of seizures and appropriate sedation should be implemented. The long-term sequelae and multi-organ effects of tetramine poisoning are believed to be primarily associated with refractory seizures. While there have been case reports and promising results in animal models regarding the use of adjunct medications and elimination techniques, the lack of human data prevents routine recommendation of these interventions. Consulting a toxicologist or regional poison center is advised to consider these treatments.
