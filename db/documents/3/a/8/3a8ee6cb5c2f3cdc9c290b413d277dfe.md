Horner syndrome is almost always secondary to an underlying cause, such as tumor, trauma, infection, etc, and is rarely idiopathic. The complications that occur as a result of Horner syndrome are essentially related to the cause of Horner syndrome. For instance, if Horner syndrome is secondary to multiple sclerosis, it could lead to muscle stiffness or spasms, impaired bladder, bowel, or sexual function; and seizures. Similarly, Horner syndrome-related eye problems can lead to problems with vision that could be temporary or permanent. Visual involvement can lead to partial or complete blindness.
