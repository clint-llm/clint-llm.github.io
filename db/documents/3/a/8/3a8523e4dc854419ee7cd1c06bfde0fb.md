The Office of Rare Diseases (ORD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) classifies androgen insensitivity syndrome and its subtypes as “rare disease,” which signifies that it affects less than 20,000 people in the US population. The prevalence of 46XY phenotypic females is low, which limits the data about the age and clinical presentation at diagnosis for AIS. As per a nationwide study in Denmark, all known females with 46XY karyotype females since 1960 were analyzed via medical record evaluation and found to have a prevalence of 6.4 per 100000 live-born females. The prevalence of AIS was found to be 4.1 per 100000 live-born females.
