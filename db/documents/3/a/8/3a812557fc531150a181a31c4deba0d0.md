The possible differential diagnosis for acute knee pain varies somewhat by age group but remains extensive regardless of age or gender. A thorough examination can help differentiate prepatellar bursitis from patellar subluxation/dislocation, tibial apophysitis, patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral tracking syndrome. Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common cause of discomfort, while reactive and rheumatoid arthritis may also cause knee pain. Septic arthritis will also produce discomfort. Radiation of pain from hip fracture, osteoarthritis of the hip, slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), and other disorders of the hip may refer pain to the knee. It is important to assess for cellulitis or other skin, and soft tissue infections as these can present similarly to prepatellar bursitis. Other common causes of knee pain include ligamentous and meniscal injuries within the knee joint itself. Fractures of the tibial plateau also produce discomfort within the knee. Inflammation of a bursa other than the prepatellar may produce knee discomfort.
