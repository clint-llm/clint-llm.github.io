The large number of studies and data published on UDCA demonstrates the therapeutic effect of this drug on various forms of cholestatic liver disease. The efficacy of UDCA in primary biliary cholangitis is evident. Prolonged administration of ursodeoxycholic acid for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is associated with a survival benefit and delaying of liver transplantation. There is evidence that it might even prevent the progression of the histologic stage of PBC. A comprehensive review of three randomized trials from the United States, Canada, and France included more than 500 patients with PBC treated with UDCA, with a median length of follow-up of 4 years. Patients treated with UDCA had significantly longer transplant-free survival, with a 32% reduced risk of death or transplantation. However, it is essential to note that up to 40% percent of patients with PBC exhibit an inadequate response to UDCA and may continue to experience disease progression. In these cases, second-line agents merit consideration.

Recent data also suggest UDCA might have a role in managing PSC, cystic fibrosis, graft-versus-host-disease, and other hepatobiliary disorders; however, concrete data regarding therapeutic potential and long-term effects are currently lacking. Due to its multi-functionality, it is difficult to envision a viable substitute agent for UDCA that combines as many hepatoprotective effects with similar efficacy. The significant progress made in understanding the anti-cholestatic mechanisms of UDCA has allowed for the successful testing of new therapeutic applications, even beyond liver and gallbladder disease. Several alternative drugs are under investigation in pre-clinical trials; however, unless there's an agent proven to be more effective than the current therapy, UDCA will most likely remain the go-to agent for treating cholestatic liver disease.

The use of UDCA requires the involvement of the entire interprofessional healthcare team. Management of the drug includes monitoring by the pharmacist in tandem with the prescribing clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA). While the drug is safe, it can exacerbate pruritis and cause abdominal discomfort. The pharmacist should notify the clinician if the side effects become intolerable. Nursing can assess for therapeutic effectiveness and adverse events at follow-up visits, which is particularly important if the drug is used off-label, and report these to the rest of the team. As more data regarding indications and use of UDCA becomes available from ongoing research, all interprofessional healthcare team members need to keep current to drive patient outcomes optimally to effectively use ursodeoxycholic acid, where it can provide therapeutic benefit.
