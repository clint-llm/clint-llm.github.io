There are no absolute contraindications to the use of US for IV access, although inadequate training or experience may lead to incorrect identification of structures and subsequent complications. A second relative contraindication would be failed attempts or when the time is critical, in which case intraosseous access point or landmark identification may lead to quicker access.

Other relative contraindications include those for traditional IV access: burn, infection, or injury at the site of access; mastectomy, DVT, or AV fistula on the side of access. Clinical judgment must be used in these instances.

As use becomes more widespread, the lack of training or experience will become less common. Many medical schools have begun implementing US curricula, and residency programs with ultrasound fellowship-trained faculty are increasing in number.
