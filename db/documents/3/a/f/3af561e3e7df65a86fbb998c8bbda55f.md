**Macroscopic Findings**

Central carcinoid tumors are well-circumscribed, round to ovoid, and sessile or pedunculated. There is salt and pepper chromatin and moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. They often fill the bronchial lumen.

**Histopathology**

The growth patterns of carcinoid tumors suggest neuroendocrine differentiation. Organoid and trabecular patterns are most common; however, rosette formation, papillary growth, pseudo-glandular growth, and follicular growth may also be present. The tumor cells are usually uniform in appearance, with finely granular nuclear chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and moderate to abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.

**Immunohistochemistry**

Immunohistochemistry may be a necessity for diagnosis, particularly on small biopsies. An antibody panel including chromogranin A, synaptophysin (both with cytoplasmic labeling), and CD56 (mostly decorating cell membranes) is the recommendation. However, none of these markers distinguish typical carcinoids from atypical carcinoids. Most carcinoids are also reactive for pan-cytokeratin antibodies. Some peripheral tumors also stain with TTF1, which is less specific. The Ki67 labeling index is valuable in biopsy or cytology samples, particularly with crush artifacts where the mitotic index is difficult to assess, to avoid misdiagnosing carcinoid tumors as high neuroendocrine carcinomas.
