Periodic monitoring of serum lipoproteins is recommended in patients taking colestipol toÂ assess treatment response and further dosage modifications.

As colestipol is known to cause constipation of varying severity and may cause intestinal obstruction, monitoring of constipation at 4 to 6-week intervals is recommended. Worsening constipation or failure to meet therapeutic goals may require combination therapy or replacement with alternate therapy.

Patients with pre-existing fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (A, D, E, K) should monitor their vitamin levels regularly while on colestipol therapy. Colestipol may impede the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins through its action as a bile acid sequestrant.

As colestipol may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, signs of hyperchloremic acidosis should be monitored. These include headaches, seizures, increased respiratory rate, and arrhythmias.

Patients on warfarin therapy should have their International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitored regularly.
