Impetigo is a common infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis that is highly contagious and most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria. It most commonly presents as erythematous plaques with a yellow crust and may be itchy or painful.Â  The lesions are highly contagious and spread easily.

Impetigo is a disease of children who reside in hot humid climates. The infection may be bullous or nonbullous. The infection typically affects the face but can also occur in any other part of the body that has an abrasion, laceration, insect bite or other trauma.

Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and clinical manifestations alone. Treatment involves topical and oral antibiotics and symptomatic care.
