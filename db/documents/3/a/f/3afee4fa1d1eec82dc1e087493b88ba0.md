**Monitoring**

After initiating mechanical ventilation, close and continuous monitoring is required for the patient, and settings are adjusted accordingly. Without the ability to check blood gases in the field, rely on pulse oximetry and end-tidal capnometry to guide adjustments.

**End Tidal Capnometry (EtCO2)**

This is a rough approximation of the PaCO2 or the pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood as it passes through the alveoli. Goal EtCO2 for most patients is around 40 to 45 mm Hg. Keep in mind actual PaCO2 may be higher than EtCO2, but trending is as important as the absolute number. For example, if the patient was intubated for respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation and the initial EtCO2 was 80 mm Hg after mechanical ventilation, this number should trend downward toward normal. If EtCO2 trends upward, this is a sign of inadequate ventilation, and the minute ventilation must be increased by increasing first the respiratory rate and then tidal volume. Avoid tidal volumes beyond 8 ml/kg to prevent lung injury.

**Pulse Oximetry (SpO2)**

This is a dynamic monitor of oxygenation. Again, the goal SpO2 should be 92% to 98%, using as little oxygen as possible. Adding PEEP is another method of increasing oxygenation, as this helps prevent the collapse of the alveoli and increases the diffusion gradient for oxygen.
