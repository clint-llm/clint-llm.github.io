The treatment guidelines for mediastinal germ cell tumors are similar to those of gonadal germ cell tumors. The rarity of the disease has not allowed for large prospective randomized controlled studies. According to the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG), non-seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors are considered “poor risk” tumors.

For seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors, treatment consists of 3 or 4 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin chemotherapy (BEP), based on being in the good or intermediate risk category.

For poor-risk tumors (non-seminomatous), first-line therapy usually involves chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual tissue. The original chemotherapy regimen that included four cycles of a combination of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) resulted in pulmonary complications, which were noted to be harmful in patients with mediastinal germ cell tumors, who may need extensive thoracic surgery after chemotherapy.

There is a lack of strong evidence to support the role of upfront high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue. However, this modality could be considered for high-risk disease subtypes and in cases of early relapse.

Relapse after completing therapy can occur. A retrospective study of 79 cases of mediastinal germ cell tumors found that only 11% of patients were found to be disease-free in the long term. Thus, the second round of chemotherapy is warranted in most of these patients, although clear guidelines for an optimal second-line chemotherapy regimen have not been outlined. Irrespective of the chemotherapy regimen used, studies show very poor cure rates (5% to 10%) in the salvage therapy setting.
