Riesman's sign or Snellen-Riesman's sign is a clinical sign characterized by bruit heard over the closed eye with a stethoscope in Graves' ophthalmopathy (thyroid eye disease or Graves' orbitopathy or thyroid-associated orbitopathy) in thyrotoxicosis. The bruit is audible during systole.

The name comes from Dr. Herman Snellen and Dr. David Riesman. Dr. Herman Snellen (1834 - 1908) was a famous ophthalmologist from the Netherlands known for Snellen's chart for estimating the visual acuity. Dr. Ravid Riesman (1867-1940) was born in Germany. He completed his MD from the University of Pennsylvania, USA. He was a professor of clinical medicine and then a professor of history of medicine.
