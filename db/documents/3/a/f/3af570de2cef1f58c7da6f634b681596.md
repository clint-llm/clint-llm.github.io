In an observational study of acute porphyrias, which included 90 patients with AIP, researchers found that the diagnostic delay was a mean of 15 years.

Owing to the broad spectrum neuro-visceral clinical presentation of AIP, the list of differential diagnosis is long:

- Other acute porphyrias - Clinically, it is often difficult to differentiate from other acute porphyrias: HCP, VP, and Doss porphyria.

- Causes of acute abdomen - Peritonitis, appendicitis, acute cholecystitis, acute gastritis, acute pancreatitis, intestinal occlusion, strangulated abdominal hernia, acute mesenteric ischemia, ileus, diverticulitis, esophagitis, endometriosis, gastric outlet obstruction, intussusception, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts, acute pyelonephritis, aortic dissection.

- Lead poisoning constitutes a substantial differential, and one must look for the presence of anemia and lead levels in the blood to confidently differentiate between the two conditions.

- Causes associated with clinical features of autonomic neuropathy - Hypertensive crisis, tachyarrhythmias,  adrenal crisis, familial Mediterranean fever, fibromyalgia

- Neuropsychiatric simulators - Acute psychotic attack, delirium, panic attack, Guillain-Barre syndrome.
