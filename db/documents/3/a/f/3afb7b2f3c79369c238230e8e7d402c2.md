Renal artery stenosis is a common cause of renovascular hypertension. In elderly individuals, the usual etiology of renal artery stenosis is atherosclerotic disease. As the lumen of the artery narrows, the renal blood flow drops, and this compromises perfusion of the kidney. Patients with renal artery stenosis may present with azotemia, abdominal bruit, and worsening of hypertension. Sometimes acute renal failure can be precipitated by starting the patient on ACE inhibitors. Unfortunately, the treatment of renal artery stenosis with angioplasty and stenting may not always result in the recovery of renal function.
