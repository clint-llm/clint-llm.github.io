A careful history and physical examination are essential when evaluating a patient with a chest wall mass. Patients may complain of pain, soreness, swelling, impaired movement, a lump, or muscle atrophy. Physical examination may demonstrate noticeable swelling, and careful palpation may reveal underlying asymmetry of the chest wall and describe the texture of the tumor. Breath sounds may also be decreased. All of these result from the mass effect of the tumor itself and is not diagnostic for the underlying pathology for the tumor.
