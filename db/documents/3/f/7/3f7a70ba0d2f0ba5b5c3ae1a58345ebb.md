Maintenance tocolysis is the procedure of providing tocolysis beyond 48 hours. Typically 48 hours of medication is sufficient to bridge the patient through the steroid window and transport her to a tertiary care center. There is no official stance by ACOG on the status of maintenance tocolysis. Evidence does not suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, calcium channel blockers, COX inhibitors, or magnesium sulfate are sufficient for maintenance tocolysis. Progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate have limited data that might suggest they might be beneficial for maintenance tocolysis. They may be used in patients with a history of preterm labor but are not considered tocolytic agents.
