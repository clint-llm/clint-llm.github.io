A supraclavicular block is usually performed by an anesthesiologist or anesthesia nurse with the help of a nurse. During the procedure, the nurse assists with sterile technique and making sure the medications and equipment are ready. Once the procedure is over, the patient is usually monitored by nurses in the recovery room. The nurses must be prepared and familer with expected complications and quickly report to back to the operative team.

All of these professionals need to know the adverse effects of anesthetics used for regional blocks. The majority of patients have no complications but a few patients may develop temporary paralysis of the brachial plexus. Due to the rarity of complications, it is easy to become lax. As such, re-education and continued interprofessional training is crucial. The best outcomes will be achieved by an interprofessional team approach where each member communicates with the team as challenges arise. [Level V]
