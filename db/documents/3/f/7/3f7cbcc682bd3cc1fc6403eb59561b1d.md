Peripheral venous access is a hallmark of resuscitation in patients of all ages. Ideal sites for venous catheterization are easy to access and pose the least risk to the patient. Sites for venous access in young children include the hands, feet, forearms, and scalp. The most common reasons for intravenous therapy in infants are to deliver maintenance fluids, blood and blood products, medications, and nutrition. The scalp veins are commonly used to secure access in neonates and infants often after unsuccessful attempts at cannulation of upper and lower limb veins. Scalp veins offer ease of stabilization and ease of access in this age group. Scalp veins in neonates/infants typically have less overlying subcutaneous fat compared to other peripheral sites to allow easier visualization and cannulation.
