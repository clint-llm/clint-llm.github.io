The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway and its effectors are key to lanugo development and the development of other hair types. Antagonists of Wnt and its effectors are also crucial. While other mediators are necessary for the eventual production of lanugo, these two are the most important. In either case, molecular messages initiating the process of hair development begin in the dermis.PTC1 and GLI1, are transcribed through the actions of the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2.  After further downstream processes, the formation of lanugo and other types of hair occurs.
