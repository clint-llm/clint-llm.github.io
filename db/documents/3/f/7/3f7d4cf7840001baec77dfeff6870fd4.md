The rhomboids consist of two separate muscles; the major and minor muscles, which are found immediately deep to the trapezius. The rhomboid minor is a cylindrical muscle that originates at the ligamentum nuchae and C7 and T1 vertebra. It inserts at the scapula's medial border near the base of the spine of the scapula. The rhomboid major is a quadrangular muscle located inferior to the rhomboid minor. The origin of the rhomboid muscles is from the spinous processes of the T2-T5 vertebra and inserts on the medial border of the scapula, just inferior to the rhomboid minor.

With the assistance of many other muscles, the rhomboids help form the shoulder girdle. This group of muscles is important for the movement of the upper extremity and stabilization of the shoulder through articulation with the trunk. Functionally, the rhomboid muscles retract, elevate and rotate the scapula. They also protract the medial border of the scapula, keeping it in position at the posterior thoracic wall. Dysfunction, weakness, or loss of nerve function to the rhomboids causes winging of the medial border of the scapula and inferior scapular angle rotation.

The rhomboids are also vital to actions such as pulling and have been shown to play a large role in throwing and overhead arm movement.
