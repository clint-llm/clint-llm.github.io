Infancy is a period of rapid growth second only to the fetal period. There is a pressing need to optimize nutritionÂ to ensure adequate growth and organ development. With much emphasis placed on the developmental origins of health and disease, pioneered by the Barker hypothesis

Low birth weight and rapid compensatory weight gain are independently linked to multiple morbidities in addition to altered growth, including increased risk of childhood and adult obesity, insulin resistance, increased leptin levels, and thus type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as higher mortality in the future.

Preterm infants are particularly at high risk of postnatal growth failure due to the inherent challenges faced due to prematurity. Improved care of preterm infants, including current advances in neonatal and infant nutrition, has been shown to improve growth and development in this high-risk population.
