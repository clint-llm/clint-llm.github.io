Overall, caput succedaneum is a clinically benign condition. Clinicians involved in neonatal care may frequently encounter the condition. However, parents and family members of newborns may find the swelling quite distressing. They should be reassured and provided with education regarding the condition and favorable short and long-term prognosis. It is important, when possible, to set expectations and provide patient education during prenatal visits about maternal and fetal complications associated with delivery.
