Gastric cancer is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The only potentially curative treatment approach for patients with gastric cancer is surgical resection with adequate lymphadenectomy. Regrettably, patients with an unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease can only be offered life-prolonging palliative therapy regimens. This activity discusses the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and treatment modalities for gastric cancer and outlines the interprofessional team's role in providing the optimal management for patients with gastric cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology and etiology of gastric cancer. 
- Outline the typical clinical presentation and evaluation of a patient with gastric cancer.
- Summarize the treatment modalities and palliative care strategies for gastric cancer.
- Explain the significance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with gastric cancer.
