Chronic venous disease (CVD) is defined by morphological and functional abnormalities of the venous system that primarily affect the lower extremities and present as leg heaviness/achiness, edema, telangiectasia, and varicose veins. Persistent ambulatory venous hypertension and the ensuing inflammation are the pathophysiological alterations that underlie CVD. It is estimated that over 2.5 million individuals in the United States experience CVD; of them, approximately 20% develop venous ulcers.

CVD and chronic venous ulcers are associated with a poor prognosis and impede the capacity to participate in occupational and social activities, resulting in diminished quality of life and financial limitations. Approximately 2 million workdays per year are lost due to venous ulcer-related disability, and more than 12 percent of workers with venous ulcers retire prematurely as a result.

The financial burden of venous ulcers on the healthcare system is readily evident, with an estimated $1 billion spent annually in the United States on chronic wound treatment, equating to $3 billion annually for venous ulcer care.
