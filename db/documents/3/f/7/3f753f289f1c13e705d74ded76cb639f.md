Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is common among patients with musculoskeletal pain problems. MPS is a pain condition originating from muscle and surrounding fascia. Patients usually present with localized pain in a restricted area or referred pain of various patterns. Moreover, the physical examinations may reveal trigger points (TrPs) on the involved muscles. MPS can be divided into the acute and chronic forms. Acute MPS frequently resolves spontaneously or after simple treatments. However, chronic MPS are usually worse in prognosis, and the symptoms can last for 6 months or longer. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of myofascial pain syndrome and stresses the importance of an interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of myofascial pain syndrome, with a focus on the pathophysiology of muscular trigger points.
- Recall the presentation of myofascial pain syndrome, and describe examination and evaluation techniques emplyed to arrive at a diagnosis of MPS.
- List the treatment and management options available for myofascial pain syndrome.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of myofascial pain syndrome and improve outcomes.
