The evaluation of a patient with back pain without neurological deficit should be conservative as long as there are no significant risk factors, however, should risk factors exist then an evaluation with neuroimaging should be initiated. If the patient presents with a neurological deficit or bowel/bladder incontinence, then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast should be obtained to identify any possible mass lesions. The MRI is the gold standard for the evaluation of nontraumatic spinal lesions. If a metastatic mass lesion is suspected,Â then an appropriate workup would include a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis or a full-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan to evaluate for any primary malignancy. Lumbar radiographs may show pathological fractures, destroyed pedicles, angulation, or enlarged neural foramina. When necessary, a lumbosacral CT scan is performed to visualize the bony anatomy of the spine.
