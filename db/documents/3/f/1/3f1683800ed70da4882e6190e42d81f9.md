Birthing multiple infants add an increased challenge to the interprofessional team in the delivery room. This includes obstetricians, the patient's pediatrician, family clinician, obstetric-trained specialty nurses, neo-natal care nurses, and a clinical pharmacist if medication has a place in the management of twin births. All members of the interprofessional team must communicate openly, and meticulous documentation of all observations, interactions, and interventions in the case is essential. The best outcomes will occur withÂ all interprofessional team members working together and providing delivery care in a coordinated fashion. [Level 5]
