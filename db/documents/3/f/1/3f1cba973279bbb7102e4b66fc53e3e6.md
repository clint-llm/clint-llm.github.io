The lymphatic system is a system that drains the leaked tissue fluid back into the circulation. Its components are lymphatic vessels, lymphatic organs, lymph nodes, and widely scattered lymphoid tissue within the connective tissue. Lymph is the tissue fluid flowing through these lymphatic channels.

Lymphatic vessels contain valves that prevent the backflow of transported lymph.

The lymphatic vessels are present in all the tissues except the bone marrow, eyeball, central nervous system, epidermis, cartilage, internal ear, teeth, cornea, and placenta.
