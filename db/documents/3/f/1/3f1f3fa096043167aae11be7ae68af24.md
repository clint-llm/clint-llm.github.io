Patients may present with a changing plantar mole. However, acral melanomas typically are discovered only upon focused examination of the soles and toe webs. Anatomically, the palms and soles lack hair follicles and sebaceous glands but have many sweat ducts.Â The palms and soles are much thicker, and regular patterns are distorted by walking and grasping pressures. Simple clinical evaluation looking for asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, diameter greater than 6 mm, and change over time or lesion elevation is important. Augmenting these clinical observations with dermoscopy can increase diagnostic acumen by 20%. A complete examination of the soles, toe web spaces, and nail units are important components of a lower extremity examination.
