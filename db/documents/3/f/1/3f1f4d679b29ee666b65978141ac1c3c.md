The clinician should obtain a detailed history from a patient who presented with complaints related to menstruation. Specific aspects of the history include:

- Menstrual history

- Age at menarche
- Last menstrual period
- Menses frequency, regularity, duration, the volume of flow

- Frequency can be described as frequent (less than 24 days), normal (24 to 38 days), or infrequent (greater than 38 days)
- Regularity can be described as absent, regular (with a variation of +/- 2 to 7 days), or irregular (variation greater than 20 days)
- The duration can be described as prolonged (greater than 8 days), normal (approximately 4 to 8 days), or shortened (less than 4 days)
- The volume of flow can be described as heavy (greater than 80 mL), normal (5 to 80 mL), or light (less than 5 mL of blood loss)

- Exact volume measurements are difficult to determine outside research settings; therefore, detailed questions regarding frequency of sanitary product changes during each day, passage and size of any clots, need to change sanitary products during the night, and a "flooding" sensation is important.
