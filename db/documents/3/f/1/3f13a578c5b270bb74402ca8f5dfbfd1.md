The four tissue layers comprising the female urethra help keep it closed. Resting urethral closure relies on the middle muscular and outer seromuscular layers in the female. The internal sphincter consists of the proximal urethra and bladder neck.

SUI in females is proposed to be due to both intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) and urethral hypermobility.
