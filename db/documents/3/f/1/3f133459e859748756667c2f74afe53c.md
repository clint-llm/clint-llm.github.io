Mitral valve stenosis is a disease process usually caused by rheumatic fever. Mitral valve commissurotomy is the procedure of choice for the treatment of mitral valve stenosis. This entire disease process should be managed with a multidisciplinary team from the time the stenotic valve is diagnosed and, most importantly, throughout the entire surgical management. As mitral valve surgery advances, it is essential to have interprofessional teams that are close in communication with the management of patients to help advance the field and decrease morbidity and mortality.

An interprofessional team should include an anesthesia team, cardiologists, cardio-thoracic surgeons, and cardiac intensivists. Preoperative echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve requires coordination between the ultrasound sonographer and the cardiac surgery team. The intraoperative repair of the valve requires closed-loop communication between the cardiac surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, circulating nurse, and OR techs.
