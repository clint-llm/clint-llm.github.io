The diagnosis of folliculitis is clinical. In general, no diagnostic testing or radiographic evaluation is necessary to diagnose this condition in lieu of a thorough history and physical exam. A standard KOH preparation can be used to visualize hyphae and spores associated with folliculitis caused by Malassezia. KOH preparation could also be used to diagnose Demodex folliculitis; however, this is not common in clinical practice.
