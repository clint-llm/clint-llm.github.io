The clinical characteristics specific to overlap syndrome often coexist with the common presentations of COPD and OSA. For example, COPD commonly presents with sputum production, shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, forgetfulness, confusion, and trouble sleeping, likely related to sleep-disordered breathing. ObstructiveÂ sleep apnea commonly presents with daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, gasping for air, choking, and the patient's sleeping partner often observes snoring, which may progress to apneic episodes.

In addition to the common symptoms of the individual diseases, COPD and OSA, overlap syndrome exhibits increased hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and pulmonary hypertension, as previously discussed. Consequently, morning headaches resulting from hypercapnia, cyanosis resulting from hypoxemia, and peripheral edema resulting from cor pulmonale are expected to be particularly prevalent in individuals with overlap syndrome.
