Scaphoid fracture with displacement <1 mm has a union rate of 90%. The prognosis worsens if the fracture is displaced, with a missed diagnosis, or if the fracture is in the proximal pole. If left untreated, the risk of chronic pain with associated reduced range of motion and grip strength is more likely to occur.
