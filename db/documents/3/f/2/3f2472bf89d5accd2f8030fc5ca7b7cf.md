The erector spinae plane (ESP) block is a newer regional anesthetic technique that can be used to provide analgesia for a variety of surgical procedures or to manage acute or chronic pain. The technique is relatively easy to perform on patients, and it is performable with minimal or no sedation in the pre-operative holding area. The ESP block can is possible either using a single-injection technique or via catheter placement for continuous infusion. The first report of the successful use of this procedure was in 2016; the block was used to manage thoracic neuropathic pain in a patient with metastatic disease of the ribs and rib fractures.
