Intravitreal implants have revolutionized the treatment of posterior segment diseases. A thorough ophthalmological examination of both the anterior and posterior segments to rule out any ocular or periocular infections before planning for intravitreal steroid implants is essential. The nurse can assist the ophthalmologist in explaining to the patient the indications of the intravitreal implant and the need for follow-up to monitor response and manage complications early. Risks and possible complications of the implant should be thoroughly explained to the patient.

The nurses should be aware of the implantation techniques and the use of intravitreal implants. The peri-injection precautions and the follow-up schedule should be explained to the patient. The patient should be explained the importance of periodic evaluation, including intraocular pressure check and optical coherence tomography. The clinic can play an active role by scheduling future visits in advance and sending timely reminders to the patient to attend the appointment. In case of complications, the physician or nurse should promptly identify those and institute treatment immediately. This interprofessional team approach will yield better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
