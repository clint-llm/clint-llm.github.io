Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness usually affecting infants and children but can affect adults. The infection usually involves the hands, feet, mouth, and sometimes, even the genitals and buttocks. The cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease is coxsackievirus A type 16 in most cases, but the infection can also be caused by many other strains of coxsackieviruses and Enteroviruses. The coxsackievirus is a member of the Picornaviridae family, which includes non-enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and clinical presentation of HFMD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of HFMD.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with HFMD.
- Outline the management options available for HFMD.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of HFMD and improve outcomes.
