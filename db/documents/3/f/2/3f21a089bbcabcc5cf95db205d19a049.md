Accurate staging of cutaneous malignant melanoma depends on the availability of full-thickness biopsy specimens. Sentinel lymph node biopsy, if accessible, should be performed for patients with node-negative disease and tumors at least 0.8 mm thick or for tumors with high-risk features and less than 0.8 mm thick. Evaluation for potential hereditary syndrome and appropriate genetic referral should be considered.
