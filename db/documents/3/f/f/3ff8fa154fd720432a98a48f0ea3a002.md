Breast ultrasound is often used to localize palpable and non-palpable masses before surgical excision.

The basic breast anatomy comprises 15 to 20 lobules, each consisting of smaller breast ducts, known as the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs). All the ducts drain into a single lactiferous sinus towards the nipple.

The three main anatomical zones of the breast are the pre-mammary, mammary, and retro-mammary zones, consisting of fatty tissue, fibroglandular tissue, and muscular tissue.

From a sonographic point of view (Image 2), the breast is divided into various hypoechoic and hyperechoic layers:

- Skin (hyperechoic, white fibrous bands)

- Fat (hypoechoic, subcutaneous fat lobules)

- Breast parenchyma (hyperechoic, fibroglandular soft tissue)

- Retromammary fat (hypoechoic fat lobules)

- Pectoralis major muscle (hyperechoic fibrous tissue)
