If intubation is necessary, cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT) can be used. The formula to determine ETT size is 3.5 + (age/4) while, for uncuffed ETT, the value of 3.5 changes to 4. Pediatric patients under 3 months may require a 3.0 tube. The child’s pinky finger may also be used to determine tube size.

While the Miller blade is traditionally preferred to lift the U-shaped epiglottis and expose the vocal cords, a Mac blade is an option based on practitioner comfort and availability. Video laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy can also aid in these difficult airways.

If a patient requires defibrillation or cardioversion, biphasic attenuated defibrillators are preferred over adult AEDs which are non-attenuated. While this is preferred, adult AEDs may be used if a pediatric AED is unavailable. 2 to 4 J/Kg can be used for defibrillation, with the recommendation being to start at lower energy doses. This synchronized dose should be started at 0.5 J/Kg and titrated up to 2 J/Kg for tachyarrhythmias.
