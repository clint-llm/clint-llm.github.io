The anterior choroidal artery runs medially and superiorly to the uncus, between the ambient and semilunar gyrus.

The P2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery and the basal vein supply and drain the caudal part of the head of the hippocampus that faces the crus cerebri and crural cistern.

Internal cerebral veins drain into thalamostriatal basal ganglia, thalamus, internal capsule, tela choroidea of 3 ventricles, and hippocampus. The veins on each side unite to form the internal cerebral vein.
