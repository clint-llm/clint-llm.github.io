Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is generally the first screening test for the diagnosis of arterial diseases due to its low cost, reliability, and non-invasive nature. This recommendation, in combination with pulse volume recordings, has been supported by the 2016 American heart association (AHA) guideline and the US preventive services task force.

Blood testing should also be obtained to identify underlying risk factors. Lipid profile, hemoglobin A1c, lipoprotein A, and serum homocysteine levels may identify the etiology.
