The clinical significance of standardized patient assessment of medical learners is via the application of both formative and summative assessments. Â Formative assessments, including CSAs and OSCEs, provide developmentally appropriate teaching of clinical skills and competency in the delivery of safe and effective patient-centered care. Summative assessments, such as Step 2 Clinical Skills, are valid and reliable high stakes exams.
