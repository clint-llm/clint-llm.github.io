Epidural catheter placement is a skill that can humble the most seasoned of providers. To enhance first attempt success, the provider should give clear instruction to both the patient and assisting staff in achieving optimal positioning. In the case of placement for a laboring patient, an early discussion should be had so that optimal timing of placement can be determined instead of waiting until a time of extreme distress. Other considerations include having all necessary equipment accessible and ready for placement, optimize bed height and room lighting before beginning, utilizing sterile technique, and considering allowing an alternative provider to attempt after multiple failed attempts. When combining these steps under the guidance of an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, OR nurses, and surgical assistants, such considerations may improve patient care safety and efficacy, ultimately improving patient outcomes and satisfaction.
