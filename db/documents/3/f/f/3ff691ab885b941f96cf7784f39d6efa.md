More than 500,000 people in the United States live with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression to this terminal disease remains a significant cause of reduced quality of life and premature mortality.

According to KDIGO 2012 clinical practice guideline, CKD is classified into five stages considering the GFR level.

- Stage 1: Kidney damage with normal GFR (greater than 90 ml/min)

- Stage 2: Mild reduction in GFR (60-89 mL/min)

- Stage 3a: Moderate reduction in GFR (45 to 59 mL/min)

- Stage 3b: Moderate reduction in GFR (30 to 44 mL/min)

- Stage 4: Severe reduction in GFR (15 to 29 mL/min)

- Stage 5: Renal failure (GFR less than 15 mL/min)
