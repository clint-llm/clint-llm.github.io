The diagnosis and management of trigger finger is best done with an interprofessional team that consists of a hand surgeon, orthopedic surgeon, plastic surgeon, nurse practitioner, physical therapist and the primary care provider. The diagnosis of trigger finger is clinical. In most cases, the initial treatment is non-surgical and may involve splinting or injection of a corticosteroid. Patients should be made aware that after a steroid injection, pain may be significant for a few days. To minimize the risk of tendon rupture after a steroid injection, patients should be warned not to perform strenuous activity for a few weeks.

Surgery is recommended when conservative treatments fail. However, surgery is not 100% effective and complications are not unheard of. In addition, surgery may fail to resolve the trigger finger. It is vital to educate the patient on non-surgical methods before surgery is contemplated. Damage to the digital nerves and incomplete release are relatively common with the surgical approach. With open communication between members of the team, the patient should be provided with realistic expectations. This helps improve treatment satisfaction.
