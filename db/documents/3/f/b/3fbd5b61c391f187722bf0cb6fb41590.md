Medical staff should observe patients taking aliskiren for hyperkalemia and impaired renal function. Serum potassium requires periodic monitoring. Patients at risk include those with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, combination use with ARBs or ACEs, and patients using potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics. Renal function also should be monitored periodically. Individual patients will be at higher risk of developing acute renal failure while taking aliskiren. These patients include those taking ARBs, ACEIs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and patients with renal artery stenosis, severe heart failure, post-myocardial infarction, or volume depletion.
