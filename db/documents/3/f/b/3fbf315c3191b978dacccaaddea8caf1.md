**History**

The etiology of pulmonary regurgitation mainly determines the history. In PR secondary to pulmonary hypertension, the clinical picture is dominated by the primary lung disease or the high pulmonary vascular resistance rather than the volume load.

Post Ross procedure: Ross procedure is a pulmonary autograft placement in place of the diseased aortic valve, which is a common procedure in congenital aortic valve disease. Ross procedure is the only aortic valve intervention that has long-term survival benefit. As per the recent American Journal of Cardiology consensus (2018), this procedure is also under consideration for selected young patients.

Post-TOF repair: Despite major advances in TOF repair in the past few decades, many patients experience several complications secondary to post-surgical hemodynamic and electrophysiological abnormalities. Right bundle branch block, residual intra-cardiac shunts, tricuspid regurgitation, etc., cause pulmonary annular dilatation causing PR.

**Physical Findings**

Jugular venous distension with large v waves (Lancisi sign) can be seen in patients with PR secondary to pulmonary hypertension if the right ventricular pressure is high enough to cause tricuspid insufficiency as well.

**Auscultation**

- The first heart sound (S) is normal.

- P2 is not audible in patients with congenital absence of the pulmonic valve; however, this sound becomes accentuated in patients with PR secondary to pulmonary hypertension. There may be a wide splitting of S2 caused by the prolongation of RV ejection accompanying the augmented RV stroke volume.

- A systolic ejection click can be heard sometimes in the second left intercostal space, due to sudden expansion of the pulmonary artery by augmented RV stroke volume.

- An S3 and S4 originating from the right ventricle are often audible, most readily in the fourth intercostal space at the left parasternal area, and become augmented by inspiration.

- In the absence of pulmonary hypertension, the PR murmur is a diamond-shaped, diastolic low pitched murmur that commences as soon as the pulmonary artery and the right ventricular pressures diverge (approximately 0.04 seconds after P2). The auscultation of the peak intensity of this murmur is when the gradient between these pressures is maximal, and soon, it ends with equilibration of the pressures.

- The Graham Steell murmur: It is heard when systolic pulmonary artery pressure exceeds approximately 55 mm Hg, resulting in dilatation of the pulmonary annulus causing a high-velocity regurgitant jet. It is a high pitched, blowing, decrescendo murmur beginning immediately after P2, most prominent in the left 2 to 4 intercostal spaces, increases in intensity with inspiration exhibits little change after amyl nitrite inhalation or vasopressor administration, is diminished during the Valsalva strain, and returns to baseline intensity almost immediately after the release of the Valsalva strain.

**Progression of PR**

As per 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines, all valvular heart diseases progress through four stages

- Stage A: Patients at risk for PR, who still have not developed it

- Stage B: Asymptomatic patients with mild or moderate PR

- Stage C: Asymptomatic patients with severe PR

- Stage D: Symptomatic patients with PR

Descriptions of the severity of PR appear in the section of the investigations below.
