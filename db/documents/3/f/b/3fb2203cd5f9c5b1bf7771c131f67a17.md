Functional abdominal pain is a common disorder in children. The diagnostic Rome IV criteria for functional abdominal pain must be fulfilled for at least 2 months before diagnosis, must be met at least 4 times per month, and include all of the following: episodic or continuous abdominal pain that does not occur solely during physiological events such as eating and menses; insufficient criteria for other functional gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, or abdominal migraine; and after appropriate evaluation, the abdominal pain cannot be fully explained by another medical condition. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of functional abdominal pain and addresses the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the Rome IV criteria to diagnose functional abdominal pain.
- Describe the presentation of functional abdominal pain.
- Review the treatment options for functional abdominal pain.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by functional abdominal pain.
