Due to the vital role that glycogen breakdown has on normal physiology, including maintaining blood glucose levels and muscle contraction during activity, disruptions in glycogenolysis have exhibited pathophysiological conditions. Although researchers have investigated the role of glycogen, certain information is not well understood. For instance, the specific role that glycogen serves in muscle contraction or the method for glycogen transport into lysosomes is unclear.
