Head and neck anatomy can be complicated as a result of the vast number of minute anatomical structures in the spatially limited anatomic region. Clinically, there are a vast number of structures that require special attention, and failure to do so can result in fatal consequences.

The neck is divided into several regions, triangles, and zones to organize the complex anatomy of this area. The two primary neck regions are the anterior cervical and posterior cervical triangles, which are found deep to the skin and subcutaneous tissue and contain several muscles, vasculature, and nerves.

The objective of this article is to describe the anatomy of the anterior cervical region and the anterior triangle of the neck, as well as any notable clinical or surgical considerations.
