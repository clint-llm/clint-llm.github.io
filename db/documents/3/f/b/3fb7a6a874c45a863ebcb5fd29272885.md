Pili annulati may appear at birth or during infancy.

The clinical examination usually reveals a shiny and banded appearance of the hair with sometimes a peculiar glistening texture or even a frizzy aspect.

Pili annulati is not typically associated with increased hair fragility. Hair growth and tensile strength of hair in affected individuals are normal, but abnormal areas of the hair shafts appear to be more susceptible to weathering and present with minor surface abnormalities. In a minority of cases, an increased sensitivity at the level of the light bands with severe trichorrhexis-nodosa-like hair fracturing and breakage can be observed.

Pili annulati is classically limited to the scalp hair, but other regions such as pubic, axillary, and beard hair, may also be affected.

Pili annulati is easily detected in blonde hair while it can be completely obscured in black hair, as the additional pigment in dark hair tends to absorb the surrounding light and mask the banding appearance. Pili annulati become more noticeable with age as the hair becomes depigmented, increasing light transmission.

There have been several reports of pili annulati associated with alopecia areata, autoimmune thyroid disorders, as well as primary immunoglobulin A deficiency. The most commonly accepted assumption is that these cases represent a coincidental concomitant manifestation, as a true pathogenetic association has not been proven.
