More than 90% of abdominal aortic aneurysms occur below the renal arteries. By scanning to the level of the bifurcation, providers ensure complete visualization of the aorta.

Do not overlook an intraluminal thrombus. Include the thrombus to measure the diameter accurately.

Identify intimal flaps, which are pathognomonic for aortic dissections.

It can be difficult to differentiate the IVC from the aorta. Generally, the pulsatile aorta is thick walled, non-compressible, and positioned medial to the IVC. The IVC is thin-walled and compressible. It may appear to pulsate given its proximity to the aorta and secondary to the normal respiratory cycle. Use pulsed-wave Doppler to delineate the aorta’s pulsatile flow from the venous flow of the inferior vena cava, which should display mild respirophasic variation only.

Although the majority are retroperitoneal, when concerned for a ruptured AAA, perform a right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess for pathologic free fluid.
