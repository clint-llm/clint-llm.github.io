The brachioradialis is a superficial forearm muscle located in the lateral forearm. The brachioradialis primarily flexes the forearm at the elbow but also functions to supinate or pronate depending on the rotation of the forearm. The muscle originates along the proximal two-thirds of the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and distally inserts into the lateral surface of the styloid process of the radius. The brachioradialis has unique attachment points compared to other muscles in the body because it originates from the distal end of one bone and inserts into the distal end of another bone.
