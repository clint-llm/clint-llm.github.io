Like many disease conditions, early detection is critical in the management of infant head lag. During well-visits, pediatricians and family physicians must watch for red flags like significant hypotonia or concern for developmental delay, based on the perinatal risk factors and family history. In infants with a higher risk of developing autism (positive family history of ASD in siblings), findings suggest the need for developmental surveillance, promoting earlier access to intervention. [Level 3]

Pediatric neurologists and medical geneticists should also be consulted early to evaluate suspected CNS pathologies, syndromes, and genetic diseases associated with infant head lag.
