**Dosage Forms and Strengths**

Linaclotide is supplied as capsule dosage form and contains linaclotide-coated beads in a hard gelatin shell. In the market, linaclotide is available in various strengths such as 72 mcg, 145 mcg, and 290 mcg for oral administration. Inactive ingredients of the 72 mcg capsule are slightly different from the 145 mcg and 290 mcg capsules.

The inactive components of linaclotide 72 mcg capsules include L- histidine, calcium chloride dihydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and polyvinyl alcohol. The capsule shell is made of ingredients such as gelatin and titanium dioxide.

The inactive elements of linaclotide 145 and 290 mcg capsules include hypromellose, calcium chloride dihydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, and L-leucine. The capsule shell is made of the same ingredients, gelatin and titanium dioxide used for a 72 mcg capsule.

**Recommended Dosages**

- The recommended dosage of linaclotide for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) is 290 mcg taken by mouth once daily.

- The recommended dosage of linaclotide for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is 145 mcg ingested by oral route once a day. Still, a smaller dosage of 72 mcg once a day may be prescribed according to individual presentation and tolerability.

**Preparation and Administration Instructions**

- Linaclotide is taken orally on an empty stomach, a minimum of 30 minutes before breakfast or the first meal of the day.

- If a dosage is missed, skip the missed dosage, and take the next dosage at the regularly scheduled time. Do not take two dosages together at the same time.

- It is recommended not to open, crush or chew linaclotide capsule or contents, and instead, an intact capsule is swallowed.

- For adult patients with dysphagia or odynophagia, capsules of linaclotide can be opened and administered orally with either water or in applesauce or administered with water through a feeding tube, nasogastric, or gastrostomy tube. A sprinkling of linaclotide beads in other liquids or on other soft foods has not been scientifically tested.

- Linaclotide is stored at room temperature (25 C (77 F)), and excursions are allowed between 15 C and 30 C (59 F and 86 F). It is recommended to keep linaclotide in the original container. It should not be subdivided to store in a pillbox or repacked. The lid of the container needs to be closed tightly. Linaclotide needs protection from humidity, and therefore, its container is kept in a dry place along with the desiccant in it. The container is stored securely for safety purposes.

**Oral Administration in Water**

- Take a clean cup containing about 30 mL of room-temperature bottled water.

- Then, open the capsule and empty the whole contents (beads) into the water.

- Dissolve off the medicine coated on the beads’ surface by gently swirling the beads and water for a minimum of 20 seconds. Beads are insoluble and will remain visible.

- The whole mixture of beads and water is consumed immediately.

- Pour an additional 30 mL (about 1 ounce) of water into any beads sticking around in the cup, swirl for at least 20 seconds, and swallow it immediately. It is not essential to consume all the beads to deliver the full dose. It is recommended not to store the bead-water mixture for later use.

**Oral Administration in Applesauce**

Take a clean container and add a teaspoonful of room-temperature applesauce into it. Then, open the intact capsule and disperse the entire medicine on applesauce. Swallow the bead-applesauce mixture immediately. Do not chew the beads. Storage of the mixture for later use is not advisable.

**Administration with Water Via a Nasogastric or Gastrostomy Tube**

- Open the linaclotide capsule and sprinkle the beads into a clean container with 30 mL of room-temperature bottled water.

- Mix the beads and water by gently swirling the beads for a minimum of 20 seconds.

- Draw up a mixture of the beads and water into a catheter-tipped syringe of appropriate size and dispense the contents of the syringe into the tube by applying rapid and steady pressure (10 mL/10 seconds).

- Another 30 mL of water can be added to any beads left in the container, and then the entire process is repeated.

- After administering the dose (bead-water mixture), flush the feeding tube, nasogastric or gastrostomy, with at least 10 mL of water.

Note: It is not essential to flush all the beads through the feeding tube to deliver the complete dosage

On economic evaluation, linaclotide is a less expensive option with equal efficacy for treating adults with CIC and IBS-C compared with other drugs such as lubiprostone.
