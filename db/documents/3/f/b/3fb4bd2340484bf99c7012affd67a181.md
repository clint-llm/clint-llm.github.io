The acid phosphatase family generally divides into two major groups depending on the presence or absence of a binuclear metal center. The first group (metallohydrolases) shows a characteristic purple color due to charge transfer from tyrosine residue to Fe(III), thus called purple acid phosphatases (PAP). They also can be differentiated from the other group of acid phosphatases by their insensitivity to tartrate inhibition, so they were called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatases (TRAP).
