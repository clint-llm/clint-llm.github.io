Cholestyramine is used for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. The reduction in LDL cholesterol by the resin is dose-dependent. A dose of 8 to 12 grams of cholestyramine is associated with a 12% to 18% reduction in LDL cholesterol. It also reduces the risk of coronary artery disease. Cholestyramine can be used in patients with bile-acid diarrhea or choleretic enteropathy due to limited ileal disease or resection. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of cholestyramine that is pertinent information for interprofessional team members when lipid-lowering therapy is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of cholestyramine.
- Outline the approved and potential indications of cholestyramine.
- Recall the potential side effects/adverse events of cholestyramine.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with cholestyramine.
