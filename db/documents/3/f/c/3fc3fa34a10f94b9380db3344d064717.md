If any of the scapulohumeral muscles are injured, it can affect the motion of the shoulder and scapula. If a tear is present in any of these muscles, the function of the shoulder can still be maintained non-surgically, depending on which muscle is damaged. Surgery is indicated if conservative management fails.

Scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR) can be affected by damage to any of the scapulohumeral muscles. Rotator cuff tears are especially susceptive to changes to the SHR because there will be an increased motion at the scapulothoracic joint to compensate for a decrease in glenohumeral motion.

Generally, after a total shoulder arthroplasty operation, the shoulder biomechanics and, therefore, the muscular neurological intervention (also considering the presence of scars and adhesions) change. One study reveals that a shoulder having undergone surgery tends to use the scapulothoracic system a higher percentage than normal while using the glenohumeral system less when the patient has to raise his arm. FromÂ the biomechanical point of view, the converse occurs with a patient who has undergone full-thickness rotator cuff tears.

In the sports field, the surgical procedure (arthroscopic) often negatively influences the arthrokinematics, preventing the return to sports performance equal to those preceding the operation.
