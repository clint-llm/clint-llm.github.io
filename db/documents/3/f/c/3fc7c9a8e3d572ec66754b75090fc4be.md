Double-lumen tubes are used for multiple complex surgical procedures and lung isolation in some non-surgical patients. Since malposition and displacement of these tubes can lead to life-threatening consequences, an interprofessional education is an essential component to avoid morbidity and mortality. Everyone involved in the care of patients requiring DLT placement including anesthesiologists, intensivists, resident physicians, CRNAs, AAs, nurses, and respiratory therapists in the intensive care unit must know the indications for placement, identify correct placement, confirm the position, and be able to troubleshoot complications from the placement of DLT. Daily chest x-ray and auscultation to confirm placement and bronchoscopy should be immediately available if malposition is suspected. Respiratory status should be monitored continuously, and caution should be used during the positioning and transport of patients. The need for continued placement should be addressed daily as these tubes have the potential for airway injury and should be changed to SLTs if mechanical ventilation is still needed, but lung isolation is no longer indicated.
