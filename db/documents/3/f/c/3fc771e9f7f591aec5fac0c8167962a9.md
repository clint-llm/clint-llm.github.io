Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) usually remain asymptomatic until late in the disease, and over 50% of tumors may be detected incidentally.

Bone metastasis is often osteolytic and causes pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. Excruciating, sharp, band-like back pain may be present due to vertebral collapse and spinal cord compression due to metastatic renal cell carcinoma and may help diagnose metastatic disease.

A third of the patients with RCC have metastatic disease at presentation. Therefore the physical examination should have an evaluation for metastasis to lungs (75%), bone (20%), liver (18%), CNS (8%), and others.
