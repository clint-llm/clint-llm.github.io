The Joint Commission defines a sentinel event as a patient safety event that results in death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm. Sentinel events are debilitating to both patients and health care providers involved in the event. The term sentinel refers to a system issue that may result in similar events in the future. The National Quality Forum defined the term serious reportable events as “preventable, serious, and unambiguous adverse events that should never occur.” These events are also termed as never events. Previously, sentinel events included events that occurred only to patients. In 2013, the concept was expanded to include “harm events” to the staff, visitors, and vendors on the organization’s premises.

Serious reportable events can be classified into the following categories:

- Surgical

- Device/product

- Care management

- Environmental

- Patient protection

- Radiologic event

- Criminal events

Hospitals vary in their definitions, investigations, and reporting of sentinel events. Examples of sentinel events from the Joint Commission include the following:

- Suicide during treatment or within 72 hours of discharge

- Unanticipated death during the care of an infant

- Abduction while receiving care

- Discharge of an infant to the wrong family

- Hemolytic transfusion reaction due to blood transfusion with major blood group incompatibilities

- Surgery on the wrong individual or wrong body part

- Retained foreign body after surgery

- Severe neonatal jaundice (bilirubin >30 mg/dl)

- Prolonged fluoroscopy with very high or inappropriate dose or to the wrong site

- Fire during direct patient care caused by hospital equipment

- Intrapartum maternal death

- Unanticipated severe maternal morbidity resulting in permanent or severe temporary harm
