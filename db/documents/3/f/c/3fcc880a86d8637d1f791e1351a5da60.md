Enhancing healthcare outcomes for patients with dyslipidemia has to involve a multidisciplinary treatment team, including clinical physicians such as cardiologists or endocrinologists, nurses, and pharmacists. Clinicians have to be aware of up to date guidelines on lipid screening, indication for treatment, and goals LDL-C levels. Nurses should adhere to the same awareness as physicians but also aid in maintaining close follow up with these patients to help improve adherence to medications. Pharmacists can assist in watching for drug interactions, counseling regarding potential adverse effects, and providing dosing instruction.
