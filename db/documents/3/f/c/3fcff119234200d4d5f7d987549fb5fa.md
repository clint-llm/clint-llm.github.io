The middle cerebral artery (MCA) is the most common artery involved in acute stroke. It branches directly from the internal carotid artery and consists of four main branches, M1, M2, M3, and M4. These vessels provide blood supply to parts of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes of the brain, as well as deeper structures including the caudate, internal capsule, and thalamus. This activity describes the presentation, evaluation, and management of middle cerebral artery strokes, and explains the role of the members of the interprofessional team in assessing, diagnosing, managing, and rehabilitating patients who suffer from this, and how to try to prevent a recurrence.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various potential etiologies of middle cerebral artery stroke.
- Summarize the most important evaluations needed to diagnose a middle cerebral artery stroke.
- Outline the differential diagnoses that must be considered if a patient presents with stroke-like symptoms but does not have a stroke.
- Review how to address the modifiable risk factors for secondary stroke prevention after a stroke, and how the interprofessional team can be involved in improving the outcome and quality of life of a stroke patient.
