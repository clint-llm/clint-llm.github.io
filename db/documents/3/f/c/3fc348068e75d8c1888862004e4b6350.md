Many factors play a role in the prognosis of an encephalocele, like the location, the size, the amount of brain inside the sac, the presence of dural sinuses in the sac, and the presence of the hydrocephalus.

Long term evaluation of children with encephaloceles shows that 48% had adequate development, 11% had mild impairment, 16% had a moderate impairment, and 25% had severe impairment.

Factors that increase mortality include low birth weight, multiple intracranial defects, and Black race.
