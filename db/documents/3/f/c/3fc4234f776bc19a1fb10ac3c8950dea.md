Mortality is estimated to be 60% to 80%, especially in those with more than a 24-hour delay in diagnosis. Surgical intervention within 6 hours of symptom onset increases survival rates. In general, prognosis depends on the etiology. Patients with an arterial etiology have worse survival outcomes than those with a venous etiology.
