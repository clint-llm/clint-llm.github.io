Contraindications for using gemfibrozil include hepatic or severe renal dysfunction (including primary biliary cirrhosis), presence of cholelithiasis, gallbladder abnormalities, hypersensitivity, and combination therapy of gemfibrozil with the following drugs: simvastatin, repaglinide, or dasabuvir.

Cholelithiasis is one of the potential side effects in patients managed with gemfibrozil. This medication enhances cholesterol elimination into bile. If cholelithiasis is suspected, it is recommended to order an abdominal ultrasound and HIDA scan to rule out gallstones. Discontinuation of gemfibrozil is recommended if diagnostic studies are positive for gallstones. Unusually, it has been reported in the literature the development of severe anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow hypoplasia. Periodical complete blood count is a good practice during the first 12 months of treatment with this medication. It has been reported worsening renal failure, particularly in patients with a baseline creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dL. It is suggested to use an alternative treatment in these patients.

Gemfibrozil can potentially interact with other medications; monitoring dose or modifying frequency is recommended.

- **HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors:**There have been case reports of rhabdomyolysis and myopathy and its susceptibility in patients with renal failure. The simultaneous usage of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) with gemfibrozil enhances the probability of developing rhabdomyolysis or myopathy. Therefore, simvastatin is contraindicated, and rosuvastatin use should be avoided while administering gemfibrozil.

- **Anticoagulants:**If gemfibrozil is used in patients using drugs that modify the coagulation cascade (warfarin), it is recommended to reduce the anticoagulant dose and monitor the coagulation cascade (PT, PTT, INR) until normalization of these parameters.

- **Enzalutamide:**Gemfibrozil can increase CYP2C8 substrates like enzalutamide levels when it is coadministered with this drug concomitantly. It can increase the risk of seizures. If simultaneous administration is required, decrease the enzalutamide dose.

- **Selexipag:**Concomitant administration of selexipag with gemfibrozil is contraindicated.

- **OATP1B1 substrates:**Gemfibrozil inhibits OATP1B1 transporter and can increase the exposure of medicines of substrates of OATP1B1 (e.g., atorvastatin, atrasentan, bosentan,  fluvastatin, ezetimibe, glyburide, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, rifampin, pravastatin, olmesartan, or valsartan). Therefore, reduce the dose of OATP1B1 substrates when used concomitantly with gemfibrozil.

- **Colchicine:**Concomitant use of colchicine and gemfibrozil can potentiate the development of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Elderly patients and patients with renal dysfunction are at higher risk of these adverse reactions. Exercise caution when administering colchicine and gemfibrozil, especially in elderly patients or patients with renal dysfunction.
