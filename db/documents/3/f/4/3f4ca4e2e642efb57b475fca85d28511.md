Clinical evidence to support toxic doses of lemborexant in humans is scarce. In at least one clinical study, 7.5 times the recommended dose of lemborexant was given to healthy human subjects resulting in dose-dependent increases of somnolence frequency, providing little information regarding toxicity. There is no specific antidote to lemborexant overdose. In the case of a suspected overdose, the protocol of any drug overdose should be followed, with close monitoring from a medical professional.
