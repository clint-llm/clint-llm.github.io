The histopathology of idiopathic subglottic stenosis shows dense fibrosis of the keloidal type with interspersed fibroblasts. The overlying epithelium shows metaplasia, and the cartilaginous rings are mostly normal histologically. Estrogen seems to play a role in idiopathic subglottic stenosis, but no estrogen or progesterone receptor overexpression is seen in the disease process.
