Arytenoid subluxation is usually related to acute traumatic events to the cricoarytenoid junction. Protrusion of an endotracheal tube stylet, an unanticipated difficult airway leading to prolonged or traumatic intubations, the use of a gum elastic bougie, blind intubation techniques (e.g., utilization of a lighted stylet or light-wand) and insertion of bulky double-lumen tubes, have all been implicated.

Several systemic diseases, as well as chronic corticosteroid use, laryngomalacia, and acromegaly may lead to the weakening of the cricoarytenoid joint capsule, thus exacerbating this complication.
