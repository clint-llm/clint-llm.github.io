During the pathologic process of IP joint osteoarthritis (OA), the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) develops Bouchard’s nodes, and the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) develops Heberden’s nodes. These nodes are bony and gelatinous outgrowths of the joint articular cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is another disease that can cause deformities of the PIP and DIP joints.

Rickets is a disease consisting of weak bones that most often occurs due to vitamin D deficiency in children. This disease can greatly affect the knee joint as a weakened bone of the femur and tibia allow for the development of varus bowing in the lower extremities that alters the biomechanics of the knee hinge joint.
