A mycotic aneurysm is dilation of an arterial wall due to infection. The term "mycotic" was coined by Willaim Osler in his Gulstonian lectures, where he described a man with multiple aortic mycotic aneurysms in a patient with valve vegetations, which resembled the appearance of a fleshy fungus.

The risks are higher in immune-compromised host i.e., HIV, diabetes, high dose glucocorticoids, or malignancy/chemotherapy.
