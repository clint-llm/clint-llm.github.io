The type of suction equipment used depends on several factors:

- Resource availability

- Provider/caretaker expertise

- The target area of the airway requiring suctioning

The human airway can be broadly divided into two parts:

- Upper airway – mouth, nose, oropharynx, nasopharynx, and laryngopharynx

- Lower airway – trachea, major and segmental bronchi, and terminally alveoli
