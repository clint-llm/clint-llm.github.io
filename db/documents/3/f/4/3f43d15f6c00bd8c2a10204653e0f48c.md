The FDA-approved indication for intravenous (IV) phenylephrine hydrochloride is for increasing blood pressure in adults with clinically significant hypotension resulting primarily from vasodilation in such settings as septic shock or anesthesia. Phenylephrine HCL is also used over-the-counter in ophthalmic formulations to promote mydriasis and conjunctival blood vessel vasoconstriction, intranasal administration as a treatment for uncomplicated nasal congestion, and as an over-the-counter additive to topical hemorrhoid medications.

Phenylephrine is primarily an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist with minimal to no beta-adrenergic activity; therefore, it is ideal for elevating mean arterial pressure. It does so by causing venous and arterial vasoconstriction and increasing cardiac preload without having any significant direct effect on cardiac myocytes.

Phenylephrine has been shown to be effective in offsetting commonly encountered hypotension associated with spinal anesthetics (60% to 70%) in obstetric patients and has become the preferred vasopressor in this setting.

Although phenylephrine is not recommended as the initial treatment of septic shock, it is an acceptable therapy in the case of norepinephrine associated arrhythmias, known high cardiac output with hypotension, and as a salvage therapy when combined inotrope and vasopressor drugs when low-dose vasopressin has failed to achieve MAP target.
