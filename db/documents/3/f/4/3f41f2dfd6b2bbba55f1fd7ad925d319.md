Patients should be informed about the cause, disease course, and surgical management of the leptomeningeal cyst. Patients and families should be reassured regarding the benign nature of the cyst. In cases where children are affected, patients' families should be given detailed information about the complications and reminded to contact a physician or urgently present at the emergency room if there are any changes in the patient's clinical condition. Patients should be made aware of the likelihood of the cyst reoccurrence, although the reoccurrence is quite rare. It is essential that the necessity of multispecialty involvement in the patient's treatment and regular multispecialty follow-up with the neurosurgeon, neurologist, and pediatrician, be emphasized. Patients or parents should be warned of several long-term neurological issues that may have a prolonged or unpredictable course of recovery, such as mental retardation, motor weakness, speech disorders, and vision problems, and appropriate assistance should be provided.

Careful observation and education of the parents are pivotal.
