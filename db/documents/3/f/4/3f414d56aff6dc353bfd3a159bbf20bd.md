Tonsil cancer is the most common form of oropharyngeal malignancy, and its incidence is sharply rising due to the increasing prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers. The presence of HPV can dramatically alter the prognosis of tonsillar cancer, and there have recently been significant changes made to the WHO classification and TNM staging to reflect this. Tonsil cancer can be managed by both surgical and oncological approaches, although the optimal treatment regimen remains an area of ongoing research.
