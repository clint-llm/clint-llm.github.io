The three most important mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis are recurrent infections, airway obstruction, and peribronchial fibrosis.

Neutrophils dominate airway inflammation in bronchiectasis, driven by high concentrations of neutrophil chemoattractants such as interleukin-8 (CXCL-8), and leukotriene B4. Airway bacterial colonization occurs because of impaired mucociliary clearance and because of the failure of neutrophil opsonophagocytic killing. Other mechanisms of immune dysfunction include the inability to clear apoptotic cells and invasion of T-cells, with recent reports leading to Th17 cells playing a significant role. Histologic changes in bronchiectasis include cartilage destruction and fibrosis, mucosal and mucous gland hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and increased mucous and exudate.
