A double orifice mitral valve (DOMV) is most commonly found incidentally while investigating other possible cardiac pathologies. This anomaly, by itself, is asymptomatic; however, it can lead to mitral valve dysfunction. It is at this juncture that intervention is pursued with medicines and some sort of valve intervention, whether noninvasive or surgical. At the time of diagnosis, patients should be referred to a cardiologist and a cardiothoracic surgeon and followed closely with interval TTE. For symptomatic patients, physical activity is restricted, and patients are advised to seek medical care if they develop signs of heart failure. This may include but is not limited to shortness of breath, cough, leg swelling, and weight gain.Â At this time, medications may be required to help with heart failure and serve as an interim measure until the dysfunctional mitral valve can be repaired.
