Noninvasive echocardiographic techniques have a minimally invasive approach, and the only contraindication is the refusal of the patient to undergo the testing. Moreover, the patient’s habitus will possess limitations on the penetration of the ultrasound waves to determine echocardiographic landmarks—limitations in acquiring doppler signals which could underestimate the gradient, velocity, and associated calculations for hemodynamics.
