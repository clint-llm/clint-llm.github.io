Patients treated with pamidronate should have their kidney function closely monitored throughout their treatment with the medication. Clinicians should record serum creatinine before every infusion. In instances of renal deterioration, the patient should not receive the drug until creatinine rises to within 10% of the patient’s baseline level. Electrolyte disturbances can also occur with the drug, and thus magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin D levels should be monitored and corrected if necessary. Patients should also receive monitoring for albuminuria for 3 to 6 months after pamidronate infusion.

Close monitoring of a patient’s creatinine clearance is vital as the administration protocol of pamidronate depends on this value. Infusion time is not affected with creatinine clearance values greater than 60 mL/min, but for values between 30 to 60 mL/min, it is recommended to either decrease the drug dose or infuse it over a longer period. Pamidronate infusion is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min except in cases of fatal calcium levels or those with severe bone disease due to multiple myeloma.
