Patients should take preventive measures to prevent episodes of Hartnup disease. Preventive measures include avoiding direct sunlight, wearing protective clothing, and applying sunblock in outdoors as hot weather and sunlight exacerbate skin lesions.

Drugs like sulfonamides, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines, tetracyclines, oral contraceptives that increase sensitivity to light should also be avoided.
