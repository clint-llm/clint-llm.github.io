The Koebner phenomenon (KP), first described in 1876 by Heinrich Koebner, is the appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary to trauma.

The Koebner phenomenon is not to be confused with pathergy, which is a term utilized to describe when minor trauma (including blunt trauma such as bumps and bruises) can induce skin lesions.

The Koebner phenomenon requires differentiation from the reverse Koebner phenomenon, which is the disappearance of skin lesions following trauma over the existing lesions.

One should also differentiate the true Koebner phenomenon from Wolf’s isotopic response. Wolf’s isotopic response is a similar phenomenon that occurs when trauma induces new skin lesions to appear on previously unaffected skin. However, unlike the Koebner phenomenon, the lesions in Wolf’s precede the appearance of generalized skin disease.
