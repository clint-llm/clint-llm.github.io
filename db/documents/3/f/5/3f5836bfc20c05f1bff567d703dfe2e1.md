- Phantosmia describes the perception of an odorant in the absence of an identifiable stimulus in the environment.

- Classifications of olfactory disorders include conductive, sensorineural, peripheral, and central.

- A myriad of etiologies exists for phantosmia. However, idiopathic is the most common.

- Burnt smell is the most commonly reported smell associated with phantosmia, but other smells have been reported, such as feces, rotten, musty, gas, sweet, metallic, or fruity.

- When history and physical exam are unrevealing for an obvious root cause of phantosmia, imaging in the form of CT sinus or MRI brain with attention to the olfactory region may be helpful.

- Treatment is etiology-dependent, and typically medical therapies (i.e., antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, antimigraine medications, etc.) are exhausted before attempting endoscopic surgical excision of olfactory mucosa.

- Overall, little is known about phantosmia and its management. Future studies should be directed towardsÂ characterizing pathomechanisms and treatment strategies.
