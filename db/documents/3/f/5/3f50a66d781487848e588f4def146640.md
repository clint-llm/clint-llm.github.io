First identified in the 1940s by Swedish physiologist Ulf von Euler, norepinephrine, also known as noradrenaline, is a neurotransmitter of the brain that plays an essential role in the regulation of arousal, attention, cognitive function, and stress reactions. It also functions as a hormone peripherally as part of the sympathetic nervous system in the “fight or flight” response.

The noradrenergic system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some significant neuropsychiatric disorders and has been an important pharmacologic target in various psychiatric, neurologic, and cardiopulmonary disorders. This article will focus on the physiology of the noradrenergic synapse.
