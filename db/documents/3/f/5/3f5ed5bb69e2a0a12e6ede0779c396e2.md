Indications of T Tube can be summarized in one concept that is to stent and drain the common bile duct after choledochotomy

Another less common reason is repairing limited injury of the CBD over a T tube. Simple closure of the CBD injury without stenting and draining is associated with a high rate of stricture and or leak. T tube placement may also be used for CBD drainage when ERCP and PTC fail to clear the CBD intraluminal non-malignant obstruction. This is a rare indication, but it can relieve the obstruction and prevent further complications.

A common misconception is using the word T tube interchangeably with different tubes such as Cholecystostomy tube and PTC drain. The Cholecystostomy tube is a tube that is inserted by interventional radiology method through the abdominal wall into the gallbladder and serves as a drain to an inflamed gallbladder in patients with acute cholecystitis who are otherwise at high risk to undergo formal cholecystectomy. On the other hand, Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram (PTC) is a drain inserted through the abdominal wall into a major hepatic duct, also by interventional radiology method. It is an external drain for bile in patients with bile duct obstruction until the underlying pathology is treated.
