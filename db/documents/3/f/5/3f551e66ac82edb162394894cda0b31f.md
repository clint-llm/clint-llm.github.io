Laryngomalacia ranks as the most prevalent cause of infant stridor. It is important to make the diagnosis in early infancy as it may affect multiple aspects of growth and development. Stridor and noisy breathing are crucial symptoms to recognize as they may indicate varying degrees of respiratory compromise. Thorough upper airway evaluation is necessary for children suspected of laryngomalacia for accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of the condition and any underlying comorbidities. This activity presents a general overview of the current diagnostic and management strategies for laryngomalacia in infants.
