**Good Prognostic factors:**

- The prognosis of hyperopia is good if early diagnosis and treatment are started. It is of utmost importance in the pre-school age group. Cycloplegic refraction, followed by post-cycloplegic refraction, is mandatory for them. In suspected amblyopia, proper amblyopia management carries a good prognosis. If not done early, it may lead to amblyopia and permanent visual decline.

- Proper preoperative preparation and timely intervention carry a good prognosis.

**Bad prognostic factor:**

- Associated other ocular abnormalities

- Surgical intervention in unstable refraction cases

- Co-existing systemic syndromes

- Family history of squint and amblyopia
