Felons, along with paronychias, account for almost one-third of hand infections. Felons most commonly occur in the first and second digits of the hand. They are most commonly caused by penetrating trauma. However, anything that introduces bacteria into the digital pulp can lead to felon formation. Â Splinters, puncture wounds, bits of glass, abrasions, or bites can all be inciting factors. Paronychias are another common cause.
