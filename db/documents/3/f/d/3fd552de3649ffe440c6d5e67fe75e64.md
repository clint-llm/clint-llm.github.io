The lactase enzyme is located in the brush border of the small intestinal mucosa. Deficiency of lactase results in the presence of unabsorbed lactose within the bowel. This results in an influx of fluid into the bowel lumen resulting in osmotic diarrhea. Colonic bacteria ferment the unabsorbed lactose-producing gas (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane), which hydrolyzes lactose into monosaccharides.

An association has been reported between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms with lactose tolerance in a northeastern Brazilian population. In Indo-Europe, lactose intolerance is linked with rs4982235 SNP (or -13910C>T).
