The necessary equipment includes the following:

- Chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine

- Ultrasound probe with a sterile probe cover and gel (if applicable)

- Fluoroscopy equipment (if applicable)

- Nerve stimulator (if applicable)

- Local anesthetic, typically 1% lidocaine, for superficial layer local anesthesia

- Regional block local anesthetic test solution (2% lidocaine or 1.5% mepivacaine)

- A 10- to 20-mL syringe with extension tubing

- Block needle (length-variable depending on depth of targeted peripheral nerve) or spinal/epidural needle if neuraxial approach (needle characteristics based on body habitus and provider preference)

- Chemical neurolytic agent (alcohol, phenol), if applicable

- Radiofrequency probe, if applicable

- Cryo machine and cryoprobe with cooling agents (i.e. nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide), if applicable

Agents used for chemical neurolysis primarily include 50-100% alcohol and 5% to 15% phenol, although the use of other agents including hypertonic saline, glycerol, ammonium salt solutions, and chlorocresol has also been reported.

Radiofrequency probes are frequently used for nerve ablation of the medial branch nerve, percutaneous cordotomy, thermocoagulation of Gasserian ganglion, percutaneous rhizotomy, and percutaneous radiofrequency sympathectomy.

Cryoprobes attached to a cryo machine can be used to target nerves with extreme cold temperature exposure.

Finally, surgical neurolysis or neurectomy involves directly severing a nerve, and is generally reserved for rare cases with a poor prognosis. This modality carries a high risk of deafferentation pain, which is a complication due to loss of neuronal input leading to spontaneous firing within the spinothalamic tract.
