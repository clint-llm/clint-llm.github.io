As the largest lymphoid organ in the body, the spleen has a crucial function in the immune system. It is responsible for the production and maturation of IgM, B lymphocytes, and opsonins. Additionally, the spleen protects the body from infections caused by polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria, acts as the primary reservoir for platelets, and filters out damaged or malformed red blood cells, removing them from circulation. In addition, the spleen performs extramedullary hematopoiesis. This activity reviews the evaluation, management, and complications of functional asplenism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this patient population.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of functional asplenism.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with functional asplenism.
- Review the treatment and management options available for functional asplenism.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of functional asplenism and improve outcomes.
