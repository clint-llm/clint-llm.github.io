Ventricular tachycardia is the most common cause of broad complex tachycardia. However, there are multiple other causes of broad complex tachycardia. The common differentials of VT include supraventricular tachycardia with bundle branch aberrancy, supraventricular tachycardia with preexcitation, antidromic atrioventricular tachycardia (AVRT), pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, and metabolic derangements.

A meticulous history, clinical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) help differentiate ventricular tachycardia from the other causes of broad complex tachycardia.
