The pathophysiology of the spinal accessory nerve injury depends on the etiology and mechanism of injury. Axonal injury is typically followed by Wallerian degeneration. It is evidenced by needle electromyography (EMG) and scar formation, causing muscle atrophy and contractures.

Stretch on the accessory nerve impairs intraneural microvascular flow, causing ischemia and subsequently axonal rupture and degeneration. Usually, when stress on the accessory nerve due to traction is spread over a longer period of time, it is endured better than sudden and large stretches, as encountered in sudden acceleration-deceleration injuries.
