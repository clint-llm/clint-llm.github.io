The histopathology of nasal polyps depends mainly on the endotype classification. Polyps in patients with CRSwNP tend to have higher tissue eosinophilia, plasma cells, macrophages, edema, IL-5, and IgE. In contrast, in patients without nasal polyps, the collected specimens do not share this abundance of Th2 inflammatory markers. In the same cohort of patients, those who suffered from aspirin sensitivity (AERD) also had a generous amount of eosinophils and mast cells.

Another study confirmed increased tissue eosinophilia in patients with CRSwNP and patients with AERD; however, there was no statistically significant relationship between their asthma and tissue eosinophilia. Charcot-Leyden crystals can be found in nasal polyps specimens. The authors describe that the presence of these crystals typically correlates with worse endoscopic findings.
