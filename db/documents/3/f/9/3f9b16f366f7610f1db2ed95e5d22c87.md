The findings of Angelman syndrome (AS) are mostly limited to the nervous system because physiologically paternal UBE3A is only imprinted in the brain. So if there is a pathologic loss of function mutation of maternal UBE3A, mainly the brain is affected.

UBE3A codes for a ubiquitin ligase called E6-associated protein (E6-AP).

Mouse models of AS with UBE3A knockout of the maternal gene have shown ataxia, seizures, decreased size of the brain, motor abnormalities. These models have also demonstrated deficits in hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP), which explains deficits in memory and learning in AS patients.

There are mainly four mechanisms that cause loss of function of UBE3A. These are deletion, mutation, imprinting, and uniparental disomy.

The most severe symptoms are seen in the deletion subtype, out of which class 1 has the worst clinical phenotype. These include global developmental delay, microcephaly, and seizures, no speech, and oculocutaneous hypopigmentation. Increased susceptibility to seizures is seen since some of the GABA genes are deleted in deletion mutations. The deletion of OCA1 genes in combination with the regulatory effect of UBE3A on MC1R might explain oculocutaneous hypopigmentation.
