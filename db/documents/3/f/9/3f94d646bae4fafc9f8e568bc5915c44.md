Eyecare practitioners, including optometrists and ophthalmologists, evaluate, examine, and manage ocular diseases. The duochrome test can refine the spherical endpoint in measuring spherical refractive errors. Worldwide, especially in underdeveloped countries, the global visual initiative has created an invaluable and productive medium of collaboration and cooperation between various healthcare professionals to eliminate needless blindness.

The duochrome test can aid in achieving the optimum refractive correction when assessing a patient's refractive error. It can be used for screening purposes to determine if the individual has a refractive error (myopic or hypermetropic). Thus, it should be referred to an eye care professional for lens prescription.
