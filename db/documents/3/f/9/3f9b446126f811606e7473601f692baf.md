The study begins with an accurate measurement of the patient's height and weight. These metrics are important because, as mentioned above, blood volume can vary based on body size. Patients with higher body fat actually have a blood volume that is lower per unit of mass.

After this, intravenous access is obtained, and a control sample of blood is drawn from the patient. The patient then receives a prepared sample containing 1 mL of a radioisotope tracer containing 125I-human serum albumin (HSA) or 131I-HSA. A total of 12 minutes is allowed to pass for the isotope to mix within the blood appropriately. Once 12 minutes pass, the first blood sample is taken, followed by another sample every 6 minutes until there is a total of 5 specimens.

With carbon monoxide (CO) rebreathing, a small quantity of CO is diluted in oxygenÂ and rebreathed for a specified time period. Most of the CO is absorbed and bound to circulating hemoglobin. The dilution principle then allows the calculation of the total number of circulating hemoglobin molecules based on the number of absorbed CO molecules and the resulting changes in the fraction of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood.
