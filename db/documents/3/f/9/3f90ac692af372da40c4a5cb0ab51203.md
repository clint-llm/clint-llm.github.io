Opioid-exposed babies, more commonly after heroin exposure, are more likely to be born premature, have intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight. As alluded to earlier, due to the hypermetabolic state combined with difficulties in feeding and increased intestinal losses, these babies are at high risk for growth failure. NAS has been associated with life-threatening complications - seizures, especially in methadone-exposed infants, even though recent evidence shows it's a rare occurrence secondary to withdrawal. Ultimately, NAS babies are at higher risk for death as well.
