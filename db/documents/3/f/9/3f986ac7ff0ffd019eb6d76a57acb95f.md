Although long term studies in patients with SFIOLs have generally been favorable, this surgery has its own set of complications, which include:

- Transient corneal edema

- Postoperative hypotony

- Ocular hypertension

- Cystoid macular edema

- IOL dislocation

- IOL tilt and resultant astigmatism

- Pupillary capture of IOL

- Pseudophacodonesis

- Suprachoroidal or vitreous hemorrhage

- Retinal detachment, especially in patients with high myopia and Marfan syndrome

- Endophthalmitis

In addition, transscleral knot erosion through sclera and suture breakage in sutured SFIOL and haptic erosion and haptic dislodgement in the sutureless SFIOL may occur.
