Hemorrhoids are managed by an interprofessional team that includes an ED physician, general surgeon, colorectal surgeon, nurse practitioner, and primary care provider. Even though there are many treatments for hemorrhoids, recurrence is not uncommon. Thus, prevention is the recommended strategy. Patients should be educated on a healthy high fiber diet, drinking ample water, regular exercise, and maintaining healthy body weight. In individuals with recurrence, prolapsed, or bleeding internal hemorrhoids, a referral to a colorectal surgeon is recommended. Most patients with internal hemorrhoids have a good outcome. (Level II)
