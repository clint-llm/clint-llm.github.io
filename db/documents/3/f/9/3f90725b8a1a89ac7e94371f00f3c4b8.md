Donor pancreatic islet cells are infused into the recipient via the portal system. A portal venous pressure above 20 mmHg at baseline is a contraindication to transplantation due to the significantly increased risk of thrombosis. After a patient receives an islet cell allograft, they require lifelong immunosuppression. Because of this requirement, an inability to tolerate immunosuppression is a contraindication to transplantation.

Grafts also do not survive well when the body is fighting an active infection making active infection another contraindication. Malignancy is another contraindication, except for patients that have been cancer-free for more than five years after the excision of cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma.
