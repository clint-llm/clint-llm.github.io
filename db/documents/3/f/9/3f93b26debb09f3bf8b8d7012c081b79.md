Good communication between subspecialists (i.e., retina and glaucoma) is essential for the treatment and good outcomes of patients with Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome. These subspecialties need to function as an interdisciplinary, interprofessional team that includes nursing and other ancillary staff, communicating with other team members and accurately documenting all interactions and interventions in the patient's medical record.

Although the incidence and prevalence of Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome are low, ophthalmologists should be aware of this condition to ensure prompt treatment of both the retinal detachment and intraocular pressure elevation.
