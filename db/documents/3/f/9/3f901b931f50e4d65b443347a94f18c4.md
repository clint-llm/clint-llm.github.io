The gag reflex is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the vagus nerve (CN X). Embryologically, the glossopharyngeal nerve is associated with the derivatives of the third pharyngeal arch, while the vagus nerve is associated with the derivatives of the fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches.
