The most common presenting symptom is vague epigastric or left upper quadrant abdominal pain that may radiate toward the left shoulder. Other symptoms include gastrointestinal hemorrhage with subsequent hematemesis or hematochezia, or hemorrhage into the pancreatic duct with subsequent hemobilia.True aneurysms can be silent and asymptomatic; however, pseudoaneurysms are always symptomatic. Rupture is a rare but serious complication of SAA which may manifest by acute diffuse abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock with signs and symptoms of an acute surgical abdomen. Rupture incidence increases in multiparous women and patients with portal hypertension due to increased portal blood flow. The reported risk of SAA rupture is 2% to 10%, which is increased to 76% to 83% in symptomatic patients.
