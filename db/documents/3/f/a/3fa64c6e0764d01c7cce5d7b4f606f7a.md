Isoflurane should be carefully titrated to the patientâ€™s hemodynamics as it can cause precipitous drops in blood pressure due to dose-dependent peripheral vasodilation. Hypovolemic patients may be especially sensitive to these effects. Otherwise, there are no specific adverse effects of isoflurane.
