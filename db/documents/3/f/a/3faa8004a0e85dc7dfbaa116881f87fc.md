The xiphoid process is an important surgical landmark, especially in cardiac surgery. For example, in open-heart surgeries, this thoracic bone is used as a landmark for locating the midline while determining the exact location to place a mechanical saw before cutting through the sternum. It is imperative that the attachments of the xiphoid process are detached before inserting a saw to avoid injury to the diaphragm, lungs, or even the heart. Once the xiphoid process is detached, surgeons utilize a blunt dissection method to detach the sternal pericardial attachments by inserting a finger posterior to the sternum and bluntly dissecting from inferior to superior.

During pericardiocentesis, healthcare providers usually palpate for the xiphoid process and aim to insert the needle directly underneath the xiphoid, pointing toward the left shoulder.

Other surgical considerations of the xiphoid process include xiphoidectomy, the removal of the xiphoid process, which is commonly used to increase visualization during a total gastrectomy. This procedure has been shown to improve safety during surgery due to increased visualization of vital organs and structures.
