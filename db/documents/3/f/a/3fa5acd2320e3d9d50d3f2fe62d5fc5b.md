The optimal obstetric outcome can be expected by the early initiation of prenatal care. An essential element of prenatal care is the early detection of possible malformation, which is the primary goal of the mid-trimester anomaly scan. This cannot be achieved without optimized coordination amongst interprofessional team members, including well-trained sonographers, specialists -referral and parent counseling systems, nurses, obstetricians, fetal medicine specialists, surgeons, and others.
