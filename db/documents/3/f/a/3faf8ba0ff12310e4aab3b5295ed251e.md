The prognosis depends on the cause of the pleural effusion. Benign effusions can be cured, but if the cause is a malignancy, the prognosis is very poor. Another feature of pleural effusions is recurrence which can also occur with benign disorders like lupus, uremia, and rheumatoid arthritis. If the pleural effusion is not drained, it can lead to dyspnea and even empyema.
