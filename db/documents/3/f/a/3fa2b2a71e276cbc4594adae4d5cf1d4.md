Delirium and dementia are the most common causes of altered mental status in elderly patients. With dementia being one of the predisposing factors for delirium, often the two coexist, and sometimes when the dementia is rapidly progressive, it can be difficult to differentiate the two in patients without a prior history of dementia. This activity highlights the interprofessional team's role in the evaluation and management of patients with delirium and dementia.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the features of delirium and dementia.
- Review the occurrence of superadded delirium in patients with dementia.
- Explain the importance of differentiating delirium and dementia in elderly patients.
- Review the distinct features of delirium and dementia based on the history, physical exam, and diagnostic modalities.
