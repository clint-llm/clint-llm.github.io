A multi-disciplinary approach involving a co-ordinated team of an ophthalmologist, ocularist, pediatrician, and the patient’s family, is vital to enhance the outcomes. This inter-professional approach also aids in lowering the health-related financial burden on the patient’s family and promotes better compliance to treatment. Addressing psychosocial issues, connecting with the patient’s family, setting up futuristic goals and endpoints, and awareness regarding important time frames in a child’s life will maximize the outcomes.
