Contraindications to this procedure are few and obvious. Artificial rupture of membranes should not be undertaken in the case of malpresentation, vasa previa, suspected velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord, or in case of the unengaged fetal head or unstable lie. If the fetal presentation is unknown or not fully engaged, the risk for cord prolapse is increased. Additional contraindications include if the pregnant woman is not in active labor or if the patient refuses the intervention.
