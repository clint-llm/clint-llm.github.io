The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) increases diagnostic accuracy when evaluating the elderly for fall risk. An interprofessional team is involved, including providers specialized in internal medicine, geriatrics, orthopedics, cardiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, endocrinology, neurology, primary care providers, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and psychologists. Several studies show the effectiveness of a CGA compared to conventional treatment, due to the global evaluation and specific treatments.

Studies have demonstrated that complex falls prevention interventions delivered to a residential aged care population can possibly reduce fall risk when additional staffing, expertise, or resources are available. Organizations should determine how to best allocate resources for fall prevention and management.
