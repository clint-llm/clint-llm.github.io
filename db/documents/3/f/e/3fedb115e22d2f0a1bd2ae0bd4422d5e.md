Multigated acquisition (MUGA) scanning allows a provider to evaluate many heart parameters, including systolic and diastolic function, for any wall-motion abnormalities, valvular dysfunctions, and assessing these factors while the heart is at rest under stress. This can be used in the following clinical settings:

- Assessment of cardiac function in patients who are to receive chemotherapy, which may be potentially cardiotoxic

- Assessment of the orientation of the heart and great vessels in the chest

- Undiagnosed ischemic disease in the absence of myocardial infarction with hypodynamic wall motion

- Determination of systolic or diastolic dysfunction in undiagnosed congestive heart failure patients by viewing ventricular filling and contraction

- Evaluation of valve motion and associated ventricular function

- Evaluation of cardiac function in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Assessing for any intracardiac shunts

Despite these and other potential applications, the use of MUGA scans is largely limited in assessing cardiac functions in patients receiving cardiotoxic chemotherapy.
