The agent may cause nausea and vomiting if taken immediately after eating and is advised to be administered 2 hours post-meal or one hour before eating. Bethanechol parasympathetic effects of the M2 receptors located in the heart stimulate the SA node and AV node resulting in a decreased heart rate (bradycardia) and decreased electrical conduction rate. This activity may lead to more severe conditions such as heart blocks, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.

The parasympathetic actions on the M3 receptors present in vasculature cause vasodilation, further decreasing blood pressure.
