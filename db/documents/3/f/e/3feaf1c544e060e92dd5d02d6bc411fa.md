Both computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used in assessing sinonasal tumors to detect their presence, size, and invasiveness. In patients with BSNS, CT generally demonstrates a sinonasal mass with areas of hyperostosis, erosion of adjacent bony structures, and often post-obstructive sinus opacification.

On MRI, the tumor is isointense on T1 and T2, appearing similar to gray matter on T2. BSNS enhances heterogeneously with contrast.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scans may be ordered to determine the presence of metastases; however, the utility is limited in BSNS as these tumors display none-to-low PET avidity, and they rarely, if ever, metastasize either locally or distantly.
