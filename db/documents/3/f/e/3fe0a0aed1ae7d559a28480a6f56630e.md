Forensic pathologists are essentially required to estimate the time since death (TSD) to assist in death investigation by limiting the investigation period and thus helping narrow down the number of suspects in homicide cases. TSD also provides valuable information in establishing the timeline of events that lead to death. This activity reviews the prevalent methods, including traditional and modern techniques, and the inherent shortcomings of the methods of estimation of time since death relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the medico-legal investigation of death.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the importance of estimation of time since death in the medico-legal investigation of the death.
- Summarize the factors affecting the changes that occur after death.
- Describe the stages of post-mortem changes and identify the appropriate methods for estimation of time since death.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes in the medico-legal investigation of death and deliverance of justice.
