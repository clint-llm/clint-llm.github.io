Toxoplasmosis can cause severe life-threatening complications in immunosuppressed individuals manifesting as toxoplasmic encephalitis or extracerebral toxoplasmosis. Initiation of treatment can be complicated by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), resulting in a paradoxical worsening of symptoms. Treatment involves continuing anti-infective therapy, antiretroviral therapy, and starting steroids (or increasing dose if patients are already on steroids).
