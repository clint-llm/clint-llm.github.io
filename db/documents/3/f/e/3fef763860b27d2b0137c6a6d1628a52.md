Rusu et al. in 2009 had analyzed the pterygopalatine ganglion of 20 adult human specimens, to which four distinct morphological forms of the pterygopalatine ganglion detailing whether the pterygopalatine ganglion was a single or partitioned unit as well as where the Vidian nerve entered the pterygopalatine ganglion, were described as follows:

- Type A – a partitioned structure with the superior partition receiving the Vidian nerve and constituting 10% of observed specimens

- Type B – a single structure with the superior part (base) of the pterygopalatine ganglion receiving the Vidian nerve and constituting 55% of observed specimens

- Type C – a single structure with the inferior part (tip) of the pterygopalatine ganglion receiving the Vidian nerve and constituting 15% of observed specimens

- Type D – a partitioned structure with the inferior partition receiving the Vidian nerve and constituting 20% of observed specimens

Various sources of the literature have detailed the shape of the pterygopalatine ganglion to be triangular,
