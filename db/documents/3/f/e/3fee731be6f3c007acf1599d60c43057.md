Healthcare workers, including nurses who work in the emergency department or the ICU, need to know about the indications and contraindications for albumin. While the colloid is safe, it may rarely induce an anaphylactoidÂ reaction. With larger doses, albumin infusions can cause fluid overload and electrolyte disturbances. Thus, it is crucial to understand how to manage this adverse reaction.

The clinician will decide to use albumin colloid albumin, but the nursing staff will administer it in most cases. They can verify administration and dosing with the pharmacy and understand the adverse reactions mentioned above to alert the managing clinician promptly. The pharmacist should also have involvement with checking the patient's administration record so the team can make dose adjustments for protein-bound drugs, if necessary. The interprofessional team methodology is the best means by which patient outcomes can achieve their optimal result when using albumin therapeutically. [Level 5]
