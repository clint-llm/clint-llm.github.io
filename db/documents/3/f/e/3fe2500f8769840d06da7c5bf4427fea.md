Entamoeba histolytica is a parasitic protozoan that is a common cause of amoebic colitis. This particular amoeba causes about 40 million infections annually, with deaths of up to 100,000 per year. E. despar, which also occurs in humans via the fecal-oral route, it is nonpathogenic and may present as an asymptomatic carrier. Entamoeba species, namely E. dispar and E. moshkovskii infect humans, but only E. histolytica causes amebiasis. The only natural host for E. histolytica includes both human and Non-Human primates, which accounts for the infection that occurs.
