Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) known formerly as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a form of idiopathic diffuse interstitial lung disease. Davison et al. coined the term COP in 1983. This was followed by detailed descriptions of the disease under the term BOOP by Epler et al. in 1985. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is believed to be a consequence of alveolar injury and is characterized by the formation of organized buds of granulation tissue obstructing the alveolar lumen and bronchioles resulting in respiratory failure. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
- Review the presentation of a patient with cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
- Summarize the treatment options for cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
