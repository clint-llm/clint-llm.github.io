ELISA testing is an important part of medical care and scientific research. Collaboration between scientists, laboratory technicians, phlebotomists, clinicians, nurses, and other medical professionals is necessary for appropriate specimen collection, testing, interpretation, diagnosis, and effective patient education and treatment planning. ELISA technologies continue to grow and play a major role in clinical research allowing for theÂ development of more diagnostic and screening tests. The continued evolution of ELISA testing is promising for the future of medicine and has improved early diagnosis of HIV and pregnancy detection.
