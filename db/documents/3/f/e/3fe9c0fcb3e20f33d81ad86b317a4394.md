An extra copy of chromosome 21 is associated with Down syndrome, which occurs due to the failure of chromosome 21 to separate during gametogenesis resulting in an extra chromosome in all the body cells. Robertsonian translocation and isochromosome or ring chromosome are the other 2 possible causes of trisomy 21. Isochromosome is a condition when 2 long arms separate together instead of the long and short arm while in Robertsonian translocation. This occurs in 2% to 4% of the patients. The long arm of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome, mostly chromosome 14. In mosaicism, there are 2 different cell lines because of error of division after fertilization.
