At the most basic level, anything placed with adequate strength, size and length may be considered as an immobilization option. These should immobilize the hip and the knee as well to prevent movement and further injury. In a non-medical environment, these basic principles should guide the placement of an improvised device.

There are multiple devices which may be used in immobilizing the femur. Pre-hospital providers often useÂ commercial traction splints which have a rigid element with straps to attach to the patient and then apply traction using cords and tension devices. In the hospital, weighted traction splints may be placed on the patient. One of 2 methods creates this traction. The non-invasive method is to use a strap on the ankle and keeping the injured lower extremity straight weight is hung from the end of the bed typically using a frame and pulley system. Some fractures in the multiply injured patient may require transfemoral or transtibial pins to be placed which then allow skeletal traction. These pins are placed with careful sterile preparation and need specialized equipment typically found in orthopedic operating trays.
