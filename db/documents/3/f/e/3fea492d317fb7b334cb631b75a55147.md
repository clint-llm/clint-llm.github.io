In patients who do not have diabetes, hypoglycemia is uncommon, but when it occurs, there are a few major causes of hypoglycemia: pharmacologic, alcohol, critical illness, counter-regulatory hormone deficiencies, and non-islet cell tumors

Most hypoglycemia cases occur in patients with diabetes who are undergoing therapeutic intervention with meglitinides, sulfonylureas, or insulin. Drugs are the most common cause of hypoglycemia.

Alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesis in the body but does not affect glycogenolysis. Thus, hypoglycemia occurs after several days of alcohol consumption, and after glycogen stores are depleted.

For example, in critical illness states, end-stage liver disease, sepsis, starvation, or renal failure, glucose utilization exceeds glucose intake, glycogenolysis, and/or gluconeogenesis. The result of this imbalance is potentially the reason why hypoglycemia may occur. Counter-regulatory hormone deficiencies can occur as in states of adrenal insufficiency. Hypoglycemia associated with such deficiencies is rare. Non-islet cell tumors may also cause hypoglycemia through increased secretion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2).

Insulinomas are hyperfunctioning islet cell tumors associated with increased insulin secretion. They can be life-threatening and primarily manifest with fasting morning hypoglycemia. Although these tumors are rare, they should be a consideration in the workup of suspected cases.
