All local anesthetics can cause direct neurotoxicity, depending on the dose and time of contact with the nerve. The occurrence of clinically relevant myopathy and myonecrosis has been described after continuous peripheral blocks, infiltration of wound margins, trigger point injections, and peri- and retrobulbar blocks. Histologically, myofibril hypercontraction progresses to lytic degeneration, edema, and necrosis. Regeneration usually occurs after three to four weeks. Concomitant steroid or epinephrine injections can worsen myonecrosis.
