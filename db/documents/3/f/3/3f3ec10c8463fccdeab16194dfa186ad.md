All health-care providers caring for patients diagnosed with BSS must emphasize on preventive care to patients and families. In addition to these, the following consultants must be involved.

- A hematologist (pediatric or adult) must be involved in case the patient requires emergency or elective surgery.

- In the event of planning for pregnancy, high-risk obstetrics and gynecology teams must be involved.

- Transfusion medicine must be consulted whenever blood products are required to meticulously screen for antibodies and provide for HLA-matched platelets.
