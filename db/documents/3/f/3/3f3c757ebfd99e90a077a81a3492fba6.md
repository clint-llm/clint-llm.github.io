Otoacoustic emissions testing offers another modality of evaluation of the auditory system beyond conventional audiometry. It may be performed for patients with suspected hearing loss who cannot tolerate or complete conventional hearing tests. The testing does not require recording a patient's subjective response to sound. There are several different ways to measure otoacoustic emissions, each with advantages and disadvantages. This activity reviews the evaluation of hearing loss using otoacoustic emission testing and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the physiology of how otoacoustic emission is produced.
- Outline the different forms of otoacoustic emission testing.
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each type of otoacoustic emission testing.
- Illustrate the clinical significance of performing otoacoustic emission.
