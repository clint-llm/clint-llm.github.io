The prognosis of blunt eye trauma depends heavily on the sequela of the trauma. One study showed that ocular trauma, in general, resulted in monocular blindness in one-quarter of patients.

The extent of the initial injury and the injury mechanism often predict whether poor outcomes might be expected. To give the best prognosis of an individual's visual prognosis, the Ocular Trauma Score is a verified method to predict the functional outcome of an eye after trauma.
