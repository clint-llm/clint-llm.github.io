Arterial cannulation is a procedure frequently performed in acute and critical care settings. It serves as an invasive means to more accurately measure blood pressure and mean arterial pressure than non-invasive means. Artery cannulation gives precise measurements that allow for immediate recognition of alterations, thus allowing for quicker intervention and potential stabilization of a patient. This activity describes the technique and indications for arterial cannulation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring safe arterial access.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique of inserting arterial lines.
- Describe the indications for inserting arterial lines.
- Recall the complications of arterial lines.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients needing arterial access.
