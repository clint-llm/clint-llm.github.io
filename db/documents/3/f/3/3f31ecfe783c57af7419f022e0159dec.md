Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health and an adequate quality of life. Physical activity has health benefits for everyone regardless of age, current fitness level, or underlying clinical conditions. Physical activity is linked with positive health outcomes that can start accumulating immediately after doing physical activity. Still, most Americans do not meet the key guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity. This activity reviews the current national guidelines for physical activity outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2018 with supplemental recommendations and guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2020 Guidelines for physical activity and sedentary behavior.

**Objectives:**
- Review the health benefits associated with increased physical activity.
- Outline the United States national guidelines for physical activity.
- Identify differences in physical activity recommendations for special populations, such as pregnant women, people living with chronic diseases, and the elderly.
- Explain the role of an integrated interprofessional team in helping the population meet key guidelines for physical activity in the United States.
