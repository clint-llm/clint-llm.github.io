There is no specific historical detail or physical examination finding that differentiates strokes from stroke mimics, which include metabolic disturbances, intracranial lesions, seizures, and psychiatric disorders.Â Stroke mimics may present with neurological deficits in a vascular territory or symptoms may span multiple vascular territories or follow no vascular pattern. The mapping of symptoms to a vascular territory may help differentiate true CVAs from stroke mimics, though it is important to remember that stroke mimics may follow a vascular territory as well. Gradual onset is suggestive of a stroke mimic rather than a CVA, since CVAs, with the exception of some vertebrobasilar strokes, typically present with acute onset of symptoms. The presence of positive neurological symptoms, such as hemiballismus or hallucinations, suggests a stroke mimic rather than a CVA, which typically present with only negative neurological symptoms such as loss of sensation or paralysis.
