An occupational and environmental exposure history will greatly aid the treating clinician, but should not delay treatment of acute, life-threatening toxicity. A focused history should determine toxin exposure, dose, route, time of exposure, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to include respiratory protection. In acute exposure, symptoms may vary by the degree of exposure ranging from dizziness, shortness of breath, and headaches to CNS depression, respiratory arrest, and death with severe exposure.

Those with a remote history of significant VCM exposure or those with ongoing significant chronic exposures may present with mild acute symptoms as described above or may endorse non-specific systemic symptoms such as malaise, night sweats, and weight loss if malignancy is present.

Physical examination findings may be representative of VCM induced complications. In acute exposures, respiratory distress or somnolence may be a presenting sign. Complications from significant chronic exposure may manifest as thickened skin over the hands and forefingers, or Reynaud phenomenon and acroosteolysis (AOL), to abdominal distension, ascites, or cachexia in those with advanced hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS).
