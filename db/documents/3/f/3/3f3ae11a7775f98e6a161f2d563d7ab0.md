Broadly speaking, lead interacts with human physiology in two significant ways: it has a strong affinity for sulfhydryl groups and electron donor groups in general, such that lead ends up bound to and affecting a wide range of proteins. Because of its similarity to other divalent cations like calcium and zinc, it interferes with the vast array of cellular mechanisms that are regulated by and mediated by these cations.

From a neurologic perspective, lead is thought to undermine the normal synaptic pruning process in young brains, likely underlying the cognitive and behavioral changes seen in young children with excessive lead exposure.

From a hematologic perspective, lead causes anemia by interfering with the function of several enzymes involved in heme synthesis as well as enzymes involved in maintaining erythrocyte cell membrane integrity, which leads to decreased production and increased destruction of erythrocytes, respectively.

From a renal perspective, lead can induce a global proximal tubule dysfunction leading to a Fanconi-like syndrome, and lead also competes with uric acid for excretion in the distal tubule, leading to higher blood concentrations of urate, which ultimately gets deposited as urate crystals in joints and is the mechanism underlying so-called “saturnine gout.” Lead is also known to be associated with the development of hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease; the mechanism is likely multifactorial and may involve increasing serum renin concentrations and activity as well as the development of neuropathy of the peripheral autonomic nervous system.
