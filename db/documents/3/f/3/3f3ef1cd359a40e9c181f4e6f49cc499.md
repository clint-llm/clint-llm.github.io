Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in the human diet that the body needs to metabolize. It is present in honey, fruits, vegetables, and high-fructose corn syrup used during manufacturing beverages (soft drinks) and food. Their consumption results in a significant amount of added sugars entering the diet, approximately half of which is fructose. Sucrose (table sugar) converts to fructose and glucose by acid hydrolysis in the stomach, and sucrase-isomaltase cleavage in the small intestine.

Transport and metabolism of fructose do not require insulin; only a few tissues such as the liver, intestine, kidney, adipose tissue, and muscle can metabolize it. Glucose and fructose have similar metabolic fates because most of the dietary fructose converts into glucose.
