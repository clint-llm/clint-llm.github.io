Given the fact that PI can be fatal, signs of respiratory distress or hemodynamic collapse should be addressed immediately with supportive care measures. Patients with PI may develop obstructive shock associated with a PE or cardiorespiratory collapse secondary to hemodynamic collapse or persistent hypoxia.

In addition to supportive management, treatment is guided by the underlying condition that has led to the PI. PE initially requires anticoagulation. In patients requiring admission, heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is started with the goal of transitioning to some of the newer direct oral anticoagulation (DOACs) medications like apixaban or rivaroxaban or some of the older medications like coumadin for continued outpatient management.

The average time of resolution of pulmonary infarction has not been well studied.  However, one retrospective review found that of 32 patients evaluated by CT scanning after pulmonary infarctions with intervals varying from 1 to 69 weeks after initial diagnosis, 10 were found to have continued evidence of PI at an average interval of 10 weeks after the initial diagnosis.

Current radiographic technology in the setting of the appropriate clinical picture makes it such that biopsy is rarely used to diagnose PI. A lung biopsy is typically reserved for investigating a pulmonary nodule, suspected mass, interstitial lung disease, or to collect a sample for culture.
