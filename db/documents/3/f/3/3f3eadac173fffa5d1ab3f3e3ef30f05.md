Investigations can be grouped into three categories.

- Detect disturbance of the BRB: FFA, vitreous fluorophotometry, and laser flare cell photometer.

- Detect retinal tissue thickening: OCT, retinal thickness analyzer (RTA), and scanning laser ophthalmoscope.

- Assess the impact on visual function: Contrast sensitivity, multi-focal electroretinogram, and microperimetry.

We will restrict our discussion to the important points related to FFA and OCT only as they are the most commonly used investigations.

**Fundus fluorescein angiography:**A significant amount of edema (cystoid or non-cystoid), especially if turbid (due to lipid-laden macrophages), partially blocks the early phase choroidal fluorescence. The arteriovenous phase may show dilation of the fine capillary network and/or telangiectatic retinal vessels around the fovea. The late phase shows hyperfluorescence due to the accumulation of dye leaking from retinal vessels. The amount of leakage depends on the amount of dysfunctional retinal vascular endothelium. The hyperfluorescence may be either cystic or diffuse irregular staining. If the leakage is pronounced, the cystoid spaces fill rapidly, and hyperfluorescence may appear within one minute of injection. The large confluent cysts that are occasionally seen with severe CME may fill late. In case the leakage is not marked, the hyperfluorescence tends to appear late. The large retinal vessels can also leak (called perivascular staining) in case of inflammation, traction (severe pull on a large retinal vessel), or occlusion. A large retina vessel may leak if it is partially occluded or traverses an area of occlusion (capillary nonperfusion).

Conditions where an FFA leak is not demonstrated, despite macular edema, include RP, JXLR, Goldmann-Favre disease, and nicotinic acid toxicity.

ETDRS defined focal DME as ≥67% leakage associated with microaneurysms, intermediate as 33 to 66% leakage associated with microaneurysms, and diffuse as <33% leakage associated with microaneurysms.

**Optical coherence tomography**: Owing to its excellent reproducibility, it is currently the investigation of choice for diagnosing CME and monitoring its treatment. OCT has also been used for classifying multiple diseases, which can help in prognosticating patients.

a) Diabetic macular edema: Kim et al. proposed five morphologic DME patterns.

- Diffuse retinal thickening (DRT) is defined as increased retinal thickness (>200 microns height and >200 microns width) with areas of lower reflectivity, especially in the outer retinal layers.

- CME is defined as low reflectivity intraretinal round- or oval-spaced spaces with high reflective septa separating them.

- Posterior hyaloid traction (PHT) or taut posterior hyaloid membrane (TPHM) is defined as a highly reflective membrane on the inner retinal surface, causing tractional retinal elevation.

- Subretinal fluid is defined as a dome-shaped dark area between the NSR and RPE.

- Tractional retinal detachment (TRD) is a peak-shaped retinal detachment caused due to traction produced by the proliferative membranes present over the retinal surface and/or in the vitreous.

b) Radiation retinopathy: Horgan et al. proposed a five-point OCT-based grading that correlated with visual acuity. Grade 1 was defined as foveola sparing non-CME, grade 2 as foveola sparing CME, grade 3 as foveola-involving non-CME, grade 4 as mild-to-moderate foveola-involving CME, and grade 5 as foveola-involving severe CME.

c) Congenital juvenile X-linked retinoschisis: Prenner et al. proposed a classification system based on clinical and OCT findings.

- Type 1 (foveal) was defined as the absence of both lamellar schisis on OCT and peripheral schisis on the ophthalmoscope.

- Type 2 (foveo-lamellar) as the presence of lamellar schisis on OCT without peripheral schisis on the ophthalmoscope

- Type 3 (complex) as the presence of both lamellar schisis on OCT and peripheral schisis on the ophthalmoscope

- Type 4 (foveo-peripheral) as the presence of peripheral schisis on ophthalmoscopy without lamellar schisis on OCT.
