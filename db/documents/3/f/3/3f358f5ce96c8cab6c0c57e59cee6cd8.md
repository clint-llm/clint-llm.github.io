TFCC injury often occurs when a load is compressed on the TFCC while the wrist is in ulnar deviation. Common causes of forced ulnar deviation include swinging a racket or a bat. TFCC injury is also associated with positive ulnar variance; this is when the articular surface of the ulna is more distal than the articular surface of the radius. Positive ulnar variance is often due to prior surgery or prior fracture.
