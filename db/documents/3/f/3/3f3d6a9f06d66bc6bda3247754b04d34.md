Balloon dilatation and angioplasty are not advised for infants that are less than four months old.

Given the concern for femoral arterial injury with large sheath placement, stent utilization is typically not advised in patients weighing less than 25 kg. In addition, placing a stent in patients less than 30 kg necessitates repeated stent dilatations as they grow. Thus, it has been recommended that stent implantation is only pursued in patients who are able to receive a stent that can be further dilated to adult size.
