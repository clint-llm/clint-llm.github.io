The cerebellum develops from the hindbrain vesicle that gives rise to the posterior part of the alar plates of the metencephalon. The cerebellar hemisphere and vermis form by the 12thÂ week. Accordion-like folds gradually start developing from about the fourth month. Neurons of cerebellar cortex form by the neuroblast derived from the matrix cells in the ventricular zone. Other neuroblasts from the ventricular surface differentiate into cerebellar nuclei, which axons grow towards the mesencephalon (midbrain) and create the superior cerebellar peduncle. Later, projections of the axons of the corticopontine and the pontocerebellar fibers will develop the middle cerebellar peduncle and connect the cerebral cortex with the cerebellum. The inferior cerebellar peduncle will form mainly by the growth of sensory axons from the spinal cord, the olivary and vestibular nuclei.
