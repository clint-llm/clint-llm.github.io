The prognosis of FCH depends on several factors, including the age of onset, the severity of lipid abnormalities, comorbidities, and treatment adherence. FCH is associated with an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), leading to significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated.

To date, no appropriately designed trials have been conducted to determine the unique risk of cardiovascular disease among patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia. However, some authors propose that their risk may be at least as high as that of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.
