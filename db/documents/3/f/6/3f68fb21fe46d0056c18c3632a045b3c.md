Diagnosis of the IGE is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on a typical history with a lack of findings on examination (excluding possibly precipitating an absence seizure with hyperventilation). This has support from electroencephalogram (EEG) evidence.Â There is normal background activity with generalized spike-and-wave discharges interictally.
