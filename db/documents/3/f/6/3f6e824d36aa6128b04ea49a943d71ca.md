Headache disorders have a large global burden. Both acute and chronic headaches are most prevalent between the teenage years and the fifth decade.

Chronic headaches occur in 1 to 4% of the entire population.

Chronic migraines are associated with significant comorbidities, including obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, chronic pain disorders, and cardiovascular disease.

Chronic migraine headaches also have a prevalence of 7 to 17% in children and adolescents.

Hemicrania continua is less common than chronic migraine or tension headache. It has a 2Â to 1 female to male incidence, with the peak diagnosis occurring in the third decade.

Chronic cluster headache occurs more often in men but is also experienced by women. Women often have nausea and vomiting associated with chronic cluster headaches and may be initially diagnosed with migraine headaches.
