The tongue is an extremely sensitive organ that performs on a complex muscle background. The primary functions of the stomatognathic system, such as mastication, deglutition, and speech, require the active involvement of the tongue. Embryologically, the development of tongue is a very complicated process that starts around the fourth or fifth week of the gestation period, and its development has a marked influence on the oral cavity.
