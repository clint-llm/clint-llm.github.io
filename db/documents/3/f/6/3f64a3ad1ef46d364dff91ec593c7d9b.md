Most references suggest the spleen is the most commonly injured solid organ in trauma for both blunt and penetrating mechanisms. The wound of a penetrating trauma need not be near the spleen to cause significant injury. Penetrating stab wounds made by right-handed assailants tend to enter the abdomen on the left side and are more associated with spleen injuries than if the assailant is left-handed. Other severe injuries can be associated with spleen trauma, so these should be looked for during patient assessment.
