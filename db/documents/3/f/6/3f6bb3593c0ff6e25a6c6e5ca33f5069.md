The prognosis of a patient with congenital ptosis depends upon the severity, type, associated findings, time of presentation, whether unilateral or bilateral, choice of surgery, and post-surgical outcomes. If the proper examination is done of a case of ptosis, the parameters of the measurement are very accurate. Planning of the type of surgery is precisely dependent on the preoperative measurements. If not done properly could lead to under or over correction of ptosis.
