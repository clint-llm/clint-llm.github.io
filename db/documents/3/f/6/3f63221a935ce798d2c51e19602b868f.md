The usage of contrast media has increased the sensitivity and specificity of many exams. While not all conditions merit the use of contrast, ordering physicians should be aware of the risks. The risk of PC-AKI (CIN) and NSF are most evident for those with an eGFR at or below 30, and caution is advised. While undergoing contrast administration, patients should be monitored for reactions with nurses, technologists, and physicians aware of how to identify and treat potentially life-threatening reactions. The history of a prior reaction may merit pretreatment of at least 5, or possibly 13 hours. The use of contrast in a pregnant population is limited, but in lactating women, no pause in breastfeeding is required.
