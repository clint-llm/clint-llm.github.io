In the normal menstrual cycle, estrogen leads to proliferative endometrium. After ovulation in the luteal phase, endometrium shows secretory changes under the effect of progesterone. In the follicular phase, normal endometrial tissue shows no glandular crowding, and the ratio of glands to stroma is less than 50%. In the secretory phase, the normal endometrial glands may show features such as minimal crowding and a small increase in gland-to-stroma ratio. Despite these features, the endometrial glands are organized and cells of the glands that do not show mitoses.

In endometrial hyperplasia without atypia, the glandular to stromal ratio is increased to more than 50 % (Reed SD, Urban RR. Classification and diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia.)

The glands may show mild crowding, cystic dilatation with sparingly seen outpouching and mitoses. However, atypical cellular features are not seen.

In endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, the gland-to-stroma ratio is increased further.

There have been three main classification systems used for endometrial hyperplasia. These were based on the histopathological characteristics of the lesion and their propensity to progress to malignancy. WHO proposed a classification in 1994, which was accepted and used widely. It was based on the work of Kurman et al., who performed a retrospective study on 170 women with varying degrees of hyperplasia (architectural complexity and atypical features.

- Simple hyperplasia without atypia: the number of glands increased, but the regular architecture was not compromised; progression rate to cancer 1%.

- Simple hyperplasia with atypia: simple hyperplasia with features of nuclear atypia( marked variation in nuclear shape and size and prominent nucleoli); progression rate to cancer 8%

- Complex hyperplasia without atypia: glands become more crowded and irregular; progression rate to cancer 3%.

- Complex hyperplasia with atypia: complex hyperplasia with atypical features, progression rate to cancer 29%.

Up to half of the cases of complex atypical hyperplasia can have coexistent endometrial adenocarcinoma.

Considering these issues, WHO simplified the classification of endometrial hyperplasia in 2014 and proposed two categories based upon the presence of cytologic atypia:

- Hyperplasia without atypia

- Atypical hyperplasia/ endometrioid intraepithelial neoplasia

The terms ‘simple’ and ‘complex’ are not used in this classification.

In the year 2000, a group of gynecologic pathologists suggested endometrial intraepithelial lesion (EIN) classification.
