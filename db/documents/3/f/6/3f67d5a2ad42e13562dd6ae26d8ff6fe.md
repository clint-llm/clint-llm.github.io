Psittacosis can affect any age group and gender, but incidence tends to peak in middle age, with an age range of 35 to 55.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States classifies psittacosis as a reportable condition in most states, with estimated confirmed cases numbering fewer than ten annually. This is likely due to underdiagnosis and underreporting. Individuals with exposure to pet shops, veterinary hospitals, bird exhibitions, and occupational exposure in the poultry industry are considered at the highest risk of contracting the disease.

Psittacosis has been reported throughout the world. In a meta-analysis review of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) worldwide, C. psittaci was reported to be the causative agent in 1.03% of the cases, with a range of 0 to 6.7%.C psittaci.

Improved diagnostic techniques and strategies will likely lead to an apparent increase in the incidence of psittacosis. A 2022 study from China, using combined molecular techniques to identify pathogens in severe community-acquired pneumonia cases, revealed that Chlamydia psittaci was the causative agent in 6.8% of the patients (15 out of 222).
