Healthcare workers, including cardiologists, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists, who plan to use adenosine, should be veryÂ familiar with the indications and contraindications. Any patient receiving adenosine should be on a form of cardiac monitoring. Patients receiving treatment for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) are often on a 12-lead electrocardiogram rhythm monitoring to assess the underlying rhythm, while adenosine actively affects the AV node. In cases of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, a defibrillator should be available in case of rapid decompensation. If one has never used adenosine before, it is important to first speak to a cardiologist.

It would also benefit the clinician to consult a cardiology board-certified pharmacist to ensure proper dosing for the application at hand. Cardiology specialty-trained nurses can also assist in administering the drug, helping during a pharmacological stress test, or following up when using adenosine therapeutically. Open communication must exist between the clinician, cardiologist, nurses, and pharmacists so that an interprofessional team works on the case and the patient receives the optimal benefit. [Level 5]
