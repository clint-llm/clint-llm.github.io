The relationship of the leiomyoma with the uterine cavity is important for understanding symptoms and treatment options. Myomas are classified using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification system, which predominantly categorizes based on location (Figure 1).

Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) imaging remains the best tool for initial evaluation when fibroids are suspected.

Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) is also useful in evaluating the distinction between Type 1-3 fibroids as it provides a clearer picture of extension into the endometrial cavity (figure 3).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most effective imaging to detect the size and location of fibroids; however, given the cost of this modality, it is not routinely used and is instead useful for surgical planning since it can help identify vasculature, degenerating fibroids, location, and depth into the myometrium (figure 4).
