Some of the characteristic histopathologic features of SPS include loss of GABAergic neurons in the spinal cord and cerebellum with scattered areas of inflammatory changes. Additionally, chromatolysis and vacuolization of anterior horn cells of the lower spinal cord segments were also described.****Paraneoplastic SPS is associated with more pronounced inflammatory changes in the temporal lobes, brainstem, and spinal cord.
