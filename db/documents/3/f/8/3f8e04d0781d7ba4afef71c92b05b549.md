The heart muscle is the myocardium or middle layer of the heart walls. The myocardium is responsible for the contractile function of the cardiac pump. Composed of cardiomyocytes, the heart muscle has distinctive cellular and physiological features allowing it to generate force to maintain adequate tissue and organ perfusion throughout the entire body. Heart muscle makes up one of the earliest functioning embryonic organs that continues to contract and beat from development throughout a lifetime. Supplied by a complex system of coronary vasculature, cardiac lymphatics, and autonomic innervation, cardiomyocytes line the thickest layer of every chamber of the heart. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. A vast number of these diseases involve the heart muscles with diverse mechanisms of pathophysiology, leading to contractile dysfunction, cell damage and death, and cardiac pump failure. However, numerous interventions, treatment options, and therapies are aimed at minimizing damage, restoring functionality, preventing the occurrence, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.
