In plastic surgery, the superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS), which contains the risorius muscle, is manipulated during cosmetic surgeries of the face, such as rhytidectomies (facelifts). Removal of excess facial skin along with tightening of the underlying tissues (SMAS) helps to create a more youthful appearance. Facelift surgery was the sixth most popular cosmetic surgery in 2011 according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
