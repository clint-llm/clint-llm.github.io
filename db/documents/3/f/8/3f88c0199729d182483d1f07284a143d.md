Toxic doses of theophylline can be as low as 7.5 mg/kg. When taken orally, 80% to 100% of theophylline is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum levels can occur from 30 to 120 minutes for immediate release formulations. Sustained-release formulations have peak levels between 6 and 10 hours. Intravenously, theophylline takes 30 minutes to reach peak levels. Therapeutic serum levels range from 10 to 20 mcg/mL. Toxic levels are considered to be 20 mcg/mL or higher. However, toxic effects can be seen within therapeutic levels as well.   Cardiac dysrhythmias, seizures, and death can be seen with 80 to 100 mcg/mL levels. Chronic toxicity can be seen at levels of 40 to 60 mcg/mL. Fifty percent to 65% of theophylline is protein-bound in the circulation. The volume of distribution is small, at 0.45 L/kg. The half-life varies with age. A half-life of 4 to 8 hours is seen in young adults. A shorter half-life is seen in newborns. Theophylline is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system and excreted by the kidneys. Therefore, any agents or pathology that alters the cytochrome P450 system or renal function can have a substantial effect on theophylline levels.
