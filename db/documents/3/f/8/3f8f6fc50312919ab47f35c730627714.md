Filgrastim requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Although it has uses in other fields of medicine, its primary use is in the field of hematology and oncology to reduce the duration of neutropenia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or patients with myelosuppression. Clinicians should prioritize monitoring patients as monitoring is essential to track the response and minimize complications. Nurses should be aware of the proper method of drug administration and be alert to signs of infection and adverse effects. Pharmacists are also crucial for appropriate dosing schedules. The principal aim of filgrastim is to reduce the incidence of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Thus, being alert to signs of infection would guide dosage and improve response outcomes in these patients. The interprofessional team approach will drive optimal patient results with the fewest adverse events in patients receiving filgrastim. [Level 5]
