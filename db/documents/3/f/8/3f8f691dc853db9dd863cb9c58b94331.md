Lissencephaly includes a range of severe brain malformations, including agyria (absent gyri), pachygyria (broad gyri), and subcortical band heterotopia.

Lissencephaly is caused by a defect in neuronal migration during embryonic development between 12 and 24 weeks of gestation that results in the absence of normal development of brain gyri and sulci.
