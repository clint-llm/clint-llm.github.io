Leptospirosis is caused by an infection with the spirochete bacterium Leptospira. It is most often spread through exposure to the urine of infected animals either from direct contact or from contact with soil or water contaminated by the urine. Common animals that transmit Leptospirosis include farm animals such as cattle, pigs, and horses but can range from wild animals such as raccoons and porcupines to domesticated dogs.
