After attempted decompression, reassess the patient by auscultating lung sounds. This is only temporizing treatment. A patient with a tension pneumothorax will need a chest tube placement upon arrival to the emergency department. Complications of treatment include worsening pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, and lung parenchymal damage.

Three to six hours of observation is recommended for those patients that have a simple, spontaneous pneumothorax that was treated only with oxygen and observation. Any other patient should be observed for longer periods. Following a pneumothorax, there is an increased risk of recurrence, especially at high altitude altitudes, so patients should avoid traveling by air for 7 to 14 days after treatment. Additionally, the patient should not go diving unless they have been managed with definitive surgical treatment.
