In a patient with a winged scapula, the medial or lateral aspect of the scapula appears to be protruding from the back. As the name of the condition implies, it can create a winged appearance. This abnormal position of the scapula can lead to many physical functional disabilities such as pain, decreased strength, and range of motion disruptions. TheÂ ranges of motion that are typically abnormal are abduction and flexion of the affected upper extremity.
