Treatment is first aimed at controlling and treating the underlying vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

Two large studies, the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) found that endarterectomy in symptomatic patients who have carotid stenosis greater than 70% reduces future risks of stroke. However, these studies did not address ocular TIAs separately. The NASCET further compared patients with hemispheric TIAs and ocular TIAs demonstrating that patients with hemispheric TIAs had a 2-year stroke incidence of about 44% compared to about 17% in ocular TIAs. The patients with ocular TIAs did not experience a major stroke episode, which was defined as a functional deficit persisting for more than 90 days. Both groups also had similar grades of carotid stenosis (about 83%).

Therefore, the clinician needs to address if the risks of death and preoperative stroke in patients undergoing endarterectomy outweigh the low risk of observing these specific patients and treating them with anticoagulants alone, such as aspirin, warfarin or clopidogrel.

It is important to note that both NASCET and ECST evaluated open endarterectomy but, since then, carotid stenting has become commonly used. Carotid stenting is comparable to endarterectomy, regarding treatment, and has similar low risks of death, stroke and myocardial infarction in patients with asymptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis.

Treatment of ocular ischemic syndrome involves reducing the oxygen drive to the eye to decrease the neovascularization. This involves panretinal photocoagulation or intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
