The pathology of the disease is still poorly understood. A comprehensive pathophysiological basis for the lung injury seen in these patients is yet to be established. Butt et al., in a recent study, described a wide spectrum of histopathological findings seen in EVALI,Â including acute fibrinous pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage, or organizing pneumonia, usually bronchiolocentric and accompanied by bronchiolitis.

Previously, studies had suggested that EVALI may represent a form of exogenous lipoid pneumonia.
