Complications can be a result of nerve damage itself or a consequence of gait aids and braces.

Nerve damage leading to foot drop impairs the ability to clear the ground resulting in a fall. Gait aids as walkers and canes can also be an impediment, especially on uneven surfaces. Anesthetic skin can be a source of ulceration. Abrasions can be a result of poor fitting braces.  Bracing may need to be variable depending upon bulk change. In cases such as renal failure and congestive heart failure, different braces for different phases of edema and swelling may need to be provided.
