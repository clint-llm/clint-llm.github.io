Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a devastating complication of the measles virus. Although it is a rare complication and the measles virus is preventable with vaccination, healthcare systems may see more cases given the re-emergence of measles in many countries in the last few years. High mortality rates are associated with SSPE, and there is no known cure at this time. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
