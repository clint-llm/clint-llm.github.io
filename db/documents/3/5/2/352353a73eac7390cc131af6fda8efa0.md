Burning mouth syndrome is much more common in females than males, with 3 to 7 times higher occurrence in females. It has a strong association with advancing age in both sexes. The highest prevalence in females occurs in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods. The condition is essentially non-existent in children and rarely seen in those under 30. Occurrence in males is rare before the fifth decade. Overall, the prevalence of burning mouth syndrome is not well documented but is thought to be around 4%.
