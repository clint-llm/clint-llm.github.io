Contraindications to facial gender affirmation surgery are similar to those that would prevent any other type of major facial surgery: cardiopulmonary disease, bleeding diatheses, malnutrition, history of poor wound healing or anesthetic complications, or other major comorbidities. Additionally, psychological instability, which could manifest as anything from a history of consistent dissatisfaction with plastic surgical outcomes to body dysmorphic disorder to suicidal ideation, should likely prevent proceeding with surgery.

Hormone therapy is a consideration as well: insufficient duration of therapy should result in a delay in order to allow the effects of the hormones to manifest themselves prior to surgery, and estrogens should ideally be held for two weeks preoperatively in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism. Lastly, smoking is a relative contraindication as well. Patients who smoke are at a higher risk for wound healing problems, and when smoking is combined with estrogen therapy, the risk of venous thromboembolism is greatly increased.
