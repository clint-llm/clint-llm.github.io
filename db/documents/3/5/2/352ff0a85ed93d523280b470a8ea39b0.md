Hypospadias is one of the most common urogenital anomalies in newborn males. It is defined as the combination of the displacement of the urethral opening on the ventral side of the penis, an abnormal ventral curvature of the penis, called "chordee," and an abnormal distribution of the foreskin with a "hood" present dorsally and deficient foreskin ventrally. Hypospadias can cause problems in voiding, and in adults, it can cause sexual problems and infertility. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hypospadias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypospadias.
- Review the clinical features of hypospadias.
- Outline the management strategies and timing of surgery for hypospadias.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with hypospadias.
