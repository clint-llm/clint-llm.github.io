Current literature shows promise for BTMs to serve as useful clinical tools in the management of osteoporosis; however, several limitations persist that prevent the incorporation of BTMs into the clinical management of this condition. Extensive research has concluded that these markers are suitable for confirming adequate therapeutic response to anti-osteoporotic drugs, which is of particular use in the first lines oral bisphosphonate agents due to patient compliance falling off to less than 50% by one year into treatment due to the high maintenance regimen this medication entails and the relatively clinically silent nature of the osteoporotic disease.

Patients showing insufficient response to treatment that have been confirmed to treatment adherence, BTMs resistant to change may help identify patients with issues absorbing medications appropriately or those with underlying pathologies further contributing to bone turnover derangements.
