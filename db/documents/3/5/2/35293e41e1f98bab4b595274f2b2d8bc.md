The definite etiology of EHS has not been determined, but researchers have hypothesized the following causes:

- A delayed decrease of reticular formation activity during the transition between wakefulness and sleep, resulting in a brief increase of activity in sensory neurons.

- Complex partial seizures within the temporal lobe.

- Ear Pathology
- Eustachian tube dysfunction
- Perilymph fistulasÂ 
- Rupture of the round window membrane
- Temporary disinhibition of cochlea or its central connections in the temporal lobe
- Abrupt involuntary movement of the tympanum or tensor tympani

- Aberrant attentional processing during the sleep-wake transition resulting in an altered perception of external auditory or visual stimuli.

- Aura preceding a migraine.

- Side effects due to sudden withdrawal from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or benzodiazepines.

- A gene mutation resulting in transient calcium channel dysfunction.
