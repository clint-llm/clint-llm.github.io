Edema formation occurs into two fundamental steps. Firstly, an alteration in capillary hemodynamics favoring the movement of fluids from the vascular space into the interstitium. Additionally, retention of dietary or intravenously administered sodium and water via the kidneys can cause edema. Initially, fluid moves from the vascular space into the interstitium, and consequently reduces plasma volume and reduces tissue perfusion. To respond to these changes the kidney retains sodium and water. There is someÂ fluid that stays in the vascular space, and plasma volume returns towards normal. However, this change in capillary hemodynamic leads to retained fluid entering the interstitium and results in edema.

Edema can also form as a response to elevated capillary hydraulic pressures or increased capillary permeability, disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx, decreased interstitial compliance, lower plasma oncotic pressure, or a combination of these factors. Lymphatic obstruction can also lead to fluid buildup because, under normal conditions, filtered fluids do not return to the systemic circulation.
