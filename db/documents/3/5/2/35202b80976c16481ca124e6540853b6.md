Although the management of WCT is complex, given its broad differential and numerous etiologies, this article emphasizes a multidisciplinary team approach for ventricular arrhythmias because they are the most common cause of WCT. A multidisciplinary team will be required during both the in-patient and outpatient setting.

This team usually consists of emergency room physicians, cardiologists, cardiac electrophysiologists, ICU intensivists, clinical pharmacists, nurses, nutrition specialists, case managers, cardiac rehabilitation specialists, psychologists, and primary care physicians. It is beneficial to have multiple team members involved as it can optimize a patient’s care and improve their quality of life. Typically while the patient is in the hospital, their care is predominantly coordinated by the primary cardiologist in conjunction with a cardiac electrophysiologist who will decide on optimal treatment options taking into consideration the patient’s risk factors and comorbidities. Once these patients are discharged home from either the hospital or rehabilitation centers, they will still require a multidisciplinary approach to facilitate their care.

In the outpatient setting, the patient’s care is usually managed by both their primary care doctor and cardiologist. Those patients who are treated with implantable devices or defibrillators may encounter repetitive shocks if they have recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. In return, being repeatedly shocked can reduce a patient’s quality of life by inducing significant anxiety. It is important to keep in mind that these patients should also have some form of psychological support upon discharge into the community.
