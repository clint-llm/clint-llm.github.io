To remain viable, the spinal cord requires the perfusion of its tissues with blood. When the pia mater is violated, or a patient acquires an infection in the bloodstream, the pathogen may penetrate the blood-cord barrier. As a part of the central nervous system, the blood-cord barrier is functionally equivalent to the blood-brain barrier, leaving a certain segment of the population - especially those who are immunocompromised or intravenous drug users - at risk of developing an infection of the spinal cord due to mechanisms similar to those that may cause a brain abscess.

Abscesses can be either primary (source of infection not identifiable) or secondary (the source is identifiable).

The pathogenesis postulated for ISCA include:

- Hematogenous dissemination and bacterial embolism from an extraspinal infection.

- Contiguous extension.

- Direct implantation (penetrating trauma, neurosurgical procedures-lumbar puncture, and intrathecal morphine pump).****

- Cryptogenic.

The watershed zone makes the dorsal cord and thoracic spine more prone to ISCA.

The fulminant neurological sequelae observed in ISCA are secondary to the mechanical-vascular insult of the spinal cord by the abscess and its resultant edema superimposed by the relatively compromised vascularity of the spinal cord.

Risk variables for the development of ISCA described in the literature include:

- Spinal dysraphism and CDS.

- Epidermoid cyst.

- Vertebral osteomyelitis discitis spondylodiscitis and epidural abscesses.

- Infective Endocarditis.

- Spinal infarction due to spinal artery embolism by bacterial embolism.

- Spinal artery occlusion.

- Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) leads to chronic venous congestion disrupting the bloodâ€“spinal cord barrier.

- Right to left cardiac shunts such as Patent foramen ovale and right superior vena cava (RSVC) drain into the left atrium.

- Penetrating injury.

- Intravenous drug users.

- Prior history of neurosurgical trauma or surgery.

- Immunocompromised state.

**In a modern-era review of ISCA**

- 44% of ISCA was associated with anatomical abnormalities

- 24% of ISCA was from the contiguous spread

- 8% of ISCA was secondary to hematogenous dissemination and

- 64% of them were cryptogenic.
