Patients should receive advice regarding relative rest following a medial epicondyle corticosteroid injection. Patients should understand the possibility of a steroid flare that can acutely worsen the pain; this is treatable with ice, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs.

Following an injection, patients should continue with activity modifications and other therapies until the pain subsides.  A session on proper mechanics should take place before returning to work or sports. A slow functional progression of sport-specific exercises is required for a successful return to play.  Typically, activity modifications and treatment are necessary for a total period of 6 to 12-weeks.
