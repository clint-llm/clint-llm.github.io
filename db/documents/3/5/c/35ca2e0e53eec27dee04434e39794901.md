The radionuclide ventriculography (RNV) scan is a non-invasive way of assessing ventricular function and intracardiac hemodynamics. The less inter-observer variability of the RNV scan makes it a preferred method for serial monitoring of ventricular function.

The RNV scan is possible via three different approaches, including first-pass radionuclide ventriculography, equilibrium blood pool ventriculography, and gated single-photon emission computed tomography (Gated SPECT).
