Initial treatment of EPS begins with considering peritoneal dialysis cessation to halt further derangements to the peritoneal membrane. Not every patient can benefit from stopping peritoneal dialysis; thus, this decision must carefully weigh the benefits and risks, as hemodialysis would be what most patients transition to. Hemodialysis carries a different set of complications and risks when compared to peritoneal dialysis, in addition to lifestyle changes. It is also worth noting that because many cases of EPS are diagnosed years after stopping peritoneal dialysis, there is the potential for symptoms to worsen even after discontinuing.

Regardless, if the decision to cease peritoneal dialysis is made, the standard of care would be switching from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis and removing the peritoneal dialysis catheter. To decrease the risk of abdominal adhesions, the peritoneum should be flushed twice a week with 100 to 200 mL of 1.36% dialysate with 3500 international units of heparin. Bowel rest should occur for four to twelve weeks, depending on the severity of symptoms present.

Medical management of EPS includes the use of corticosteroids and/or tamoxifen. Steroids act by decreasing inflammation and the development of fibrin deposition. In treating the early stages of EPS, steroids have been proven an effective medication. Still, the effect tends to decrease in the later stages when fibrosis is significant, and bowel obstruction occurs. For these earlier stages, prednisolone dosing is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day or a pulse dose of 500 to 1000 mg of methylprednisolone for two to three days.

Treatment should be continued for at least one year with a steroid taper. If using prednisolone, the taper should be 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg daily for month one, 0.25 to 0.5 mg at 2 to 3 months, and then 10 mg at six months. CRP should be monitored, and a dramatic rise should raise the suspicion of inflammation due to bacterial peritonitis or intestinal obstruction. Tamoxifen can be an alternative treatment and may be considered the first choice considering the well-documented side effects of steroids. Despite this, tamoxifen is typically given in combination with steroids. Tamoxifen is offered in 10 to 40 mg/day doses for at least two to six months.

Surgical interventions become the treatment choice when patients are at risk of obstruction due to fibrotic adhesions. A peritonectomy involves the lysis of adhesions and total ablation of sclerotic tissue in the abdomen. Surgery should only be considered in chronic patients that fail medical and conservative management and in patients with acute symptoms of bowel obstruction. Risk of surgery includes perforation of intestines, sepsis, bleeding, fistula formation, and death. There is also a risk of recurrence of adhesions and symptoms. Despite this, suturing intestine to intestine to prevent recurrence has been proposed, and considering medical management with steroids or tamoxifen might decrease risk.

Nutrition and hydration should be optimized in patients with EPS. Patients who elect to treat with surgery are at high risk of refeeding syndrome, so aggressive nutritional support should be a vital aspect of the management plan for these patients in the pre & post-operative period. In research conducted in the UK, patients who underwent surgery had reportedly improved surgical outcomes when total parental nutrition was used in preoperative management care. It is important to note that TPN is not the mainstay treatment for all patients, as chronic EPS patients can benefit from close monitoring and increased oral intake.
