Laser procedures should be performed with great caution as the majority of laser procedures are performed for cosmetic purposes, which raises the stakes somewhat because of high patient expectations for optimal results. Surgeons should be selective in their choice of candidates for laser therapy and should not perform elective procedures on patients who are excessively tan. Darker-skinned patients are at increased risk of dyspigmentation and should be counseled on this risk. Nd:YAG lasers have been shown to have the lowest risk of dyspigmentation for dark-skinned patients but should only be used in the hands of experienced laser operators.

Strict sun avoidance for two weeks before treatment can reduce the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation typically resolves over several months but can be treated with strict sun avoidance, superficial chemical peels, and hydroquinone. Hypopigmentation may resolve with time and can be covered with makeup, or melanin production may be stimulated with fractionated CO2 laser or narrow-band ultraviolet light treatments.

Physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners often operate medical lasers. There is an inherent risk of complications for laser procedures; however, a team approach that emphasizes patient education and coordination of care will result in the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
