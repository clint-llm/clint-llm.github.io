Laboratory measurement of CD4 count through flow cytometry is reported as CD4 percentages. The absolute CD4 count is obtained by multiplying this percentage with the total measured white blood cell (WBC) count. The absolute CD4 count usually corresponds to the CD4 percentages. A CD4 percentage of greater than 29% corresponds to an absolute count of more than 500 cells/microliters, 14% to 28% corresponds to an absolute count between 200 and 500 cells/microliters, and less than 14% corresponds to an absolute count of fewer than 200 cells/microliters. It is, however, important to note that an increase in WBC will cause an increase in the absolute CD4 count while the CD4 percentage remains the same. CD4 count measurements may also have inter-assay or inter-laboratory variability.
