Seizures are thought to arise secondary to an imbalance between excitation and inhibition of neurons. Imbalance of excitation and inhibition can be the result of alteration in genes or from acquired etiologies. Genetic pathologies can produce dysfunction at the circuit level (e.g., abnormal synaptic connectivity) to the receptor level (imbalance between excitatory glutamate and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] receptors) to ionic channel level(example, sodium channel dysfunction in Dravet syndrome). Both monogenic and polygenic mutations can lead to epilepsy, and most adult-onset epilepsies have a complex genetic basis with multiple gene defects playing parts to develop excessive excitability, or diminished inhibition, or both.
