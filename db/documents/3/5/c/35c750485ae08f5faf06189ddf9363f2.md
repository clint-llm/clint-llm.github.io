Polydactyly occurs once in every 700 to 1000 live births, making it a relatively common anatomical variant. There are a variety of types of polydactyly, and they can broadly categorize as syndromic or non-syndromic. Subtypes of polydactyly exist based upon the point of origination of the extra digit. Though the identities of the exact genetic links are still a work in progress, patients who present with polydactyly should have a careful workup to rule out underlying conditions.

Small joint osteoarthritis characteristically demonstrates Heberden and Bouchard nodes of the DIP and PIP, respectively. These nodes represent the cutaneous manifestations of joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation resulting from osteoarthritis. Research shows a positive correlation between the appearance of these nodes and underlying osteoarthritis.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is another form of arthritis that often presents with prominent hand manifestations. Swan neck and boutonniere deformities are classically described, in addition to the ulnar deviation of the digits. The swan neck deformity is characterized by DIP flexion with PIP extension, while the inverse is true of the boutonniere deformity.  Nowadays, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been able to reduce the severity of hand disease seen in RA, but early intervention should be started to prevent disability and progressive joint erosion seen in the natural course of the disease.
