Pediatric patients below 13 to 14 years of age presenting with defective vision and having underlying refractive error should be subjected to cycloplegic refraction.

Patients in the age group of 14 to 35 years should be evaluated with tropicamide refraction. After cycloplegic or tropicamide refraction, the final contact lens or glass prescription should be given. All ophthalmologists and optometrists must know the indications and importance of cycloplegic and non-cycloplegic refraction to avoid the progression of refractive error.

The optometrists play a crucial role in explaining and performing non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refraction. Ophthalmologists play a vital role in treatment, counseling, and explaining the prognosis to the patients.
