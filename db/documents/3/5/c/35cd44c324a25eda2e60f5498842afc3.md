The vast majority of newborns with retinopathy of prematurity have a mild form of the disease (stages 1 and 2), and their condition improves without any treatment.  Careful monitoring and delivery of oxygen therapy have reduced oxygen toxicity.  About 8 to 10% of newborns with ROP require medical intervention such as laser therapy or cryotherapy. ****

Lifestyle modifications are usually the first tier of preventative treatment for most of the retinopathies described above.  These modifications could include weight loss, dietary changes such as portion control, aerobic exercise (e.g., greater than 130 steps per min), smoking cessation, reduction/elimination of alcohol and maintaining normal lipoprotein-cholesterol levels.   For hypertensive retinopathy, excellent, cost-effective hypertensive medications are readily available.  For diabetic retinopathy, glycemic control is a crucial factor.
