Fuchs uveitis syndrome shares similar clinical features with other inflammatory processes, such as Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS). Both diagnoses are made clinically, with PSS having the characteristics of mild, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis with recurrent attacks of increasing intraocular pressure. Patients with PSS may experience unilateral mild eye discomfort, pain, or blurred vision but can be asymptomatic. Epithelial corneal edema and small keratic precipitates will be seen.

Both FUS and PSS share the unique features of an atrophied iris and heterochromia. In between attacks, the patients will have open angles with normal IOP. PSS responds well to steroids, with most cases only resulting in surgery if refractory glaucoma develops. FUS can be differentiated from PSS through history, physical examination, and a trial of steroid medication.

Herpes keratouveitis (HKU) may be considered in the differential diagnosis. Patients with HKU have the clinical features of iridocyclitis, like those of FUS; however, the patients will have stromal edema along with pigmented keratic precipitates and endotheliitis. Other eye findings of posterior synechiae, sphincter damage, and sectoral iris atrophy can also be seen. HKU can be differentiated from FUS by the typical herpetic lesions and diagnostic tests. Viral culture and a viral antigen test can detect the presence of HSV-1 or HSV-2 in ocular fluids.

Alternative differential diagnoses that are common etiologies of chronic uveitis, such as a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), should also be considered. These infectious etiologies usually have reduced corneal sensitivity and skin manifestations that help differentiate them from FUS.

FUS may be distinguished from the various causes of increased IOP. A common cause of increased IOP would be acute angle-closure glaucoma, which would have the unique characteristics of a fixed and dilated pupil paired with severe pain, nausea, and vomiting, all of which would be absent in a patient with FUS.
