The majority of symptoms are nonspecific, which can include but not limited to generalized weakness, fatigue, poor concentration, irritability, headaches, shortness of breath on exertion, and decreased exercise capacity. These are attributable to low oxygen delivery to tissues and reduced activity of iron-containing enzymes.

Pica occurs in approximately half of these patients, and pagophagia (craving for ice) is quite specific for iron deficiency.

Beeturia is a finding which is not specific for iron deficiency but is more common in these individuals. It is the result of a change in gastrointestinal function due to severe iron deficiency. The urine turns red following the ingestion of beets.

The physical examination can be normal or may reveal dry skin, hair loss, atrophic glossitis, cheilosis, pallor, brittle nails, and koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails). Cardiac auscultation may reveal a systolic murmur.
