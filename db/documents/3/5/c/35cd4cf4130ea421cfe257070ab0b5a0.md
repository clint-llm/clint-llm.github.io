The clinical course of Coats disease is progressive. Acute exacerbations of the disease infrequently occur, followed by a quiescent state. Spontaneous remissions are rare. In untreated eyes, secondary complications can develop, including:

- Orbital cellulitis (which may simulate retinoblastoma)

- Neovascularization

- Vitreous hemorrhage

- Cataract

- Rubeosis iridis

- Neovascular glaucoma

- Phthisis bulbi
