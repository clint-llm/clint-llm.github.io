For patients that need general anesthesia or sedation for ABR testing, parents should be educated on the risk of neurotoxicity on the developing brain. Studies have shown that only a few hours of anesthesia exposure can result in neuronal loss in young animals, with adverse effects persisting in later life.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings that general anesthesia and sedation should be minimized for children under 3 years old and limited to 3 cumulative hours.
