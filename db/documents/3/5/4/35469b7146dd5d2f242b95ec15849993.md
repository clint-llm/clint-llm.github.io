Sexually transmitted infections are the first to consider in the differential diagnosis of LGV.

The exclusion of diseases which cause genital ulceration and inguinal adenopathy including herpes simplex, syphilis, chancroid, herpes, and granuloma inguinale will help narrow the diagnosis.

HIV and lymphoma can also cause generalized lymphadenopathy.

Dermatological conditions and trauma which can cause genital ulcerations should also be in the differential diagnosis.
