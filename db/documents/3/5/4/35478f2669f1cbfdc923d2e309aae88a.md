Often times, it is difficult to diagnose lymphocytic hypophysitis as patients can present with no symptoms or with vague symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, nausea. It is important to know that usually, the first symptom is headache followed by other endocrine-related symptoms due to anterior and posterior pituitary hormone deficiencies and visual field defects.

Gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the pituitary is the imagining of choice and there are very fine differences in imaging that help radiologists discern between pituitary adenoma and lymphocytic hypophysitis.

An interprofessional team approach is required for the correct management of lymphocytic hypophysitis andÂ often involves teamwork with primary care physicians, neurosurgeons, radiologists, ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, pharmacists, and nurses.
