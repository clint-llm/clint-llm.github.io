If the surgeon prepares the DSEK graft, it may be obtained manually or by using a microkeratome and special techniques (DSAEK/UT-DSAEK), which produce smoother, thinner grafts with better outcomes.

If patients are concurrently suffering from lens opacities, cataract extraction, and intraocular lens insertion may be combined with the DSEK or DMEK as a single-stage "triple procedure" without increasing complication risk.
