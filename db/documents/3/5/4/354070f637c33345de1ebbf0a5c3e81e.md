A number of factors increase diathesis of serious suicide attempts and completed suicides, including, but not limited to, the following:

- Medications

- Mental illness

- Sex

- Genetics

- Availability of firearms

- Life experiences

- Physical illness

- Economic instability and status

- Media and the Internet

- Psychodynamic formulation

An understanding of the causes of suicidal behavior will not only clarify the roots of the patient’s self-destructive path but also help the clinician to determine the appropriate treatment for the patient. Once the patient is safe, then the underlying dynamics can be addressed.
