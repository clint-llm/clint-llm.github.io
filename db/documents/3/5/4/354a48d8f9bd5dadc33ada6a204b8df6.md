**Antenatal Evaluation**

Antenatal ultrasonography with a four-chamber view is the commonly used diagnostic test for the atrioventricular septal defect. The most common findings include a common atrioventricular valve and a defect in the atrial or ventricular septum. However, the sensitivity of antenatal ultrasound for the atrioventricular septal defect is very low.

**Postnatal Evaluation**

Chest Radiograph: It demonstrates cardiomegaly and pulmonary plethora, especially in those cases with associated atrioventricular valve regurgitation.

Electrocardiogram: The characteristic electrocardiographic findings include a superior axis in the frontal plan, right ventricular hypertrophy, and atrioventricular block. Other findings may include superior p wave axis and partial right bundle branch block.

Echocardiogram: Echocardiographic findings include:

- Abnormal configuration of atrioventricular valve

- Loss of normal offset of atrioventricular valve

- Abnormal position of papillary muscles

- Disproportion in left ventricular inlet and outlet

- Ostium primum atrial septal defect

- Ventricular septal defect of inlet type

- And other associated cardiac malformations.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging reveals findings similar to an echocardiogram. It is more accurate in measuring the size of defects and regurgitation fraction through the atrioventricular valve.
