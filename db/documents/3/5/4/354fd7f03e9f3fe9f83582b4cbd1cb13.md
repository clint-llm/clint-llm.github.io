Care should be taken to clean the area around the ear laceration as well as possible prior to initiating the repair. Sterile saline should be used to irrigate the wound with 50 to 100 mL of solution per centimeter of the wound. Anesthetizing the ear with a regional auricular block may provide the patient with greater comfort prior to irrigation, as well as avoiding tissue distortion of the laceration edges. After the wound has been cleaned, a sterile drape should be applied to isolate the field. If necessary, the physician may need to debride or excise macerated or devitalized tissue to create clean wound margins that will hold a suture before attempting the repair.
