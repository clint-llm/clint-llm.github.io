Neonatal sepsis refers to an infection involving bloodstream in newborn infants less than 28 days old. It continues to remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among infants, especially in middle and lower-income countries. It is divided into early-onset sepsis (EOS) or late-onset sepsis (LOS) based on the age of presentation after birth with different experts using 72 hours or 7 days as the cutoff. This activity describes the treatment and evaluation of neonatal sepsis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of early and late onset neonatal sepsis.
- Describe various clinical and laboratory findings associated with neonatal sepsis
- Review the various treatment and management options available for neonatal sepsis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for neonates affected by sepsis.
