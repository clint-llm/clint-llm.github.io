Oxazepam is a commonly prescribed benzodiazepine and can potentially be subject to misuse. Managing patients on oxazepam requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, and different specialty physicians. The healthcare team must vigilantly monitor patients on oxazepam by observing any changes in hemodynamic stability (respiratory compromise) or patient demeanor (e.g., stupor, somnolence, or altered mental status). Careful consideration of adverse effects and signs of toxicity by the interprofessional team is necessary to ensure effective treatment and care for patients who exhibit signs of oxazepam use toxicity. Nursing should be well-versed in recognizing toxicity to promptly report any signs to the prescriber or consult with the pharmacist. Additionally, prescribers and pharmacists collaborate in improving patient safety outcomes through the CURES report and could help decrease the likelihood of drug-drug interaction by prescribing oxazepam to a patient receiving an opioid therapy through another provider.

In summary, oxazepam therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (including mid-level practitioners such as NPs and PAs), specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across individual disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.
