Side effects for short-term use of cannabis include impaired short-term memory, which can affect learning, impaired motor coordination in activities such as driving, and an increase in high-risk sexual behaviors.

Children aged less than twelve are a separate concern. Their exposure typically occurs via unintentional consumption of edibles meaning the dosage of THC taken in is not considered. This has led to increased presentations to the emergency department, often for central nervous system depression such as lethargy and somnolence, and rarely for respiratory insufficiency.
