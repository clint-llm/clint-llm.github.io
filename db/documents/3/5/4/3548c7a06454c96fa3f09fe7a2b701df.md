The diagnosis of ASAS is usually suspected with a detailed history and the physical exam findings. Neuroimaging studies can help establish and confirm the diagnosis of ASAS.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine is the gold-standard study for the diagnosis of ASAS. Although results can be negative in the first 24 hours, it is usually done to confirm an ASAS diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance angiography may help for further delineation and visualization of spinal vascular pathology.

Other studies and tests are useful to find the underlying etiology of ASAS.
