The most common clinical presentation of POW virus infection is encephalitis or meningoencephalitis though seroprevalence studies suggest that most infections are sub-clinical. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 5 weeks and can result in a non-specific prodromal illness.

In those who present with severe disease that includes CNS symptoms, it is common to see prolonged fever, confusion, decreased level of consciousness, and seizures. Ocular symptoms can also be seen, such as ophthalmoplegia and nystagmus. Spastic and flaccid paralysis have also been associated with human POW virus infection, but these features are less frequent.
