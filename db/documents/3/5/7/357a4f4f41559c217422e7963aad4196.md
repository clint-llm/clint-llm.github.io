Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) was described by Kossarden in 1994. It is characterized by band-like cicatricial alopecia of the frontotemporal zone of the scalp. There may be signs of perifollicular inflammation at the edge of the hairy region. Alopecia of the eyebrows is frequently associated, and axillary, pubic, facial, and hairy lesions of the limbs could be involved. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of frontal fibrosing alopecia and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the histopathology of frontal fibrosing alopecia.
- Review the physical exam findings commonly seen in patients with frontal fibrosing alopecia.
- Summarize the treatment of frontal fibrosing alopecia.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by frontal fibrosing alopecia.
