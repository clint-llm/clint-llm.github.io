Altered pH can disrupt homeostatic digestion, resulting in dysregulation of gastric pH. In the clinical setting, this dysregulation is typically due to physiologic stress, leading to inflammation of the stomach, known as stress-induced gastritis. In the stressed state, elevate levels of ACH and histamine result in increased acid production, thus inducing gastritis.

Patients are typically found in the surgical unit of the hospital or the medical or surgical intensive care unit. These critically ill patients have typically undergone physiologic stress related to severe trauma, severe burns, ventilator dependency, on intracranial trauma.

Physiologic stress leading to stress gastritis results in gastric erosions, known as curling ulcers. Erosions secondary to cranial etiology are named Cushing ulcers after the famous neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing.

The first step in the development of stress-induced gastritis is decreased mucosa resistance from toxic radicals. The stress response of the body results in the decrease of gastric renewal, leading to atrophy of the gastric mucosa. Blood flow to the stomach decreases and makes the stomach more prone to acid-pepsin ulceration and hyperacid secretion.
