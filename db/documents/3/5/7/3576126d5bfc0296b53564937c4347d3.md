Amblyopia can be broken down into three main causes: deprivation, strabismus, and refractive. Deprivation amblyopia comes from any pathology that inhibits the visual pathway. This could be a cataract, corneal opacity, damage to the retina, or optic nerve pathology. It can even be caused by the absence of visual stimuli, such as covering one eye or living in complete darkness. Deprivation causes the most severe form of amblyopia. Strabismus is when both eyes do not align. The pediatric brain prevents diplopia by suppressing the visual input in one eye, leading to impaired visual development in that eye.

Typically the more profound the visual deprivation, the more severe the resultant amblyopia will be. The critical period for visual development is roughly the first seven years of life, with the first few years and even months being the most critical.
