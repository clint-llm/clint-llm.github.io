The olecranon bursa is synovial membrane located immediately posterior to the olecranon bone of the elbow. The bursa's function is to allow the bony olecranon to glide smoothly across the overlying tissues with flexion and extension of the elbow. Olecranon bursitis refers to inflammation of the bursa. The superficial location and limited vascularity make the bursa susceptible to trauma and infection. The diagnosis of olecranon bursitis is often made by clinical evaluation alone without the aid of objective diagnostic testing. However, diagnostic tests become very important when considering the risk of alternative diagnoses or the presence of infection.
