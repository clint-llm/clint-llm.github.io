Positive serological markers are considered essential in the diagnostic criteria for undifferentiated connective tissue disease, so the laboratory measures are beneficial in diagnosis, especially anti-Ro/SSA and anti-U1-RNP. Other tests helpful in diagnosis include routine screening tests, which include: complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum creatinine, urinalysis with microscopic analysis, rheumatoid factor (RF), and antinuclear antibodies (ANA).

Additional laboratory tests can be used in some cases, which include: complement components (c3, c4, ch50), creatine kinase, aldolase, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), anti-La/SSB, thyroid-stimulating hormone, anti-jo1, anti-smith, anti-mi2, anti-cardiolipins, lupus anticoagulant, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1, Anti-Ku, rapid plasma reagin (RPR), anti-scl70 (topoisomerase antibody), anti-chromatin, anti-histone and vitamin D (25[OH]D3).

Regarding imaging studies, chest radiography can be normal or may display signs of pleural or pericardial effusion, longstanding pulmonary hypertension, cardiomegaly, or interstitial lung disease. Computed tomography of the chest may be needed in the assessment of interstitial lung disease. Additionally, ultrasonography of the salivary glands was found to be a good test in differentiating between undifferentiated connective tissue disease and Sjögren syndrome.

Other tests can be helpful: Pulmonary function tests, including lung volumes, spirometry, and carbon monoxide-diffusing capacity, assist in diagnosing interstitial lung disease. When patients have cardiac symptoms, electrocardiography can be helpful in the detection of ischemic changes, chamber enlargement, or axis deviation. The Schirmer test can also be used in patients with dry eyes due to high sensitivity but can be nonspecific in patients who take anticholinergic medications.
