Primary CNS tumors are the second most common tumor in children and adolescents after leukemia.

Using the data available for CNS tumors diagnosed in the United States in the years 2012-2016, and excluding medulloblastoma, the incidence of PNET is 0.15 per 100,000 children age 0 to 4, 0.05 per 100,000 children age 5 to 9, 0.04 per 100,000 children age 10 to 14, and 0.03 per 100,000 adolescents age 15 to 19 years.

The incidence of ATRT is 0.32 per 100,000 children ages 0 and 4 and 0.03 per 100,000 children ages 5 to 9 years. Very few cases are diagnosed after nine years of age. The 10-year survival estimates for ATRT is 37%.

The high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with BCOR alteration is an extremely rare tumor, with only 24 cases reported. The four-year survival is 50%.

A study investigating previously histological supratentorial PNET, which reanalyzed them using molecular parameters, found that the diagnosis changed in 71%.
