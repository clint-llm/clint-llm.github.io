Patients with diabetes have an improvement in the quality of treatment and prognosis with proper education and training of prehospital providers. This training depends on the specific level of education of the prehospital providers (EMT, Advanced EMT, Paramedic, etc.). There are also state variations on the scope of practice, and within the United States of America, prehospital agencies have to have a CLIA waiver to perform blood glucose monitoring. Type 1 diabetic patients who have received previous education and who had symptomatic hypoglycemia at the scene were safe to treat with the potential of release at the scene after the patient was no longer symptomatic.
