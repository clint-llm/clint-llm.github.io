The prevalence of the disease is more in those disciplines where the intensity of exposure is high. A study conducted in Okayama, Japan, among construction workers revealed that workers working in the installation of the asbestos board have the highest number of cases (39.1%), followed by sprayer of asbestosis (38.5%). And also longer the duration of exposure, the more the chances of asbestosis.

The latent period for benign disease is shorter than other pulmonary complications. The incidence of pleural effusion is associated with the site of exposure and was found to be 9 cases per 1000 in heavily exposed groups. Although mesothelioma is less prevalent than lung cancer, over 2000 cases per yr in the twenty-first century were reported in the united states of America. The incidence of lung cancer is comparatively more than mesothelioma. The use of asbestos in developed countries has been reduced but use in developing countries like Nepal, Pakistan is considerably high.
