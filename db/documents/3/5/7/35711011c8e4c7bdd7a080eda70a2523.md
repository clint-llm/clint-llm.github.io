The pathophysiology of O. tsutsugamushi consists of vasculitis as a result of infection of endothelial cells and subsequently perivascular infiltration of T cells and monocytes/macrophages. This is followed by a wide range of inflammatory responses resulting in the endothelial and non-endothelial cells producing several cytokines which can be both beneficial (i.e., anti-microbial) and also cause tissue destruction to the infected host. This nature of the immune response can result in severe complications like hepatitis, renal failure, meningoencephalitis, and respiratory failure in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sometimes myocarditis.
