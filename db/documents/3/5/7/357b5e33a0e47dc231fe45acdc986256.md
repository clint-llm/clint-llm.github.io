A small incision is made on the left side at about the level of the second or third rib. A pocket is created under the skin, and the device is inserted in that pocket, and then the incision is closed. The device is usually implanted by an electrophysiologist as an outpatient procedure using local anesthesia. Conscious sedation can be used but is generally not required. Once implanted, the device is activated by passing a magnet over it.
