The global aim in the management of infants with BPD is to support them while lung growth occurs, limit further injury to the lungs, optimize lung function and detect complications associated with BPD. The various measures employed in the care of these infants are-

- Nutrition: Infants with BPD need an increased amount of energy to promote lung growth and repair. Their nutritional need maybe up to 140 to 150 Kcal/Kg/day and protein intake from 3.5 to 4 g/kg/day.

- Fluid restriction: Based on the severity of their lung disease, infants are restricted to a total fluid volume of 120 to 150 ml/kg/day. Restriction of fluid intake allows for improved pulmonary function by preventing pulmonary edema and improving gas exchange. Although frequently followed, there is insufficient data to support this practice.

- Minimize ventilator-associated lung injury: Non-invasive ventilation is the preferred mode of ventilation wherever feasible. If mechanical ventilation is necessary, care should be taken to limit barotrauma and volutrauma. Early extubation has been shown to lower the rates of BPD.

- Minimize oxygen associated injury: Exposure to hyperoxia is one of the most critical factors in the pathogenesis of BPD. There is significant controversy regarding SpO target ranges. One approach attempts to target SpO of 88-94% with a lower alarm limit of 88% and a higher alarm limit of 96%.

- Pharmacological interventions:

- Corticosteroids: Systemic corticosteroids have been used in BPD to improve lung function, reduce inflammation and reduce the need for mechanical ventilation. However, concerns about long term neurodevelopmental outcomes have led to recommendations to restrict their use to infants with severe BPD who remain ventilator dependent with high oxygen needs.

- Diuretics: Thiazides and loop diuretics are the most commonly used diuretics in the setting to improve short term pulmonary mechanics of BPD. These agents are most commonly used in infants who are ventilator dependent with increasing requirement of positive end-expiratory pressure despite fluid restriction. A systemic review of available literature does not show any improvement in long term clinical outcome in infants with established or developing BPD.

- Bronchodilators:- administration of beta-2 agonists can decrease airway resistance and improve compliance. However, their routine use is not recommended in BPD as it has not been shown to improve long term outcomes. Their use should be restricted to manage acute episodes of bronchoconstriction in older infants who remain ventilator dependent.
