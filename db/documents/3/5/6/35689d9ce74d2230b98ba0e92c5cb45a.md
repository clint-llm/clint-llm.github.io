- EBVMCU is a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder with a wide variety of appearances that may resemble DLBCL and/or cHL.

- Atypical lymphoid infiltrates of the skin and mucosal surfaces should undergo evaluation for EBV.

- If the lymphoid infiltrate is EBV-positive, EBVMCU should be considered.

- Diagnosis relies on clinical history and exclusion of systemic involvement.
