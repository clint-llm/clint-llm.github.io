Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) remains the mainstay of treatment worldwide. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a 1-day or 12-day course of DEC (6 mg/kg/day). Those belonging to onchocerciasis or loiasis co-endemic areas must not be prescribed DEC as it can result in a fatal adverse reaction. Filaricidal action of DEC induces an immunological reaction similar to the Mazzotti reaction seen in onchocerciasis, characterized by headache, joint pain, dizziness, anorexia, malaise, and urticaria. Doxycycline and ivermectin or albendazole is the recommended combination in these individuals. Individuals with chronic disease such as elephantiasis or hydrocele will not benefit from pharmacologic therapy. Surgical treatment may be necessary for those with hydrocele. Patients with lymphedema should be managed by a lymphedema therapist emphasizing the role of basic principles of care such as hygiene, elevation, exercises, skin, and wound care, and wearing appropriate shoes. Steroids, although not widely used, can help in reducing the extent of lymphedema seen in these patients. There is limited evidence for the role of doxycycline as some studies advocate the use of doxycycline (200mg/day for 4 to 6 weeks) in adult worm killing and preventing the progression of lymphedema. Suramin is widely used in onchocerciasis, yet its role remains uncertain in lymphatic filariasis.
