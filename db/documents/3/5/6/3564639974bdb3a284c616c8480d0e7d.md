Achieving the correct diagnosis in these patients is vitally important and can help avoid unnecessary surgery.  It is important to take a detailed history and physical exam and be vigilant when evaluating for possible appendicitis and confirm on diagnostic imaging whether or not the appendix is well visualized and if it appears abnormal.  An incorrect diagnosis can lead to unnecessary invasive interventions to the patients with subsequent morbidities.
