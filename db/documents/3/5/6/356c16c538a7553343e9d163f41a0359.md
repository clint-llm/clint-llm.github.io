The vasculature of the body is an essential network for maintaining healthy skin tissue. Skin changes, including blanching, ecchymosis, and edema, are a result of changes in vascularity. The face is a highly vascularized region of the body with constant exposure to the harsh environment. One of the most dominant features on the face is the lips, which serve many functions for daily living. The lips are composed of skin, a network of vessels, and muscles. The functionality of the lips relies on the simultaneous action of many muscles to carry out each movement. The movements of these muscles can only function with proper nerve impulses and good blood supply.

The lips receive most of their blood supply from the labial arteries. Due to the various branches, the labial arteries can efficiently provide blood to the lips. Aside from providing blood to the lips for proper function, the blood flow also contributes to the color in the lips. Adequate blood supply is required to maintain appropriate functioning, including breathing, eating, and facial expression.
