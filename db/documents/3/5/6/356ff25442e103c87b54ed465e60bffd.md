Staphylococcus epidermidis can manifest in many ways once inside the human host, including localized and systemic infections. Below are some of the most common diseases.

**Intravascular Catheter Infections**

Staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphs are one of the leading causes of catheter-related bloodstream infection. The infection largely occurs as the bacteria migrate from the patientâ€™s skin to the surface of the catheter, but they also can migrate via luminal surfaces.

**Infectious Endocarditis**

Staphylococcus epidermidis ranks as one of the most common species to cause infective endocarditis in both the prosthetic valve and the native valve. Up to 40% of cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) are due to coagulase-negative staph.

**Cardiac Devices, Prosthetic Joints, and CNS Shunt Infection**

Staphylococcus epidermidis can cause infections from implantation of medical devices such as cardiac devices, orthopedic devices, and CNS shunt. Up to 20% of patients with cardiac devices can become infected and can show signs of erythema, pain, purulence around the site of the infection, and sepsis.

Shunt infection may present without symptoms, but can also cause headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status.
