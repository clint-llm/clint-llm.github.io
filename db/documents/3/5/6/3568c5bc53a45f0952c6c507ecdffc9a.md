Despite the remarkable progress in treatment strategies for multiple myeloma, relapse and resistance to treatment remain significant challenges, often leading to a poor prognosis. Hence, patient-specific and disease-specific factors are extremely important in the risk stratification of MM patients to determine the prognosis and guide the best treatment strategy.

Factors determining MM patients' survival duration include tumor burden(stage), host factors, cytogenetic abnormalities, and response to treatment.

**Factors Associated With Poor Prognosis**

- Cytogenetic abnormalities: More than one cytogenetic abnormality, IgH translocations t(4:14), t(14:16), t(14:20), and genomic imbalances like deletion in 17p or gain in 1q.

- Tumor burden: R-ISS stage II/III, renal insufficiency, elevated LDH, presence of extramedullary disease, plasma cell leukemia, high serum beta-2-microglobulin.

- Response to treatment: Resistance or failure to first-line therapy, relapse occurring within 1 year of autologous stem cell transplantation or primary therapy.****

- Previous lines of therapies.

The median survival rate in relapsed MM patients improved from 12 months before 2000 to 24 months after the year 2000 with the availability of modern therapies like protease inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and auto-HCT.
