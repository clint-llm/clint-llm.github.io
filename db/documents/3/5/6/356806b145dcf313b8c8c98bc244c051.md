Infection with N.Â fowleri leads to amebic meningoencephalitis. Infection occurs when warm freshwater enters nasal passages and makes its way through the cribriform plate into the central nervous system. The incubation period can last anywhere from 1-14 days before symptoms of encephalitis manifest.
