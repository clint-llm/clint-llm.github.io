All patients should be under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. NETT did not require institutions to comply with uniform surgical approaches and included both median sternotomy (MS) or video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), and allowed buttressing material to try to prevent air leaks.

According to an updated review of NETT and long-term follow-up, there was no difference in 90-day mortality or intra-operative blood loss between MS or VATS.

Other endobronchial techniques remain investigative, and non-open surgical techniques such as placement of endobronchial valves can be performed with a bronchoscope to try to accomplish the same goals without a surgical incision.
