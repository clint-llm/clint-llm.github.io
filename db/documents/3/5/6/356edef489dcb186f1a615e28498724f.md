Famciclovir has many benefits in terms of ease and effectiveness in treating zoster infections. Therapy with famciclovir is best when under the direction of an interprofessional healthcare team. Famciclovir requires a prescription from a clinician. Famciclovir is a relatively safe antiviral treatment with rare adverse side effects. However, the prescribing clinician must monitor treatmentÂ with famciclovir to ensure that the patient does not experience any adverse effects. All primary care clinicians and dermatologists can prescribe famciclovir. To achieve the best results with the treatment, the patient must begin taking famciclovir treatment as soon as possible as the first signs of herpetic or varicella infections occur.

Regular follow-ups with patients taking famciclovir suggest that the treatment is working properly and that there are decreased signs of infection. A pharmacist should be involved to ensure that proper dosing of famciclovir is prescribed, and the patient fully understands the treatment regimen. If the patient has any questions regarding treatment, a nurse will be able to answer most questions. Any serious concerns will be discussed between the nurse, doctor, and patient to decide how to alter care. [Level 5]
