Various tests can diagnose syphilis.

The gold standard remains visualization of spirochetes on darkfield microscopy. More commonly, however, non-treponemal blood work for VRDL (venereal disease research laboratory) or RPR (rapid plasma reagin) is sent to rule in the disease, and then confirmatory testing assessing for FTA-ABS (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption), TPPA (Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay) or EIAs (syphilis enzyme immunoassays) is obtained.

A lumbar puncture can be useful in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis in a patient with an unknown syphilis history who is presenting with neurologic and ocular disease that could be consistent with the disease. Lumbar puncture is required in the evaluation of a patient with known syphilis presenting with these same symptoms. Furthermore, a lumbar puncture is suggested in all HIV patients with syphilis regardless of their presenting symptoms.

CSF findings indicative of neurosyphilis will show greater than 20 WBC/microL, and return positive for VRDL and intrathecal pallidum antibody index.
