The Duffy blood group system is a complex of highly immunogenic glycoprotein antigens found on the surface of red blood cells (RBC), vasculature endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, collecting tubules of the kidney, and on the surface of Purkinje cells in the brain. The Duffy blood group system is the first mapped blood group system on chromosome 1 using cytogenetic studies. Major antigens in Duffy blood group systems are Fya and Fyb, the product of FYA and FYB genes, respectively. Antibodies against the Duffy blood group antigens are implicated in transfusion reactions (TR) and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). THis activity covers the uffy blood group system and its association with many clinically significant activities through its DARC, including hematopoiesis, Malarial parasite, HIV interaction, Inflammatory process, cardiovascular diseases association, and organ transplantation.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the Duffy blood group system, DARC, and ACKR1 and its molecular genetics.
- Explain the antigens, antibodies, and phenotypes of the Duffy Blood group system.
- Review the functional role of the Duffy blood group system and DARC.
- Outline the clinical significance of the Duffy blood group system and DARC and its association with diseases.
