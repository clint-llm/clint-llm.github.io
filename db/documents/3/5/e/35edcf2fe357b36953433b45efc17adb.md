Overall, congential chest wall defects are rare.  As the most common defect, pectus excavatum can be appreciated on physical examination by health care providers at every level.  Pediatricians are well equipped to follow these patients, and determine the need for comprehensive cardiopulmonary assessment.  There is a misconception that pectus chest wall deformities are merely cosmetic defects, even in the absence of abnormal pulmonary function and cardiac testing. Asymptomatic patients or those with minor defects may not need any treatment, be offered physical therapy consultation, or can be considered for negative pressure therapy. Surgical (pediatric or cardiothoracic) consultation should be sought for all patients with a Haller Index of 2.5 or greater, as well as for patients with concomitant cardiac defects that need surgical repair or decreased pulmonary reserve.  Regardless of the Haller index measure, impaired cardiopulmonary function is an indication for surgical correction. Surgical correction of the funnel chest attributed to a pectus excavatum defect significant improves pulmonary function at rest and VO2 max in cases in which the Hallex index measures greater than 3.2.  Subjective improvements tracked my quality measurements have also been attributed to operative correction.
