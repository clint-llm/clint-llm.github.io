About a third of the cases of internuclear ophthalmoplegia are caused by infarctions and are commonly unilateral and seen in older individuals. Demyelinating disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS) account for another third of cases and are mostly bilateral and seen in young adults and adolescents. Some studies have shown that internuclear ophthalmoplegia is seen in about 23% of MS patients. Other causes of internuclear ophthalmoplegia include trauma, tentorial herniation, infections (like HIV, syphilis, cysticercosis, herpes zoster, tuberculoma), tumors (medulloblastoma, glioma, lymphoma, metastases), vasculitis (systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome), iatrogenic injury, and brainstem hemorrhage. The incidence of internuclear ophthalmoplegia in males and females is almost equal. Nearly half of all cases of internuclear ophthalmoplegia resolve within one year. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is extremely rare in the pediatric population. Tumors like medulloblastoma and pontine gliomas are important causes besides trauma, vasculitis, infarction, and hemorrhage.
