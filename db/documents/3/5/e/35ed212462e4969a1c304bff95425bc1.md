The history of a patient with suspected caustic ingestion must include five basic parameters in determining the appropriate treatment. Some articles on this subject have done the helpful work of organizing them into a helpful mnemonic known as the "5 W's" which will be summarized here. This aspect encompasses the rapid assessment of relevant history.

- Who: Patient demographics are key in this section. Determine the patient's age and weight, along with any accompanying family, friends, or witnesses

- What: Characteristics of medications and poisons ingested

- When: Time and date of ingestion

- Where: Route of poisoning in addition to geographic location to determine any environmental factors that may be confounding

- Why: The clinician must determine intentionality as this may greatly affect discharge disposition when the patient has been stabilized

Patients with caustic ingestions may present with oral and tongue edema, drooling, and vomiting. Some patients may have upper airway edema and present with voice changes, stridor, and respiratory distress. Hematemesis may be present if there has been erosion into a vessel. If the esophagus or stomach are perforated, mediastinitis and peritonitis, respectively, can occur.
