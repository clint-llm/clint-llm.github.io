Physiotherapy can be essential in helping those with Wallenberg syndrome regain their functional independence and reintegrate into their communities.

The primary goal of any post-stroke rehabilitation program should be to:

- Prevent complications

- Minimize impairments

- Maximize independence & function

Training is meant to be motivating, meaningful, engaging, and challenging. Instead of following a redundant mechanistic approach to rehabilitation, practitioners should use graded real-life activities that are purposeful and meaningful to every patient.

Physical therapy is used to combat balance, coordination, and movement deficits commonly associated with the disorder. Treatments should focus on task-oriented training, environmental adaptation, and motor retraining to improve functional ability. Furthermore, it has been found that electrical stimulation has a beneficial effect on improving muscle strength and balance in patients with stroke.
