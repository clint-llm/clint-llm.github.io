The pathogenesis of coxsackieviruses depends upon specific virus-receptor interactions. These interactions determine the location and the origin of the primary infection and also influence the viral spread to other organs during the post viremic stage. The coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and the decay-accelerating factor (DAF) are the notable receptor proteins that play an important role in the pathogenesis of Coxsackie B virus infections.

DAF is expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells. CAR is present in intercalated discs, which are structures that link the myocardial cells and relay signals between cells. Interactions with these receptors facilitate Coxsackie B virus entry into the myocardial cells, eventually leading to myocarditis.

CNS infections may occur by hematogenous spread or by axonal transport. Viral replication or activation of the autoimmune system can lead to injury of CNS tissues. While the exact mechanisms that cause cell injury and death remain unknown, viral inhibition of cellular macromolecular production, the toxicity of viral proteins, and virus-induced apoptosis are thought to play a role.
