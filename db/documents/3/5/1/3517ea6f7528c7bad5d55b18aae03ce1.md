Acanthosis nigricans is not a common skin disorder but when it presents, the diagnosis can often be difficult. The condition can be benign or malignant, and hence an interprofessional approach is necessary to make a prompt diagnosis. Healthcare workers in primary care including nurse practitioners should always refer the patient to a dermatologist if unsure about the rash. The overall prognosis for patients with the malignant form of acanthosis nigricans is poor with an average survival of fewer than 24 months. Those with the benign form have an excellent prognosis, provided the condition causing it is treated. The majority of practitioners are likely to see acanthosis nigricans in the younger population with insulin resistance; hence a referral to an endocrinologist is recommended. Finally, patients should be educated that acanthosis nigricans is not a primary skin disorder but usually due to an underlying condition. In many benign cases, just changing diet and losing weight may lead to a cure.
