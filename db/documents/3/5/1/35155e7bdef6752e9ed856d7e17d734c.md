Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) is an aggressive form of renal cell carcinoma. CDC represents fewer than 2% of renal masses and usually carries a poor prognosis. Alterations in various genes, including NF2, SETD2, SMARCB1, and CDKN2A, have been identified in CDC cases. Patients with CDC generally undergo cytoreductive nephrectomies, which have been shown to improve survival outcomes (particularly when combined with chemotherapy/radiation).
