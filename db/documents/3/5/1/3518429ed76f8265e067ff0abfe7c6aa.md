- Hypersensitivity or allergy to mirtazapine or any component of its formulation would preclude the use of the drug.

- Avoid prescribing mirtazapine to any patient who is currently on MAO inhibitors. There should be a gap of at least 14 days between the discontinuation of an MAO inhibitor and therapy initiation with mirtazapine. Conversely, the same amount of time (at least 14 days) should be allowed to pass after stopping mirtazapine and initiating MAO inhibitors to treat psychiatric disorders. This delay is because of the increased risk of serotonin syndrome with concurrent use of both drugs.

- Avoid prescribing mirtazapine to any patient receiving intravenous methylene blue or linezolid because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

- Boxed warning-Mirtazapine can paradoxically exacerbate depression and anxiety and even cause suicidal ideation in some people. Closely monitor these patients.
