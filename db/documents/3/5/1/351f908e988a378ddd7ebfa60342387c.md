Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by monoclonal B cell proliferation. It is the most common adult leukemia in Western populations and comprises 25 to 30 percent of leukemias in the United States. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline some of the epidemiological factors associated with the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
- Describe exam findings consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
- Explain management considerations for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
- Describe how coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to more rapid diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
