Thorough knowledge of the motor and sensory distribution of the ulnar nerve is critical in evaluating patients with ulnar neuropathy. Diagnosis can be made clinically, and nerve conduction studies are often used to mainly confirm the diagnosis. In some patients, however, nerve conduction may be normal in the early stages of symptoms; therefore, interpretation of nerve conduction studies should always be in a clinical context.

X-ray of the elbow joint can be done to exclude bony pathologies such as osteophytes and old fractures which may cause compression of the nerve.

Both ultrasonic scanning (USS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have sensitivity and specificity over 80% in diagnosis. MRI and USS are also helpful to identify other causes of compression, which may not be picked up on plain radiograph films such as soft tissue swelling and lesions such as neuroma, ganglions, aneurysms, etc.
