Chorioamnionitis is a risk factor for both maternal and neonatal sequelae. Endometritis can occur in up to one-third of women treated for chorioamnionitis who undergo a cesarean section. The rate of endometritis is the same in vaginal deliveries and cesarean deliveries following chorioamnionitis. Recent studies show that management with postpartum antibiotics does not decrease the risk of endometritis following chorioamnionitis.

The majority of women with chorioamnionitis will recover and not require further antibiotics after delivery.
