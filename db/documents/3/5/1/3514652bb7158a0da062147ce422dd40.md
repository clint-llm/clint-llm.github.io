All currently available assays for the quantification of PCT are based on immunoassay techniques.

A point-of-care test for PCT  is available using an immunochromatographic technique. A colored band appears on the test strip 30 minutes after applying 200 microliters of serum or plasma; the intensity of the band is read against a reference card. The results are reported as less than 0.5, 0.5 to 2.0, 2.0 to 10, and greater than 10 μg/L.
