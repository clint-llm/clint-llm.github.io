The ventral rami of the cervical spinal nerves C5 and C6 join to form the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. Each trunk is divided into anterior and posterior divisions, which are further divided to create the cords, then branches, namely the axillary nerve, suprascapular nerve, and musculocutaneous nerve, to supply the muscle of the upper limb. Injuries to the brachial plexus range from mild to severe. The degree of severity can be defined as neuropraxic, axonometric, or neurometric. A neuropraxic injury is the least severe. It is reversible and heals without any complications. Axonometric lesions involve disruption of axon and myelin sheath. Recovery of axonometric lesions depends on the level of the lesion, and it may take months to heal with proper treatment, including physiotherapy. Neurometric has the worst prognosis, with avulsion of the roots from the spinal cord causing irreversible damage affecting the axon, myelin sheath, and supporting structures through the nerve. The proximal end of the nerve tries to regenerate by forming a neuroma.
