Patients with volvulus often present to the emergency department. While the diagnosis is not difficult, the management is not always straight forward. Thus, it is important to involve an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, intensivist, nurse practitioner, general surgeon, gastroenterologist, and internist. It is also vital to involve the radiologist right from the beginning so that a diagnosis can be made urgently. The monitoring of the patient, before and after the surgery, is exceedingly important and must be done in ICU or HDU under the care of an intensivist. Immediate consultation with a surgeon is necessary to plan for surgery. The role of a gastroenterologist is also vital, as immediate treatment of sigmoid volvulus is detorsion utilizing the sigmoidoscopic reduction technique. In the postoperative period, nurses should provide prophylaxis against DVT, pressure ulcers, and gastritis. Nurses also play a critical role in educating the patients and their relatives about stoma care. Open communication between the team is vital in order to achieve good outcomes.
