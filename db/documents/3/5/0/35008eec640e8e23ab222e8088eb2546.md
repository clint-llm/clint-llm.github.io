The stratum corneum can be visualized by examining sectioned epidermal tissue under hematoxylin and eosin staining under light microscopy. The corneocytes present in the stratum corneum are flat, eosinophilic cells that lack nuclei. The stratum compactum and stratum disjunctum layers can generally be visualized easily.
