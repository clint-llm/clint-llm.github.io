Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) or "Fatty Liver" corresponds to the presence of macrovesicular changes without inflammation (steatosis) and lobular inflammation in the absence of significant alcohol use. It can be divided into two subgroups: NAFL (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver) or simply Steatosis and NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis). NAFL is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with no evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning of the hepatocytes. NASH is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis and inflammation with hepatocyte injury (ballooning), Malloryhyaline, and mixed lymphocytic and neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate in perivenular areas with or without fibrosis.

NAFLD is commonly associated with Metabolic Syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Nearly 80% of patients with Metabolic Syndrome have NAFLD.
