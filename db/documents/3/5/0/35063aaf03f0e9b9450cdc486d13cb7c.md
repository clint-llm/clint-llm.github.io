Invasive trichosporonosis has been mainly documented in patients with hematological malignancies and other medical conditions associated with immunosuppression, whereas superficial infections and allergic pneumonia are found predominantly in immunocompetent hosts.

In 2005, Girmenia et al. did a very large retrospective study about invasive trichosporonosis, focusing on patients with hematological conditions. DataÂ collected over 20 years in a multicenter study of 287 cases of trichosporonosis showed that 74.7% of the patients had a bloodstream infection of Trichosporon, while 50.6% developed a disseminated infection.

Risk factors for severe disease include:

- Chemotherapy

- Malignancy

- State of immunosuppression

- Neutropenia

- End-stage renal disease

- Severe burns

- Cystic fibrosis
