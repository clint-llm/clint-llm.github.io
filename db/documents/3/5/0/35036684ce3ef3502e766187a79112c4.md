In patients with aldolase B deficiency, the ingestion of fructose, sucrose or sorbitol initiates a cascade of biochemical abnormalities that lead to the short term and long term complications of the disease. The intracellular trapping of phosphate and accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate is responsible for many of the manifestations of the disease. The depletion of ATP alters the AMP: ATP ratio, leading to an increased breakdown of AMP, leading to hyperuricemia seen in patients. Fructose-1-phosphate is a strong inhibitor of phosphomannose isomerase.

Untreated disease can lead to hepatic and renal dysfunction. Hepatomegaly and hepatic fibrosis may be observed. Renal manifestations include Fanconi-like syndrome and nephrocalcinosis. The mechanism behind renal dysfunction is not well characterized.
