Management of duplication cysts requires an interprofessional team approach. The involvement of a pediatric surgeon, primary clinician or neonatologist, radiologist, gynecologist, and neurosurgeon are necessary in the optimal management of these cases. The nurses are also a vital member of the interprofessional group. They play an important role in the postoperative monitoring and care of the children. The pharmacist must ensure that the patient is on the correct formulation and doses of antibiotics and analgesics in the postoperative period. Thus, meticulous planning and discussions with all the team members involved in the management of the patient are highly recommended to lower morbidity and improve outcomes. [Level 5]
