Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the degradation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain.

The biochemical hallmark is the accumulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid in body fluids. The affected individuals present with non-specific and variable neurological features, and a high index of suspicion is required for diagnosis. However, the characteristic biochemical and neuroimaging findings often lead to diagnostic suspicion and facilitate targeted metabolic and genetic testing.
