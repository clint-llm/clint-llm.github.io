Acute amiodarone toxicity from overdose is a relatively rare phenomenon. Its high volume of distribution makes it unlikely to cause serious toxicity as single ingestion. However, patients with suspected acute amiodarone overdose should have continuous cardiac monitoring for two to three days after ingestion as toxic effects may experience a delay before appearing. The literature on toxicity from acute amiodarone overdose describes primarily cardiovascular side effects, including hypotension, bradycardia, VT, and TdP. However, as noted above, these adverse effects may occur at recommended dosingÂ as well.

Treatment of acute toxicity may include vasopressor support as well as magnesium for TdP. Temporary pacing may be necessary for bradycardia, and TdP treatment may warrant over-drive pacing. Activated charcoal is the recommended therapy for acute oral ingestions. No specific antidote for amiodarone toxicity is available, and amiodarone is not dialyzable.
