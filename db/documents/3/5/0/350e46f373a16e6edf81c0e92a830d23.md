Barrett esophagus (BE) is a pre-malignant condition characterized by the conversion of the normal esophageal squamous epithelium into metaplastic columnar epithelium. A worldwide consensus on the exact requirements for the diagnosis, however, has not yet been reached. The majority of BE cases are acquired, with the precipitant being long-standing gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). Rare families have an increased incidence of developing BE through autosomal dominant inheritance of certain susceptibility alleles, known as the familial Barrett esophagus phenotype. BE predisposes patients to the development of dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Surveillance programs have been developed to aid management decisions based on the presence of non-dysplastic BE, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, or invasive adenocarcinoma. These continue to change as new studies and new data are evaluated and included in newer guidelines. When to apply various endoscopic and surgical therapies is another topic that has undergone recent change. Advances in technologies and further studies for patient risk stratification are research areas of interest with the potential for affecting the future guidelines for diagnosing and managing BE.
