Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is administering antibiotics before performing surgery to help decrease the risk of postoperative infections. The evidence supporting routine preoperative use of prophylactic antibiotic administration continues to grow. The routine administration of prophylactic antibiotics is standard in cases in which a patient will have an artificial implant or foreign body implanted as part of the procedure, bone grafting procedures, and other surgeries with extensive dissections and expectations for higher amounts of anticipated blood loss. This activity will highlight the rationale, timing, agent selection, coverage, and monitoring pertinent for interprofessional team members involved in the administration of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis to patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the rationale behind preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
- Summarize the evidence for the timing of administration with preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
- Review the follow-up monitoring necessary to determine the successful implementation of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, where it is indicated and improves patient outcomes.
