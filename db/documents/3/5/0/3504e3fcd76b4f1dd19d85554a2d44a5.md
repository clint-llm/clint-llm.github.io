The tensor veli palatini receives its blood supply from the maxillary artery, a branch of the external carotid artery, just below the mastoid bone. The lesser palatine branch of the maxillary artery enters through the maxillary tubercle and emerges through a foramen in the lesser palatine.Â  In some patients, the lesser palatine branch anastomoses with the greater palatine branch.
