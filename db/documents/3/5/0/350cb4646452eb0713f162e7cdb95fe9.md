A glycol ether (GE) is a compound similar to a glycol. However, unlike glycols, GEs possess one or more hydrocarbon chains attached to the hydroxyl group. They are often used for their solvent properties in paint, cleaning products, and cosmetics. Although rapidly absorbed, the bioavailability of these compounds is variable. Glycol ether toxicity can occur via multiple routes and cause neurologic impairment, metabolic derangements, kidney injury, and reproductive side effects. This activity reviews the toxicokinetics and chemistry of glycol ethers and highlights the toxicologist's role in evaluating and managing its toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of glycol ether toxicity.
- Review the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of glycol ether toxicity.
- Outline the typical presentation of glycol ether toxicity.
- Summarize the critical steps in diagnosing and managing glycol ether toxicity.
