Regional anesthesia can be part of a multi-model treatment plan to mitigate pain for clinical scenarios frequently seen in an emergency department and in the perioperative setting. Preoperatively, these blocks can be employed for a variety of surgical procedures. In the emergency department, it can be utilized for insertion of internal jugular central venous catheters, treatment of clavicular fractures and repairing lacerations, and draining abscesses that involve the earlobe and submandibular areas. The superficial cervical plexus block provides ipsilateral anesthesia to the "cape" region roughly bordered by the posterior tip of the earlobe, the lateral end of the clavicle, the medial aspect of the mandible and the inferior surface of the clavicle.
