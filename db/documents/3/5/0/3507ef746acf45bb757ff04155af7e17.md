The radial nerve stems from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and supplies the upper limb. It also supplies the triceps brachii muscle of the arm, the muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm (also known as the extensors), the wrist joint capsule, and aspects of the dorsal skin of the forearm and hand. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of radial nerve injury and highlights the interprofessional team's role in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of radial nerve injury.
- Review the physical exam of a patient with radial nerve injury.
- Outline the management options available for radial nerve injury.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with radial nerve injury.
