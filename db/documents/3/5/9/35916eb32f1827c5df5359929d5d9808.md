Intracranial hemorrhage encompasses four broad types of hemorrhage: epidural hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Each type of hemorrhage results from different etiologies and the clinical findings, prognosis, and outcomes are variable. This activity provides a broad overview of the types of intracranial hemorrhage and the role of the interprofessional team in managing affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presentation of epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal intracranial hemorrhage.
- Summarize the evaluation of epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal intracranial hemorrhage.
- Outline the management approaches for epidural, subdural, subarachnoid, and intraparenchymal intracranial hemorrhage.
- Review the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients with intracranial hemorrhage receive high-quality care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.
