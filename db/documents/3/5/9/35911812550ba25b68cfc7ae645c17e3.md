Because human trafficking is not a medical disease, the traditional use of differential diagnosis does not apply. Instead, human trafficking should be in the differential as a cause of certain diseases or conditions. Human tracking is one type of abuse. It should be considered along with child abuse, intimate partner abuse, elder abuse, and vulnerable-populations abuse.

Trafficking often co-exists with physical and mental abuse. Human trafficking can be a cause of psychiatric disease and may also co-exist with pre-existing psychiatric disease. Trafficking should be considered as a cause of trauma and sexual assault. It also may cause certain medical conditions such as STI, dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, and heat illnesses.
