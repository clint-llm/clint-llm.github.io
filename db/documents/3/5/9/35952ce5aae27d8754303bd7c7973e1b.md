Thyroid function tests may reveal hypothyroidism in about 74% of patients. Hashimoto thyroiditis can occur concomitantly, and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are positive in about 90% of patients with Riedel thyroiditis. In rare instances, it can accompany Graves disease or subacute thyroiditis.

Ultrasonography (USG) of the neck would show a hypoechoic hypovascular mass involving the extra-thyroidal tissues and occasionally encasing the carotid vessels. Elastography would reveal stiff inflammatory tissues consistent with fibrosis. On computed tomography (CT) scan, the mass appears as hypodense and does not enhance with the administration of contrast. CT scan can assess the extra-thyroidal involvement more accurately than USG. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan shows intense uptake in areas of inflammation and is particularly useful in diagnosing remote areas of fibrosis which may occur in association with Riedel thyroiditis. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass is often inadequate but may show spindle cells and fragments of fibrotic tissue. A definitive diagnosis can be made only by performing an open biopsy.

Diagnostic criteria for Riedel thyroiditis are

- Extra-thyroidal extension of the inflammatory process.

- Presence of occlusive phlebitis

- Absence of granulomas, giant cells, lymphoid follicles, or oncocytes.

- Absence of thyroid malignancy
