At approximately the third week of gestation, the notochord induces neurulation, a process by which ectoderm above the notochord becomes the neural ectoderm which will later form the neural tube and crest. Noggin, chordin, BMP4, and FGF8 are some of the genes involved. The neural tube closes by week six. The rostral end will be the lamina terminalis. In addition to the spinal cord, the neural tube differentiates into three primary vesicles for the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain further differentiates into the telencephalon and diencephalon; the midbrain continues to be the mesencephalon, and the hindbrain becomes the metencephalon and myelencephalon. These structures continue to differentiate into adult brain structures. The origin of the amygdaloid body or complex called the amygdala is traced to populations of diencephalic and telencephalic cells that form the floor of the lateral ventricle about three weeks after conception.
