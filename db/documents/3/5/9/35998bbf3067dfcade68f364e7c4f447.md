There areÂ three approaches to placing the pacing electrodes depending upon the position of placement, i.e., cervical, thoracic, and diaphragmatic.

- Cervical approach - The nerve is identified in the mid-portion of the neck under the scalene fat pad by retraction of sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle.

- The thoracic approach is usually undertaken via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

- Pacing through the diaphragmatic approach is done laparoscopically.
