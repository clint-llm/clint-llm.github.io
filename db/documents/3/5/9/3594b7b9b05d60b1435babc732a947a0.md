Surgical drains are catheters placed near the surgical wound to remove blood, pus, or other fluid and prevent it from accumulating in the body. They are active drains that maintain a negative pressure gradient. The collection reservoir of an active drain collects fluid by exchanging negative pressure, and the drain may become ineffective if the vacuum is lost. The activity describes suction drains and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of drain.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for a suction drain.
- Outline the parts of two commonly used suction drains.
- Review how a suction drain inserted and the steps of drain care.
- Explain the interprofessional team's role in the use of the suction drain and improve patient outcomes.
