WAS is a rare disease and the estimated prevalence is one in 100,000 live birth.

It is highly difficult to predict the definitive incidence and prevalence of XLA disease with the absence of population screening, but it is presumed to be 1 in every birth of 190000 males based on the data acquired from the United States registry system.

Prevalence and incidence of IPEX thereof remain clearly unknown. However, retrospective analyses suggest that IPEX disease has been diagnosed or reported less than expected.
