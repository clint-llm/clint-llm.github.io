Sideroblastic anemia is a type of anemia that results from abnormal utilization of iron during erythropoiesis.  There are different forms of sideroblastic anemia, and all forms are defined by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are erythroid precursors containing deposits of non-heme iron in mitochondria forming a ring-like distribution around the nucleus.

The hemoglobin molecule contains an important protein called heme. Structurally, the heme contains four pyrrole rings joined by four methine bridges at the alpha position with an iron atom at the center of the ring.

Sideroblastic anemia is a result of abnormal erythropoiesis during heme production. 85% of heme is produced in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of the erythroblast cells while the remaining is produced in hepatocytes.

This review article will discuss the etiology, epidemiology, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment and management of sideroblastic anemia.
