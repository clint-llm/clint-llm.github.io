Cirrhosis is classified based on morphology or etiology.

**Morphology Classification**

Morphologically, cirrhosis is (1) micronodular, (2) macronodular, or (3) mixed. This classification is not as clinically useful as etiologic classification.

- Micronodular cirrhosis (uniform nodules less than 3 mm in diameter): Cirrhosis due to alcohol, hemochromatosis, hepatic venous outflow obstruction, chronic biliary obstruction, jejunoileal bypass, and Indian childhood cirrhosis.

- Macronodular cirrhosis**(i**rregular nodules with a variation greater than 3 mm in diameter): Cirrhosis due to hepatitis B and C, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and primary biliary cholangitis.

- Mixed cirrhosis (when features of both micronodular and macronodular cirrhosis are present): Usually, micronodular cirrhosis progresses into macronodular cirrhosis over time.

**Etiology Classification**

Based on the cause of cirrhosis which is sub-classified as follows:

- Viral - hepatitis B, C, and D

- Toxins - alcohol, drugs

- Autoimmune - autoimmune hepatitis

- Cholestatic - primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis

- Vascular - Budd-Chiari syndrome, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, cardiac cirrhosis

- Metabolic - hemochromatosis, NASH, Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cryptogenic cirrhosis.
