Patients with nephrolithiasis chiefly present to the emergency department with complaints of flank pain which is radiating towards the lower abdomen. The radiation of pain advances towards the pubic area and then the tip of the genitalia with the stone's passage through the ureter. Pain is intermittent, colicky, and may be quite severe, supplemented by nausea or vomiting. Fever may be present if the stone obstruction is complicated by infection. About 85% of nephrolithiasis patients will have gross or microscopic hematuria, which can help confirm or suggest the diagnosis.

Taking a comprehensive history of a patient diagnosed with nephrolithiasis is very important. The medical history may reveal a history of gout or diabetes mellitus. The patient may be taking medications that enhance uric acid in the urine, such as probenecid or sulfinpyrazone, which interfere with uric acid reabsorption in the kidneys. A dietary history is vital in terms of animal meat protein intake, water input, alcohol consumption, and fructose-containing food intake.

On physical examination, the patient could be in considerable distress due to the pain. Patients may literally writhe in agony and are constantly moving in contrast to those with an acute abdomen who try to remain absolutely still. Nausea and vomiting is often present. Costovertebral tenderness may be present, but often, the abdominal examination is unremarkable. Tophi may be seen in patients with primary gout.
