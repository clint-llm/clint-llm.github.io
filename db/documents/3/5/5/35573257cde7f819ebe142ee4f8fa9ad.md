Most of the side effects of this test are related to pharmacological vasodilators and are usually self-limited. However, these drugs have correlations with a severe side effect such as myocardial infarction.

All patients should be informed that myocardial perfusion imaging also increases exposure to significant radiation (more than a CT scan).

There is also a small risk of an allergic reaction to the radiocontrast.

All patients stressed with adenosine must abstain from caffeinated foods, cola beverages, and medications for at least 12 hours before the procedure. In addition, both theophylline and aminophylline mist be discontinued 24 hours prior to the test.
