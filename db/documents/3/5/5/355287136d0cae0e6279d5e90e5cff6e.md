As with any disease that has a significant genetic component, genetic counseling to patients (if age appropriate) and family members is important for patients and families to make informed decisions. Due to SMA's autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, manner siblings have a 25% chance of being affected, 50% chance of being carriers, and 25% of being unaffected and not being carriers. Ninety-eight percent of parents of an individual with SMA are heterozygote carriers, with the remaining 2% being explained by the de novo pathogenic variant in the child. Preconception counseling should be offered to affected individuals and screening provided for the planned reproductive partner.
