Several cases of uncommon thrombotic events associated in combination with thrombocytopenia were observed in patients who were vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines.

Due to the rarity of this clinical syndrome among vaccinated individuals, there is currently no evidence suggesting that individuals with prior history of thrombosis or risk factors for developing thrombosis are at increased risk of developing VITT. It is also unclear at this time as to why this immune-mediated thrombosis manifests mainly in the cerebral vessels and splanchnic circulation.
