Typically presenting in the elderly (median age 65 years), DLRPN is an episodic, monophasic disease that is clinically active for a relatively short period (few months - 2 years). This neuropathy presents acutely/subacutely, with an asymmetrical, focalized, unilateral, and proximal lower extremity (thigh, buttocks, or hip) distribution early in the disease. Widespread, multifocal, bilateral progression becomes apparent as disease advances, with a wide range of symptomatic severity.

Presentations include severe neuropathic pain (most aggravating initial symptom), with predominant motor-strength weakness, proximal muscle atrophy, and frequently associated weight loss (typically exceeding 10 lbs). Progressive worsening of the disease process is seen, until eventual stabilization, and gradual recovery, often with some degree of impairment.Â In comparison to other complications caused by diabetes, patients who present with diabetic amyotrophy, often have newly diagnosed diabetes, a short period of exposure to hyperglycemia, better glycemic control, less diabetic micro/macrovascular complications (i.e., retinopathy, CV disease, etc.), and a lower BMI than the average diabetic population.
