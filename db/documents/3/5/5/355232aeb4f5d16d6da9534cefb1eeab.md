When the respiratory musculature, for different reasons, does not produce sufficient force to emit sounds, the laryngeal system must compensate with muscle fatigue. The voice loses quality, and the vocal cords can undergo significant changes. A study of 29 patients showed that rehabilitation exercises to increase the expiratory force could decrease this gap (between the diaphragm and the vocal cords), improving the emitted voice.

A recent meta-analysis on the physiotherapy and recovery of speech disorders show agreement on the effectiveness of insertingÂ a rehabilitation process to improve the phonetics and strength of the sounds emitted. The therapist's action is not only directed on the respiratory system, but also in correcting the posture of the trunk, shoulders, and cervical tract. Laryngeal mechanoreceptors regulate the tone of the vocal cords based on the posture taken by the person. Correct posture is equivalent to a better tone of the vocal cords and an emission of high-quality sounds.
