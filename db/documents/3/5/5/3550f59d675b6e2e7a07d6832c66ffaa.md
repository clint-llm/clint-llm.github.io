The pathophysiology of unconsciousness involves neuronal dysfunction from a decrease in the supply of glucose or oxygen to the brain.

The anatomical seat of arousal is the ascending reticular activating system in the brainstem. Neurons of this system originate in the dorsal pons and midbrain, connect in the thalamus, and project to several areas in the cortex. The cortex processes, integrates, and gives context to the information provided to it, thus generating awareness.

The many causes for an unconscious patient can be classified as affecting three main areas of the brain:

**Bilateral Hemispheric Damage/Effect**

Extensive damage to the bilateral cerebral cortex, as can occur with hypoxic-ischemic injury or brain trauma, causes neuronal death and de-innervation of cortical regions. Such patients lose the ability to process and consciously respond to stimuli. The systemic causes of coma can also be placed in this category, as they produce an abnormal physiologic environment that inhibits neuronal function. This type of pattern is generally reversible if the systemic abnormality can be corrected.

**Diencephalic (Thalamic) Injury**

The thalamus contains relay nuclei that direct afferent input to the cortex; therefore, bilateral thalamic lesions can mimic the result of a bilateral cortical injury.

**Upper Brainstem Injury**

The dorsal pons and midbrain contain the reticular activating system. Lesions in this area can inhibit consciousness and result in a comatose state.
