A normal spleen receives its blood from the splenic artery. The splenic artery divides into branches before it reaches the spleen, and each of the branches proceeds to vascularize aÂ subset of the organ. This helps to form individual subsets of splenic tissue, each with a blood supply independent of the others but arising from the same origin, the splenic artery. Accessory spleens, like normal splenic tissue, receive their blood supply from the splenic artery. Since accessory spleens receive blood from a feeding artery off of the splenic artery, accessory spleens can function as active, functional splenic tissue even in the case of a total splenectomy.
