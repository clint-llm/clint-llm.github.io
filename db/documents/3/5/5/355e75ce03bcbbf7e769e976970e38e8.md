Clinically Ashman phenomenon is asymptomatic. However, a patient may experience symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness due to an underlying baseline rhythm like atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, but this is not due to the PAC itself, that is conducted with an aberration. An irregularly irregular rhythm is found on examination if associated with atrial fibrillation. Ashman phenomenon is a benign EKG finding commonly observed in atrial fibrillation, due to variability in the R-R interval, atrial tachycardia, and atrial ectopy.
