Most cases of BRONJ occur after a dental intervention that affects bone, but osteonecrosis can also present spontaneously.

Practitioners must consider BRONJ if patients with a history of anti-resorptive drug use present delayed healing after oral surgery, infection, and swelling in the surrounding soft tissue, numbness, paraesthesia, or bone exposure. But, clinicians should be aware that BRONJ lesions may also be an incidental discovery.

The altered nerve sensation described by some patients is due to compression of the neurovascular bundle causing paresthesia, or even anesthesia of the associated branch of the trigeminal nerve.

Complications of BRONJ include tissue ulceration, intra-and extraoral sinus tracts, and fistula.
