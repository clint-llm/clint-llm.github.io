Vascular anomalies of the orbit represent a heterogeneous group of vascular lesions found within the orbit. A profound understanding of the natural course, appropriate nomenclature, clinical features, and imaging characteristics is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. This activity reviews the recently laid-out guidelines by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) and describes the evaluation and management of OVAs. It also highlights the role of an interprofessional team-driven approach to deliver optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the recent ISSVA classification of vascular anomalies.
- Describe the diverse clinical spectrum of orbital vascular anomalies.
- Review the radiological characteristics of the vascular lesions of the orbit.
- Explain the appropriate management approach for orbital vascular anomalies.
