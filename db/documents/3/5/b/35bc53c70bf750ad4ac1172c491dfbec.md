Transection of the thyrohyoid membrane is rare but can be fatal. A prompt diagnosis and securing airway patency are essential in any patient with a neck injury.

Lateral thyrohyoid ligament syndrome can cause acute or chronic cervical pain. Patients typically present with unilateral neck pain, odynophagia and foreign body sensation, and the pathognomonic feature of point tenderness with deep palpation along the axis of the lateral thyrohyoid ligament. Inflammation of the ligamentous, cartilaginous, or bursa-related anatomical structures might contribute and can be caused by overuse or factors such as a cough, voice abuse, or strenuous neck and upper limb movements. A majority of patients achieve improvement in symptoms with steroid and local anesthetic injection. There is no imaging to confirm this condition. Therefore it is critical for physicians to be aware of the diagnosis, as a physical exam demonstrating localized tenderness over the lateral thyrohyoid ligament axis is all that is required to make a diagnosis.
