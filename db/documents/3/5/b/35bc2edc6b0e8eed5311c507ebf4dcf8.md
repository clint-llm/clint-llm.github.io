Diagnosis and management of AFLP are complex and should involve an interprofessional team; this is a true obstetric emergency which if not treated promptly can lead to the loss of two lives. The interprofessional team comprising an obstetrician, hepatology service, and critical care trained physicians should be involved.

Because there may be a need for an emergent cesarean section, the anesthesiology staff require notification. The operating room personnel and the NICU nurses should be informed of the emergency and the nurses should monitor the patient, reporting to the clinical team changes. Labor and delivery nurses, including clinicians, must ensure that the patient is hemodynamically stable, hydrated, and ready for delivery. Nurses and clinicians should educate the family members of the seriousness of this disorder and not give unrealistic expectations.

The blood bank should be notified, and the neonatology team must be on standby. There is no room for expectant management of these patients; if the mother is stable vaginal delivery may be undertaken; otherwise, a cesarean section is recommended.Â  Following delivery, the mother has to be managed in an ICU setting to ensure that there is no coagulopathy. The infant should receive care in the NICU.

Pharmacy staff needs to also remain on standby, conducting medication reconciliation and providing the required medications for surgery and post-surgical care, verifying dosing, and informing the team of any interactions or discrepancies.

In this manner, the entire interprofessional healthcare team functioning as a collaborative unit can provide optimal care for acute fatty liver of pregnancy and drive patient outcomes for both mother and child. [Level 5]

**Outcomes**

As the outcome of AFLP is time-sensitive in many cases, a multispecialty team-based approach with effective communication is key to the efficient management of these patients.
