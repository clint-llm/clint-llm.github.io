Those team members selected to don PPE are all at risk of contamination. Contamination can be in the form of a systems error or unforeseeable circumstance. The same complications with resuscitative techniques can also occur. For example, endotracheal intubations can lead to esophageal intubations, tracheal perforations, aspiration, or possibly main stem intubations if done incorrectly. Victim and Responder can endure heat stress orÂ dehydration from the physical demands of egress from a dangerous environment with the taxing strain of PPE equipment as added workload required for protection.
