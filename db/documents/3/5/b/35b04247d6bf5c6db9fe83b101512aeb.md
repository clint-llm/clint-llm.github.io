With over 16100000 flights annually carrying 1 billion travelers in the 29 million square miles monitored by the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Air Traffic Organization (ATO) and the recent changes governing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) - otherwise known as drones – increased use in shared air space highlights the importance of military, civil, and international regulations that  ensure the health and safety of those both keeping the aircraft in flight as well as the passengers. Each U.S. military branch has its aviator health regulations; the Air Force’s Medical Standards Directory and Waiver Guide, the Army’s Regulation 40-501, and the Navy’s Aeromedical Reference and Waiver Guide. The FAA uses the Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners, and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) utilizes the Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine.

Human factors are cited as the most common factor in aviation accidents, with 79% of 2006 U.S fatal accidents attributed to human error.
