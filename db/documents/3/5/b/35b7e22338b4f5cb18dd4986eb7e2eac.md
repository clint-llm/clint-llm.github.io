It is postulated that almost half of all patients with pelvic malignancies undergo treatment that involves radiation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of radiation proctitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of radiation proctitis.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of radiation proctitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for radiation proctitis.
- Summarize the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to treat radiation proctitis and improve outcomes.
