**Absolute Contraindications**

Contraindications of radial keratotomy are similar to that of other types of refractive surgical correction. Absolute contraindications include refractive instability, defined as changes greater than 0.5 D within the last 12 months. Systemic conditions that can lead to refractive instability include pregnancy and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Patients with unstable collagen vascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease are at risk of having or developing ocular conditions which directly affect vision or cause decreased wound healing, such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

**Relative Contraindications**

These will vary with the individual patient.

- Patients with advancing age can have cataracts developing, which will adversely affect visual acuity despite RK correction. Cataract surgery with intraocular lens implantation may be a better option for these patients to improve unaided distance visual acuity.

- If there is co-existing corneal pathology, e.g., scarring, corneal dystrophy, and herpetic eye disease, final visual improvement will be harder to achieve with a greater risk of visual loss.

- Patients with larger pupil diameter size may be more affected by postsurgical visual symptoms of glare and haloes, especially in dim light.

- In glaucoma patients who require regular monitoring of intraocular pressure (normal range 10 to 21 mmHg), RK correction is a relative contraindication because of the changed corneal biomechanical properties, which will cause underestimation.
