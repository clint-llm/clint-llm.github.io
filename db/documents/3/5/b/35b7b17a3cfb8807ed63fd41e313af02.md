Patients with pterygium should be informed about the chances of recurrence after surgery. Postoperative mitomycin drops or steroid strops should be strictly used under the supervision of the surgeon. Unsupervised use may lead to the melting of the cornea or sclera, resulting in loss of vision and may even result in medicolegal suits. In elderly patients, OSSN may masquerade as pterygium, and histopathological examination of such tissue is important in ruling out OSSN.
