Those with a diagnosis of cryptogenic cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Given this risk, it is recommended that patients be screened every 6 months for hepatocellular carcinoma using ultrasound imaging of the liver. Other screening modalities exist such as computed tomography (CT) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) lab testing. However,Â ultrasound imaging is the primary modality for screening. Often alpha-fetoprotein is an additional test along with an ultrasound but should not be used alone.
