The first structure encountered during cystourethroscopy is the urethra. In the male, the urethra is divided into segments: the bladder neck or pre-prostatic urethra, prostatic urethra, membranous urethra, and penile urethra, which can be subdivided into the bulbous urethra, pendulous urethra, and fossa navicularis. The verumontanum protrudes from the posterior wall of the prostatic urethra just proximal to the external urethral sphincter. It contains openings for the prostatic utricle at the apex and ejaculatory ducts on both sides of the very. The female urethra is an approximately 4 cm complex tubular structure that connects the bladder to the external meatus. It is not divided into sections due to its smaller size.

Proximal to the prostatic urethra is the bladder neck (internal sphincter), and then the cystoscope enters the bladder. On entering the bladder, tilting the scope down will reveal the trigone, a triangular portion of the bladder floor bordered by the internal urethral opening and the right and left ureteral orifices. The superior portion of the trigone is a raised area named the interureteric ridge, which courses between the ureteral orifices and can be used as a landmark to find these openings. The intravesical ureteral orifices are approximately 2 to 3 cm apart.
