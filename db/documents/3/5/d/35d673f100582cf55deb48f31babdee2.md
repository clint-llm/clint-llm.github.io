Whole-cell pertussis vaccines, known as DTP vaccines, were commonly associated with local adverse events, including swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site. DTaP vaccines replaced DTP vaccines in the 1990s to reduce the number of these common adverse events. Less common adverse events for pertussis vaccines are seizures, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, and prolonged crying.

Vaccines with tetanus toxoids can cause brachial neuritis based on case reports and studies reviewed by the World Health Organization and ACIP. The cases can be severe but are rare, and brachial neuritis is usually self-limited.

ACIP has reviewed several studies regarding the simultaneous administration of DTaP with other vaccines. There may be an increased riskÂ of febrile seizures within 24 hours when administering the inactivated influenza vaccine along with the pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine or the DTaP vaccine. The overall risk for febrile seizures is small with any combination of vaccines. Therefore, the ACIP recommends a simultaneous administration of these vaccines.
