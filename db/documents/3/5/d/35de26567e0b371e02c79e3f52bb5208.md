The tarsal plates of an involutional entropion demonstrate collagen degeneration, disorganized collagen fibers, and abnormal elastogenesis. Tensile strength is provided to the tarsus via the collagen fibers, and elastic fibers provide the tarsus withÂ resiliency. As we age, the tarsus begins to change from mainly collagenous fibers to elastic fibers
