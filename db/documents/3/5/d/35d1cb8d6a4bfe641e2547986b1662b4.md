Initial symptoms of blastomycosis are flulike and typically resolve within days, though the patient may disregard their mild nature; therefore, the initial infection may go undiagnosed. In addition, asymptomatic infection occurs in about 50% of infected persons. Acute or chronic pneumonia can occur and, in elderly or immunocompromised patients, acute respiratory distress syndrome can result. The extrapulmonary disease can occur after the dissemination of BlastomycesÂ dermatitidis to other organs, with the skin being the most common site involved. Clinically, cutaneous blastomycosis typically starts as papules that evolve into crusted, vegetative plaques often with central clearing or ulceration. Lymphangitis and lymphadenopathy may be present. Bone lesions are the next most common finding, occurring in 25% of extrapulmonary cases, and are typically lytic. Though osteomyelitis can involve any bone, the lower spine and pelvis are most commonly affected. Other findings of an extrapulmonary disease can include prostatitis, orchitis, or epididymitis. The central nervous system is involved in 5% to 10% of cases, including cases of meningitis and intracranial or epidural abscesses.
