Because of the adverse effects of alfentanil highlighted above, the recommendation is that vital signs undergo close monitoring for those receiving alfentanil, including respiratory status, cardiovascular status, blood pressure, and heart rate. These parameters should continue to be monitored closely immediately after surgery as well. Also, electroencephalogram monitoring may be necessary for those with a history of seizure activity. This precaution is due to an observed focal activation of cerebral activity occasionally seen in those with seizure history who have received alfentanil.
