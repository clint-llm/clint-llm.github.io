Forearm amputations are not a frequent occurrence, but their requirement can be broadly split into three categories: trauma, disease process such as vascular, infection or malignancy, and congenital. Tissue destruction, vascular compromise, and malignancy are the most prevalent, in contrast to the lower limb, where the peripheral vascular disease is the cause in nearly 80% of cases.

Trauma is by far the most common indication at 80 to 90%, and particularly crush injuries in the industry.

Disease processes, both acute and chronic, can necessitate amputation. Infection is a significant cause, and in the upper limb, the reasons are principally aggressive infection such as necrotizing fasciitis, rather than chronic variants in the lower limb such as osteomyelitis. Not only has the part been rendered useless, but it is also a threat to the life of the patient because the toxic products of tissue destruction are disseminated systemically.

No injury severity score exists to guide severe upper extremity trauma. The decision making is left to the surgeon's judgment. Similarly, in patients with systemic sepsis, amputations are necessary to control the rampant infection. And vascular complications, either from peripheral vascular disease or diabetes, can require amputation in their end stages.

An indication for amputation after nerve injury is the development of uncontrolled trophic ulcers in an upper anesthetic limb. Amputation is usually not indicated in persons with quadriplegia.

Amputations in the upper limb are also indicated for persons with malignant tumors without evidence of metastasis.

Finally, less commonly, there may be a requirement for amputation in congenital deformities or other cases such as severe contractures.
