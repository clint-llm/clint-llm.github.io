Pseudogenes are located diffusely throughout the genome. Due to the sequence similarity between pseudogenes and their functional counterparts, it is often difficult for scientists as misidentification errors can and do occur frequently. Additionally, not every gene within the genome has associated pseudogenes. Some genes even have paralogous pseudogenes, that, with evolution, have been able to insert into different chromosomes from their functional gene copies. However, the identification of pseudogenes is significant and necessary to understand their molecular role in disease as well as their relationship to their functional gene copy.

The identification of pseudogenes is especially difficult when they originate from mitochondrial DNA that retrotransposed into nuclear DNA. The complexity of identification may be able to be overcome using in silico analysis, which utilizes a homology-based, whole-genome approach. While the identification of pseudogenes is continually evolving and is a current work in progress. Many independent groups, such as REGEXP, PseudoFinder, RetroFinder, PseudoPipe, and GIS-PET, have an ongoing effort to standardize the identification of pseudogenes.
