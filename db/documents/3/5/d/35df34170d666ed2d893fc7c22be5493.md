An ultrasound scan performed between 18 and 22 weeks gestation provides the pregnant woman and her care provider with information about multiple aspects of her pregnancy. The obstetrical ultrasound will inform them of and/or confirm the number of fetuses present, the gestational age, and the location of the placenta. It will present an opportunity to diagnose congenital anomalies and/or to detect soft markers of aneuploidy and to identify maternal pelvic pathology.
