Prevention of advanced disease starts with reducing mold-exposure and antifungal prophylaxis targeted to high-risk patients with options such as mold-active azoles, echinocandins, and amphotericin B formulations.

Studies have shown that in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and severe graft-versus-host disease, posaconazole was an effective prophylactic agent. It is important to state that mold-active azoles have significantly drug-drug interaction rate given their metabolism through CP-450 and that this is taken into consideration when choosing the appropriate drug therapy.

Further investigation is needed to determine the best treatment in cases of prophylaxis failure in patients with invasive aspergillosis, diagnostic tests with higher sensitivity and specificity and detection of polymorphisms in host genes that mediate innate immunity and may play a role in invasive infection in periods of immunosuppression.
