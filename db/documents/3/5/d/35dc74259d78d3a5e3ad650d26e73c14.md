The distinctive appearance of lupus pernio makes it an easily recognizable manifestation of sarcoidosis. However, a few differential diagnoses can mimic its clinical presentation, including fungal infection, lupus vulgaris, berylliosis, lymphoma cutis, lupus erythematosus, and tuberculoid leprosy that have a similar pattern of distribution. The cutaneous examination is usually enough to differentiate most of these lesions, but in some cases, a biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis.
