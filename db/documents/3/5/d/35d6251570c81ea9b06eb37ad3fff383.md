Malaria is a global infectious disease that remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Severe and fatal malaria is predominantly caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Its management and prognosis depend on the awareness of a possible diagnosis in travelers returning from endemic areas, early recognition, and timely effective treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with falciparum malaria and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of P. falciparum infection. 
- Summarize the findings seen in a patient with P. falciparum malaria. 
- Describe common complications for patients with severe P. falciparum malaria. 
- Outline the importance of communication and collaboration among the interdisciplinary team to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients affected by P. falciparum malaria.
