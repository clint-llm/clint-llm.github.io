Fatal caffeine overdose is relatively uncommon, and treatment data is limited to case reports. The primary treatment for minor caffeine ingestion is supportive. Hydration may be oral in minor cases, yet severe cases benefit from intravenous (IV) hydration. Beta-blockade with esmolol is useful for tachycardia. Procainamide, lidocaine, or bicarbonate have also been utilized for the treatment of tachydysrhythmias.

Activated charcoal can bind caffeine if the ingestion is recent, and repeated doses can help diminish serum levels via the enterohepatic circulation. Hemodialysis has been effective in severe, life-threatening caffeine ingestions. Caffeine exhibits ideal characteristics to be dialyzed, including low protein binding (36%), low molecular size (194), and a small volume of distribution (0.6 to 0.8 L/kg). Imminent cardiac arrest in caffeine toxicity should prompt intra-lipid therapy to scavenge the free serum caffeine.
