The prognosis of LBD is fair to poor. Patients die from multiple complications like falls, immobility, cardiac complications, medication side effects, pneumonia, swallowing problems, and depression leading to suicide. The average life expectancy is only five to eight years after the initial diagnosis. This also can be due to a lack of knowledge regarding LBD among physicians and the population and difficulty in differentiating it from other similar conditions which leads to a delay in diagnosis which delays the onset of specific therapy. Health professionals need to improve awareness regarding LBD and there should develop investigative methods to ensure its early diagnosis.
