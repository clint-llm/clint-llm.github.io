In utero, the spleen is partially responsible for hemoglobin synthesis from the 10th through the 25th week of pregnancy. After birth, the primary function of the spleen shifts to the following major roles:

- Filtration

- Iron metabolism

- Prevention of infection

- Red blood cell and platelet storage

Filtration of erythrocytes and platelets occurs via splenic cords in the red pulp. Young, flexible red blood cells pass through the epithelial cells of the splenic cords and continue through blood flow. On the other hand, older, larger, and deformed red blood cells are trapped by the splenic cords and phagocytosed by macrophages waiting on the reticulum and sinus endothelium.

Furthermore, splenic macrophages in red pulp are specialized to recycle iron from the breakdown of senescent and damaged red blood cells.

Not only does the spleen play a role in the breakdown of red blood cells, but it can also play a role in hematopoiesis. While not a typical function, in pathologic conditions, such as beta-thalassemia major, extramedullary hematopoiesis may occur to help the bone marrow compensate for the hemolysis taking place.

Infection prevention occurs by two major mechanisms: phagocytic filtration of the bloodstream and production of opsonizing antibodies. As mentioned above, macrophages supervise the flow of red blood cells, platelets, as well as microorganisms through the splenic cords.

As a reservoir for blood, the spleen weights about 100 g. The organ can respond to sympathetic stimulation by contracting its fibroelastic capsule and trabeculae to increase systemic blood supply. In particular, this vital function takes place during hemorrhage. About 25% to 30% of red blood cells (RBCs) are stored in the spleen, along with about 25% of platelets normally sequestered in the spleen.
