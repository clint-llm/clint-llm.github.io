Electrodiagnostic studies must be considered in a patient presenting with a weakness to confirm the presence of muscle disease and rule out alternative diagnoses and myopathy mimickers. Additionally, this study can reduce differential diagnoses and point towards specific types or groups of myopathies.

Electrodiagnostic testing is important in investigating patients with suspected myopathy, excepting clearly hereditary myopathies with positive family history, where proceeding directly to genetic testing is reasonable and preferable.
