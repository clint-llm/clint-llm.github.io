Bulimia nervosa is a condition that occurs most commonly in adolescent females, characterized by indulgence in binge-eating, and inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain.

Episodes of binge eating:

- Patients are eating portions more significant than what most people would consume in a similar period (usually less than 2 hours) and under comparable conditions.

- During eating episodes, the patient loses control and is unable to curb the servings he consumes.

Binging episodes are followed by inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain:

- Self-induced vomiting

- Laxatives abuse

- Diuretic use

- Extreme physical activity

- Fasting

The episodes should occur at least once a week for three months to establish a diagnosis.
