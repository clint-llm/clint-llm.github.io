Atherosclerotic plaques with large lipid-rich core and covered by a thin, fibrous cap are extremely unstable and susceptible to rupture. Such plaques may not necessarily cause obstruction. Metalloproteases and cytokines released by T-lymphocytes and macrophages present at the site of plaque weaken the fibrous tissue rendering it vulnerable to erosion.
