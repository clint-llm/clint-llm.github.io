To optimize clinical outcomes, fetal ultrasonography is an essential component in the early detection of fetal anomalies. Beginning with the initial prenatal visit, properly identifying risk factors or exposures by the obstetrician, midwife, or nurse practitioner is important for early ultrasonography evaluation. Communication between the ultrasonographer, obstetrician, and Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist is vital in diagnosing any major fetal anomalies or maternal complications requiring early intervention or transfer to a tertiary care center equipped with resources to safely handle the management and care of both mother and fetus.
