The differential diagnosis for Noonan syndrome is broad. Many other chromosomal abnormalities can cause a similar constellation of symptoms of congenital heart defect, short stature, and developmental delay.

- Turner syndrome

- Noonan syndrome has been referred to as “pseudo-Turner syndrome” due to the similarities between Turner and Noonan syndromes. Both syndromes display a webbed neck and short stature. However, only females are affected by Turner syndrome (45, X0), as the X chromosome is affected. Both males and females are affected by Noonan syndrome, and the karyotype is normal.

Noonan syndrome is considered a RASopathy since the genetic mutations affect the RAS/MAPK pathway. Other RASopathies exhibit similar features to those in Noonan syndrome. These conditions include:

- Cardiofasciocutaneous syndrome (CFC)

- Costello syndrome

- Neurofibromatosis 1

- Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (formerly called LEOPARD syndrome)
