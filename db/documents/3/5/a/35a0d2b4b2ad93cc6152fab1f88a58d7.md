The flexor carpi ulnarisÂ is one of the superficial flexor muscles of the forearm along with the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. These superficial forearm flexor muscles attach through a common flexor tendon onto the medial epicondyle of the humerus.
