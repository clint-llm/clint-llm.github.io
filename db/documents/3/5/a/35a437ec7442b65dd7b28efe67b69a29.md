The approach to the treatment of epiphrenic diverticula is based on the underlying motility disorder that is commonly present. Not only must the diverticulum be addressed, usually with a diverticulectomy, but a myotomy, fundoplication, or hiatal hernia repair may also be necessary.

Indications for surgery are not based on size but instead on symptoms such as worsening dysphagia, regurgitation, food retention, or complications such as aspiration pneumonia, perforation, and cancer. Asymptomatic patients with epiphrenic diverticulum can be managed non-operatively. The surgical approach can be either open or laparoscopic/robotic with a trend toward minimally invasive due to its decreased pain, length of stay, and mortality.

Open approaches can be via laparotomy or left thoracotomy, or a combined thoracoabdominal approach. Minimally invasive procedures can be transhiatal or transthoracic, depending on the distance of the diverticulum from the lower esophageal sphincter. This also includes robotic-assisted devices such as the Da Vinci Surgical System robot, which may offer better visualization than the traditional laparoscopic/thoracoscopic approach.

The extent of the subdiverticular myotomy is more critical than the proximal length to encompass the area of obstruction. This is performed between 90-180 degrees from the diverticulectomy site to avoid a leak.
