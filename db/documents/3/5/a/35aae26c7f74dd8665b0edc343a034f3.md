Medial medullary syndrome remains a complex clinical condition that needs communication and coordination between providers at all healthcare levels to bring to bear their specialist skills and collective knowledge for the benefit of the patient. This begins with the initial patient contact by emergency medical service (EMS) to the stroke team's (including clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses) assessment upon hospital arrival. A specially qualified neurologist and neurology specialist nurse will ideally assist in organizing patient treatment, monitoring, and patient awareness, and keeping all team members aware of observations and issues.

The pharmacist will assess possible drug-drug interactions and assist with proper dosage as well as patient care, closely working with clinical personnel if any changes in prescription are needed. Enhanced interprofessional teamÂ communication leads to better outcomes in patients with medial medullary syndrome.
