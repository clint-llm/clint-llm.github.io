CD4 count monitoring primarily serves to assess when to initiate prophylaxis against several opportunistic infections. While it is useful in monitoring response to ART, CD4 count is, by itself, insufficient in evaluating response to therapy. Viral load monitoring remains the most reliable indicator of treatment response.

The CD4 count is necessary at baseline and three months after the initiation of ART. It is subsequently monitored every 3 to 6 months during therapy. According to treatment guidelines, less frequent monitoring (every 12 months) may be sufficient after two years of ART in patients who have a stable CD4 count of greater than 300 cells/microliters and consistently undetectable viral load.
