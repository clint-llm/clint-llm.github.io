The significant pathological changes involved in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord are multifocal, diffuse demyelination, and axonal loss, particularly in the white matter of the spinal cord. These demyelinating changes predominately affect the dorsal column and lateral corticospinal tracts, and sometimes the spinothalamic tracts. Clinical presentations include paresthesias, ataxia, sensory loss, dementia, and muscle weakness. These symptoms can collectively be seen in patients with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.

Vitamin B12 is utilized as a cofactor for two essential enzymes involved in the preservation of myelin. Homocysteine methyltransferase converts homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is the precursor for S-adenosyl methionine, which is required to maintain the neuron sheath. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. This step is necessary for myelin synthesis.

The deficiency of vitamin B12  produced leads to the accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. A deficiency of vitamin B12 results in the accumulation of MMA, which can impair the synthesis of myelin and result in the incorporation of abnormal lipids in myelin, leading to demyelinating changes that manifest as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.
