No treatment has proven to be effective in necrobiosis lipoidica. In patients with diabetes mellitus, control of blood glucose usually does not significantly affect the course. In the absence of ulceration or symptoms, it is reasonable not to treat necrobiosis lipoidica, given that up to 17% of lesions may resolve spontaneously. Compression therapy controls edema and promotes healing in patients with associated venous disease or lymphedema.

When ulcerations are present, proper wound care principles are essential. First-line therapy includes potent topical corticosteroids for early lesions and intralesional corticosteroids injected into the active borders of established lesions. For inactive, atrophic lesions, topical steroids should be avoided as they may exacerbate the atrophy and increase the risk of new ulcerations.

Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy is used for various inflammatory dermatoses. Psoralen and ultraviolet light A (PUVA) decreases the actively inflamed borders but has no clinical effects on atrophic scars.

Calcineurin inhibitors inhibit T-cell activation by blocking calcineurin resulting in both anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Topical tacrolimus has been shown to be effective in resolving ulceration associated with necrobiosis lipoidica.

TNF is an important regulator of the formation of granulomas. The monoclonal antibodies adalimumab and infliximab bind directly to soluble TNF-alpha to prevent its action. Etanercept is a fusion protein made up of the Fc portion of human IgG1 and TNF receptors that also inhibit TNF function. Both etanercept and infliximab have been repeatedly found to be effective as monotherapy for ulcerating necrobiosis lipoidica.

A study by Erfurt-Berge et al. found that topical steroids were predominantly used. Calcineurin inhibitors and phototherapy were the next most frequently used treatments. Systemically, fumarate esters were commonly employed, followed by steroids and dapsone.

Antiplatelet aggregation therapy with dipyridamole and aspirin has been tried based on the theory that necrobiosis lipoidica is due to platelet-mediated vascular occlusion or altered platelet survival.
