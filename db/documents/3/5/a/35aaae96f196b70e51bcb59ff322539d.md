The presence of K-complexes has been seen during sleep in the EEG of infants as young as 5 months old. When the child is about 3 to 5 years old, a faster negative component develops which continues to increase well into adolescence. During adulthood, there are changes observed at around 30 years of age. There is a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of the K-complex in those more than 50 years of age, seen especially in the elderly.
