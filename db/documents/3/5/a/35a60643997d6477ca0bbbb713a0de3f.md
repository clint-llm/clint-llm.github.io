Nasogastric tube placement begins as the tube is placed through the nares and ends in the stomach. The utilization of fluoroscopy allows for continuous visualization of the tube as it passes through the pharynx and esophagus, reaching its ultimate destination. This ensures proper placement; and allows for the avoidance of traumatic or adverse events.

Nasogastric tubes are most often used for decompression of the stomach but additionally can be used for the administration of nutrition or medications, removal of gastric contents in the case of poisoning or overdose, or diagnoses involving upper gastrointestinal bleeds.Â  Additionally, the use of fluoroscopic-guided placement proves to be more beneficial in the case of difficult anatomy.
