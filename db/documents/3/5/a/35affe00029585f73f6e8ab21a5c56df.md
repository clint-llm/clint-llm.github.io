Insulin, regular when administrated subcutaneously, should be injected 30 to 40 minutes before each meal. Avoid cold injections. The injection is in the buttocks, thighs, arms, or abdomen; it is necessary to rotate injection sites to avoid lipodystrophy. Do not inject if the solution is viscous or cloudy; use only if clear and colorless.

When administered intravenously, U-100 administration should be with close monitoring of serum potassium and blood glucose. Do not use if the solution is viscous or cloudy; administration should only occur if it is colorless and clear.

For intravenous infusions, to minimize insulin adsorption to plastic IV tubing, flush the intravenous tube with a priming infusion of 20 mL from a 100 mL-polyvinyl chloride bag insulin every time a new intravenous tubing is added to the insulin infusion container.
