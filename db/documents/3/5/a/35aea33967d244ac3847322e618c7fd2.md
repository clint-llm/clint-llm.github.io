A-pattern and V -pattern deviation is horizontal; rectus muscles can be vertically transposed to correct A-pattern and V-pattern deviation. In A-pattern deviations, the medial rectus muscle is moved superiorly along the globe toward the location of the deviation. In V-pattern deviations, the medial rectus is moved down toward the deviation. This will weaken that muscle in the direction of gaze that the muscle is displaced. Full treatment plans for these disorders depend on the function of the other extraocular muscles, most notably the superior and inferior obliques, and assessment of over or under action is crucial.
