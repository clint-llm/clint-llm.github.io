Neurons of the supraoptic nuclei begin their formation early in development, and adult numbers of vasopressin producing cells are typically present by the second trimester. The postulate is that the formation of the Herring bodies occurs not within the posterior pituitary, where they ultimately reside, but within the axons of the hypothalamic magnocellular cells during the vasopressin secretory cycle. Once vasopressin granules are contained within mature Herring bodies, they are no longer able to travel retrograde through the axon and must either be released or degraded.
