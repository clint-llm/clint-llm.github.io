Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is a rare disease requiring a high degree of suspicion for diagnosis before serious complications like fatal hemorrhage or pancytopenia occur. It requires collaboration between primary care physicians and specialists, including hematologists, to avoid any delay in care. Communication between team members is crucial for managing these cases, including the nursing staff, to pick up any slight bleeding or new symptoms that can reflect serious complications. Shared decision-making about treatment options and their pros and cons must take place with patients and their families.

Enrollment of patients in national and international studies is essential because of the rarity of the disease. At the moment, there are no large multicenter randomized control trials; hence hematologists have to depend on case reports describing success with various therapies for CAMT and AAMT.
