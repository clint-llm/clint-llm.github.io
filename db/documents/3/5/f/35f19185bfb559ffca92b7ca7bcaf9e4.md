Absent any significant medical co-morbidities, particularly those carrying immunosuppression, olecranon bursitis is relatively benign. The progression to systemic infection from infectious bursitis in the average healthy patient is a very low risk. In fact, there may be a greater chance of spontaneous remission with no treatment in the young healthy patient compared to the risk of progression to systemic disease. However, more objective research is required to substantiate this claim, and conservative treatment with observation typically carries a higher risk of deformity and other complications.
