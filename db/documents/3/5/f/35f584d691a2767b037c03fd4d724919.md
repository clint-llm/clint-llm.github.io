A definitive diagnosis of PLEVA requires a thorough history and physical exam along with a skin biopsy due to many diseases with similar clinical presentations. There are many histopathologic findings for PLEVA, which aid in confirming the diagnosis.

Dermal findings include edema,Â wedge-shaped superficial and deep dermal lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate, lymphocyte and erythrocyte extravasation, subepidermal vesicles, and even dermal sclerosis.

Dermatoscopic findings for PLEVA have been reported in the literature and include a ring of pinpoint vasculature, brown amorphous areas, white scale, and focal melanin deposition within the stratum corneum.
