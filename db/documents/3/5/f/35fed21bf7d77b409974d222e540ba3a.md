ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK(-) ALCL) is an uncommon CD30-positive T-cell lymphoma that presents a major diagnostic challenge. It affects individuals in a wide age range and a variety of nodal and extranodal sites. Both morphologically and immunohistochemically, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) can mimic many other hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies. This activity explains how to properly evaluate for ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the histopathology of ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
- Describe the presentation of ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
- Summarize the treatment of ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
- Explain various modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
