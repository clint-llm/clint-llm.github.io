A diagnosis of hypopituitarism may be missed or delayed in complex situations where apparently normal pituitary hormone levels are misinterpreted in the context of suboptimal target organ hormone levels. However, adrenal insufficiency shouldÂ receive treatment based on clinical suspicion without waiting for the biochemical evidence.

Following are some differential diagnoses that may be considered while making a diagnosis of hypopituitarism:

- Primary hypothyroidism

- Kallman syndrome

- Pituitary macroadenomas

- Hyponatremia

- Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type-1

- Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type-2

- Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type-3
