The most common cause of dyspnea on exertion is CHF. Management of CHF is complicated, and an interprofessional approach is very important. The patient and his family need to be educated by a specialty-trained nurse prior to discharge from the hospital. The patient needs close follow-up with their primary care provider, cardiologist, heart failure nurse, and dietician. The patient would also benefit from home health services after discharge from the hospital to help monitor weight and make sure they are taking all their medications. This would help reduce hospital readmission.
