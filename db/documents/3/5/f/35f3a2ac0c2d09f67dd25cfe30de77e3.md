Elastic fibers are components of the extracellular matrix of connective tissue produced by fibroblasts. Each elastic fiber is composed of an elastic microfibril containing glycoproteins and fibrillin-1 that serves as a scaffold for the deposition of elastin proteins. Elastin fibers are crosslinked by the action of lysyl oxidase, generating a branching, three-dimensional elastin matrix and contributing to the substanceâ€™s pliability.

Elastin is also produced by perivascular smooth muscle cells, which forms the elastic lamellae found within the tunica media. The elastic tissue of blood vessel walls contains elastin only, without microfibrillar support. The elastin is organized into fenestrated lamellae in concentric rings between layers of myocytes. A unique feature of these fibers is the ability to stretch up to 50% of their length before recoiling to their original length after deformation. This characteristic enables elastin within the tunica media of arteries to facilitate pressure wave propagation of blood flow, particularly in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta and pulmonary arteries. This property, known as the Windkessel effect, maintains relatively uniform arterial blood pressure, despite pulsatile blood flow.
