Gastric polyps may be found during investigation and workup of patientsâ€™ complaints of weakness, fatigue, and dyspepsia and while they can contribute to these symptoms, they are nearly always incidental findings during endoscopic evaluation performed to rule out other gastric pathologies such as peptic ulcer disease, Barrett esophagus, delayed gastric emptying, etc. As such, the decision and responsibility of properly managing gastric polyps rest with the specialist. Guidelines such as those laid out by the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) are in place for this reason and can be applied to direct specialists when they encounter pathologies such as GHP, FGP, and adenomatous polyps.

Since the management of gastric polyps is directed by a specialty service, interprofessional communication between the gastroenterologist and the primary care clinician is essential to ensuring the appropriate information is conveyed to patients and that they receive the necessary follow-up dependent on their specific pathology found during the endoscopic evaluation.
