Fortunately, the autosomal recessive form of the disease has an incidence far less than the autosomal dominant form.

The autosomal recessive form occurs in approximately 1 out of every 250,000 births. Of note, in Costa Rica, the incidence has been found to be significantly higher, with a rate of approximately 3.4 out of every 100,000 births.

The autosomal dominant form of the disease occurs at an approximate frequency of 1:20,000.
