A strong suspicion is needed for diagnosis of cutaneous endometriosis since this condition might be mistaken for diseases such as keloid, dermatofibroma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, cutaneous metastasis of cancer (e.g., Sister Mary Joseph nodule), or melanoma. The main feature to keep in mind while suspecting cutaneous endometriosis is that the symptoms it produces are of cyclical nature that may range from cyclical pain only to cyclical increase and decrease in the size of the mass relating to the start and end of the menstruation cycle.
