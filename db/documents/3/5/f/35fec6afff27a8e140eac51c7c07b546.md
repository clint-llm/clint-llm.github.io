Central vertigo occurs when there is any lesion or dysfunction of the brainstem vestibular apparatus as described above. Peripheral vertigo may occur as a result of problems in the peripheral vestibular system from the inner ear to the vestibular division of the VIIIth cranial nerve. Peripheral vertigo accounts for over 90% of all causes of vertigo. Central vertigo most commonly occurs as a result of ischemia of the central vestibular structures in the cerebellum, brainstem, or vestibular nuclei especially in the elderly with vascular risk factors. Acute demyelination such as multiple sclerosis is another relatively common cause of central vertigo in younger patients. The other not so uncommon cause is medication-induced, especially toxicity due to common anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine. Other less common causes include infection, trauma, posterior fossa brain tumors, and migraine.
