In the literature, there are no reported overdoses of mipomersen. In clinical trials, there was no difference in the adverse reactions observed in patients receiving the normal dose of 200 mg once weekly and patients receiving a higher dose of 300-400 mg once weekly for 13 weeks. However, patients with higher doses of mipomersen experienced more frequent and severe adverse reactions than patients receiving regular doses. There is currently no reported overdose treatment for mipomersen. It is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in treating mipomersen overdose since mipomersen is tightly bound to plasma proteins.

Caution is advised when using mipomersen with other medications known to cause hepatotoxicity, increase transaminase levels or increase hepatic fat. Such medications are isotretinoin, acetaminophen, and isotretinoin when administered for more than three days per week, with a dosage of 4 g per day or more.

No studies currently observe the effects of concomitantly using mipomersenÂ with other low-density lipoprotein-lowering therapeutic agents that increase hepatic fat. Therefore, it is not recommended for such a combination to be administered to the patient.
