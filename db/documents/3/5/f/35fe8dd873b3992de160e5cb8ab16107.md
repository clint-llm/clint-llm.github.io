Dermatologists often coordinate care with other specialists as well as primary care physicians.   Dermatologists are trained in both clinical dermatology and dermatopathology, making clinicopathologic correlation a crucial part of the management of cutaneous conditions by dermatologists.  Given this unique training, it is important for dermatologists to effectively communicate with primary care and other specialty physicians about the proper management of both benign and malignant cutaneous neoplasms.  It is this collaborative decision making that provides the best care and outcomes for patients.  In the case of spiradenomas, though a benign neoplasm, complete surgical excision is recommended given the potential for malignant transformation.  With proper evidence-based management, the risk for this malignant transformation diminishes, improving the long-term prognosis for the patient.
