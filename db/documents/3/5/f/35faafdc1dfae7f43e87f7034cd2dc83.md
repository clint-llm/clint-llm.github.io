The examiner must develop their system when approaching the ear examination; this instills fluency and structure and ensures nothing is missed. Most examiners first perform a general inspection before focused inspection of the ears, palpation, and otoscopy. This is then followed by what is known as the "four F's": **f**ree-field hearing test, the**f**istula test, (tuning)**f**orks, and the**f**acial nerve. Depending on the clinical scenario, examinations of the other cranial nerves, vestibular system, nose, throat, neck, or cerebellar systems may follow.

Patients that present with ear pathology usually are well and assessed in the outpatient clinic. However, any suspicion that the patient is unwell should prompt assessment according to the Advanced Life Support 'ABCDE' algorithm.

**Inspection and Palpation**

The ears are first visualized with the patient in a seated position facing the examiner. The examiner should note any asymmetry of the ears or any prominence, and a note should be made of any resting facial asymmetry. Starting with the 'better' ear and using the otoscope as a light source, the examiner should inspect the preauricular area for any surgical or traumatic scars, masses, evidence of pits or sinuses, or skin changes such as erythema or desquamation. The pinna itself requires a detailed inspection for congenital malformations, scars, erythema, edema, masses, or exudate from the external auditory canal. If there are any piercings, a note should be made of any signs of infection, and the examiner should be vigilant for signs of perichondritis. Finally, the postauricular area should be inspected for scars and erythema. Mastoid erythema, swelling, loss of the post-auricular sulcus, tenderness to palpation, and anteroinferior displacement of the pinna are all signs of mastoiditis. The 'worse' ear should then be inspected in turn.

Following this inspection, the mastoid and tragus should be palpated for tenderness, indicating mastoiditis and otitis externa, respectively. Pre- and post-auricular lymphadenopathy should also be noted.

**Otoscopy**

The pinna should be gently pulled in a posterosuperior direction, having warned the patient. This results in the straightening of the external auditory canal and subsequent alignment of the canal's cartilaginous and bony portions. The otoscope should be gently inserted into the external auditory canal. Any discomfort doing so should be noted. The canal should be assessed for any edema, exudate, wax, foreign bodies, and the presence or absence of a mastoid cavity (from a previous 'canal-wall-down' mastoidectomy). The tympanic membrane, if visible, should be assessed for perforation, sclerosis, retraction. The presence or absence of a normal light reflex should be noted. The attic area, immediately superior to the tympanic membrane, should be carefully inspected for signs of cholesteatoma. In cases of middle ear effusion, fluid levels or bubbles may be seen behind the tympanic membrane.

Pneumatic otoscopy is a simple test to assess the mobility of the tympanic membrane. The combined features of a bulging tympanic membrane and reduced mobility of pneumatic otoscopy are highly suspicious for acute otitis media.

**Free-field Hearing Test**

This is a bedside test of hearing. It is not as reliable as formal audiometry and is highly examiner-dependent. However, it has value as a screening tool for hearing impairment. The test can reveal whether any gross hearing impairment is present and estimate the degree of the impairment.

Firstly, explain to the patient that they will be required to repeat words or phrases they hear back to the examiner. To eliminate the possibility of lip-reading, stand behind the patient, and say a test word to be repeated back. The examiner then stands to the side of the test ear (conventionally the better hearing ear) and gently presses on the tragus of the non-test ear to mask it. The examiner then speaks several test words at arm's length and then half arm's length. At each distance, the test words are spoken at three volumes: whispered, conversational, and loud.

The following descriptors of hearing can then be noted if the patient correctly identifies 50% or more words at each level:

**Arm's Length Test Words**

- Whispered: normal hearing

- Conversational: mild-moderate hearing loss

- Loud: severe hearing loss

**Half-arm's Length Test Words**

- Whispered: mild hearing loss

- Conversational: moderate hearing loss

- Loud: profound hearing loss

**Fistula Test**

A perilymphatic fistula is an abnormal connection between the inner and middle ear, allowing perilymph to leak into the middle ear. This can be secondary to dehiscence at the oval or round windows or otic capsule. Etiologies include trauma, cholesteatoma, otological surgery, or barotrauma. Perilymphatic fistula can also be idiopathic in nature. The pressure of the middle ear is transiently increased during the test. If a perilymphatic fistula is present, this pressure may be directly transmitted to the inner ear.

Prior to performing the test, the patient is warned that it may make them feel dizzy. The test is, therefore, performed sitting down. The patient's tragus is firmly palpated, and the examiner assesses the patient's eyes: nystagmus toward the test ear implies a perilymphatic fistula.

**(Tuning) Fork Tests**

Many otological pathologies result in hearing loss, either conductive, sensorineural, or both. Conductive loss is due to a blockage of the vibrations reaching the cochlea, due to ossicular disruption or tympanic membrane perforation, for example. Sensorineural hearing loss is due to damage to the cochlea itself or due to damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve.

Weber's and Rinne's tuning fork tests allow the differentiation between these two types of hearing loss. Weber's test is performed first. The examiner strikes the tuning fork and places it in the center of the patient's forehead, with the examiner's other hand providing counter-pressure on the back of the patient's head. The patient is then asked to state whether they can hear it loudest in the left, right, or center.

**Interpretation of Weber's Test**

- Normal hearing or symmetrical hearing loss: heard in the center.

- Asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss: heard loudest in the normal ear.

- Asymmetrical conductive hearing loss: heard loudest in the affected ear.

Rinne's test is then performed by striking the tuning fork and holding it 2 cm away from the external acoustic meatus (air conduction). After 2 to 3 seconds, the base of the fork should then be firmly pressed on the mastoid, using the examiner's other hand to provide contralateral counter-pressure (bone conduction). The patient is then asked which sound was heard loudest.

**Interpretation of Rinne's Test**

- Air conduction is heard louder than bone conduction [Rinne's positive]: either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss.

- Bone conduction heard louder than air conduction [Rinne's negative]: conductive hearing loss.

Therefore in left sensorineural hearing loss, Weber's will lateralize to the right, and Rinne's will be positive on both sides. In the left conductive hearing loss, Weber's will lateralize to the left, Rinne's will be negative on the left and positive on the right.

**Facial Nerve Function Testing**

The facial nerve has a complex intratemporal course, running through the middle ear.
