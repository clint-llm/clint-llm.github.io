The paramedian branches of the basilar artery supply the abducens nucleus. Occlusion of the artery damages CN 6 and thereby the lateral rectus muscle that the nerve innervates, resulting in the dysfunctional coordination of horizontal eye movements. The patient will experience the inability to abduct the ipsilateral eye and adduct the contralateral eye. Impaired eye movements will receive further discussion below.

The labyrinthine arteries, which arise from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, supply the facial nucleus and its nerve fibers. An occlusion of any of these arteries supplying the facial nerve may result in unilateral facial paralysis, impaired taste, loss of parasympathetic, or diminished somatic sensation.
