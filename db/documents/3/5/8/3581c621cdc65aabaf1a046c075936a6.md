To perform this operation safely, it is essential to have a full theatre team including a surgical team, an anesthetic team, operating department practitioners (ODPs), a scrub team, and recovery nurses for post-operative care. These patients often require ITU care, and their involvement beforehand can be vital. Sometimes, depending on co-morbidities, patients may also need to go to a high-risk anesthetic clinic pre-operatively to optimize them for theatre.

Another key component of a patient's preparation for surgery involves interaction with the stoma nurses to provide patients with information to prepare themselves mentally for the life-changing event of having a stoma. They also provide support and aftercare for patients with ileal conduits and are often the first point of contact for those living with an ileal conduit.
