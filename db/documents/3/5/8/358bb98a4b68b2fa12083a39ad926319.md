Vitreous floaters or PVDs have a good prognosis. The prognosis is worse when a patient presents with vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachments. Within three months, symptoms of the floater may subside. Some patient symptoms may not subside. If symptoms do not subside and greatly affect the patient's vision, an evaluation by a retinal specialist can be discussed.
