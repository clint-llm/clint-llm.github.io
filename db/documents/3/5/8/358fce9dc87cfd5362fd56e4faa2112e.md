Patients drinking alcohol should be counseled against the practice, especially those whose diagnosis is linked to drinking i.e alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Patients who have biliary stents placed should be educated about the recognition of symptoms and signs of blocked stents. Those who have external drains should be taught about how to flush their drains using aseptic measures. Lastly, the patient and their caregivers should be informed about the prognosis of their disease.
