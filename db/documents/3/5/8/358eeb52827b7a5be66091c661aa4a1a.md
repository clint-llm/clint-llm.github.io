The endocardium is a transparent thin layer approximately 10 micrometers in thickness consisting of only 5 layers.

- The initial invasion of endocardium by dark smooth muscle cells

- The latter invasion of endocardium by light smooth muscle cells

- Transformation of light smooth muscleÂ cells to leiomyoid cells

- Transformation of these leiomyoid cells to typical fibroblasts

It is believed that light smooth muscle cells, along with leiomyoid cells, are the culprit in the production of excessive collagen and elastin in the endocardium.
