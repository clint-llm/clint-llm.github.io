**Types of Striated Muscle Contraction**

There are four types of striated muscle contractions: isometric, isotonic, concentric, and eccentric.

Isometric striated muscle contraction is characterized by a change in muscle tension without change in muscle length. Isometric contractions are seen when pushing against an immovable object or trying to lift a weight that is too heavy.

Isotonic striated muscle contraction is characterized by a constant muscle tension without a change in muscle length. This type of contraction occurs when the contraction force matches the total load on a muscle. Isotonic contractions are seen during activities such as walking, running, or squatting.

Concentric striated muscle contraction occurs when there is sufficient muscle tension to overcome the load, and the muscle contracts and shortens.

Eccentric striated muscle contraction occurs when the muscle works to decelerate a joint at the end of a movement as opposed to pulling a joining in the direction of the contraction. This type of contraction can occur involuntarily (e.g., while attempting to move a weight too heavy for the muscle to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when the muscle is 'smoothing out' a movement or resisting gravity, such as during downhill walking). Eccentric contractions act as a braking force in opposition to a concentric contraction to protect joints from damage.

**General Mechanism of Skeletal Muscle Contraction**

Skeletal muscle contraction initiation and execution occur in the following steps.

- An action potential (AP) travels along a motor nerve to its endings on muscle fibers.

- At each motor nerve ending, the nerve secretes acetylcholine (ACh).

- ACh acts locally on the muscle fiber membrane to open ACh-gated cation channels.

- The opening of ACh-gated channels allows large quantities of sodium (Na) ions to diffuse to the interior of the muscle fiber membrane.

- This action causes a local depolarization, leading to the opening of voltage-gated sodium (Na) channels, which initiates an AP at the membrane.

- The AP depolarizes the muscle membrane, causing the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to release large quantities of Ca ions stored within the reticulum.

- The Ca ions produce attractive forces to act between actin and myosin filaments, causing them to slide alongside each other leading to the contractile process.

- After a fraction of a second, the Ca ions are pumped back into the SR by a Ca-membrane pump and remain stored in the SR until a new muscle AP occurs.

- The removal of Ca ions from the myofibrils causes muscle contraction to cease.

**General Mechanism of Cardiac Muscle Contraction**

Cardiac muscle contraction occurs via excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), utilizing a mechanism called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). ECC is the process of converting an electrical stimulus (AP) into a mechanism response (muscle contraction). CICR involves the conduction of Ca ions into the cardiomyocyte, leading to the further release of ions into the cytoplasm. Ca prolongs the period of cardiac muscle cell depolarization before repolarization begins. Contraction of cardiac muscle occurs due to the binding of the myosin head to ATP, which pulls actin filaments to the center of the sarcomere, the mechanical force of contraction.

Cardiac muscle contraction initiation and execution occur in the following steps.

- An AP, induced by the pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes, is conducted to contractile cardiomyocytes through gap junctions.

- As the AP travels between sarcomeres, it activates the Ca channels in the T tubules, leading to an influx of Ca ions into the cardiomyocyte.

- Ca in the cytoplasm then binds to cardiac troponin C, which moves the troponin complex away from the actin-binding site. Removal of the troponin complex frees actin, which becomes bound by myosin and initiates contraction.

- Intracellular Ca is then removed by the SR, dropping the concentration of intracellular Ca. This decrease in intracellular Ca concentration returns the troponin complex to its inhibiting position on the active site of actin, ending contraction as the actin filaments return to their initial position, relaxing the muscle.

**General Mechanism of Smooth Muscle Contraction**

The contraction of smooth muscle is not regulated by the binding of Ca to the troponin complex, as is seen in cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction. Smooth muscle instead utilizes calmodulin, an intracellular second messenger which binds calcium.

Smooth muscle contraction initiation and execution occur in the following steps.

- Intracellular Ca concentration increases when calcium enters the cell and is released from the SR.

- Calcium binds to calmodulin.

- Ca-calmodulin activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK).

- MLCK phosphorylates myosin head light chains and increases myosin ATPase activity.

- Active myosin cross-bridges slide along actin and create muscle tension.

- Smooth muscle relaxation occurs as free Ca in the cytosol decreases when Ca is pumped out of the cell or back into the SR.

- Ca unbinds from calmodulin.

- Myosin phosphatase removes phosphate from myosin, decreasing myosin ATPase activity and muscle tension.
