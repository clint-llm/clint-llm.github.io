Clearance for all contraindications and verbal consent fromÂ the patient before completion of vestibular rehabilitation exercises is needed before treatment. Removal of eyeglasses is recommended as they can increase the sensation of vertigo during head oscillations required during gaze exercises.

Utilization of a questionnaire, many of which are available and should be used at the provider's discretion, is helpful to pinpoint not only ADLs affected (which will be useful for prescribing habituation exercises) but also in determining the intensity of vertigo and duration of symptoms (again, beneficial for exercise prescription and progression).
