It is of paramount importance to effectively train staff on how to appropriately care for agitated and at-risk patients requiring restraint and/or seclusion. If staff is not appropriately trained, patients and others are placed at a higher risk of adverse outcomes. In addition to staff training, healthcare facilities must be equipped with means to protect individuals such as continuous security presence, efficient operation of the business, access control, alarm systems, availability of means to restrain and seclude. Restraint and seclusion must be thought of as last resort methods to use if de-escalation techniques are ineffective. The patient should be included as much as possible in the decision-making process. It is important for staff to review restraint and seclusion situations to evaluate performance and provide feedback to ensure efficient, effective, and safe medical practice.
