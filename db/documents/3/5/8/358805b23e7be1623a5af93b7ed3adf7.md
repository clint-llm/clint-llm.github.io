Metronidazole diffuses into the organism,Â inhibits protein synthesis by interacting with DNA, and causes a loss of helical DNA structure and strand breakage. Therefore, it causes cell death in susceptible organisms.

The mechanism of action of metronidazole occurs through a four-step process. Step one is the entry into the organism by diffusion across the cell membranes of anaerobic and aerobic pathogens. However, antimicrobial effects are limited to anaerobes. Helicobacter pylori and Gardnerella vaginalis, but the mechanism of action to these pathogens is not well understood.
