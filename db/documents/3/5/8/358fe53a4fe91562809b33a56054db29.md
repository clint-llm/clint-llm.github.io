The reaction after a mosquito bite is believed to be mostly from toxins located in their saliva. Unlike other biting insects, they do not leave stingers or fangs in the skin of victims. These toxins usually serve the purpose to aid in feeding viaÂ vasodilating, anticoagulant and antiplatelet properties. However, in sensitized patients, there will be a local reaction.

The thinking is that a bite in unsensitized individuals will cause no observable reaction, although some may have a small pruritic papule. However, once sensitized, individuals will go through a spectrum of presentations. A 1940 paper described five stages of mosquito bite reactions.

Immediate reactions are postulated to be due to IgE mediated type 1 reactions as they correlate with serum levels. When this IgE binds to mosquito saliva proteins, mast cells are triggered, causing a release of histamines and leukotrienes responsible for the wheal, itch, and warmth of immediate reactions. IgG and T-cells are involved in Type 4 delayed reactions. It is thought that IgG also triggers an immune complex type 3 reaction, responsible for the case reports of serum sickness-like symptoms in some case reports.
