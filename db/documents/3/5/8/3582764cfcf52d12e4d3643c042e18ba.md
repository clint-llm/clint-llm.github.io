Similar to squamous cell carcinoma elsewhere characterized by squamous differentiation where it can be affected by grade and degree of differentiation (well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated), (ranging from abundant to scant eosinophilic cytoplasm with or without intercellular bridges to small undifferentiated (primitive) cells), hyperchromatic nuclei, high nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio, mitosis (few to high) and abundant to lack of keratinization. WHO histologically classifies epithelial tumors of the cervix into squamous tumors and their precursor (squamous intraepithelial lesion) and squamous cell carcinoma into keratinizing, non-keratinizing, basaloid, warty, papillary, verrucous, squamotransitional, and lymphoepithelioma-like, each of these type has a specific morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristic.

Some of the features that can help determine the invasiveness of squamous cell carcinoma: include the presence of stromal inflammation, stromal desmoplastic reaction, numerous single or small clusters of highly dysplastic epithelial cells that look different than the one in the rete ridges, elongated rete ridges, and loss of nuclear polarity.The histological grades include well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated. Recent data suggest that recurrence-free survival was significantly reduced in patients with poorly differentiated tumors.
