Historically, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was known as hyaline membrane disease, owing to an eosinophilic membrane that lines the distal airspaces, usually terminal bronchioles or alveolar ducts, in autopsies of neonates with RDS. Macroscopically, lung tissue from infants with RDS appears similar to hepatic tissue with a ruddy appearance. The hyaline membrane mentioned above is composed of fibrin, cellular debris from lung epithelium, red blood cells, and leukocytes. Microscopic histological examination may also reveal pulmonary tissue with few dilated alveoli among diffuse areas of atelectasis.
