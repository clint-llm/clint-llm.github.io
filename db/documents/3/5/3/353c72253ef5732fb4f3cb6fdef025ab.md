As osteitis condensans ilii (OCI) is self-limiting with no proven cause, therefore there is no specific deterrence for the patients. Weight gain may be a risk factor, and thus patient education should focus on promoting healthy lifestyle choices and proper nutrition. Physical therapy has a central role in the management of pain so patients are taught different exercises to strengthen their muscles and help their pain.
