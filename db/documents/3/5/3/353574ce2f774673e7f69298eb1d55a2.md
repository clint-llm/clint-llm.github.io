Interstitial lung disease (ILD) comprises of a large group of idiopathic diffuse processes that affect the lung parenchyma. Connective tissue disease-associated lung disease (CTD-ILD) represents one of the most common causes of ILD. Along with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), they both represent the majority of ILDs.
