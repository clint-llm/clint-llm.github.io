Among the more common unwanted effects of morphine use is constipation. This effect occurs via stimulation of mu-opioid receptors on the myenteric plexus, which in turnÂ inhibits gastric emptying and reduces peristalsis. Other common side effects include central nervous system depression, nausea, vomiting, and urinary retention. Respiratory depression is among the more serious adverse reactions with opiate use that is especially important to monitor in the postoperative patient population.
