The most likely clinical presentation of a vanishing twin pregnancy is vaginal bleeding or spotting, uterine cramps, or pelvic pain, which indicates the loss of the conceptus. This can occur during the first trimester of pregnancy and may go unnoticed by the mother as missed abortion or vanishing through later gestational ages. Studies have told that most of the patients are usually more than 30 years old.

Patients who conceived via assisted reproductive technique (ART) are especially worried about the outcomes of vanishing twin pregnancy on the viable co-twin and are brought into medical attention earlier, as multiple embryos are transferred into the uterus and chances of twin gestation and vanishing twin phenomenon to occur are higher.
