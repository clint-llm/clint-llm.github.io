Before the lytic and urgent interventional era, left ventricular thrombus occurred in 25% to 40% of patients after a first anteroapical myocardial infarction. With the advent of acute reperfusion strategies, there has been a decline in prevalence. The major risk of left ventricular thrombus is subsequent embolization with stroke or major organ loss. Historically, the likelihood of embolic events was greatest in the first two weeks after the acute event and tapered off over the ensuing six weeks. After this time, there was presumed endothelization of the thrombus with a reduction in its embolic potential. Now, with the use of thrombolytics and anticoagulants, the incidence of thrombi has diminished but not to a great extent.
