After the diagnosis of the ulcer, it should undergo staging. One of the commonly used classifications is by Wagner from 1981. It classifies wounds into six grades based on the depth

**Grade/****Features**

1/Superficial ulcer

2/Deep ulcer involving tendon bone or joint

3/Deep ulcer with abscess or osteomyelitis

4/Gangrene involving the forefoot

5/Gangrene involving the entire Foot

This classification, though, has been criticized as grading merely the depth of the ulceration and not incorporating other factors known to influence the outcome. Among others, one of the most commonly used classification today is The University of Texas Classification, which not only includes assessment of the depth, but also the type of infection, and ischemia based on the eventual outcome of the wound.
