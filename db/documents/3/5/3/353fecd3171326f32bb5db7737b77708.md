The stylopharyngeus muscle plays an active role in elevating the larynx, pharynx, and in dilating the pharynx. This movement allows the passage of a large food bolus, thereby facilitating swallowing. Elevation of the pharynx causes compression of the lateral laryngeal walls, which further leads to the compression of the pharynx over the food bolus during deglutition.

The stylopharyngeus muscle act as a significant dilating muscle of the nasopharynx. During breathing, the contraction of this muscle pulls the nasopharyngeal wall dorsally. This action prevents the dynamic collapse of the dorsal wall of the nasopharynx by supporting the wall during inspiration. There are three longitudinal muscles of the pharynx (stylopharyngeus, palatopharyngeus, and salpingopharyngeus), among which contraction of the stylopharyngeus muscle is the most effective for pharyngeal clearance.
