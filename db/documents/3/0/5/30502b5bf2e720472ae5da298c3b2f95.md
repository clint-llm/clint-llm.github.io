As presenting complaints are often nonspecific, the differential diagnosis can be extensive. However, high on the list should be infectious keratoconjunctivitis, and the clinician can rule it out with appropriate cultures. These can include bacterial, viral PCR, fungal, and amoebic cultures. The literature documents, however, that even in the case of positive cultures, a temporal correlation between exposure and symptoms can lead to a diagnosis of PTX-associated corneal toxicity.

Other considerations should include other toxic exposures. In one instance, a patient was noted to have exposure to water from his coral fish tanks and plant debris (Epipremnum aureum, better known as golden pothos or devilâ€™s ivy) sap.
