The lifetime diabetes risk in men older than 18 years increases from 7% to 70% when BMI increases from less than 18.5 kg/m to more than 35 kg/m. Similarly, the lifetime diabetes risk in females increases from 12% to 74% with the same BMI values.

Similarly, bariatric surgery led to a 5-fold reduction in T2DM incidence over 7 years.

The most common metric used to evaluate body weight is body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing the patient's weight by the square of the height (kg/m). BMI stratifies patients into the following categories:

- Underweight: less than 18.5 kg/m

- Healthy weight: 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m (18.5 to 22.9 kg/m in the Asian population)

- Overweight: 25 to 29.9 kg/m (23 to 27.4 kg/m in the Asian population)

- Obese, class 1: 30 to 34.9 kg/m (27.5 to 32.4 kg/m in the Asian population)

- Obese, class 2: 35 to 39.9 kg/m (32.5 to 37.4 kg/m in the Asian population)

- Obese, class 3: greater than 40 kg/m (greater than 37.5 kg/m in the Asian population)

The upper value in each category is reduced for individuals of Asian descent because they tend to have a higher body fat content and increased risk of T2DM at a lower BMI. Many international societies have adopted these lower ranges to define obesity in individuals of Asian descent.

**Lifestyle Management**

Obesity is a chronic medical condition and a known risk factor for the development of T2DM. In patients diagnosed with overweight or obesity and T2DM, treatment begins with aggressive modification of lifestyle risk factors.

- Self-management education

- Nutritional counseling

- Increasing physical activity

- Psychosocial care, if indicated

- Smoking cessation for smokers

Patient self-management education promotes a better understanding of coexisting chronic conditions and improves knowledge about self-testing and compliance with medical therapy. Patient education is first recommended when T2DM is diagnosed, then annually, and again if complications develop.

The goal of lifestyle modification is a loss of at least 5% of body weight to achieve beneficial effects.

Participants assigned to the ILI group required fewer medications for diabetes, hypertension, and lipid management. A calorie deficit of 500 to 750 kcal/day is generally advised to achieve this. Typically, this results in a calorie goal of 1200 to 1500 kcal/day for women and 1500-1800 kcal/day for men. Meal replacement plans can be helpful for some individuals in reaching a set calorie deficit, but their use is unlikely to be sustainable over the long term. Other successful dietary interventions include the DASH diet (Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension) and the Mediterranean diet.

Modified alternate-day fasting and the 5:2 diet are the only types of intermittent fasting diets that have demonstrated a statistically significant weight loss of more than 5%.

The diet chosen should be tailored to the patient's cultural and dietary patterns, food availability, and other factors such as hunger and access to healthy foods. Counseling sessions for nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral goals to achieve weight loss should be available to all patients. More than 16 such sessions in 6 months are included in standard ILI, and monthly sessions continue for patients who achieve the target weight loss after one year. However, this degree of intensive intervention may not be readily available or financially feasible in primary care settings.

Individuals with T2DM and obesity should be encouraged to increase their physical activity gradually. A minimum target of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise is recommended. The weekly exercise plan should include aerobic exercise and two to three resistance training sessions. Exercising daily, or at least avoiding more than 2 days between exercise sessions, promotes decreased insulin resistance.

Screening for mood disorders and other psychosocial factors related to diabetes and obesity should be done regularly.

Teens and adults with obesity and diabetes should be screened for smoking and other tobacco use, including e-cigarettes. Smoking is associated with increased diabetes risk, possibly by increasing insulin resistance.

**Medical Evaluation and Treatment**

When lifestyle modifications do not achieve weight loss goals, clinicians should review the patient's medical history for other contributing factors. This includes obesogenic medications such as thiazolidinediones, beta-blockers, sulphonylureas, insulin, risperidone, other antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, and gabapentin.

Pharmacotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to ILI in patients with a BMI of greater than 30 kg/m (greater than 25 kg/m in Asians) or greater than 27 kg/m (greater than 23 kg/m in Asians) with a weight-related complication such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, T2DM, or sleep apnea.

After initiating therapy, patients should be monitored closely for medication efficacy and adverse effects. Early responders with a weight reduction of at least 5% in the first 12 weeks typically continue to achieve sustained and significant weight loss. Most weight loss medications are intended for long-term use. Initially, medical therapy for weight loss was studied only for brief use before the evidence supporting long-term use emerged in the last 2 decades. However, the FDA has approved phentermine only for short-term use of fewer than 12 weeks due to concerns about possible abuse.

FDA-approved weight loss medications for long-term use are detailed below.

(1) Phentermine-topiramate, extended-release

This combination was approved in 2012. The SEQUEL trial investigated this medication and found an average of 10% weight loss compared to less than 2% in the placebo arm.

(2) Liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide

These medications are glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonists. They were initially approved for the treatment of T2DM but were found to be beneficial for weight loss. Since then, the FDA has approved liraglutide and semaglutide. FDA approval for tirzepatide to treat obesity is expected in 2023. GLP-1 agonists promote weight loss by multiple mechanisms, including insulin release stimulation, insulin sensitization, glucagon suppression, slower gastric emptying, and centrally acting early satiety. These medications are expensive, and availability can be limited based on insurance coverage.

Liraglutide was studied in the SCALE trial and led to about 5% additional weight loss compared to the placebo.

Semaglutide was examined in the STEP clinical trial.

The SURMOUNT-1 trial investigated the use of tirzepatide for weight loss in people with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m or 27 kg/m with diabetes mellitus.

(3) Naltrexone-bupropion sustained release (SR)

This combination works by multiple mechanisms to reduce food intake and promote weight loss. Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist, and bupropion is an antidepressant. The medication must be titrated slowly to avoid intolerance. The starting dose for naltrexone/bupropion is one 8/90 mg tablet daily. Then it is increased to 2 tablets (16mg/180 mg) twice a day if necessary. Use is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, seizure disorder, or long-term opioid therapy.

(4) Orlistat

Orlistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor that prevents fat absorption. Orlistat is dosed as 60 mg tablets, 3 times daily with meals. The XENDOS trial showed an approximate 5% weight loss with orlistat.

**Surgical Treatment**

Surgical obesity treatment is indicated in patients with suboptimal weight loss or uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Surgery is recommended for patients with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m or a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m with hyperglycemia, comorbid weight-related conditions, or inability to achieve sustainable weight loss. The Second Diabetes Surgery Summit evaluated the evidence for surgical treatment in patients with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m.

Metabolic and bariatric surgery is safe and effective and should also be considered in diabetic patients with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m with uncontrolled hyperglycemia despite optimal medical therapy for T2DM. Surgery for obesity includes several options. The most common procedures are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB), and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD).

RYGB and VSG are the most frequently used techniques as they have better long-term outcomes and safety data. BPD is very effective but carries a higher risk of complications. LAGB is the safest procedure but carries the highest risk of revision and re-intervention.

Surgery achieves results by altering gastrointestinal (GI) anatomy, producing early satiety, decreasing the absorptive surface area, and modifying hormones responsible for glucose homeostasis.

RYGB has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in many human trials. Furthermore, increased levels of adiponectin (insulin-sensitizing hormone) and insulin receptors in muscles are observed. This promotes muscle fatty acid metabolism, which decreases lipid accumulation in muscle and liver and improves insulin sensitization.

Extensive data exists that bariatric procedures can control and even prevent T2DM.

A relapse of T2DM was observed in 35 to 50% of the patients. In the same study, RYGB was associated with a median disease-free period of 8.3 years. Surgical treatment is associated with improved glycemic control and clinical outcome, even when remission does not occur. An observational study assessed diabetes remission and complications for 10 to 20 years and noted a significant reduction in complications and higher remission rates in the surgical group.

RYGB and BPD patients experience the greatest reduction in HbA1c and BMI. Patients with a BMI of 30-35 kg/m and uncontrolled T2DM have also been evaluated by many studies.

The economic impact of bariatric procedures has been studied in patients with T2DM. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for metabolic surgery is generally $3,200 to $6,300, below the $50,000 estimate for nonsurgical care.

Metabolic surgery has become safer and more effective in the past two decades. Results are highly dependent upon the operating surgeon. Mortality is low at 0.1 to 0.5%, but discussing potential risks and complications is part of informed consent and shared decision-making with patients.

Long-term follow-up demonstrates that LAGB has the highest rate of removal or revision. VSG is a newer procedure that has increased in popularity as surgeons gain additional experience. BPD is the most complex surgery, resulting in increased mortality, morbidity, and complications. Clinicians should educate all surgical patients about the risk of postoperative nutritional deficiencies such as iron deficiency anemia, hypoglycemia, and bone demineralization and monitor them closely for short and long-term complications.
