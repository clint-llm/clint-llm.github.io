Clinicians will continue to refine the dosing, duration, and combination of immunosuppression and chemotherapy found in the HLH-2004 protocol. Survival will undoubtedly improve. However, progress will also (and is) being made in the realm of anti-cytokine agents. As mentioned previously, even the earliest of HLH research understood the central role of targeting hypercytokinemia. Various drugs have been developed or repurposed with specific cytokines or cytokine pathway targets, such as ruxolitinib (Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor) and emapalumab (anti-TNF gamma).

Ruxolitinib, a medication currently approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, has shown promise in murine models of HLH. Perforin deleted mice were treated with 1 mg/kg for 10 days and demonstrated improved survival, cytopenias, and serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6. Human trials have yet to been undertaken; however, given that it already has FDA approval for other hematologic diseases, such a transition could be expedited.

Phase II pediatric clinical trials have been performed with emapalumab, a novel human monoclonal anti-TNF gamma antibody. A trial of 13 children with refractory or worsening primary HLH, despite treatment, was administered the drug. Response (defined as a complete or partial improvement) occurred in 63% of treated children. 11 of 13 children were alive at 8 weeks.
