On gross examination, yolk sac tumors are soft, solid masses, and tan to yellow or grey with a mucoid appearance, notable necrosis, cystic changes, and hemorrhages are common to be present.

On microscopic examination, the tumors consist of primitive tumor cells and have many histological types, including microcystic/reticular, papillary, solid, festoon, polyvesicular-vitelline, glandular, intestinal, endometroid, parietal, tubular and, hepatoid. The reticular microcystic pattern is the most common type formed by vacuolated cytoplasm of tumor cells; it appears like a honeycomb under a microscope.

Schillerâ€“Duval body is pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors, and it appears like a glomerulus in structure with a fibrovascular core. However, Schiller-Duvall bodies are usually present only in two to three-quarters of yolk sac tumors and are only seen in papillary type.
