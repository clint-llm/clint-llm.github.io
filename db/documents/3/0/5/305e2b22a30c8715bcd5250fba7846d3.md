Mucoceles can occur in any patient with acute calculous or acalculous cholecystitis. Gallbladder disease occurs in men and women. Certain populations are more prone to gallbladder disease. The risk of gallbladder disease increases in women, obese patients, pregnant women, and patients in their 40s. Drastic weight loss or acute illnesses may also increase the risk, as well as a family propensity for this condition and the formation of gallstones. Other conditions that cause the breakdown of blood cells, for example, Sickle Cell disease, also increase the incidence of gallstones. Most gallstones are asymptomatic. In the United States, approximately 14 million men and 6 million women between the ages of 20 to 74 have gallstones. The prevalence increases as a person ages. Obesity increases the likelihood of gallstones, especially in women, due to increases in biliary secretion of cholesterol. On the other hand, patients with drastic weight loss or fasting have a higher chance of gallstones secondary to biliary stasis. Gallstones also have a hormonal association. Estrogen has been shown to increase bile cholesterol as well as decrease gallbladder contractility. Women of reproductive age or on birth control medication containing estrogen have a two-fold increase in gallstone formation compared to men. People with chronic illnesses such as diabetes also have an increase in gallstone formation as well as reduced gallbladder wall contractility due to neuropathy.
