Symptomatic patients who present with acute ischemic stroke due to spontaneous vertebral artery dissection without associated injuries or contraindications should be considered for systemic thrombolytic therapy (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) if they present within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms. Patients who present up to 4.5 hours from symptom onset and those who are otherwise not candidates for systemic thrombolytic therapy should merit consideration for catheter-directed thrombolysis. Patients who are not appropriate for thrombolytic therapy can receive anticoagulation, antiplatelet therapy, endovascular or open operative repair depending on the grade of injury.

Clinicians can manage symptomatic patients with anticoagulation versus antiplatelet therapy based on bleeding risk, the location of the lesion, and the grade of injury. Endovascular therapy and operative repair are reserved for patients with higher-grade lesions and those with contraindications to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy that are at high risk for progression.

There are no proven methods to reduce the risk of a neurologic event or recurrent dissection in patients with know dissections, but patients are advised to limit contact sports, neck manipulation or any other activity that involves the abrupt movement of the neck. Hypertension should be well-controlled and estrogen-containing medications avoided.
