To ensure accurate assessment and treatment of hearing loss, patients must be evaluated by trained professionals. Hearing loss can vary in presentation depending on social and environmental factors, and thus a thorough history is warranted in the evaluation of hearing. Patients regularly exposed to loud occupational and recreational noise may benefit from undergoing audiometric screening (often mandated annually for workplace-related noise exposure) in addition to the use of effective ear protection.

Some studies suggest that before undergoing PTA, patients should avoid exposure to loud noises (including those louder than a household vacuum cleaner) for at least 14 hours to prevent temporary threshold shifts, which may confound test results.Â Parents and caretakers of pediatric patients should be educated on the necessity of newborn hearing screening and at well-child visits. Effective follow-up is vital in the early detection and treatment of pediatric hearing loss.

Regarding BC evaluation specifically, patients, especially children, should be made aware that the vibration of an oscillator is nonpainful and will not cause harm despite an unusual sensation. With the increasing use of bone conduction hearing devices, patients with hearing loss should be sufficiently educated on the results of their audiometric testing and counseled in choosing an appropriate amplification device.
