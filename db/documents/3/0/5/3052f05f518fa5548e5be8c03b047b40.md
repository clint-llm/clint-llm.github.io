Isoniazid (INH) is a potent bactericidal antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis. Treatment with INH therapy has a risk of toxicity, which can be acute or chronic. Acute toxicity manifests as neurological symptoms. Consumption of 2 g of INH can predispose a patient to acute toxicity; while chronic toxicity usually presents as hepatotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of isoniazid toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of INH toxicity.
- Describe the presentation of INH toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options for INH toxicity.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to identify patients affected by INH toxicity early and treat the condition rapidly.
