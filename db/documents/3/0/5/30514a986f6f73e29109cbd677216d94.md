An avulsion fracture is a failure of bone in which a bone fragment is pulled away from its main body by soft tissue that is attached to it.

Soft tissue attachments to bone can include ligaments, tendons, sub tendon sheaths, joint capsule, labrum, retinaculum, meniscus, or syndesmosis.

Avulsion fractures, as a topic, is very broad, with diverse mechanisms, clinical scenarios, presentations, and a wide range of appropriate management depending on where it occurs. They can represent small or large fractures.

Avulsion fractures often happen near joints due to large numbers of supporting osseous, tendinous, and capsuloligamentous structures in a relatively close anatomic space, or at apophyseal myotendinous attachment sites.

Some types of avulsion fractures are quite common, and many others are very rare, but may remain clinically significant.

These injuries are important to recognize because they are frequently associated with other concomitant soft tissue, or osteocartilaginous injuries, or can indicate joint instability.

Fracture patterns, along with information such as patient age, can provide information for the injury mechanism as well as predict stability and predict associated soft tissue injuries.

In general, these fractures can occur in adult, adolescent, or pediatric populations,Â with common characteristics specific to each anatomic location.
