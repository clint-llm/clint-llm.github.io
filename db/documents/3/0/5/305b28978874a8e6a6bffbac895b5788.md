Some patients will develop pains in their feet as they stand for long periods rather than sit. Medication side effects are relatively common and may require alternative drugs.

Side effects and complications from pudendal nerve blocks are rare. They include hematoma formation, pain or infection at the injection site, and neonatal anesthetic toxicity (exceedingly rare) when the nerve block is done for childbirth analgesia.

Pudendal nerve blocks may also produce side effects indirectly from the injected steroids, such as agitation and anxiety, as well as possibly elevated blood glucose in diabetics. Placement of the needle for injection may penetrate the nerve, a rare complication causing immediate pain, sacral neuropathy, or ischial region paresthesia that may last for up to six weeks or longer.

Intravascular infiltration of lidocaine and bupivacaine is rare. Initially, the patient may notice a metallic taste. A large bolus can cause significant cardiovascular problems, but this is exceedingly rare. Aspiration of the injection needle for evidence of blood is not an absolute uniform indicator of safety. Following the infiltration of medicines, transient exacerbation of pain may occur. One theory is that this is caused by cold (room temperature) injected drugs or local pressure from the volume of the injected bolus.

Surgical complications specific to pudendal decompression include injury to a small branch of the nerve. A microsurgical repair can be performed if necessary. An incomplete transaction of the sacrospinous ligament has been reported. Transection of the sacrotuberous ligament can occur, which results in the development of an unstable pelvis. (This can be avoided by using a midline vertical incision in the sacrotuberous ligament.)

Immediate, total pain relief after surgical decompression is unusual. Pain which slowly decreases over several months is common and should not be considered a surgical or procedural complication.
