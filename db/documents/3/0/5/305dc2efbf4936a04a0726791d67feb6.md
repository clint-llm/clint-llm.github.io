Radioactive gallium isotopes are inherently hazardous to one's health. Both healthcare staff and patients must be aware of the dangers and take reasonable precautions. The patient should be informed that the risk of radiation exposure is less than the scan's benefits and should understand why the scan is indicated. They should also understand others' risks when they emit radiation, especially to children, during lactation and pregnancy. The patient should be encouraged to ask questions about safety concerns.

Organs have different uptake of the isotope, and there are individual variations as well. For example, a patient post-splenectomy would have higher uptake in other organs. The average effective whole-body dose of 67Ga is 18.5mSv, while 68Ga-DOTATATE is 3.0mSv.
