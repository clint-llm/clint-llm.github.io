Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is common and is most often transmitted in childhood through direct physical contact. The most common infectious sites are oral mucosa (HSV-1) or genital mucosa (HSV-2). Rarely, the infection may be spread to the distal phalanx via direct inoculation and cause pain, swelling, erythema, and vesicles in an entity known as herpetic whitlow. This diagnosis is of particular importance given its close similarity on presentation to paronychia and its drastically differing treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of herpetic whitlow and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of herpetic whitlow.
- Review the presentation of herpetic whitlow.
- Outline the treatment of herpetic whitlow.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by herpetic whitlow.
