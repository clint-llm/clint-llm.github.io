The V-series nerve agents were first discovered in 1952 by scientists in the United Kingdom researching organophosphate esters as pesticides.

The five most well-known V-series nerve agents:

- VX.  O-Ethyl-S-[2(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate

- VE.  O-Ethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] ethylphosphonothioate

- VG.  O,O-Diethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] phosphorothioate

- VM.  O-Ethyl-S-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate

- VR.  N-diethyl-2-(methyl-(2-methylpropoxy)phosphoryl)sulfanylethanamine

VR is the compound from which Soviet newcomer agents (Novichok) Novichok 5 and Novichok 7, are derived.

V-series nerve agents are highly viscous and have low volatility; thus, they can persist in the environment and are difficult to wash away. They are oily liquids at room temperature. Some V-series agents can be deployed as binary agents, in which two non-toxic chemicals react together inside the weapon before deployment to form the chemical weapon. For example, isopropyl aminomethyl ethyl phosphorite and elemental sulfur react to form VX. V-series agents can be deployed as liquids or aerosols.
