Several evaluation/grading systems can detect progression and monitor ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. The Foster staging system is based on clinical signs whereas the Mondino and Brown system is based on an inferior fornix depth.

**Foster System**

- Stage 1 - includes subconjunctival scarring and fibrosis

- Stage 2 - includes fornix shortening

- Stage 3 - occurs when a symblepharon form

- Stage 4 - the formation of ankyloblepharon and keratinization of the ocular surface

**Mondino and Brown System**

- Stage 1Â - 0% to 25% loss (of inferior fornix depth)

- Stage 2 - 25% to 50% loss

- Stage 3 - 50% to 75% loss

- Stage 4 - 75% to 100% loss
