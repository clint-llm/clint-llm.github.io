Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a group of inherited genetic defects that lead to the severe elevation of serum cholesterol concentrations. Clinically familial hypercholesterolemia is diagnosed by a high serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and genetically is characterized into two subgroups: (1) autosomal dominant (AD), (2) codominant transmission with 90% or higher penetrance.
