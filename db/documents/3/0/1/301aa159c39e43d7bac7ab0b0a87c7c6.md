Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) is used to treat unilateral limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). It involves harvesting healthy limbal stem cells from a healthy eye for autologous implantation into the diseased eye to restore corneal transparency and prevent conjunctivalization. This activity describes the evaluation and etiology of LSCD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo SLET surgery and its complications.

**Objectives:**
- Review the LSCD disease process and theory behind simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET).
- Describe simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) and compare it with other LSCD treatments.
- Identify common complications of simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) and how to manage them.
- Explain the importance of communication among the health team workers for the appropriate selection of candidates for simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) and improvement of postoperative management.
