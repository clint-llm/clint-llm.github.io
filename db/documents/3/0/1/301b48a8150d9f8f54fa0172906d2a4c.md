The interaction of acetylcholinesterase with the substrate acetylcholine results in the breakdown, hydrolysis, and inactivation of acetylcholine and subsequent control of the amount of ACh at the synapse. AChE is a serine hydrolase that creates a tetrahedral intermediate through acid-base reactions with a catalytic triad (serine, histidine, acid residue).
