Management in the immediate postoperative period is similar to any other upper gastrointestinal surgery. The patient should remain NPO (nothing by mouth),Â have maintenance IV fluids, and have adequate analgesia. A nasogastric or nasoenteric tube is often necessary for decompression. The patient should be out of bed early and often, with chemical and mechanical deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, as appropriate. A diet is slowly progressed from a clear liquid diet to soft food and then to solid food. Any subsequent dietary modifications should take into account the specific clinical scenario, including the operation performed, with the involvement of a trained and experienced nutritionist, if available.
