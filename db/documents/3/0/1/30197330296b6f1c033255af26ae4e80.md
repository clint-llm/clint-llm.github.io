Studies on human skeletal muscles show that higher doses of propofol (10mcg/mL) can lead to microscopic changes affecting cell survival.  Mitochondrial membranes were affected, which caused a decrease in electron transport chain capacity.  Furthermore, propofol inhibited fatty acid oxidation, which may contribute to the lost spare electron transfer chain capacity.

Biopsies of skeletal muscle from patients with known PRIS reveal disorganized myofibrils and sarcomeres, as well as necrotic reactions.  Kidneys had myoglobin casts with acute tubular necrosis.  Cardiac histology showed myofibril degeneration with acute inflammation.

In animal models, histologic exams show a range of organ dysfunction.  The liver revealed focal liver cell necrosis and steatosis.  There was evidence of interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary edema in the lungs.  Skeletal muscle biopsies had signs of muscle necrosis and rhabdomyolysis.  Other findings included myocarditis, loss of urinary bladder epithelium, and cholangitis.
