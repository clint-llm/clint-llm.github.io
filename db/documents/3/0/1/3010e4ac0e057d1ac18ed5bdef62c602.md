An aneurysm is an abnormal dilatation or bulging in a blood vessel due to the intrinsic weakness of the vessel wall.****Aneurysms can affect any blood vessel, but they are most commonly seen in arteries rather than veins. An aneurysm can be a true aneurysm or a false aneurysm. A true aneurysm has all the three layers of the arterial wall (intima, media, and adventitia). A false aneurysm, also known as pseudoaneurysm, involves only the outer layer of the artery (adventitia). Depending on their shape, they can be saccular or fusiform. Cerebral aneurysms are 90% saccular aneurysms (also known as berry aneurysms), unlike aortic aneurysms, which are about 94% fusiform. Aneurysms can be classified based on their location in the body. Depending on the etiology, they can be dissecting or mycotic aneurysms.

This review will focus on saccular cerebral and aortic aneurysms. Saccular cerebral aneurysms can also be classified by size (small: 5 mm or less, medium: 6 to 14 mm, large: 15 to 25 mm, giant: greater than 25 mm).
