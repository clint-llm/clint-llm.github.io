Frey syndrome is a benign condition and tends not to progress once established. Asymptomatic patients are rarely treated and are studied only for academic purposes.

In children, spontaneous symptom regression occurs in 69% of unilateral presentations. The bilateral form is usually unrelated to postnatal trauma and resolves during the first year of life in 58% of patients.
