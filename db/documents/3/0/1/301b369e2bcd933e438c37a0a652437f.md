Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a condition in which genetic mutations result in abnormal bile secretion and/or production. Though uncommon, this is a serious condition that, in many cases, leads to significant morbidity and mortality. In order to prevent the disease process from progressing rapidly, this condition should be addressed and diagnosed appropriately. This activity will address the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of patients diagnosed with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.
- Review the pathophysiology and 3 main variants of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis and improve outcomes.
