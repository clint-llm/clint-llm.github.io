IPMNs can come to clinical attention in a variety of different ways. They can be asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging. However; when symptoms are present, they are usually nonspecific including abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and weight loss. They can also present with jaundice caused by obstruction of the bile ducts due to external compression or invasion or pancreatitis-like symptoms due to obstruction of the main pancreatic duct by mucin.
