Physiological infant head lag has a benign presentation, and watchful waiting is most times sufficient, as most of the cases will resolve before the age of four months (and four months corrected gestational age in preterm infants) without any intervention. However, an interdisciplinary approach is required to assess and manage pathological head lag (i.e., persistent head lag after four months or severe head lag before four months of age) while addressing the underlying etiology.Â A pediatrician, child neurologist, medical geneticist, a physical and occupational therapist can work together to accomplish optimal results.

Systematic reviews have demonstrated that early intervention, through specific motor training routines and global developmental programs where parents are taught how to promote infant development, maybe the most reliable approach to promoting infant motor and cognitive development for groups at risk of developmental motor disorder.
