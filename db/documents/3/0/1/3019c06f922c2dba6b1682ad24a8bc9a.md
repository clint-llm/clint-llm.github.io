While the incidence of isolated mediastinal trauma is unknown, chest trauma is the third most common type of trauma in the United States after head and extremity trauma. About 25% of traumatic deaths in the United States are related to thoracic injuries. The incidence of penetrating thoracic trauma varies greatly by geographic distribution. In Europe, for example, the incidence of thoracic trauma is estimated as low as 4%; however, in war-ridden regions, up to 95% of military deaths may be from penetrating thoracic trauma. In the United States, thoracic gunshot wounds make up about 10% of major traumas, while stab wounds to the thorax make up about 9.5%.
