As mentioned above, preterm labor is diagnosed primarily by history, symptoms, and physical exam. Pertinent history regarding past and present obstetrical complications can be informative. If an early gestational age ultrasound is not available, fetal biometry should be performed. Maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, assessment of uterine contractions, frequency, duration, and intensity are very important in the assessment of a patient in labor

A physical exam is done to assess firmness, abdominal tenderness, fetal size, and position. The cervical exam can identify asymptomatic cervical dilatation and effacement. Symptoms of preterm labor include regular contractions before term gestational age associated with cervical change, pelvic pressure, menstrual like cramps, watery vaginal discharge, and lower back pain. Although lower back pain is present in normal pregnancy as well, if occurring before term, it has an established association with impending preterm labor.

If cervical dilatation is noted to be at least 2 or 3 cm at less than 34 weeks, then the patient is highly likely to deliver preterm. Another indicator is short cervix as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound. Normal cervical length is 35-48 mm. The definition of a short cervix is cervical length <25mm at 16-24 weeks of gestation. Of note, a transvaginal ultrasound can help to distinguish cervical effacement due to cervical insufficiency versus due to active labor.
