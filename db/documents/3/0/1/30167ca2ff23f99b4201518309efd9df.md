In 1907, an osteopathic researcher named Louisa Burns observed that "a very important, if not the only, pathway of viscerosensory impulses enters the spinal cord through its posterior roots."

The result was an explanation of the phenomenon that would later be known as somatic dysfunction. Somatic dysfunction is defined as "impaired or altered function of related components of the somatic (body framework) system: skeletal, arthrodial, and myofascial structures, and related vascular, lymphatic, and neural elements."**T**issue texture changes;**A**symmetry;**R**estriction of motion;**T**enderness (primarily used for specific osteopathic manipulative techniques, namely counterstrain). These criteria are commonly referred to as "TART changes".

One or more of the criteria are required to diagnose somatic dysfunction.
