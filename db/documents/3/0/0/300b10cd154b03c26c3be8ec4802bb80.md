The formation of sesamoid bones is attributed to the body's natural growth and various stressors imposed on the body. Starting as cartilaginous nodules, most sesamoid bones undergo further endochondral ossification during the prepubertal years. Further calcification is evident during puberty, with sesamoid bones appearing much earlier in females. A lack of sesamoid bone formation often indicates a delay in puberty and can be useful in monitoring the progression of puberty. While most sesamoid bones seemingly develop in response to various stress factors, the patella is present in all humans. Its development plays a crucial role in the form and function of the lower extremities allowing for the study of sesamoid bone development.

The patella is unique in its relatively larger size and stable presence in humans compared to other sesamoid bones. Development of the patella starts during the first trimester of gestation after the chondrification of the femur and tibia, with the early patella visible as a continuous band of fibrous tissue. As the patella develops inside the band of fibrous tissue, the embryological patella becomes chondrified and inserts into the quadriceps by the 9th week of gestation.

As the embryo reaches 14 weeks of gestation, the patella is wholly cartilaginous and resembles the adult patella structure by 23 weeks of gestation. The patella continues its rapid growth rate until the end of the 2nd trimester, and then it grows at a similar rate as the rest of the growing fetus.
