There are two primary coronary arteries, the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left main coronary artery (LMCA). Both of these originate from the root of the aorta. The RCA emerges from the anterior ascending aorta and supplies blood primarily to the right atrium, right ventricle. The sinoatrial nodal artery is a branch of the RCA that supplies the SA node. The RCA also supplies the AV node via a septal perforating branch in 90% of people.
