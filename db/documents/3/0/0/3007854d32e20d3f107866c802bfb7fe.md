For patients usingÂ triamterene, it is essential to monitor specific labs and blood pressure of patients taking this drug in either its sole or combination form with HCTZ. BUN/creatinine, blood pressure, urine output, serum uric acid, CBC, and electrolytes, in particular serum potassium, should be monitored at a baseline when first placed on the drug. Once findings indicate establishing a stable tolerance of the drug, it can be periodically monitored, specifically when dose changes are made and during illnesses.
