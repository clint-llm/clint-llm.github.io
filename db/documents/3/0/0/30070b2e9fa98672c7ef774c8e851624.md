Blake’s pouch is an inferior protrusion of the fourth ventricle, resulting from a finger-like expansion of the posterior membranous area.

The timing of when this permeabilization occurs has not yet been established with certainty. The mega cisterna magna is hypothesized to develop embryologically from the permeabilization of Blake’s pouch, allowing for the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle inferiorly with the peri-medullary subarachnoid spaces and superiorly through the foramen of Magendie.

Formation of the cisterna magna is completed within the leptomeninges at the end of the 7th  gestational week. Anatomically, the cisterna magna occupies the vallecula cerebelli, a depression between the medial aspect of the cerebellar tonsils and the inferior surface of the vermis.

The cisterna magna extends anteriorly to the foramen of Magendie and inferiorly to the first cervical level. The cisterna magna is limited posteriorly by an arachnoid membrane and inferiorly from the posteroinferior surface of the cerebellum at the level of the vermian pyramid to the upper cervical spinal cord. The posterior aspect of the cisterna magna is separated by the falx cerebelli.
