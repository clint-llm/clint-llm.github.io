A neck dissection is generally indicated for any clinically positive nodal disease or advanced tumor stage in node-negative disease (T3-T4).

Radical neck dissection is reserved only for clinically positive resectable neck disease involving the SCM, IJV, and CN XI.

Selective neck dissection and modified radical neck dissection (MRND) are the gold standard for clinically positive, resectable neck disease. Selective neck dissection is frequently performed for clinically and radiographically node-negative disease with a high T-stage (T3-T4). In patients with clinically negative necks and tumors that place them at high risk of cervical metastasis (greater than 20%), a selective neck dissection is performed of the appropriate nodal basins based on the tumor’s location.

or a neck dissection to fall into the MRND classification, levels I-V must be removed, and at least one of the following structures must be preserved: spinal accessory nerve, sternocleidomastoid muscle, and internal jugular vein. Modified radical neck dissections are classified as type I, II, or III based on which structures are saved. In a type, I MRND CN XI is spared. In type II, MRND CN XI and the IJV are spared. In type III MRND CN XI, the IJV and the SCM are all spared.
