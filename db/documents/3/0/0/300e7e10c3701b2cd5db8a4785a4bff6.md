As a standard protocol for managing serious bacterial infections, there should be an administration of initial empiric therapy pending culture results; this should consist of intravenous broad second/third-generation cephalosporin or a penicillinase-stable beta-lactam antibiotic. Once K. kingae is isolated, the regimen should be changed to parenteral ampicillin if there are no beta-lactamase-producing strains or ampicillin/sulbactam if beta-lactamase-producing strains are present. Other cephalosporins like Ccefuroxime and ceftriaxone are also options.

Septic Arthritis: Current recommendation is 2 to 3 weeks of sequential intravenous-oral antibiotics.

Osteomyelitis: Traditional treatment is from 3 weeks to 6 months.

Spondylodiscitis: Conventional antibiotic therapy is for 3 to 12 weeks

Nowadays, current recommendations for the management of osteoarticular infections include shorter duration of antibiotic therapy, early switch to oral medications, and the use of serum CRP levels for monitoring clinical response. Generally, a good clinical response and a fall of serum CRP to less than 20mg/l are indications for switching to oral antibiotics and may as well guide on deciding when treatment should cease. Most infections respond to antibiotic therapy without the need for repeated aspirations or surgical washout.
