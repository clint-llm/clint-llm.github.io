Prognosis is good provided preventive precautions be taken. Hyperhidrosis is a predisposing factor for tinea infections. Because the disease often starts on the feet, the patient should be advised to dry the toes thoroughly after bathing. Dryness of the parts is essential if reinfection is to be avoided. The use of a good antiseptic powder on the feet after bathing, particularly between the toes, is strongly advised for keeping the part dry in susceptible persons. Tolnaftate or clotrimazole powder is an excellent dusting powder for the feet. Plain talc may be dusted onto socks and shoes to keep the feet dry. Periodic use of a topical antifungal agent may be required, especially when hot occlusive footwear is worn.
