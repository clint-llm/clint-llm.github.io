Digoxin toxicity can present in many ways and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, emergency department physician, poison control, internist and a nephrologist. Because digoxin toxicity can result in life threatening arrhythmias, prompt monitoring and treatment are vital. The key is patient education about drug safety. Parents should store the drug in a locked cabinet away from the reach of children. in addition, any old pills should be returned back to the pharmacist. When treated promptly, the outcomes are good, but any delay in treatment can lead to death.
