The clinical presentation may vary depending on whether a patient presents with primary or secondary pneumatosis intestinalis. Primary or benign causes usually result in mild abdominal symptoms. There are reported cases where patients with primary PI presented without symptoms. However, patients with secondary pneumatosis intestinalis may present with life-threatening peritoneal symptoms, similar to that of intestinal ischemia and peritonitis. Other symptoms of secondary PI include hematochezia, tenesmus, constipation, and abdominal pain. Approximately 3% of patients presenting with PI also reported complications such as pneumoperitoneum, intestinal ischemia, and obstruction. History of abdominal laparotomy and endoscopy can be common in patients as procedures leading to mucosal disruption, causing an increase in intraluminal pressure can lead to pneumatosis intestinalis. There are also many diseases and conditions in a patient’s history that are known to be associated with PI (via the three mechanisms), including but not limited to:

- Pulmonary disease - Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema

- Autoimmune - Lupus variants, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, polyarteritis nodosa, celiac sprue

- Drug-induced - Glucosidase inhibitors, corticosteroids

- Gastrointestinal - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diverticulitis, colitis, Clostridium difficile infection, appendicitis, carcinoma, peptic ulcer, perforation, necrotizing enterocolitis (pediatric)

- Infectious - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), mycobacterium tuberculosis, 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

- Iatrogenic - Blunt abdominal trauma, endoscopy, post-surgical intestinal anastomosis, barium enema, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation
