The inferior alveolar arteries are responsible for the direct perfusion of the lower jaw and the lower jaw's structures. The branches that arise from the inferior alveolar artery will travel with the corresponding nerve to perfuse the same structure as the nerve innervation. The inferior alveolar artery is the main blood supply to the mandible bone. The perfusion territory of the inferior alveolar artery includes the lower jaw gingivae and teeth. The branches of the inferior alveolar artery perfuse regions, including the chin, neck, and lower lip.

The lymphatic drainage of the inferior alveolar artery and its perfusion territory will drain toward the submental and submandibular lymph nodes. The lymph fluid in these lymph nodes will eventually drain into the central circulation via the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct will drain lymph from the left side of the face and neck while the right lymphatic duct will drain the lymph from the right side of the face and neck.
