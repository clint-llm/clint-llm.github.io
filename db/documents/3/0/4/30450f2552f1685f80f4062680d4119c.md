Empyema of the gallbladder is the most severe complication of acute cholecystitis. It is usually the result of the progression of acute cholecystitis in a background of bile stasis and cystic duct obstruction. This is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics and urgent aspiration/removal of the gallbladder to reduce the risk of septic shock. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of gallbladder empyemas and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing gallbladder empyema.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with gallbladder empyema.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with gallbladder empyema.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by gallbladder empyema.
