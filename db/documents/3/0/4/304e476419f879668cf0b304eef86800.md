Deficiency of the pyridoxal-dependant mitochondrial enzyme OAT, which normally metabolizes the amino acid ornithine into pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid, leads to accumulation of ornithine in the plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and aqueous humor of patients with GA which is thought to result in the manifestations of the condition possibly due to the toxic effects of hyperornithinemia, especially on the retinal pigment epithelial cells, leading to progressive chorioretinal atrophy.

Other biochemical findings associated with GA includeÂ excessive excretion of lysine and cystine in the urine with a decrease in the plasma levels of lysine, ammonia, glutamine, and creatine.
