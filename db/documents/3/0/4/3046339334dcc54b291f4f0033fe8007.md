Complications include a decline in renal function, leading to chronic kidney disease with a potential to lead to end-stage renal disease. Renal atrophy, hypertension, or extension of thrombus/embolism may occur. Left-sided renal vein thrombosis may cause pelvic congestion syndrome in females and swelling of left testis or varicocele in males. RVT after renal transplant usually occurs early after the surgery and has a reported prevalence of 0.1% to 4.2% and ultimately leads to loss of graft in almost all cases.
