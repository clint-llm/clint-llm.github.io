The drug has virtually no extracardiac pharmacological effects.

Torsades de pointes occurred in 1% to 3% of patients in clinical trials where strict exclusion criteria (e.g., hypokalemia) were applied, and continuous ECG monitoring was used to detect marked QT prolongation in the hospital.

Dofetilide may induce or worsen ventricular dysrhythmias with therapeutic use, producing life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Patients with a history of torsade de pointes, prolonged QTc (greater than 440 milliseconds), hypomagnesemia, or serum potassium below 4.0 mEq/L show an increased risk of developing ventricular dysrhythmias. Other potential adverse effects of dofetilide administration include chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and fatigue.

Overdose experience is limited. Effects reported include QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, and complete heart block. The most common side effects are headaches, chest pain, and dizziness.

**Adverse Reactions Severe**

- Shortness of breath

- Nausea

- Flu-like symptoms

- Stomach pain

- Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep

**Pregnancy**

Dofetilide is classified as FDA pregnancy category C under the recently replaced system. Therefore, pregnant patients should not receive dofetilide.

**Drug Interactions**

Approximately 80% of a single dose of dofetilide gets excreted in the urine, of which approximately 80% is excreted as unchanged dofetilide, with the remaining 20% consisting of inactive or minimally active metabolites. Renal elimination involves both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion (via the cation transport system, a process that can be inhibited by cimetidine, trimethoprim, prochlorperazine, megestrol, ketoconazole, and dolutegravir). In vitro studies with the human liver microsomes show that CYP3A4 can metabolize dofetilide, but it has a low affinity for this isoenzyme. N-dealkylation and N-oxidation form metabolites.

The following list of drugs are known to have significant interactions with dofetilide by inhibiting renal elimination:

- Cimetidine

- Verapamil

-  Ketoconazole

- Trimethoprim alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole

- Prochlorperazine

- Megestrol

- Dolutegravir

- Hydrochlorothiazide alone or in combination with other medicines
