Besides the thorough history and physical exam, urinalysis for the evaluation of proteinuria and hematuria is important. Up to 80% of patients with MN present with nephrotic range proteinuria with preserved renal function. RBC castsÂ are rare but microscopic hematuria is common (up to 40%). Laboratory and radiographic evaluation should be performed to rule out secondary causes which include but not limited to checking HIV, Hepatitis panel, ANA, Anti-DS DNA, ANCA, RF, C3, C4, and serum cholesterol levels. Despite the evidence of complement activation at the GBM level, serum complements are within normal limits. Anti-PLA2R antibody and anti-THSD7A antibody assay can be performed for presumed primary MN. Imaging includes a chest x-ray, renal venous dopplers, and possible renal biopsy for unexplained proteinuria. Age-related cancer screening should be performed in every patient suspected of MN.
