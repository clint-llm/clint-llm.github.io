An infectious disease consult may help evaluate and manage fever in an ICU patient, especially when it is persistent, even after appropriate management. Fever with an unknown etiology with non-resolving sepsis/septic shock could be challenging and require urgent multidisciplinary interaction and aggressive evaluation.Â Constant interaction with the radiology team may provide an early clue for diagnosis, ensuring early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Pulmonologists, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, and surgeons are a few other specialists required based on the suspected etiology of fever.
