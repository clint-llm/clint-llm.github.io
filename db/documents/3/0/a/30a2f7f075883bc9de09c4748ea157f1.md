Bacterial diarrhea is part of the differential diagnosis for systemic illness with acute onset of diarrhea, including the following:

- Viral systemic diseases including viral gastroenteritis, or multi-system viral infections including adenovirus, and influenza merit consideration.

- Protozoal diarrhea, such as Giardia or Cryptosporidium, can also present similarly. In endemic areas, consideration of arboviral syndromes or malaria may also be necessary.

Non-infectious causes should also be excluded, such as

- inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

- malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease, Whipple's disease),

- cystic fibrosis,

- carcinoid tumor,

- lactose intolerance,

- hyperthyroidism, and

- antibiotic-induced diarrhea
