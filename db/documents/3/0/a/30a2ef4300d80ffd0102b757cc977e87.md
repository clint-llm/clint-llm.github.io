PAD affects a large percentage of the population worldwide and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity rates. Its most severe form, Critical limb ischemia, presents as ischemic rest pain for greater than two weeks in duration. Lower extremity PAD is a common complication of systemic atherosclerosis in the elderly. This population has a 2 to a 4-fold higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary artery disease. Early identification allows PAD treatment and modification of risk factors to decrease the risks associated with cardiovascular disease.

Duplex ultrasound is a readily available and non-invasive method of arterial visualization in the lower extremity.
