A provider should not assume a pediatric ankle injury is simply a ligamentous sprain. The ligamentous stabilizers of the ankle are stronger than the physis making physeal fracture much more common.Â For appropriately aged patients, scrutinize orthogonal radiographic views in patients with apparent distal tibia Salter-Harris II or III fractures to avoid missing a more significant Salter-Harris IV triplane ankle fracture.
