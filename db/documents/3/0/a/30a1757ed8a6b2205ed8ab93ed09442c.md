Amoxicillin is one of the most commonly used antibiotics in the primary care setting. It is an amino-penicillin, created by adding an extra amino group to penicillin to battle antibiotic resistance. Amoxicillin covers a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, with some added gram-negative coverage compared to penicillin. Like penicillin, it covers most Streptococcus species and has improved coverage of Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus spp. It also has coverage over Haemophilus influenzae, some Escherichia coli, Actinomyces spp., Clostridium species, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Corynebacteria species. This activity covers amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antimicrobial that interprofessional team members need to review its indications, coverage, contraindications, and adverse event profile to manage patients with infectious disease optimally.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for initiating amoxicillin as an anti-infective strategy for patient care.
- Identify the mechanism of action of amoxicillin and its target coverage.
- Summarize the adverse effects of amoxicillin.
- Explain the importance of antimicrobial stewardship and how it affects antimicrobial selection to improve care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating amoxicillin antimicrobial therapy.
