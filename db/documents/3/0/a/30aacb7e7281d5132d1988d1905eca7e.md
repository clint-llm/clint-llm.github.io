Knowing the innervation of celiac ganglia postganglionic axons, physicians can use neurolytic blocks to provide relief in a variety of intestinal, pancreatic, and liver-related pathologies. Patients who suffer from refractory visceral pain may benefit from chemo denervation or selective surgical block of celiac ganglion that supplies visceral structures.

One such cause of refractory visceral pain is advanced pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis. Abdominal pain due to pancreatic cancers involves cancer cells invading nerves both in and out of the pancreas, triggering nociceptive fibers in the pancreas. Because afferent neurons from the pancreas connect with the celiac ganglia, blocking the ganglia results in the lack of transmission of the signal from the ganglia to the dorsal root ganglia at the T12 to L1 spinal level.

Another cause of visceral abdominal pain, as well as intractable nausea and vomiting, is gastroparesis due to chronic diabetes. Because the celiac ganglia decrease bowel motility, neurolysis of celiac ganglia can increase GI motility as well as reduce the pain associated with severe cases of gastroparesis.

Celiac axis compression syndrome (also known as median arcuate ligament syndrome) presents with a triad of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and an occasional abdominal bruit.
