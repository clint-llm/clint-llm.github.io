Afferent pain fibers for the fallopian tubes travel along the same pathway as sympathetic efferent innervation, which originates from T11, T12, and L1. By contrast, minor parasympathetic innervation is shared between vagal fibers of the ovarian plexus for the lateral part of the fallopian tube and medially from the pelvic splanchnic nerve from S1, S2, and S3. The most medial isthmus receives the densest innervation, and both innervation and musculature become sparser from proximal to theÂ distal fallopian tube.
