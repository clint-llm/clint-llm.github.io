Less than 50% of patients who have gallstones will develop symptoms. Today, the mortality rate following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is less than 1%; however, emergency cholecystectomy rates are 10% or greater. Other complications include retained stones in the bile duct, incisional hernia, and chronic right upper quadrant pain. Despite the fact that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now the standard of care for symptomatic gallstones, the rates of injury to the bile duct during surgery continue to increase.
