Chronic lymphocytic leukemia staging uses two stratification systems: Binet staging, primarily used in Europe, and the modified Rai-Sawitsky staging, primarily used in the United States. Both systems, as illustrated below, use a complete blood count and physical exam findings to stratify the patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups.

**Modified Rai Clinical Staging System for CLL**

- 
**Low Risk:**

- 
              
- Stage 0: Lymphocytosis in peripheral blood or bone marrow.

- 
**Intermediate Risk:**

- 
              
- Stage I: Lymphocytosis plus lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes).
              
              
- Stage II: Lymphocytosis plus hepatomegaly or splenomegaly with or without lymphadenopathy.

- 
**High Risk:**

- 
              
- Stage III: Lymphadenopathy plus anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dL) plus organomegaly (spleen or liver) with or without lymphadenopathy. 
              
              
- Stage IV: Lymphadenopathy plus thrombocytopenia (platelet <100,000/MCL) with or without organomegaly (spleen or liver) or lymphadenopathy.

**Binet Staging System for CLL**

- 
**Low Risk**

- 
              
- Stage A: ≤ 2 involved sites of lymphoid enlargement* with no anemia or thrombocytopenia.

- 
**Intermediate Risk**

- 
              
- Stage B: ≥ 3 lymphoid enlargement involved sites* with no anemia or thrombocytopenia.

- 
**High Risk**

- 
              
- Stage C: Same lymphoid enlargement as stage A or B, but with the presence of anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet < 100,000/mcL).

*****Lymphoid-bearing sites: Cervical lymph nodes, axillary lymph nodes, inguinal-femoral lymph nodes, liver, and spleen
