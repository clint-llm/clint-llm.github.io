Elbow trauma in the young adult usually occur in the setting of sports and following either an acute avulsion injury, ligamentous injury, or insidiously and progressively with chronic repetitive trauma. Weight lifters often sustain sprains and strains injury to the elbow, accounting for 2.6% of all bodily sprains and strains.

**Pediatric considerations**

The epidemiology of elbow trauma in children is interesting due to a trend toward earlier physical fusion in girls compared to boys. In girls, most physical fractures occur at the ages of 9mto 12 and 12 to 15 years in boys. The boy-to-girl ratio for the incidence of physical fractures when examined for specific ages varied from 1 to 1 in children 11 years old or younger and 7 to 1 in children older than 11 years.
