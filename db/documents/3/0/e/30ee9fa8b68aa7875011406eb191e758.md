Although nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography are considered safe diagnostic procedures, there are a few precautions and safety measures that should be addressed prior to their performance. It is imperative to review patientsâ€™ medication lists, as taking an anticoagulant is classified as a relative contraindication to performing needle electromyography.

If a patient has an uncontrolled bleeding disorder, however, needle electromyography is contraindicated. Needle electromyography should also be avoided in areas of active skin infections such as cellulitis and should also be avoided in limbs that present with lymphedema as it can act as a nidus for infection.
