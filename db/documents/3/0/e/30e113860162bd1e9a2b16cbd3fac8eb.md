Current treatment modalities for medulloblastoma combine surgical resection with chemotherapy and radiation. By traditional risk stratification, cure rates in the average-risk group reached three-quarters of patients. However, post-surgical treatment-related neurologic, cognitive, and endocrinologic sequelae, including intellectual retardation and growth hormone deficiency, remain a source of morbidity in up to 80% of survivors. The high-risk group experienced up to 50% mortality due not only to the presence of extraneural metastases at diagnosis but also due to their young age at diagnosis, which poses significant limitations to their therapeutic options, namely lower doses of radiation and chemotherapeutic agents.

Newer subgroup classification systems have facilitated the development of more targeted therapeutics aimed at disrupting signal transduction pathways critical to phenotypic transformation. These are currently under clinical investigation:

SHH Subgroup

The SHH pathway is activated by the binding of Sonic Hedgehog to its receptor Patched 1 (PTCH1), which activates downstream signaling via a key mediator Smoothened (SMO). The most widely studied targeted therapeutic agents today are SMO inhibitors, i.e., cyclopamine, HhAntag, vismodegib, saridegib, and sonidegib.

WNT Subgroup

The key step in WNT signal transduction leading to malignant transformation is a lack of degradation of beta-catenin due to mutations at key amino acid residues that are normally destined for phosphorylation. Hence, new drugs have been developed to target steps in downstream signaling by beta-catenin. These include naturally-occurring protein phosphatase inhibitors, cantharidin, norcantharidin, and ginkgetin.

Non-SHH/WNT Subgroup

Unfortunately, not much is known about the signaling pathways implicated in non-SHH/WNT subgroupÂ medulloblastoma. As a result, targeted therapeutics have yet to be developed for this type of medulloblastoma. Promising strategies currently under investigation include myc inhibition, cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.
