The parathyroid glands contain two main cell types, chief cells, and oxyphil cells.

**Chief Cells**

The chief cells are the functional cells of the parathyroid gland, responsible for both synthesizing and secreting parathyroid hormone. Regulation of PTH production and release is dependent on serum calcium levels. The G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), on the surface of chief cells responds to low serum calcium and activates translation and secretion of PTH.

**Oxyphil Cells**

Also known as oxyntic cells, these cells have no recognized endocrine function. The proportion of oxyphil cells in the parathyroid glands increases with age.
