There is no gold standard for diagnosis. All patients who develop hoarseness after extubation must be evaluated with a flexible fiberoptic laryngeal examination, videostroboscopy, and computed tomography, focusing on the position and mobility of the vocal fold and arytenoid cartilage as well as traumatic injury to the larynx.

Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy can reveal the arytenoid displacement or dislocation with or without glottic edema. Videostroboscopy allows better visualization of any discrepancy in the lengths of the vocal cord and height of the vocal processes during phonation.  It helps to differentiate cricoarytenoid subluxation from vocal cord palsy.

Computed tomography with thin-section and multiplanar reformation will reveal disparities in the height of the vocal cords, a unique finding for arytenoid dislocation. Still, its value is limited in young patients, as the cartilage may not yet be ossified.

Laryngeal electromyography may help distinguish between cricoarytenoid joint subluxation and vocal palsy. A dislocated arytenoid cartilage would most probably show normal EMG patterns, while in the case of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, the EMG pattern will be abnormal. However, both dislocation/subluxation and hematoma can occur with recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis and can lead to misdiagnosis.

The most accurate diagnosis seems to be obtained by the combination of history and physical, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, laryngeal CT, and electromyography.
