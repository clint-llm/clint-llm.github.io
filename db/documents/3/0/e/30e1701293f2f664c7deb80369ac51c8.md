TACE can be divided into 2 major categories of chemotherapy delivery:

- TACE with drug-eluting embolization particles, and

- TACE in which the active chemotherapy drug and the embolization particles are separate agents (i.e., conventional).

Conventional TACE (cTACE) is a mixture of three agents: lipiodol contrast agent, a chemotherapy drug, and an embolization agent. TACE using drug-eluting beads (TACE-DEB or DEB-TACE) uses resin beads that slowly release chemotherapy. Currently, only two chemotherapy drugs are FDA-approved for use in this manner. Doxorubicin is used to treat hypervascular primary hepatic tumors and metastases. Irinotecan is used to treat metastases from colorectal cancer. While TACE with drug-eluting beads has similar efficacy and fewer side effcts compared to conventional TACE, the use of bland embolization is controversial.
