The mammillary bodies and circuits associated with the mammillary bodies (e.g., limbic structures) influence many higher-order functions. Researchers have hypothesized that stimulation of the Papez circuit may have beneficial effects on memory and attention as well as decreasing the incidence of depression in individuals with dementia. In animal models, deep brain stimulation of the hippocampus shows increased memory function with no signs of anxiety. Researchers attributed these results to increased activation of the cingulate gyrus through the hippocampus-mammillary tract, mammillothalamic tract, and thalamic projections to the cingulate gyrus (the brain location where emotion is perceived).

Deep brain stimulation has been a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia.
