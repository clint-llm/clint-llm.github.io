First introduced into the market in the early 1990s, nevirapine is an FDA-approved medication and plays a role in treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in patients, particularly HIV-1. Classified as an NNRTI or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, this medication is utilized in conjunction with other antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications. When prescribed, nevirapine is a component in combination therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) such as zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, etc. The rationale behind administering more than one medication is to decrease the chances of the virus developing a resistance to the treatment and making it ineffective.

Outside of its primary use as a medication to treat HIV, recent studies have also found that nevirapine may be able to function as a medication for diseases other than those for which it was initially intended. One such example of this is in the case of thyroid cancer. In a recently conducted experimental study, thyroid cancer cells of a human differentiated cell line received treatment with nevirapine, and the results showed that post-treatment, there was significant repression of both cell migration and invasion.
