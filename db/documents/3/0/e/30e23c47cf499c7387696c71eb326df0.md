Cervical dislocation patients may be directed by their clinician to see a physical therapist who will design an individualized cervical spine rehabilitation program. The physical therapist will evaluate the patient's condition to determine to optimal approach to ease pain and improve cervical mobility. The patient will also require counsel regarding the care of their cervical spine to avoid pain and prevent further injury. The patient is an integral player in their own recovery. At-home use of ice, heat, stretching and strengthening exercise, and posture training reduces stress to the affected area and helps prevent future recurrence.
