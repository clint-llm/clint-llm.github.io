The surgeon must assess a patient thoroughly before performing an extraction. At a minimum, the surgeon must do a history, clinical, and imaging evaluation. When presenting a surgical plan, the surgeon must inform patients about risks, benefits, and alternatives to proposed plans to make an informed decision. Obtain written consent as a patient decides to proceed with a planned procedure. The consent must be re-verified on the day of surgery.

The surgeon must have a radiographic image of the surgical site, and the radiograph must include important structures and anatomical landmarks related to the extraction. If indicated, CBCT should be obtained to support the assessment.
