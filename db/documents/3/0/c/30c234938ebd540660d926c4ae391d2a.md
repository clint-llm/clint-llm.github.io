Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is usually a sporadic disorder; however, autosomal dominant modes of inheritance are reported, specifically with a locus found on chromosome 9p. (also known as TIE2), which encodes TEK receptor tyrosine kinase. In contrast to common unifocal venous malformation, multifocal malformations are associated with two somatic activating mutations on the same allele (double [cis] mutations).
