The identification of inducible systems, playing an important role in mediating anti-microbial resistance, opens doors for the development of newer anti-microbial therapy.Â  Understanding the molecular basis of sensing and responding to antibiotics in these operons, including the molecular process of induction, can help develop potential antimicrobials that target these induction mechanisms and have non-inducing properties.

In recent years, the concept of an inducible system has been extended to mammalian cells to develop tools that aid in studying gene expression and their regulation. Allolactose and IPTG have been exploited to induce the expression of target genes to study their function and roles in various disease processes. Gene regulation using these inducible systems can aid in developing cancer therapy and the treatment of various genetic disorders.

Man's manipulation of operons is a major step in the process of enabling bacterial cells to produce medically important proteins such as human insulin.
