The goal of Post-Isometric Relaxation is to relax and lengthen a hypertonic muscle causing restriction of motion and pain.  The force that is generated by the patient towards the “freedom” or “direction of ease” is met with an equal and opposite counterforce from the physician resulting in an isometric contraction of the agonist muscle causing restriction at a given vertebral segment. Physiologically, this activates the tension-sensitive Golgi tendon organs (GTO) of the hypertonic muscle’s tendon through sustained, controlled tension. Group Ib afferent neurons relay this sensory information from GTOs to synapse with inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord at the respective level of the muscle and produce a reflex relaxation of the targeted agonist muscle.

Reciprocal inhibition relies on a different mechanism, but like Post-Isometric Relaxation also aims to lengthen a hypertonic muscle and relieve restriction. This technique requires the relay of sensory information gathered by muscle spindles and functions to inhibit or relax antagonistic muscle groups during sustained contraction of a given muscle.
