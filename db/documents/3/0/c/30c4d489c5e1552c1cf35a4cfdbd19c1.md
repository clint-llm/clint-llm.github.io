Female athletes often complain of low energy availability, which is defined as energy from oral nutrition less energy used for exercise. As such, low energy may result (whether intentionally or unintentionally) from more energy expenditure, less oral nourishment, or both. A chronic energy deficit can occur in the female athlete with musculoskeletal and reproductive dysfunction. Low energy (with or without an eating disorder) in combination with a menstrual disorder and altered mineral bone density is known as the female athlete triad. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of the female athlete triad and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of female athlete triad.
- Review the work up of a female athlete triad.
- Summarize the treatment of a female athlete triad.

- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by female athlete triad.
