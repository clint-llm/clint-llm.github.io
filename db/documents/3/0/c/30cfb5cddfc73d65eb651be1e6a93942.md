The approach toward a child suffering from the Peters anomaly has to be extensive and collaborative. Early identification of this condition first by the treating pediatrician followed by prompt treatment by an ophthalmologist is required. Other associated systemic conditions such as developmental delay, seizure disorder, central nervous system malformations, craniofacial abnormalities like cleft lip, cardiac malformation, and skeletal deformities need interprofessional coordination among the various specialists, including an endocrinologist, cardiologists, pediatric surgeons, plastic surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and a neurologist.

An interprofessional team approach is warranted to manage this condition, starting from early detection by the pediatrician and motivation for seeking advice from an ophthalmologist to prevent visual morbidity. It also involves validation of proper medication dosage and screening for drug interactions by the pharmacist, along with monitoring of vital signs, and parental education by the nurses. Visual evaluation by the optometrist is needed.

Subsequent counseling and education of the parents about various treatment options available for treating this condition by the ophthalmologist is crucial. Genetic counseling and evaluation play a vital role in managing patients with the Peters anomaly. Hence, this interprofessional teamwork plays a crucial role in the successful treatment of such newborns to improve the final outcome.
