Renin secretion is by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys and catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (ATI) in the liver. ATIÂ is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and other non-ACE pathways.

ATII is the principal vasoactive peptide in the RAAS and acts on two receptors, AT1 and AT2. ATII activation of AT1 receptors causes increased blood pressure due to contraction of vascular smooth muscle, increased systemic vascular resistance, increased sympathetic activity, sodium (Na), and water retention due to increased Na reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule.

RAAS system blockade can take place at several levels. RAAS-blockers include direct renin inhibitors (DRIs), which block the production of renin, ACEIs block conversion of AT1 to AT2 by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, ARBs antagonize the effect of AII on AT1 receptors, and aldosterone antagonists block the effect of aldosterone.
