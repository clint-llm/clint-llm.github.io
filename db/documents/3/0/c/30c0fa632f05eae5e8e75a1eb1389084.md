Group A streptococci are ubiquitous bacteria found as normal skin flora and in the environment around us. Streptococcus pyogenes grows easily on blood agar. When incubated at 35 to 37 C, they produce smooth or moist greyish-white colonies with clear margins measuring > 0.5 mm, and the colonies are surrounded by beta-hemolysis. Gram stain typically shows Gram-positive cocci that are arranged in chains. GAS is both catalase and oxidase-negative.

The different types of infections caused by GAS are produced in varying manners. For instance, GAS pharyngitis is caused by the transmission of bacteria from an infected individual through contact with oral secretions. Conversely, cellulitis secondary to GAS is caused by the direct invasion of bacteria through breakdown/wounds in the skin, which can subsequently progress to necrotizing fasciitis. Similarly, impetigo and erysipelas are caused by direct invasion through breaks in the skin’s protective barrier.
