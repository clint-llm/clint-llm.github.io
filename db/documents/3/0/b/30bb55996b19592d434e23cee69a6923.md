Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal fractures and tend to occur in younger, active individuals. They account for 2% to 7% of all fractures and 60% to 70% of carpal bone fractures.

This misdiagnosis can lead to increased morbidity for the patient as the risks of non-union can be high (14% to 50% if displaced). If left untreated, arthritis, deformity, and instability invariably develop within five years which can lead to significant disability. As these injuries often happen in young, active patients, the associated morbidity and cost implications secondary to disability are significant.
