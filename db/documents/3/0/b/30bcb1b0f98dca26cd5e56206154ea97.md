The management of central post-stroke pain requires an interprofessional approach and includes various pharmacological (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and miscellaneous therapies) and non-pharmacological options. A pain consult should be obtained. Nurses, pharmacists, and physicians should refrain from empirically prescribing opiates as they do more harm than good. The pharmacist should educate the patient and caregiver on the potential adverse effects of drugs; when not well tolerated, other nonpharmacological methods of pain control should be sought. Pain and neuroscience nurses are instrumental in patient and family education, patient monitoring, and facilitating communication between team members. [Level 5]
