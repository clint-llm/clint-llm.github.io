Pica is usually a benign disorder if it is short-term. In pregnant women and children, the condition spontaneously disappears without any sequelae. However, in individuals with intellectual impairment, it may persist for years. When Pica is long term it can result in bowel obstruction, bezoars, and even toxicity. Ingestion of dirt and paint can lead to infections and heavy metal toxicity. Many reports exist of people who have had to undergo surgery to relieve bowel obstruction, perforation, and ulcers.
