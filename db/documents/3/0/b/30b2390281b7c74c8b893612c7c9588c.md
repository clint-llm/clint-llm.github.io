Malar rash can occur in several systemic and local disorders. Diagnosing the underlying condition in which malar rash has been resulted from may be difficult due to the wide range of probable causes. A full and detailed clinical history and investigation of all symptoms, as well as a thorough physical examination, should be done by the clinicians to make the appropriate diagnosis.
