There are two major types of replacement techniques: surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). TAVR is the minimally invasive surgical technique for aortic valve replacement for patients who are not a candidate for sAVR.

Surgical Technique

- Minimally Invasive Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement

- Right Anterior Mini Thoracotomy

- Mini sternotomy

- Conventional sternotomy and valve replacement

Trans-catheter Technique

- Two FDA approved valves in the United States: SAPIEN valves (Edwards Lifesciences) and the CORE-valves (Medtronic)

- The newest generation Medtronic valve is the EVOLUTE-R. It has the ability to self expand and repositioning after deployment.
