Whether there is a benefit to monitoring alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and complete blood count (CBC) with differential is a concern for some providers prescribing griseofulvin. A large retrospective study performed in adults and children taking griseofulvin or terbinafine for dermatophyte infections provided clarity on this question. There was a low rate of laboratory test result abnormalities. Most of these were low-grade and did not require discontinuation of the medication or repeat laboratory evaluation. Elevations in ALT, elevations in AST, anemia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia were all infrequent and comparable to baseline rates of abnormalities. With these results, it appears unnecessary in both adults and children to perform interval laboratory tests in patients taking griseofulvin for dermatophyte infections.
