Parents with concerns about their infant's head shapeÂ should consult a pediatrician early. Further specialist consultation with a craniofacial team can be arranged by the pediatrician if there is suspicion of craniosynostosis. If the abnormal head shape is secondary to positional plagiocephaly, patient counseling can be provided.
