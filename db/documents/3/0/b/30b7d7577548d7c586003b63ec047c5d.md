The differential diagnosis for shoulder instability is much more focused than conditions involving nonspecific, chronic shoulder pain, or even rotator cuff-based pathologies or shoulder impingement conditions.

Pertinent elements to consider on the differential include:

- Dislocation versus subluxation events

- Traumatic versus atraumatic

- Chronicity

- First-time dislocations versus chronic or subacute recurrence

- Unidirectional instability – seen in association with an inciting event/dislocation (anterior, posterior, inferior)

- Multidirectional instability (MDI)

- Associated labral injuries/pathology
