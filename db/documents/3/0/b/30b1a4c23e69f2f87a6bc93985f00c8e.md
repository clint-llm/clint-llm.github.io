Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a late and chronic manifestation of Lyme borreliosis (LB). ACA predominantly involves the distal portions of extremities and is characterized by chronic cutaneous atrophy.

ACA was first described in 1883 by Buchwald in Germany, and cases were later reported in 1895 in North America.

Lyme borreliosis is the most common vector-borne disease in the northeastern United States. It is a multisystem disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. It is transmitted to humans via an Ixodes tick bite. There are 3 skin manifestations of LB: Erythema migrans (stage 1) with a characteristic “bull’s eye rash,” which, if untreated, can be followed by early disseminated infection, borrelial lymphocytoma (stage 2) along with neurologic and cardiac abnormalities, and late infection, especially arthritis in North America or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (stage 3) in Europe.
