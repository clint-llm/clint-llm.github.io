DPN can usually be diagnosed clinically. Dermoscopy may be a useful, noninvasive, cost-effective diagnostic tool in distinguishing DPN from other pigmented lesions. One study in 2017 reported the most common dermoscopy finding was fissures and ridges in a cerebriform pattern, seen in 59% of cases. Another common finding is comedo-like openings, seen in 27% of cases in the study. Milia-like cysts and a combination of the above findings may also be seen.

If there is any concern for malignancy, the lesion should be biopsied and sent for histopathology.
