Beta-blockers antagonize beta-adrenergic receptors and are used mainly in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, tachydysrhythmias, and angina pectoris. In addition to cardiovascular disorders, beta-blockers are also used in the management of anxiety, migraine headache, glaucoma, tremor, hyperthyroidism, and various other disorders. The development of beta-blockers has revolutionized the management of cardiovascular disorders and they are known to provide morbidity and mortality benefits to patients with ischemic heart diseases. Beta-blockers prevent remodeling of the heart after an ischemic event by reducing the effects of catecholamines on cardiac tissue. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology and presentation of beta-blocker toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the pathophysiology of beta-blocker toxicity.
- Discuss the evaluation of a patient with beta-blocker toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for beta-blocker toxicity.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to evaluate and treat beta-blocker toxicity and improve outcomes.
