The exact cause of an eyelid coloboma is unknown but is thought to be a form of facial cleft.

Eyelid colobomas can be an isolated finding or can be associated with various syndromes mentioned below:

- Fraser Syndrome: Cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, ear malformations, urinary tract dysgenesis, ambiguous genitalia, laryngeal/tracheal stenosis. It is autosomal recessive with mutations of FRAS1, GRIP1, and FREM2 genes

- Goldenhar Syndrome: a classical triad characterizes Goldenhar syndrome: a) mandibular hypoplasia with facial asymmetry, b) ocular and auricular malformations-periauricular tags, epibulbar dermoid, microphthalmia, eyelid coloboma, and c) vertebral anomalies: scoliosis and hemivertebra

- Treacher Collins syndrome (mandibulofacial dysostosis): Antimongoloid slant, colobomas of lateral lower eyelids, cataracts, microphthalmos, and atresia of lacrimal passages.

- CHARGE syndrome: Coloboma, heart defects, choanal atresia, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities

- Frontonasal dysplasia: Orbital Hypertelorism, bifid nose, and medical facial cleft

- Delleman-Oorthuys (oculocerebrocutaneous) syndrome: Agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebral/cerebellar cysts, orbital cysts, and periorbital/facial tags, punched out defects of the lip with philtrum

- Nasopalpebral Lipoma coloboma syndrome: upper eyelid and nasopalpebral lipoma, both eyelid coloboma, telecanthus, and maxillary hypoplasia. It is autosomal dominant with full penetrance

- Manitoba Oculotrichoanal (MOTA) syndrome: unilateral upper eyelid coloboma or cryptophthalmos, anophthalmia/microphthalmia, triangular growths of hair extending from scalp to eyebrow, bifid nose, omphalocele, and anal atresia/stenosis. It has autosomal recessive inheritance and mutation of the FREM1 gene
