- Long thoracic nerve injury causing paralysis or weakness of the serratus anterior muscle presents as winging of the scapula that is worse with lift-forward flexion of the arm or pushing the outstretched arm against a wall. This is different from accessory nerve injury, which has winging of the scapula with the abduction of the arm.

- Rotator cuff injury has a similar presentation when lifting the arm behind the head, except this injury does not present with winging of the scapula.

- Shoulder girdle arthritis and pain syndrome do not have muscular atrophy and winging of the scapula.

- Whiplash injury could cause neck pain, cervical spine rigidity, and limited neck motion secondary to spasms and pain.
