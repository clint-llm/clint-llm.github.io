Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a diagnostic modality used to evaluate a patient's functional capacity. The test can provide a wealth of knowledge about both cardiac and pulmonary disease processes, while also aiding in the development of individualized therapy and rehabilitation programs. This activity provides an overview of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, its physiological basis, use in clinical practice, and its applications to health prevention.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique used for cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary exercise testing.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cardiopulmonary exercise testing and improve outcomes.
