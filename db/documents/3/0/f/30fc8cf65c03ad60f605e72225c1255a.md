The age of the patient is an important consideration, as bone cysts can be more aggressive in the younger population with an increased recurrence rate of four-times more than those in the older population. Age is also helpful when narrowing the differential diagnosis. Other useful information of the patientâ€™s history includes type and onset of pain and associated systemic symptoms.

The physical exam includes a general physical from head to toe with special attention to the musculoskeletal portion. The range of motion, neurologic function, and vascular function are important considerations as more aggressive bone tumors can cause neurovascular compromise.

Unicameral bone cysts are asymptomatic unless a pathologic fracture is present. They often present with tenderness at the fracture site with possible associated swelling and/or bruising. Other symptoms may include difficulty with ambulation or decreased range of motion of the affected extremity. These lesions do not typically get infected, and as such, no laboratory abnormalities are present.
