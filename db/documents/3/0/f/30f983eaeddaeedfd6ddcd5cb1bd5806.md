While many medications and treatment strategies have been tried over the years, none have been proven to be effective. One of the very few randomized controlled clinical trials in neuro-ophthalmology was done evaluating whether patients with NAION will benefit from optic nerve head decompression via vitrectomy and demonstrated that surgery was not beneficial and potentially harmful.

Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, as well as triamcinolone, have been tried with disappointing results as well.

Recently, a clinical trial evaluating intravitreal injection of QRK207, a caspase 2 inhibitor preventing apoptosis, in patients with recent (within 14 days from onset) onset of NAION did not demonstrate its efficacy and was stopped early.

Currently, the only clinical trial that is ongoing includes subcutaneous injections of RPh201, an isolated botanical extract of gum mastic, for patients who had an onset of NAION within 1-5 years prior to enrollment.
