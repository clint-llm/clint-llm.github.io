Interpleural analgesia may be utilized to treat acute postoperative pain that results from thoracic and upper abdominal surgeries.

Interpleural analgesia is not specific to acute pain, as chronic pain conditions such as cancer pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, chronic pancreatitis, and complex regional pain syndrome find relief with this intervention.
