The urinary bladder, situated in the extraperitoneal space of the pelvis behind the pubis, is uniquely designed both to provide a low-pressure reservoir for urine storage during the filling phase and to efficiently empty completely during the micturition phase.Â  The layered design of the bladder and its complex neural control allows the normal bladder to fill without involuntary contractions and to empty with a highly coordinated contraction of the detrusor muscled simultaneously with the relaxation of the urinary sphincter(s) to expel urine. Within the urinary system, the bladder is the most common site of malignancy.

For localized muscle-invasive bladder cancers, and in select cases of non-muscle-invasive cancers, removal of the entire bladder with a radical cystectomy and creation of some type of urinary diversion is recommended as the gold standard.
