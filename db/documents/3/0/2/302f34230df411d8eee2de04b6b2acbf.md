The precursor extensor muscle mass gives rise to the musculature in the forearm by differentiating into three portions. The radial portion gives rise to the extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, and brachioradialis. The superficial portion gives rise to the extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and extensor digiti minimi. The deep portion gives rise to the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor indicis. The radial and superficial portions of the extensor muscle mass appear to be well conserved among different primate species, while significant differences between the deep portion exist, which can explain why many variations of the muscles and tendons in that portion can be present. However, variations of the EPL are quite rare, having a prevalence of only 1%.
