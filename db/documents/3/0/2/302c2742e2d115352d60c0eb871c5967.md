Asystole, colloquially referred to as flatline, represents the cessation of electrical and mechanical activity of the heart. Asystole typically occurs as a deterioration of the initial non-perfusing ventricular rhythms: ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). This activity describes the causes, presentation, and pathophysiology of asystole and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of asystole.
- Outline the presentation of a patient in asystole.
- Explain the management options available for asystole.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by asystole.
