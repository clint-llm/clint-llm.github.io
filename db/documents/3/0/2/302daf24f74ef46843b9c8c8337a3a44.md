Multiple staff members are necessary to effectively and safely administer PCA. Individual roles include the physician ordering the route, medication, and dosing, the pharmacist preparing the drug, and the nurse setting up the pump and explaining its use to the patient while periodically monitoring them throughout their use of the device.
