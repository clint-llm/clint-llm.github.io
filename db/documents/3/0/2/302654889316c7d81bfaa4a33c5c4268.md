Cellulitis is diagnosed clinically based on the presence of spreading erythematous inflammation of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It characteristically presents with worsening erythema, edema, warmth, and tenderness. Two of the four criteria (warmth, erythema, edema, or tenderness) are required to make the diagnosis. Its most common presentation is on the lower extremities but can affect any area of the body. It is most often unilateral and rarely (if ever) presents bilaterally. The patient's skin should be thoroughly evaluated to find the potential source for the cellulitis by looking for microabrasions of the skin secondary to injuries, insect bites, pressure ulcers, or injection sites. If cellulitis is affecting the patient's lower extremities, careful evaluation should be made to look between the patient's toes for fissuring or tinea pedis. Additionally, it can affect the lymphatic system and cause underlying lymphadenopathy. The associated edema with cellulitis can lead to the formation of vesicles, bullae, and edema surrounding hair follicles leading to peau d'orange.

The Infectious Disease Society of America practice guidelines recommends against imaging the infected area except in patients with febrile neutropenia. Consider blood cultures only in patients that are immunocompromised, experienced an immersion injury or animal bite.
