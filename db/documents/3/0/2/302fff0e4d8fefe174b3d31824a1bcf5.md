The Sanders classification has been found to have sustained prognostic value.  One hundred and eight calcaneus fractures operatively treated (Type II and III) were evaluated at a minimum of 10 years with an average follow-up time of 15.22 years.  CT scan was performed immediately postoperatively and 95% of the fractures have posterior facet reduction to the anatomic position (with no appreciable step-off of the articular surface) and with no reductions >5mm inaccurately reduced. The results of this cohort of verifiably well-reduced fractures demonstrated that the type III fractures were 4 times more likely to require eventual subtalar fusion compared to type II fractures.  Long-term functional results in this cohort resulted in mild pain and some alterations in activities of daily living.

Certain Populations tend to have better results a well

- Women

- Younger Adults

- Patients with a lighter workload (office work compared to heavy manual labor employment)

- Patients not receiving workers compensation

- Patients with a higher initial Bohler's angle. The amount of initial displacement based on Bohler's angle of <0 degrees is correlated with lower functional outcomes.  When the initial Bohler's angle is greater than fifteen degrees upon presentation their functional results will be better regardless of operative versus non-operative treatment.
