Solid pseudopapillary pancreatic neoplasms are rare pancreatic tumors accounting for 1% to 2% of exocrine pancreatic lesions. Recent surveys report a 7-fold increase in the incidence of SPEN cases since the past two decades. These are low grade with low malignant potential neoplasms commonly seen in young and adolescent females and rarely affects men. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN) of the pancreas and highlights the uncommon incidence of these neoplasms, the role of the diagnostic imaging and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of SPEN (solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm).
- Describe the clinicopathological of SPEN of the pancreas.
- Review the radiological findings of SPEN of the pancreas.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in selecting and implementing management options available for SPENs.
