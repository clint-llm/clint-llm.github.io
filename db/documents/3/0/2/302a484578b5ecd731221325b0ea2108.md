The most common complication of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is barotrauma. Barotrauma is caused by the expansion of gases in a confined space. The most common barotrauma is rupture or irritation of the tympanic membrane. Other more serious injuries include pneumothorax, rupture of small vessels, and damage to the inner, middle and external ear canals. More serious hazards include oxygen seizures, convulsions, and pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Catastrophic complications are chamber fires and explosions.

Not all failed or compromised flaps or grafts respond to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Prolonged treatments may be required. Loss of the flap or graft is a possibility that could require extensive debridement with loss of skin coverage. This could significantly increase patients' morbidity and mortality.
