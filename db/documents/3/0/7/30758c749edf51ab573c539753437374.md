Management of perioperative anticoagulation requires an interprofessional approach to determine the duration and discontinuation of temporary interruption of anticoagulation. Parenteral anticoagulation during temporary interruption may be required in certain circumstances based on the patient's and procedure's individualized risks and benefits. This activity explains the recommendations for perioperative management of anticoagulation for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Review the basic pharmacology that can affect the homeostasis in patients undergoing non-cardiac elective surgery.
- Review the current indications for antithrombotic and anticoagulation interruption in patients undergoing non-cardiac elective surgery.
- Describe the different emergency anticoagulation reversal treatments and their indications.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team that can enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring anticoagulant drugs to improve patient outcomes for patients receiving anticoagulation undergoing non-cardiac elective surgery.
