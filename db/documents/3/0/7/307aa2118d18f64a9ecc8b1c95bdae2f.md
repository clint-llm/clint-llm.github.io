Bronchodilators are prescribed by nurseÂ practitioners, physician assistants, primary care providers, internists, emergency department clinicians, and others. Anyone who prescribes these agents must educate the patient on the potential adverse effects, which can include anticholinergic symptoms as well as cardiac symptoms. Patients must be informed when to return to their provider when these symptoms appear. Overall, bronchodilators are safe when prescribed and administered correctly and can significantly improve asthma patients' quality of life.
