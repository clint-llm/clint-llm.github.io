Postoperative rehab is aimed at protecting the joint and nerve integrity and controlling inflammation, pain, and swelling. As rehab continues, the therapist and patient work to prevent contraction and adhesions of scar tissue while maintaining soft tissue and joint mobility. Return to normal gait, walking, and running are long-term goals.
