Although AGEP is predominantly self-limited and resolves with discontinuation and avoidance of the triggering agent, the rapid progression of symptoms with associated physical discomfort and potential for secondary infection without proper skincare can be particularly distressing for patients. Lack of proper diagnosis may delay discontinuation of the causative agent or potentially lead to treatment with systemic corticosteroids despite limited evidence that they expedite recovery or shorten disease duration.

On the other hand, patients with mild or localized AGEP due to a medication that is otherwise critical to their health with no suitable alternative may be appropriate for continuing the offending drug. For patients to make an informed decision in this hypothetical scenario, further data is needed to clarify the pathogenesis, appropriately characterize the risks of repeated exposures, and develop evidence-based treatment guidelines.

Collaboration between an interprofessional team of dermatologists, internists, critical care physicians, immunologists, nurses, and other healthcare specialists in clinical and academic settings is required to enhance patient-centered care. Clinical recognition and publication of cases of AGEP in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, controlled trials of specific treatments in severe or refractory cases, and detailed immunologic studies are needed to understand this condition better, clarify the details of its pathogenesis, and establish evidence-based treatment guidelines. Expanding the knowledge base of AGEP will increase diagnostic fidelity, improve patient counseling and reassurance, and develop effective treatment options.
