Historically there have been no disease-modifying treatments for SMA, and treatment has largely been supportive with early involvement of pediatric palliative care specialists, especially for types 0, I, and II.

Pulmonary - restrictive lung disease seen in type 0, I, and II causes respiratory failure and is ultimately the cause of death. Non-invasive ventilation, usually in the form of BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure), has been used as a way of increasing quality of life and life expectancy.

Gastrointestinal - Due to associated muscle weakness, patients are prone to tire quickly and have swallowing difficultiesÂ that can lead to a failure to thrive and have a negative compounding effect on muscle weakness. Other gastrointestinal symptoms include constipation, delayed gastric emptying, and reflux.

Orthopedic - Patients suffer from orthopedic complications such as scoliosis, hip subluxation, and susceptibility to fractures. Type I and II are particularly affected by these complications, with type III being variably affected.

Novel therapies - Traditionally, there has been no disease altering agents, and management has focused on optimizing the various clinical manifestations of SMA. Due to advances in understanding the underlying pathophysiology and breakthroughs in genetic therapeutics, there are now several promising novel agents that have shown to improve life span and decrease morbidity.

Nusinersen - Is an intrathecally delivered antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that promotes functional SMN2 production by inhibiting ISS-N1 (an SMN2 exon 7 splicer) and thereby increasing the amount of functional SMN protein produced.

Onasemnogene abeparvovec - This onetime intravenous injection gene therapy utilizes the properties of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 and uses it to deliver the SMN1 gene into cells and thereby allowing the body to produce functioning SMN protein.

Risdiplam - This drug is an oral medication that works via modifying SMN2 splicing and thereby increasing functional SMN protein levels. There have been numerous phase II/III trials that have shown efficacy with regards to improvement in motor function for patients with type II and III. Clinical trials are still ongoing and are currently under review in the US, Europe, and the UK for licensing.
