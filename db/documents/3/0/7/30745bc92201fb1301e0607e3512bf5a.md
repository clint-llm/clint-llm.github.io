Telemedicine involves the use of telecommunication technologies to provide medical information and services. The word telemedicine is derived from the Greek root word "tele" meaning "distant." The application of the principles of telemedicine to dermatology is referred to as teledermatology. Classically, teledermatology has been classified into real-time teledermatology and store-and-forward teledermatology.
