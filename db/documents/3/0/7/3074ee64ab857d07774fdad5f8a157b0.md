E6 and E7 are oncoproteins that inactivate p53 and pRb proteins, respectively; these inactivations lead to dysregulation of the cell cycle and neoplastic transformation of the affected tissue. The virus remains relatively inactive in early infection but keeps the cell from entering a resting (G0) state. As the infected cells grow and mature, E2 regulates the transition from early- to late-phase genes, and the virus increases the production of virions for dispersal. This increase in virion production in HPV-driven lesions typically manifests as hypertrophy of the infected tissue (discrete, thickened lesions, e.g., the common wart) with the potential for atypia and malignant transformation in those lesions infected with high-risk HPV.
