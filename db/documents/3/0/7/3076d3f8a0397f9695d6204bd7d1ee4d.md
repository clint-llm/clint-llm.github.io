The goal is to perform a safe and reliable transverse rectus abdominis (TRAM) flap while minimizing harm to the abdominal wall. In the operating room, the transverse rectus abdominis (TRAM) flap is mobilized off the abdominal wall with its vascular pedicle intact. A tunnel is created in the medial inframammary fold and onto the xiphoid process. The flap is rotated and tunneled through to be placed on the chest wall. Once the flap is positioned in the breast pocket, it is tacked in place and further shaped. The flap is tacked down circumferentially and examined in an upright position to confirm symmetry. The flap is trimmed to conform to the mastectomy flaps and breast shape. The abdominal wall defect is closed primarily, but if the abdominal muscles appear weak, an interposition piece of mesh is necessary to prevent future hernias. The fascia is closed in two layers and imbricated in the epigastric and lower suprapubic area to prevent a bulge. The rest of the abdominal closure is performed in a multiple layer form with careful attention to the superficial fascial system, deep dermis, and intradermal layers. These are the layers that contain collagen and prevent wound dehiscence. Drains are placed under the abdominal flap and inside the breast pocket. The procedure is completed with skin closure and applying a dressing.
