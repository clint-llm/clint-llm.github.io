Most commonly, patients present with hip stiffness after surgery or trauma that can lead to decreased range of motion and functional impairment. Symptoms associated with severe HO may include fever, warmth, erythema, tenderness, and swelling. Pain alone within several days after surgery could be a presenting symptom of HO, but this presentation is less common.

HO also could be an incidental finding on radiograph where calcified structures with blurred contours are seen as early as two to six weeks postoperatively. Bone scans usually show increased uptake in the soft tissues adjacent to the hip. Scans can detect HO several days before it becomes apparent on plain film, but these findings are not specific for HO

Rarely, correlations have been reported with sedimentation rate greater than 35 mm/hr
