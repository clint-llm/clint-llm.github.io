Administering intravenous acyclovir requires interprofessional effort and communication. It is not a benign drug, having potential adverse effects such as phlebitis, hypersensitivity, and AKI. Therefore, pharmacists, prescribing clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), and nurses must work together to achieve adequate and nontoxic dosing and monitor therapy.

Clinicians will make the initial decision to use acyclovir. Dose adjustments for ideal body weight and baseline renal function are necessary. The pharmacist should coordinate this with nurses and clinicians for inpatients, verifying dosing and performing medication reconciliation.

Also, patients must monitor signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity and phlebitis, specifically at the infusion site; this is where nurses will be best positioned to inform the rest of the healthcare team should there be any issues of concern. Interprofessional teamwork among each healthcare provider can help minimize and prevent the adverse effects of intravenous administration of acyclovir.
