Unfortunately, PHP is an inherited disorder, and once an individual has developed the condition, there is no cure. Genetic testing and counseling are recommendations for individuals with PHP, especially if they plan to have children, so they can fully identify their risk of passing on the disease. Patients with PHP should have yearly screening exams, even if they feel well.
