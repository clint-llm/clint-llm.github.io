Chromium deficiency is related to a variety of metabolic and neurologic abnormalities, including insulin intolerance. History taking ideally includes evaluating the timing of symptoms and identifying risk factors from past medical, procedural, trauma, and nutritional history. Chromium is absorbed in the small intestine and circulated throughout the organ systems bound to transferrin and albumin.

Risk factors that will alter the absorption process or carrying capacity are significant. Development of the following symptoms with no prior history of these symptoms in conjunction with the presence of pertinent risk factors may lead to a diagnosis of chromium deficiency.

Trivalent chromium has been theorized to influence the interaction of insulin with its peripheral receptors.

There has been some discussion regarding neurological abnormalities related to chromium deficiency. If encephalopathic, orientation questioning should be conducted before intake. Obtaining a neurological history includes asking about symptoms including ataxia, paresthesias, postural tremors, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. These may also be included in reviewing systems from the initial history.

The common denominator in all the case studies presented on chromium deficiency is the use of total parenteral nutrition. As such, factors that lead to total parenteral nutrition use must be assessed. In discussing past medical and nutritional history, It is important to note prior or current diagnoses of malnutrition, including anorexia nervosa and alcoholism. Procedural and trauma history, including bowel resection, extensive burns, and short bowel syndrome, can all lead to decreased chromium absorption but also increased demand for chromium due to the alterations in catabolism and anabolism in these high-stress situations. Patients that have had an extended hospital stay with an extensive history of total parenteral nutrition must be closely assessed as well.

There are no specific pertinent exam findings for patients with chromium deficiency. If patients report a history of new-onset neurological symptoms, evaluating those symptoms with a complete and thorough neurological examination is vital.
