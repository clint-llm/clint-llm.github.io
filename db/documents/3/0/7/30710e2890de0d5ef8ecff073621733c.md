The mammary gland is frequently biopsied to confirm the diagnosis of breast cancer. Various stains can be used to determine certain tumor characteristics, such as grade and histological type. For the initial tissue preparation, the biopsy gets fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 48 hours at 4ÂºC. It should also be dehydrated in 70% ethanol to minimize adipose distortion. Following the initial 48 hours, the fixated specimens are transferred to xylene, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 2 to 5 mm, and dyed with the desired stain.
