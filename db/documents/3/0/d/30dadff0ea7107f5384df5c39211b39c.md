The management of autoimmune diseases, such as SLE/LN, is a complex process that imposes a significant cost burden on both patients and the healthcare system. Voclosporin, a novel immunosuppressive agent, is used in combination with background immunosuppressive therapy for patients with lupus nephritis. The utilization of background immunosuppressive therapies in conjunction with voclosporin is a critical aspect of LN management.

To ensure the best possible outcomes for patients, an interprofessional healthcare team comprising various specialties is essential. Despite the improved pharmacodynamics of voclosporin compared to previous calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), it can still lead to severe adverse effects. Therefore, regular patient visits and frequent monitoring of vital signs and laboratory tests are crucial to prevent potential complications. Primary care providers, including advanced practice practitioners, should be well-informed about significant adverse effects and maintain open communication with rheumatologists and nephrologists to address any concerns that may arise.

Given the potential for drug interactions, collaborative patient care involving pharmacists is paramount. Accurate and comprehensive medication reconciliation, along with verification of the appropriate dose adjusted for creatinine clearance, should be conducted by pharmacists. If any discrepancies are noted, they should promptly communicate them to other members of the healthcare team.

Close monitoring for adverse effects is necessary for all patients receiving voclosporin, and nurses often play a key role in being the first to receive reports of adverse events from patients. This information can then be shared with other members of the healthcare team for collaborative decision-making regarding further steps. Social workers have a crucial role in identifying barriers to care, including financial constraints that may hinder medication affordability. The social work team can provide the necessary resources and support to assist patients in overcoming these challenges.

In summary, the use of voclosporin in the treatment of lupus nephritis requires an interprofessional healthcare team consisting of physicians, physician extenders, nurses, pharmacists, and social workers. Although team members come from various disciplines, effective collaboration and communication are essential to achieve optimal outcomes for patients.[Level 5]
