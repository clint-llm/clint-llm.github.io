All patient information leaflets should be provided to patients before treatment. Consent should be taken before the procedure and give time to the patient if they change their decision. Long term treatment options, side effects, and other alternative options need to be discussed. Practicalities of treatment should be discussed. Records of patients should be available at each clinic at the start of treatment for review by the consultant and nurse.

To retain the competence of physicians and nursing staff, continued training and education is essential.
