Cannon A waves are large-amplitude waves seen in the jugular veins during a physical exam. They are caused by simultaneous contraction of atria and ventricle leading to exaggerated right atrial pressure. Usually, Cannon A waves are irregular and intermittent. They are seen in patients with cardiac conduction defects or certain cardiac dysrhythmias. Cannon A waves can also be seen on the EKG.
