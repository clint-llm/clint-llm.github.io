There is a paucity of data on the incidence of COVID-19 and MIS-C in neonates. MIS-C is estimated to occur only in less than 1 percent of children exposed to COVID-19 infection. Associated risk factors included a history of asthma and obesity. However, the exact incidence of MIS-C in neonates is unknown.

According to the reported data from CDC, only 4% of the total MIS-C cases occurred in infants < 1 year.
