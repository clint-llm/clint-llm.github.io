Protein C and protein S are primarily synthesized in the liver. Protein S is also synthesized by platelets, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells and circulates in plasma.

Protein C is activated by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex to form activated protein C (APC) on the surface of the vascular endothelial cells.

In protein C or protein S deficiency, the coagulation cascade continues unchecked with the overactivity of factor V and factor VIII, resulting in excessive thrombin production.

Mutations to factor V (G1691A) in the activated protein C resistance disorder can prevent deactivation even in the presence of proteins C and S, promoting blood clotting.
