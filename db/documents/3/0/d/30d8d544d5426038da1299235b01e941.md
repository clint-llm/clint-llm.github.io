MFS can be mistaken with similar disorders with overlapping clinical features. The most common differential is brainstem (Bickerstaff) encephalitis and a pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness GBS variant. Distinguishing features of brainstem encephalitis are the presence of hyperreflexia and encephalopathy. The pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variant of GBS is clinically characterized by acute weakness of the oropharyngeal, neck, and shoulder muscles, dysphagia, and facial paresis with preserved reflexes and strength in the lower extremities. These 3 disorders have in common the presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies in CSF. The gradual onset of MFS is a key factor in distinguishing it from acute brainstem stroke. Other differential diagnoses to consider include Wernicke encephalopathy, ocular myasthenia gravis, Lambert Eaton syndrome, multiple sclerosis, and sarcoidosis, among other autoimmune disorders. Neuroimaging (CT/MRI or MRA) and electrodiagnostic (EMG, nerve conduction, or evoked potential), among other ancillary tests in the central and peripheral nervous system can be helpful to exclude these alternative diagnoses. Of note, under an uncertain GBS variant besides MFS and/or suspicion of brainstem encephalitis that is severely debilitating, the treatment regimen remains unchanged: IVIG or plasma exchange.
