Primary herpes gingivostomatitis usually occurs in children who have not been previously exposed to the virus. It may be asymptomatic in some cases, but most cases develop a prodrome of fever, anorexia, irritability, and the development of painful oral lesions. Associated symptoms include malaise, lethargy, and cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy.

The initial sign of herpetic gingivostomatitis is hyperemia of the oral and perioral mucosa, followed by rapidly spreading vesicular lesions on the gingiva, palate, buccal, and labial mucosa. The lesions may ulcerate and then eventually rupture. On physical examination, they may appear flat, yellowish in color, and approximately 2 to 5 mm in size. The ulcers are quick to bleed and typically heal without scarring in 2 to 3 weeks.

Recurrent herpes lesions commonly develop in one-third of the patients who have experienced primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. The patientâ€™s symptoms include burning and itching, followed by the formation of vesicular lesions in a localized area. The lesions mostly develop on keratinized skin such as the vermillion border of the lips, perioral skin, or the hard palate. The lesions may develop when the patient is under physical or emotional stress or systemic illness. Other triggers include sunlight exposure and trauma. The lesions occur in the same area during every episode of recurrence, and systemic manifestations such as malaise and lymphadenopathy are mild.
