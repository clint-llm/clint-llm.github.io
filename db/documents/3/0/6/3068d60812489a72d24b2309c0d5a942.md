The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B [NF-kB] ligand (RANKL) appears to be critical to the pathogenesis of GCT. Under normal physiologic conditions, osteoclast formation requires interaction with cells of the osteoblastic lineage, which may depend upon cell-cell contact, and the interaction of RANKL with its receptor RANK.

Several studies identified RANKL as highly expressed by the stromal cells within a GCT.

Mutations in the H3F3A gene, present in over 90% of GCT, may drive tumorigenesis. These mutations are restricted to the stromal cell population and are not detected in the osteoclasts or their precursors.
