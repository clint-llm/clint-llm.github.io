Management of ecthyma gangrenosum requires an interprofessional team approach, including providers from infectious disease, surgery, dermatology, hematology, and critical care. The providers involved in treatment depend on the overall clinical picture and whether they are being treated in the intensive care unit.

A dermatologist can help in the initial diagnostic workup to determine the cause (Wood's lamp evaluation, punch biopsy) and extent of the lesions. Infectious disease specialists are helpful to determine the selection and length of antibiotic therapy. Surgeons may be needed for incision and drainage of multiple abscesses, surgical debridement of necrotic lesions, or grafting of large-area defects. In patients with neutropenia, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may be given at the discretion of a hematologist.

For individuals with fulminant sepsis, management in the critical care setting by an intensivist is appropriate due to the high fatality rate of bacteremic EG. Individuals with sepsis are extremely tenuous, and careful monitoring from the nursing staff with frequent vital sign measurements is critical and reporting to the team untoward changes. Prompt administration of effective antimicrobial therapy is known to improve survival in sepsis.
