The Child-Pugh scoring system (also known as the Child-Pugh-Turcotte score) was designed to predict mortality in cirrhosis patients. Originally conceptualized by Child and Turcotte in 1964 to guide the selection of patients who would benefit from elective surgery for portal decompression, it broke down patients into three categories: A - good hepatic function, B - moderately impaired hepatic function, and C - advanced hepatic dysfunction. Their original scoring system used five clinical and laboratory criteria to categorize patients: serum bilirubin, serum albumin, ascites, neurological disorder, and clinical nutrition status.

- Encephalopathy: None = 1 point, Grade 1 and 2 = 2 points, Grade 3 and 4 = 3 points

- Ascites:  None = 1 point, slight = 2 points, moderate = 3 points

- Bilirubin: under 2 mg/ml = 1 point, 2 to 3 mg/ml = 2 points, over 3 mg/ml = 3 points

- Albumin: greater than 3.5mg/ml = 1 point, 2.8 to 3.5mg/ml = 2 points, less than 2.8mg/ml = 3 points

- Prothrombin Time* (sec prolonged): less than 4 sec = 1 point, 4 to 6 sec = 2 points, over 6 sec = 3 points

*Frequently INR will be used as a substitute for PT, with INR under 1.7 = 1 point, INR 1.7 to 2.2 = 2 points, INR above 2.2 = 3 points

The severity of cirrhosis:

- Child-Pugh A: 5 to 6 points

- Child-Pugh B: 7 to 9 points

- Child-Pugh C: 10 to 15 points
