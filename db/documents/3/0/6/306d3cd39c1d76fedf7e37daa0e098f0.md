The prognosis of benign tumors is usually quite good. Most of the morbidity from these lesions derives from their space-occupying nature and their effects on surrounding tissue. Large lesions can cause a disfiguring appearance from proptosis or globe displacement. Visual changes can occur due to diplopia from globe displacement or decreased mechanical effectiveness of the extraocular muscles. Direct compression of the globe can lead to a blurry vision from deforming the refractive shape of the eye. Pressure on the optic nerve can lead to optic neuropathy and decreased visual acuity, color vision changes, and visual field defects. At times, the tumors can be related to systemic disease (e.g., neurofibroma with neurofibromatosis type 1), where overall patient prognosis depends on the severity of the systemic disease.

Concerning pleomorphic adenoma, recurrence of the tumor has been associated with malignant transformation, which can negatively affect long-term ocular and patient prognosis.Â This risk is increased in cases of multiple recurrences and with the increased age of the patient.

Dacryops have a high recurrence rate if treated with simple aspiration and drainage.
