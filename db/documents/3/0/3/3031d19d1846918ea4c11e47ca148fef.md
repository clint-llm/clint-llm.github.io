The etiology of chronic rejection is incompletely understood. Glinton et al. reported that a vital determinant of the complication of chronic solid organ allografts is by a vascular disease component of the transplanted graft. Their review, however, focused on cardiac transplantation only. In cardiac allograft vasculopathy, histologic evidence suggests that the accumulation and activation of phagocytes can be a contributing factor. Phagocytic cells such as macrophages, monocytes, and immature dendritic cell subsets are found in this type of chronic cardiac transplant rejection. Furthermore, myeloid phagocytes crosstalk with B and T lymphocytes while also signaling and activating vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, and these can cause fibrous intimal thickening.
