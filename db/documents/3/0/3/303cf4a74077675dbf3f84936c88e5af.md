The first case of NiV infection was reported near the city of Ipoh in Perak, Malaysia, in 1998.

In Bangladesh, the epidemiology of NiV differed, starting with an outbreak of encephalitis in Meherpur in 2001. The primary difference included the absence of pigs being involved in the outbreak, as pig farming was not being practiced in Bangladesh, which is a predominantly Muslim country. Following this, multiple seasonal outbreaks have occurred, each of which is thought to be separate spillover events.

In 2001, an outbreak of encephalitis was reported in Siliguri, West Bengal, India, which is geographically adjacent to Bangladesh. This is now retrospectively thought to have been an outbreak of Nipah.

In 2014, an outbreak was reported in the Philippines where NiV transmission occurred by exposure to infected horses, similar to the Hendra virus infections in Australia.
