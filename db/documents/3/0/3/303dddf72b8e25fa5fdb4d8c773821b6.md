The prognosis of genital LS in children is good. Often the disease mayÂ resolve itself spontaneously. LS responds mostly well to local corticosteroid treatment. The forecast is not as positive for extragenital LS and chronic atrophic genital disease.

When untreated, LS leads to disease complications making early diagnosis and treatment crucial. Timely diagnosis and treatment may prevent disease complications.

Although LS is not a precancerous condition, patients with genital LS have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma.
