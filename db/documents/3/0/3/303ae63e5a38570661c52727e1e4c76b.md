Zoonotic diseases must not be confused with other groups of diseases, including:

- Zooanthroponosis (reverse-zoonosis), which are infections transmitted from humans to animals, such as tuberculosis

- Amphixenosis, which are infections transmitted in both directions from animals to humans and vice versa, such as staphylococcal infections

- Euzoonosis, where humans act as an obligatory host in the pathogen’s life cycle, such as Taenia solium and Taenia saginata

- Zoonoses also have to be differentiated from other common infections of similar presentations, and one should not be completely misled by a certain animal exposure in the context. Similarly, contact with animals, insects, and the wilderness, can cause other non-infectious pathologies like allergic reactions, which have to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
