Uncomplicated cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) are manageable by obstetrician-gynecologist; however, a maternal-fetalÂ medicine specialist (MFM) and gastroenterologist consultation, when available, should always be considered in the patients with the complicated ICP and with other preexisting chronic liver diseases. A geneticist also can be consulted for sequence analysis when there is suspicion of the familial clustering of disease.
