Patients typically present within hours after the bite has occurred. Classically, the patient describes activities in which they have entered into the habitat of the black widow spider; such as hiking, camping, gardening, shopping or activities in a garage. Most often, these bites occur on the patients’ extremities and often go initially unnoticed but can also be immediately associated with pain.

Within minutes of being bitten, the area adjacent to the wound site may become painful, erythematous and edematous followed by the development of a central punctum. Fang marks may be evident. There is also a classic appearance of isolated diaphoresis within an area of central clearing. Neuromuscular symptoms, including severe muscle pain and cramping, usually occur within an hour. Increased autonomic function leading to tachycardia, tachypnea and hypertension are also associated and are often correlated with increased pain.

Some patients may progress to latrodectism. Latrodectism refers to the systemic manifestations of a widow bite. Symptoms include diffuse muscle rigidity and cramping, tenderness and burning around the bite, truncal and abdominal tenderness, nausea, and vomiting. The diffuse pain associated with latrodectism spreads contiguously from the bite site. In other words, if the bite occurs on the ankle, the pain will progress proximally along the leg, and then to the adjacent extremity, abdomen, chest, and back. All extremities can be involved.
