The differential diagnosis of inflammatory back pain includes mechanical, non-mechanical, and visceral sources. It is crucial to rule out pain sources from cancer or vertebral body compression fractures. Recall that the characteristic features of IBP are the age of onset less than 40 years, duration of back pain greater than 3 months, insidious onset, morning stiffness, and improvement with exercise. Causes of mechanical back pain tend to worsen with movement and exercise andÂ generally correlate with injury and more acute onset.

Patients should undergo assessment for neurologic deficits that may suggest compression of the spinal cord or cauda equina syndrome. Further, patients with high clinical suspicion of vertebral osteomyelitis or epidural abscess warrant immediate MRI.

A recent study evaluating the effectiveness of various findings traditionally thought to suggest cancer as the cause of back pain found that history of malignancy and strong clinical suspicion for cancer were most useful in directing toward evaluation for a cancerous cause of back pain.
