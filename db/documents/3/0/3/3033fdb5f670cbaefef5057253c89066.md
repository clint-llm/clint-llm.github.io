- Lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LABCN) injury is the most commonÂ complication.

- Radial nerve or posterior interosseous nerve injury is the most severe complication.

- Superficial radial nerve injury.

- Synostosis: This is a bony bridge that develops between radius and ulna, resulting in restriction or loss of pronation and supination. This can develop due to the proximal radius fracture from drilling a large tunnel or suture rupture when the bone tunnel technique is used. The incidence of synostosis has been reduced with the dual incision technique. Also, it can be minimized in a single incision technique by reducing dissection between radius and ulna and reducing exposure of the ulna periosteum.

- Heterotopic ossification.
