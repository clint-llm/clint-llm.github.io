Mediastinoscopy is performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. A patient is generally in the supine position for the procedure unless an anterior mediastinal mass causes airway compromise when lying flat. In a patient without such a mass, intravenous induction is performed, and following intubation, the patient’s head is extended and turned to the side. A 3-cm incision is performed 2 cm above the suprasternal notch between the anterior borders of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The superficial fascia of the neck, deep cervical fascia, and pretracheal fascia must be dissected to reach the level of the trachea. Blunt dissection down to the anterior trachea allows entrance into the superior mediastinum. As the tract continues to be developed via blunt dissection, a tract into the superior mediastinum will develop between the anterior trachea and posterior to the great vessels. A mediastinoscope is then inserted and advanced along the tract allowing for the sampling of lymph nodes and masses.
