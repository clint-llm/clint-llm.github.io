Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a complex inflammatory disorder of the orbit. It involves the orbital fibroblasts, adipocytes, extra-ocular muscles, optic nerve, and the orbital vasculature. The systemic thyroid status can unpredictably affect the course of TED. It is challenging to diagnose TED in euthyroid cases. The clinical presentation ranges from a unilateral dry-eye disease to bilateral sight-threatening complications. The management and rehabilitation strategies are constantly updated. Newer modalities of investigations and treatment are added every day in our armamentarium. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of TED. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in effectively managing and rehabilitating the TED patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathogenesis of thyroid eye disease.
- Describe and review the clinical presentations of thyroid eye disease patients.
- Summarize the classification and staging modalities for thyroid eye disease and its applications for long-term follow-up.
- Explain the management strategies for visual and cosmetic rehabilitation of thyroid eye disease patients.
