Once the decision to proceed with the brain death determination has been made, three conditions must be present: coma, the absence of brainstem reflexes, and apnea.

Coma should be evaluated by ensuring a lack of responsiveness to noxious stimuli; no eye or motor reflex should be present in response to stimuli. Spinal-mediated reflex movements may be compatible with brain death and can include muscle stretch reflexes.

The following brainstem reflexes should be tested in the physical examination of a patient deemed for brain death evaluation.

- The pupillary reflex to light – must be fixed; pupil size is usually mid-position, around 4 to 6 mm, but may vary, and the exact size is unimportant. Of importance is that the pupils must not respond to light.

- Oculocephalic reflex – this is performed by rapidly turning the head after checking the integrity of the cervical spine.

- Oculovestibular reflex (cold caloric test) – an absence of eye movement for one minute when the head is held at 30 degrees and cold water (50 ml) is instilled in the ear canal.

- Corneal reflex–stimulate with a swab.

- Gag reflex–stimulate the posterior pharynx.

- Cough reflex–stimulated with endotracheal suctioning.

- The facial movement to noxious stimuli–apply noxious pressure to the supraorbital ridge; there should be no facial muscle response.
