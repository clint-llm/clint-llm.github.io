The first step in managing cases of pustular psoriasis is identifying disease triggers, such as an underlying infection. Generalized pustular psoriasis (e.g., von Zumbusch subtype) may require admission to the hospital. Systemic symptoms including fever and joint pain will require treatment with antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications. Disease-specific medications including systemic retinoids (acitretin, isotretinoin), methotrexate, cyclosporine, and infliximab are considered first-line in adult patients. In pediatric patients, acitretin, cyclosporine, methotrexate, and etanercept are preferred.

Second line options include systemic treatments in diffuse disease (e.g., etanercept and adalimumab) or topical treatments in localized disease (e.g., corticosteroids, calcipotriene, and tacrolimus). All of these options can be used as monotherapy or in combination with first-line options.

Recent reports indicate the successful use of IL-1 receptor antagonists (e.g., anakinra) and IL-36 receptor antagonists in treating pustular psoriasis.
