The gold standard for diagnosing Enterobacter infections is the utilization of cultures. It is recommended that at least two sets of blood cultures be obtained, one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle. MacConkey agar can be used to determine if the specimen is lactose fermenting. Furthermore, indole testing can be performed to differentiate indole negative Klebsiella and Enterobacter and indole positive E. Coli.
Enterobacter spp are motile, in contrast to Klebsiella, which is not motile.

Other important laboratory studies include:

- Gram stain (may be helpful in the rapid determination of gram-negative rods before cultures are available)

- Complete blood count

- Complete metabolic panel

- Urinalysis with culture

Relevant imaging in accordance with the particular organ system involved can be helpful in guiding management.
