Over the 40 years that John J. Shae had performed stapedectomy procedures, he had received good results from the very beginning. The success of stapes procedures showed improvement over the years as the quality of the microscopes, prostheses

While stapedectomy and stapedotomy are considered state-of-the-art operations in treating the conductive hearing loss secondary to otosclerosis, most patients who opt for surgery these days undergo a small fenestra stapedotomy-type procedure performed with microdrill or laser. The reason is that perception of stapedotomy, affording greater improvements in hearing at the higher frequencies and lower complication rates.

As many studies have alluded to, however, the experience of the surgeon will play a greater role in the success and safety of the stapes procedure

For otosclerosis to be effectively managed, detailed knowledge of the disease and the capacity to adapt to the surgical technique play essential roles. Stapedectomy is one of the most technically challenging operations, which is amplified in those cases requiring revision, as the risk of profound sensorineural hearing loss, or dead ear, is substantially higher. Considering this, it is best to use a conservative approach when addressing labyrinthine dysfunction in the postoperative period.

Despite the risks involved and the expertise required for stapes surgery, there is currently no better treatment for improving bone conduction and closing the air-bone gap (ABG) associated with conductive hearing loss, especially those hearing losses resulting from otosclerosis.
