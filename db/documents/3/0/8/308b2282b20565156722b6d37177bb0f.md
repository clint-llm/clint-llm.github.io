The pathophysiology depends on the organism causing the disease. It can be caused by toxins like Staphylococcus aureus, while others increase secretion leading to dehydration, for example, Salmonella. Cytotoxins like Shigella and Clostridium difficile can invade the more susceptible tissue and cause inflammatory diarrhea. Enterotoxin production agents cause noninflammatory diarrhea; the virus frequently destroys the villus surface, and parasites adhere to the mucosa.

In the case of inflammatory diarrhea, there are fluid, proteins, and leukocytes entering the interstitial lumen. Viruses like adenovirus can directly invade the microvillus or through calcium-dependent endocytosis, causing the loss in the ability to absorb.

On a molecular level, agents affect the interstitial lumen by activating enterocyte intracellular signal transduction, affecting the cytoskeleton of the host cells. This will alter the water and electrolyte fluxes across the enterocytes. For toxic diarrhea, there is an increase of cAMP and inhibition of NaCl abortion. When infiltration occurs, histologic damage will reduce glucose, stimulated Na, and electroneutral NaCl absorption.
