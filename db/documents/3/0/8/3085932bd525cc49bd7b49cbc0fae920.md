By the age of 80, about 11% of women will have one or more surgical interventions for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse.

The lifetime risk is 20.5% for women having a surgical intervention related to stress urinary incontinence.

In the United States, 10% to 20% of individuals are affected by defecation disorders accounting for 1.2 million annual physician visits.

Patients can have a complex of multiple symptoms, as noted in a study with 82% of patients with defecatory disorders having multiple urinary symptoms.
