The diagnosis of leptospirosis is made by growth in a specialized culture or microscopic agglutination test (only available at the CDC in Atlanta). Because multiple organ systems are involved, other bloodwork may include renal and liver function tests, coagulation studies, CBC, CSF, and chest x-ray. If there is a concern for aseptic meningitis in the immune phase, a lumbar puncture to sample the CSF is necessary.

If questions or concerns arise about how best to make this diagnosis, do not delay treatment if suspected. In severe cases, be sure to contact the Center for Disease Control (CDC) or the World Health Organization who can assist with the collection and transportation of specimens for diagnostic testing.
