There is a general lack of knowledge on the exact mechanism of somatic mutations outside of the setting of carcinogenesis.

Subsequent cell divisions increase the number of mutated cells, which accumulate and decrease cell function, leading to possible cell death. Exposure to mutagens such as radiation, chemicals, and any process producing free radicals within the cellular environment increases the incidence of cancer as a result of mutations.
