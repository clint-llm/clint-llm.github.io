There may be a history of drug use, a viral infection, or immunization. Acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura can be characterized by generalized purpura in a previously healthy child or, less commonly in an adult, bruises following minor trauma, the presence of oral hemorrhagic bullae, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, conjunctival hemorrhage, and hematuria. More commonly, the illness is gradual in onset but chronic. Severe bleeding has been noted in as many as 9.5% of adults.

Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura may be characterized by insidious onset or suddenly becomes acute. It is seen more commonly in females and presents with scattered petechiae, epistaxis, and menorrhagia, episodes of bleeding separated by an extended period. Occasionally, these clinical findings can be due to HIV-related illness.
