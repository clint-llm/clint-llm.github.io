Equipment requirements vary greatly depending on the type of flap to be transferred. Local flaps may require no more than fine soft-tissue instruments and local anesthesia, while larger regional and free flaps may require extensive instrumentation, including soft tissue sets, bone saws, an operating microscope, microvascular tools, and vasoactive medications.

For the average in-office local flap case, e.g., Mohs defect closure, the following may suffice:

- Scalpel (#15 Bard-Parker blade or #6700 beaver blade)

- Forceps (Adson-Brown or 0.5 mm Castroviejo)

- Needle holder (Halsey or Castroviejo)

- Dissecting scissors (iris or Kaye blepharoplasty)

- Suture scissors

- Electrocautery (monopolar or bipolar)

- Suture (5-0/6-0 polypropylene, 4-0/5-0 poliglecaprone)

- Adhesive strip tapes

- Skin marker

- Local anesthetic (1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine)

- Antiseptic scrub solution (povidone-iodine or isopropanol)
