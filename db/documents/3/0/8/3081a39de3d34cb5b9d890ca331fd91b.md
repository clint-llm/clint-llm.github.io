Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) occur in approximately 15% of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and are commonly located on the plantar weight-bearing surfaces of the foot. Of those patients who develop a diabetic foot ulcer, 6% will be hospitalized for infection or other ulcer-related complications, and 1% of these will require amputation. Complications in patients with diabetes are the leading cause of nontraumatic lower-extremity amputations. This activity discusses hyperbaric oxygen therapy as an effective treatment option.
