Depending on your facility, reaching out for assistance in your management should always be prioritized. This can be either an in-house NICU, the child’s disease specialist, and/or a neonatologist at another location. If the child has recently been discharged from a NICU, a PICU will need to be contacted. Reaching out to a PICU does not preclude discussing the case with a neonatologist. Making this phone call can also help in eventual disposition.

Studies have shown that it can often be beneficial to have family members present during their child’s or loved one’s resuscitation. This does have a caveat of the family members being cooperative and not disruptive. The AHA recommends that the family be given the option to be present and suggests that a team member if staffing is sufficient to do so, should be appointed to be the primary point of contact for the family’s questions and communication of information.
