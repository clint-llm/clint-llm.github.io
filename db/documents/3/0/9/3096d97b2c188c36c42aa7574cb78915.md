Neurofibromatosis is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by tumors in the nervous system and skin. Neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 are the most common and are distinct entities. Neurofibromatosis type 1, or von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant disease. Neurofibromatosis type 1 presents with neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait macules, freckling, and optic gliomas. It is a clinical diagnosis. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a disease characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Treatment for neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 is clinical monitoring and medical intervention when appropriate.
