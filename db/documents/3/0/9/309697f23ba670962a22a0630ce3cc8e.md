Hypersensitivity is a contraindication for salmeterol. It is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any ingredient in the preparation, including lactose and milk protein.

Salmeterol is contraindicated in patients who have had adverse reactions to salmeterol in the past. It should not be used for status asthmaticus or other acute asthma episodes. Salmeterol should not be used in combination with other long-acting beta-agonists. Studies have shown an increased risk for death in asthma patients taking salmeterol vs. placebo; this risk was highest for African-American patients.

There is an FDA black box warning for asthma patients due to the increased incidence of asthma-related deaths with this medication. Salmeterol should not be used as a monotherapy in asthma patients. Clinicians should only use it as an adjunct medication in patients who have failed other asthma therapies such as low to medium dose inhaled steroids or those with severe asthma necessitating two maintenance therapies.

While not strictly contraindications, salmeterol use requires caution in patients with an existing cardiovascular disorder, convulsive disorder, hepatic impairment, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis, or who use other CYP3A inhibitors, as this may increase toxicity and prolong the patient’s QT interval. There is a (usually transient) risk of hypokalemia; therefore, salmeterol use merits caution in patients with hypokalemia.
