Aseptic sacroiliitis

Alternative treatment options include ultrasound-guided prolotherapy, which is an injection of saline and glucose directed to the SI joint. It is theorized that this procedure is pro-inflammatory and results in increased healing, scarring, and tightening of the SI ligaments. SI joint belts can be provided in conjunction with various therapies, and theoretically, they function to stabilize the gluteal muscles and support the SI joint. If the leg-length discrepancy is thought to be a major contributor, then orthotics and/or shoe lifts can be considered.

Surgical indications

- Surgery is indicated after nonoperative modalities are first attempted and exhausted

- Most cases (aseptic) are self-limiting and improve with rest, activity modification, and NSAIDs

- In the case of aggressive recalcitrant symptoms or infection, especially in the setting of a documented abscess, surgery is performed earlier in the course of treatment

Special considerations

- Nonoperative management is the first line of treatment in the setting of pregnancy.  Current evidence suggests a high likelihood of symptom resolution after childbirth

- Sacroiliitis in the setting of a larger spondylopathy, management begins with more aggressive PT modalities, NSAIDs and TNF alpha inhibitors

Septic sacroiliitis

- In the setting of high index of clinical suspicion, exam, and laboratory results (including leukocytosis), initial management with broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, followed by culture-specific, and eventually a course of PO antibiotics

- Transitioning from broad-spectrum antibiotics to culture-specific can occur after an adequate sample is aspirated and/or biopsied using either interventional radiology and/or a surgical service if the aforementioned procedure fails.  In general, an open approach for SI joint debridement and biopsy has more associated morbidity compared to the minimally invasive aspiration techniques.
