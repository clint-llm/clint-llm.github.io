DFUs occur due to changes in the biomechanics of the bony and soft tissue architecture of the foot, peripheral neuropathy, and atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease, all of which occur at a higher frequency in patients with DM. Nonenzymatic glycation predisposes ligaments to stiffness. Diabetic neuropathy causes loss of protective sensation. Both of these contribute to loss of proprioception, poor balance, and lack of awareness of pain in the feet and lower limbs of patients withÂ DM. Ulcers usually begin as small areas of pressure or irritation or from a minor trauma that is not perceived by the insensate neuropathic patient.
