The histological characterizing of monocytes occurs in three main steps. These steps include obtaining and preparing a sample of whole blood, flow cytometry, and monocyte gating. The process of preparing the whole blood is a multistep chemical procedure that involves lysing the cells, marking the cells, and ultimately obtaining a concentrated sample for use in the study. Flow cytometry of the sample then allows for the characterizing of the monocytes depending on the markers they process. Monocyte gating is a visual means by which to organize the collected data to show the percentage of each monocyte subset.
