Keratoconus (KCN) is a progressive bilateral corneal ectatic disorder. Â It manifests as characteristic cone-like steepening of the cornea associated with irregular stromal thinning, resulting in a cone-like bulge (protrusion) and significant loss of vision.

Optical effects include a significant and variable reduction in visual acuity, image distortion, and increased sensitivity to glare and light. The significant asymmetry reduces the ability of spherocylindrical spectacle lenses to adequately correct vision.

KCN may remain subclinical (i.e., undetected) and simply be classified as slightly asymmetric oblique astigmatism.

The manifest clinical onset of keratoconus (KCN) may occur at puberty (late teens for male and early twenties for female population) and may progress (continuous stromal thinning and corneal steepening) until the third to fourth decade. Beyond this age, it is very rare that there is any progression. In rare cases, KCN may become manifest at a later age, following alteration in the endocrinologic status such as gestation or pregnancy.

The manifestation and the progression of the disease are highly variable and are most often asymmetric between the two eyes of the same patient. It is widely accepted that there is no unilateral KCN, in the sense of unilateral disease; even when there are no clinical signs of the disease in the fellow eye, it is still considered that is simply not manifest in that eye. Severe KCN may develop in acute hydrops.
