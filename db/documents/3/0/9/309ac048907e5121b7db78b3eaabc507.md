Complications of primary headaches are most often secondary to the temporary loss of normal function that they pose and can include loss of workdays and productivity. One complication of treating chronic primary headaches is medication overuse headache, also known as a rebound headache. This phenomenon occurs when tolerance develops to headache analgesia. In this instance, the headache is no longer responsive to treatment and worsens precipitously when the analgesic is abruptly stopped.

Complications of secondary headache range from mild, temporary disability and discomfort to severe neurologic disability and even death. It is critical for clinicians to consider secondary causes of headaches through a comprehensive primary and secondary survey to ensure that the underlying pathology of a patient’s headache is correctly managed, minimizing complications of late treatment.
