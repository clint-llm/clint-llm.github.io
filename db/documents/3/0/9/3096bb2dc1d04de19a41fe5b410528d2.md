The spinal nerves form when the ventral and dorsal rootlets from the spinal cord converge. The ventral rami of the C5 through T1 spinal nerves form the roots of the brachial plexus. A dorsal root ganglion is a group of neuronal cell bodies that lies proximal to the convergence of the spinal nerves. Injuries that occur proximal to the dorsal root ganglion are appropriately termed “preganglionic,” while injuries distal to the dorsal root ganglion are termed “postganglionic.” Distinguishing between preganglionic and postganglionic BPI has substantial implications for treatment and prognosis. The chance of spontaneous recovery after preganglionic injury is low and therefore requires early surgical intervention. Avulsions of the C8 and T1 nerve roots may concomitantly injure the sympathetic ganglion, resulting in Horner syndrome, which presents with the pathognomonic triad of miosis, ptosis, and anhydrosis.
