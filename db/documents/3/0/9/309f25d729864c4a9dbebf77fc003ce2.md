A comprehensive approach is crucial for managing patients with cancer-associated retinopathy. An appropriately high index of suspicion and early diagnosis and treatment plays an imperative role in curtailing the risk of irreversible immunological damage to the retinal cells in these patients. Hence, a multi-disciplinary approach for complete evaluation and treatment is vital for properly managing this condition, even though there is no consensus on the standard treatment protocol.

For instance, when a patient is suspected of having cancer-associated retinopathy, a prompt referral by the treating physician or oncologist to the ophthalmologist is recommended. This is to be followed by collaborative planning between the oncologist, ophthalmologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist, radiologist, or even a uveitis specialist accustomed to administering the immunomodulatory agents.

Therefore, this condition requires interprofessional teamwork. This includes evaluation by the physician/clinician or oncologist, the ophthalmologist, dispensing of medicinesÂ by the pharmacist, aiding in patient education for treatment compliance as well as monitoring the vitals by the nurses, and thorough evaluation of the visual acuity by the optometrist. This united interprofessional approach is decisive in managing the patients and acquiring favorable outcomes. [Level 5]
