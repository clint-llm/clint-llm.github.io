Hypocalcemia is an electrolytic abnormality that can have detrimental effects on the patients' health, if not discovered and corrected. When approaching a patient with hypocalcemia and considering the underlying etiology, hungry bone syndrome (HBS) is a forgotten and underdiagnosed cause. HBS most often appears in the post-operative period of patients who have undergone parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy; however, it has also been shown to be a possibility in patients with osteoblastic metastases.
