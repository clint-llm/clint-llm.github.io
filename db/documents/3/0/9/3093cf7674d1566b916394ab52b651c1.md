**Cerebral Venous Thrombosis**

Cerebral venous thrombosis is a relatively rare disorder that can have dramatic consequences, including mortality. It occurs when a thrombosis of either the dural sinuses or cerebral veins materialize. A cerebral venous thrombosis typically presents in a myriad of conditions but can be fatal if missed. Therefore it is of utmost importance for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for any patient that presents with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, benign intracranial hypertension, severe headache, focal neurological deficit, seizures, or meningoencephalitis.

The risk factors for cerebral venous thrombosis, are typically those that create a prothrombic state. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, cancer, pregnancy, a post-partum state, and thrombophilia. One study found that 34% of patients who had a CVT had comorbidity of one of the following thrombophilia conditions; Protein C/S deficiency, Factor V Leiden, antithrombin deficiency, prothrombin mutation 20210, and hyperhomocysteinemia. In addition to genetic mutations, clinicians should suspect a cerebral venous thrombosis in any patient with head trauma, or post neurological surgery procedures, including jugular vein catheterization. Preferred modalities for imaging include non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan, CT venography, magnetic resonance imaging, or magnetic resonance venography.

**Cavernous Sinus Syndrome**

Cavernous sinus syndrome presents when there is a compromise of the venous plexus that lies between the dural layers and the periosteal part of the skull, typically due to compression of the cranial nerves. It usually presents with proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, conjunctival congestion, horner's syndrome, and trigeminal sensory loss. The structures involved in cavernous sinus syndrome include the abducens nerve, the internal carotid artery, and the sympathetic plexus. There is often a delay in diagnosis, making it imperative that physicians retain a high index of suspicion for any patient who presents with the mentioned constellation of symptoms.
