A large number of pathologies can be identified by the examiner based purely on the findings of this examination. Foreign bodies in the external auditory canal can be retrieved in the clinic. Topical antibiotics and steroid therapy can be prescribed to treat otitis externa, and oral antibiotics can be prescribed to treat otitis media.

Findings may prompt further investigation. Computed tomography of the temporal boneÂ may be indicated in the presence of signs of acute middle ear infection, trauma, or cholesteatoma. Magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted in findings of facial nerve palsy or unilateral sensorineural deafness. The identification of any hearing loss can guide further formalized hearing tests such as pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry.

Findings may also prompt surgical planning; for example, in the presence of cholesteatoma, large tympanic membrane perforation, or pinna abnormalities.
