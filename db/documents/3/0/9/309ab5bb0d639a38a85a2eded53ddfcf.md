Observation of apocrine gland cells with light microscopy reveals the decapitation of the luminal portion of the secretory cells. The luminal portion of the cells is lined with microvilli. The ultrastructure reveals two types of cytoplasmic granules: small (approximately 50 nm) and large (variable in size). The small granules are round and elongated with aÂ mitochondrial-like internal structure. The large granules are also round and contain fine electron-dense particles.
