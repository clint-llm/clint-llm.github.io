The mainstay of treatmentÂ involves management of the underlying malignancy which results in resolution of associated seborrheic keratoses in about 50% of patients. In addition, symptomatic lesions may be destroyed with various physical methods including cryotherapy, curettage, shave removal, and electrodesiccation. Patients with asymptomatic lesions require no further treatment for the seborrheic keratoses besides the treatment of their malignancy.
