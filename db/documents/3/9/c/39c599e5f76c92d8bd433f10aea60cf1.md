The retrograde flow of gastric acid and pepsin induces laryngeal mucosal damage and impaired mucociliary clearance. This may occur in isolation, but symptoms may be worsened when LPR is exacerbated by vocal abuse, development of mucosal lesions, or a chronic cough caused by the esophageal-bronchial reflex, in which acid within the distal esophagus causes vagal stimulation and thereby induces a cough response.
