Arteriovenous fistulas were originally described by William Hunter as early as 1757.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases reported as of 2013, over 468,000 patients were on hemodialysis. Twenty percent of those patients receive dialysis via a surgically created AVF. In the HEMO Study published in 2000, AVF prevalence varied between dialysis centers from 4-77%. The authors discovered a decreased prevalence of AVF compared to other means of hemodialysis in females, blacks, obese, elderly, and patients with peripheral arterial disease. Geographically, the rate of AVF creation varies greatly, with the highest rates being in the Northeast and the lowest in the Southwest of the United States.
