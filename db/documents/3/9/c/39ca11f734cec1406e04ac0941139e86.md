Patients should be educated on the risk factors commonly associated with ICVT. Patients with an elevated risk of hypercoagulable states such as protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, G20210 prothrombin gene variant, and factor V Leiden thrombophilia should be made aware of their risk of forming clots. Having good follow up with a PCP and hematologist helps mitigate risk factors.

Patients with malignancy should also be aware of their increased risk of clot formation, which could lead to ICVT. Patients on medication such as oral contraception, oncology medicine, estrogen supplementation, and hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of forming clots. Patients with a previous history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis are also at a higher risk. Patients with multiple risk factors should be counseled extensively on the risk and benefits of initiating treatment given their past medical history.
