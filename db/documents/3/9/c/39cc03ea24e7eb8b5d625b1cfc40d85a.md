As shown in the figure below, the conversion of Phe to Tyr by PAH requires BH4 and a deficiency of BH4 can cause hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) even in the presence of wild-type PAH. If a newborn has a positive screen for HPA, further testing should be performed for pterins. Although beyond the scope of this review, it is possible to diagnose all forms of BH4 deficiencies based on the pattern of pterins.
