The prognosis of patients with an abdominal abscess before the era of the CT scan was very high. Today, with the availability of CT scans, the diagnosis is made much earlier, and, in many cases, CT-guided drainage has helped lower morbidity. However, if an abdominal abscess is misdiagnosed and not treated, the mortality is very high. Risk factors that increase mortality and morbidity include the following:

- Advanced age

- Multi-organ failure

- Multiple recent surgeries

- Complex abscess

- Delay in diagnosis
