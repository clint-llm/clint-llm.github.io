Endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) is a procedure to harvest the greater saphenous vein (GSV), the most widely used conduit in coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This procedure is performed by making small incisions and using an endoscopic camera like a blunt dissector to create a subcutaneous tissue tunnel under the skin. The activity outlines the main steps of the procedure and explains the role of the healthcare team who perform this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the greater saphenous vein in detail.
- Review the steps of endoscopic vein harvesting and explain the importance of preoperative venous mapping. 
- Outline the advantage of endoscopic vein harvesting in comparison to the conventional (open) technique. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate selection of candidates for endoscopic vein harvesting and to enhance outcomes.
