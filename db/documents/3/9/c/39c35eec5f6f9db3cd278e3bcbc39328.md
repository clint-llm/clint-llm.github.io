Olanzapine is an atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic that exerts its action primarily on dopamine and serotonin receptors. It works on dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway as an antagonist, blocking dopamine from potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. Olanzapine binds loosely to the receptor and dissociates easily, allowing for normal dopamine neurotransmission.

The effect on the D2 receptors leads to a decrease in positive symptoms in patients, including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech, thought, and behavior. Olanzapine works similarly on serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex as an antagonist.

The effect of olanzapine on serotonin decreases negative symptoms, including anhedonia, flat affect, alogia, avolition, and poor attention.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: Daily administration of olanzapine leads to reaching the steady-state plasma concentration in about one week. The time to peak concentration is 6 hours for oral formulation and 15-45 minutes for IM formulation. Olanzapine has a half-life of 21 to 54 hours, with an average of 30 hours.

Distribution: The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 liters, and the medication is distributed widely throughout the body. It is 93% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.

Metabolism: Olanzapine is extensively metabolized by the liver by glucuronidation and the cytochrome P450 system. This system's enzymes that metabolize olanzapine are primarily CYP1A2 and, minorly, CYP2D6. CYP1A2 genes are poly-morphic; however, a study showed no reported associations between various polymorphisms and pharmacokinetics of the medication.

Excretion: The half-life of olanzapine is approximately 30 hours (varies between 21 to 54 hours). Olanzapine is excreted primarily via the renal route (57%) and feces (30%).
