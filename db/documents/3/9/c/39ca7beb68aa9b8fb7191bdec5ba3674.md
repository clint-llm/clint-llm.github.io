**Pharmacokinetics**

**Oral administration and absorption:**Pentoxifylline is rapidly and completely absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. It is usually recommended with meals (food or milk) to minimize gastrointestinal irritation. It is usually a sustained-release tablet with an early peak plasma pentoxifylline concentration two to three hours postadministration.

**Bioavailability**: 20% to 30%, because of a high first-pass clearance.

**Metabolism:**Erythrocytes and the liver extensively metabolize pentoxifylline to its active metabolites (M1).

**Excretion:**Pentoxifylline and its metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidneys and less than 5% by feces. On the other hand, its key metabolites are also secreted in breast milk. The half-life of pentoxifylline is about 0.4 hours to 0.8 hours, and its metabolites are about 1 to 1.5 hours.
