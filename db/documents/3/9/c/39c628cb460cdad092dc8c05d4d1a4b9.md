As stated earlier, rhinoplasty is one of the most challenging surgical procedures, and one of the main reasons for this is its limited predictability. An immediate good result postoperatively may not be so one year later. This can be attributed mainly to the many variables involved in the healing process. The individual reactions of the different nasal tissues are not always anticipated, and therefore, unfavorable results can occur.

Although the risk for major complications is low,

Surgical complications can be defined as hemorrhagic, infectious, traumatic, functional, and aesthetic.

**Hemorrhagic Complications**

- **Epistaxis**: Postoperative bleeds are a common complication in rhinoplasty. They tend to be mild and usually resolve by head elevation, nasal decongestants, and compression. If bleeding continues, an anterior tamponage should be performed, and the patient reassessed. If bleeding persists in spite of the anterior tamponage, posterior bleeding should be suspected, and a posterior tampon will be required. Although severe bleeds are rare, sometimes an endoscopic approach or angiographic embolization could be needed.

- **Septal Hematoma**: It represents an early complication that can lead to serious injury if not treated promptly. Septal hematoma appears as a postoperative tender mass in the septal area. It is usually painful, and the patient can also present with fever, anosmia, and airflow obstruction. If suspected, septal hematomas should be drained in an early manner in order to prevent infection and loss of septal cartilage. After drainage, anterior tamponage should be placed, and the patient reassessed in 24 hours. If a septal abscess is suspected, antibiotic therapy must be started immediately.

The use of anti-fibrinolytic drugs in plastic surgery has been investigated in the last years to diminish hemorrhagic complications. The number one drug in this family is tranexamic acid (TXA) and can be administered intravenously in a 10 mg/kg concentration previous to anesthetic induction. Studies have shown that TXA decreases the intraoperative bleeding rate, eyelid edema, and periorbital ecchymosis.

**Infectious Complications**: Infections after rhinoplasty can range from mild cellulitis to severe systemic infectious processes. Cellulitis may be seen after rhinoplasty as an early complication. It usually presents a favorable response to cephalosporins, but close observation is necessary for preventing progression. Septal abscesses can be a complication of a non-treated hematoma, and surgical drainage followed by antibiotics is the treatment of choice. They can appear in the septal region, tip, or dorsum. Severe infectious processes are very rare. They occur in less than 1% of the cases.

**Traumatic Complications**: These include septal deformities or collapse due to injury to the L-strut, intracranial injuries, and injury to the lacrimal system. In the case of an unnoticed septal injury, deformities are usually seen as a late complication, as the soft tissue envelope contracts over the nasal framework. These often require secondary procedures in order to correct them. If a septal injury is noticed during surgery, it must be repaired before closure.

**Intracranial injury**is a rare complication and can produce a cerebrospinal fluid leak, which manifests as rhinorrhea and headaches. This complication requires hospital admission and neurosurgical evaluation.

**Injury to the Lacrimal Ducts:**This can produce epiphora that can present with bleeding. It may be caused by lateral osteotomies, and its treatment sometimes will require duct intubation. It is important to know that epiphora can be present in the first few weeks after the procedure due to edema compressing the lacrimal ducts, which typically resolves spontaneously.

**Functional Complications**:

- **Septal Perforation**: Defined as continuity defects, they can be produced by tears in the manipulation of mucoperichondrial flaps or an unnoticed septal hematoma. The importance of preventing tears or repairing them if found is important for their prevention. Once the perforation occurs postoperatively, it can range from a small perforation producing whistling while breathing to large perforations, causing epistaxis and rhinitis due to turbulent airflow. If symptoms are mild due to a small perforation, treatment may not be needed. Larger perforations will require surgical treatments using flaps, with a high recurrence rate.

- **Nasal adhesions**: The presence of synechiae can occur between abraded mucosal surfaces. They can be prevented with the use of a Silastic splint during septoplasty. If found postoperatively, they should be divided surgically.

- **Rhinitis**: This is often a temporary complication, especially when an obstructed airway has been improved. It may produce nasal discharge, dryness, and breathing issues. It is usually treated with topical agents. If rhinorrhea persists after a few weeks, a cerebrospinal fluid leak must be suspected.

**Aesthetic Complications:**These usually appear as late complications and may develop in different nasal regions. In the tip area, asymmetries and tip deformities due to grafting are sometimes encountered. This is dependent on many aspects like the thickness of the skin, the number of grafts used, and ways of fixation. Their resolution should be deferred at least one year after the first surgery. In the dorsal area, under-resection or over-resection of the septal cartilage can manifest as a residual hump, a middle vault collapse, or a pollybeak deformity. The latter is characterized by a convex formation over the supratip area, which originates tip ptosis. It can be produced, paradoxically, by over-resection of the cartilaginous dorsum. This produces scar tissue formation in the dead space area. This soft tissue pollybeak deformity may be treated with injected Triamcinolone and taping
