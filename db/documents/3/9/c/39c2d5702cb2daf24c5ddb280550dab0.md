Unlike the tibia, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone. Its main function is to combine with the tibia and provide stability to the ankle joint. The distal end of the fibula has several grooves for ligament attachments which then stabilize and provide leverage during the ankle movements. The lateral (fibular) collateral ligament attaches to the lateral side of theÂ fibular head. This ligament provides knee stability. However, the fibula itself has a little role in providing knee stability.
