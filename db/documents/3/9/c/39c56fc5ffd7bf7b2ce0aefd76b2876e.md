Orthostatic hypotension is more frequent in elderly patients because of multiple factors such as supine hypertension, age-related changes in baroreflexes and vasoconstrictor responses and a decrease in muscle tone, cardiac and vascular compliance. Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension showed a prevalence of 18% in patients older than 65  years and resulted in syncope in 9.4% of patients in the NIH funded Framingham cohort.
