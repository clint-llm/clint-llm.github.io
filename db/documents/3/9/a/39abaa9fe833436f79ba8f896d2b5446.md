**Causes of Physiologic Nipple Discharge**

- Pregnancy

- Lactation

- Postpartum galactorrhea may last up to two years after delivery

- After spontaneous or intentional termination of pregnancy

- Fibrocystic changes of the breast

- Hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle

**Causes of Pathologic Nipple Discharge**

- Infection (periductal mastitis)

- Breast abscess

- Neoplastic process of the breasts (e.g., intraductal carcinoma, Paget disease of breast)

- Pituitary tumor/prolactinoma

- Thoracic/breast trauma

- Systemic disease/endocrinopathies that elevate prolactin level (e.g., hypothyroidism, disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, chronic kidney or liver disorders)

- A side effect of medications that inhibit dopamine secretion (e.g., opioids, oral contraceptives, antihypertensives (methyldopa, reserpine, verapamil), antidepressants, and antipsychotics)
