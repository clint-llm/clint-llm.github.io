After identification of the etiology of the pulmonary restriction, patients should be oriented on the treatment options available for them. For patients with progressive disease, pulmonary rehabilitation centers aid in counseling patients about their breathing and oxygen needs as well as teach exercises that can improve respiratory function and mitigate symptoms. At times, exercise and weight loss can prove effective, especially when obesity is the main factor leading to pulmonary restriction.
