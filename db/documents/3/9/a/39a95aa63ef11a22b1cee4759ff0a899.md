Pregnancy is the state of carrying a developing embryo or fetus. The human gestational period is 39 weeks and is divided into trimesters, the first spanning from week zero to week twelve.  During this time frame, numerous significant developmental milestones occur as the fetus develops. Additionally, as the fetus grows, it becomes visible via ultrasonography, and laboratory testing can be performed to track progression.
