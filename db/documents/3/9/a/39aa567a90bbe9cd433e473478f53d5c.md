Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a complex set of diseases with the involvement of renal as well as other organs.

The timely diagnosis and treatment are the key. The primary care providers play a pivotal role by referring the patient to the nephrologist promptly. A patient needs to be admitted to a skilled facility where dialysis and other critical care facilities are within the premises.

Even after the discharge, usually, patients are sent on immunosuppressive therapy. They need closed clinical follow up for possible recovery and opportunistic infections. Infection should be treated once diagnosed, and the decision should be made on either stopping or decreasing the doses of the therapy depending on individual cases.

Patients with poor outcomes usually end up on lifelong dialysis. They should be comprehensively managed as end-stage kidney disease patients requiring dialysis, and timely referrals for kidney transplants should be made as a modality of treatment.
