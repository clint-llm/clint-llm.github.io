Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a collection of clinical signs and symptoms resulting from either partial or complete obstruction of blood flow through the SVC. This obstruction is most commonly a result of thrombus formation or tumor infiltration of the vessel wall. The superior vena cava is formed by the junction of the left and right innominate (brachiocephalic) veins and is tasked with returning blood from the head, neck, upper extremities, and torso back to the heart. Today, this syndrome is most commonly seen secondary to malignancy, although there has been a more recent rise in benign etiologies. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of superior vena cava syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of superior vena cava syndrome.
- Review the pathophysiology of superior vena cava syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment options for superior vena cava syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by superior vena cava syndrome.
