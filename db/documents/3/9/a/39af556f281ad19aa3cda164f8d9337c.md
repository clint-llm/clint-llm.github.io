While there are many benefits to telehealth, all healthcare workers should be familiar with hospital bylaws and state laws regarding the practice of telemedicine. Telehealth does not allow the healthcare worker to examine the patient as one would in an office and that is a major drawback. Countless cases already have appeared in court following an erroneous diagnosis of patients following a telehealth consult. In addition, there is a concern of violating HIPPA laws following the transmission of medical records online. The onus is on the healthcare provider to know the laws otherwise one risks litigation and loss of medical/nursing license.
