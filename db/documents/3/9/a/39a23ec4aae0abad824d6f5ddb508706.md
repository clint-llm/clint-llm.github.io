In patients with certain medical conditions, bismuth subsalicylate should not be used. BSS should be avoided in:

- Patients undergoing oral treatments for gastric and intestinal conditions with anticoagulants, sulfinpyrazone, probenecid, methotrexate, or any medication with high salicylate concentrations

- Patients with gastrointestinal ulceration or hemophilia

- Patients with bleeding problems or bloody/black stools before administration of BSS

- Children less than 12 years of age 

- There is limited data for BSS use in children under the age of 12 years old; other treatment options may be preferable.

- Children or adolescents with flu-like symptoms 

- Although not yet reported, BSS may potentially cause Reye's syndrome in pediatrics or adolescents recovering from influenza or varicella.

- Patients sensitive or allergic to salicylates

- In patients who have demonstrated sensitivity toward aspirin, it is advisable not to use bismuth subsalicylate.

For patients with any of the listed conditions, the suggestion is that they use alternative treatment options. Patients should be cautious in using bismuth subsalicylate when traveling to countries where malaria is prevalent, as it can decrease the absorption of doxycycline, which is an effective antimicrobial for prophylaxis against malaria.
