Guyon canal syndrome is a relatively uncommon ulnar neuropathy. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the variety of presenting signs and symptoms depending on the exact location of nerve compression in addition to the individual anatomic variations within the Guyon canal itself. Although there are several articles suggesting approaches to diagnosis and management of Guyon canal syndrome, due to a lack of large-scale empirical studies comprehensive guidelines have not yet been firmly established. For instance, it is unclear when a patient suspected of Guyon canal syndrome should receive additional, more expensive testing such as MRI, or at which level of severity and duration of symptoms these additional tests are required.
