Urethritis is typically a sexually transmitted infection with most cases caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma.

Typical presentation includes dysuria and penile discharge.

Diagnosis is based on positive discharge on an exam or more than 2 WBC seen on microscopy or presence of leukocytes on urinalysis  (or 10 WBC on first-void urine catch).

Initial empiric treatment should be started at the time of diagnosis. Treatment for NGU when gonococcal infection can be rule out based on microscope examination includes azithromycin 1 g orally once or doxycycline 100 mg twice per day for 7 days. If a gonococcal infection cannot be ruled out treatment should add ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly once to cover for gonococcal infection.

Patients should be instructed to avoid sex for 1 week and until partners are treated. Partners should be tested and treated for urethritis.
