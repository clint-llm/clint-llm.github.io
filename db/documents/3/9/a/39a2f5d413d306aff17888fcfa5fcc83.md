Untreated dermal exposure to phenol may result in partial or full-thickness chemical burns or necrotic soft tissue damage. The systemic complications of severe phenol toxicity are myriad. Mental status depression or seizures may result in airway compromise and respiratory failure. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may necessitate mechanical ventilation. Ventricular arrhythmias and/or cardiovascular collapse may occur. Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis may result from extensive rhabdomyolysis or hemoglobinuria due to intravascular hemolysis. Reports also exist of acute hepatotoxicity and methemoglobinemia.
