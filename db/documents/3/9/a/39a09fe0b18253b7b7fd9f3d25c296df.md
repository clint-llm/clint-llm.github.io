Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is an uncommon but aggressive subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The diagnosis of PBL is difficult because its features overlap with myeloma and lymphoma. The primary organs involved are usually the gastrointestinal system, lymph nodes, oral mucosa and sometimes the skin. It has a very aggressive disease course comprising relapses and refractoriness to chemotherapy. This activity reviews plasmablastic lymphoma, its causes, presentation, diagnosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of plasmablastic lymphoma.
- Outline the presentation of plasmablastic lymphoma.
- Describe the management options available for plasmablastic lymphoma.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by plasmablastic lymphoma.
