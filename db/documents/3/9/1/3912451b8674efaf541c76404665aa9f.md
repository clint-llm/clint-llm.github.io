The most basic type of motor coordination is a spinal reflex. From the neuroectoderm, the neural plate (central thickening of cells) originates, which subsequently turns into a neural groove and neural tube. During the formation of the tube, the cells that form the neural crests differentiate, bordering on the ectoderm (at the level of the neural folds) and from the neural tube originates the spinal cord and the encephalon, while from the neural crests originate the peripheral nervous system and the spinal ganglia.

Between the fifth and seventh week of gestation, the myotatic reflex of primitive stretching begins to develop.
