The peak incidence of a primary or idiopathic type of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been observed to range from 50 to 70 years of age. However, it may occur in any age group.

A retrospective analysis of patients seeking medical attention for BPPV in the United States recorded the incidence of 64 per 100,000 annually. Furthermore, this was found to escalate by 38% with each decade.

A cross-sectional study observed a point prevalence of 9% and a high rate of unrecognized BPPV in a cohort of older patients presenting with balance-related complaints.
