Solitary neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve tumors that also arise from cells of Schwann that more classically involve the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Like neurilemmomas, neurofibromas are very slow-growing tumors but differ in their histology in that they are not encapsulated as neurilemmomas are. Histopathologically compared to neurofibromas, and protein staining is classically limited to peripheral axons in neurilemmomas.
