Normal anatomic or aberrant palmaris longus muscles can infrequently cause median and ulnar nerve compression, leading to carpal or Guyon canal compression-like clinical presentations. The muscle can also be mistaken for soft tissue tumors of the forearm. While extremely rare, aberrant palmaris longus muscles can also cause compression of additional surrounding structures such as the ulnar artery.
