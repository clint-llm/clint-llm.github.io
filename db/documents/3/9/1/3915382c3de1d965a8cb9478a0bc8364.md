The adverse effects of procainamide include cardiac toxicity, bradycardia, hypotension, drug-induced lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, and blood dyscrasias. QRS, QTc, and PR prolongation are the most potentially harmful cardiac side effects of procainamide and may become worse when levels of procainamide rise. Serial electrocardiograms are useful for monitoring these toxic effects during treatment with procainamide. Procainamide infusion may also increase the number of premature ventricular contractions in patients.

Another side effect of procainamide is hypotension, more commonly seen at doses of 20 mg/min. Drug-induced lupus erythematosus-like syndrome is rare and occurs due to the creation of positive ANA titers when taking the medication chronically. The symptoms of chronic use may include arthritis, arthralgias, and pleuritis and commonly resolve when usage stops.

Lastly, procainamide is known to cause certain blood dyscrasias. Procainamide has been known to cause bone marrow toxicity, leading to pancytopenia or agranulocytosis; this is usually due to hypersensitivity or varied immunologic mechanisms.
