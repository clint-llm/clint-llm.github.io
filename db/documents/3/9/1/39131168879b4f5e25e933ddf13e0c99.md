Because small cell lung cancer has a very poor prognosis, the emphasis today is on screening and prevention. The role of the pharmacist and nurse is indispensable as they are always the first and last to see these patients. There is ample evidence that cessation of smoking can decrease the incidence of small cell cancer. The pharmacist has several antismoking aids that can be recommended to these patients. Early evidence shows that the rates of smoking have started to decline in males; but unfortunately for females, the reverse is true.

The role of screening for lung cancer is debatable and only approved for people with several risk factors like smokers, family history, and workers in the asbestos industry.

**Evidence-Based Outcomes**

Close to 70% of patients with small cell lung cancer have disseminated disease at the time of presentation.  At this stage, the cancer is not curable, and the prognosis is poor. Even with chemotherapy, the majority of patients are dead within 24 months, and less than 2% are alive at five years. For individuals with localized lung disease, treatment with chemotherapy and radiation does offer a better survival of 80% at two years, but less than 15% are alive at five years.
