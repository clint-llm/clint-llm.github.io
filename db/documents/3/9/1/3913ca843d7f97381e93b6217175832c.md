The prognosis for most patients with hand, foot, and mouth disease is excellent. Most patients recover within a few weeks without any residual sequelae. Acute illness usually lasts 10 to 14 days, and the infection rarely recurs or persists. However, some patients with hand, foot, and mouth disease may develop serious complications, which include the following:

- Persistent stomatitis is associated with painful ulcers. The pain can be severe enough to limit food intake, and dehydration can result, especially in young children.

- Aseptic meningitis can occur, but this is more common with enterovirus 71. This particular virus is associated with a higher rate of neurological involvement compared to coxsackievirus. The individual may develop acute cerebellar ataxia, polio-like syndrome, encephalitis, benign intracranial hypertension, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The virus is believed to induce damage to the gray matter, resulting in motor dysfunction.

- Coxsackievirus can rarely cause interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and pulmonary edema.

- Some studies indicate that coxsackievirus infections may also be associated with spontaneous abortions.
