The receptors of proprioception exist within the skeletal muscles and tendons and assist in understanding the locations of the body in space. Proprioception helps to assist our balance, movement, and coordination and is particularly important in the context of maintaining balance in the absence of visual cues. Without proprioception, one may find difficulty walking in dimly-lit or dark environments, as they have trouble understanding where their limbs are when walking. The sensory receptors involved in proprioception include the muscle spindle and the Golgi tendon organ. The muscle spindle is in parallel with muscle fibers and contains a fusiform capsule in the center of the muscle and is innervated by gamma (A-gamma) motor neurons, which help communicate changes in the length of the muscle fibers during movement and in different positions. This information is communicated by type Ia and type II sensory fibers. The Golgi tendon organ is innervated by type Ib afferent neurons and is found in the tendons, continuously signaling muscle tension status. Together these components help create a sense of the human body in space (proprioception) and participate in reflex arcs.
