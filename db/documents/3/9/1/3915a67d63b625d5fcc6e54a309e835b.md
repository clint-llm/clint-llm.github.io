The prognosis for barotrauma is good as most of these conditions are self-limiting.

AGE, however, is the most serious potential complication of pulmonary barotrauma and likely is fatal if not properly treated with HBO2. Recent case series suggest the mortality rates range from 12% to 30% with HBO therapy and around 25% of survivors experience permanent neurologic sequelae.

Inner ear barotrauma usually resolves spontaneously but may result in permanent inner ear damage.

Nitrogen narcosis also carries a good prognosis as it resolves completely with ascent. The main danger stems from poor judgment which can lead to drowning.
