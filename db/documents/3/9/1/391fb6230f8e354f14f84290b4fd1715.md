In general, most patients have a prior history of perianal abscess, which was either drained by a physicianÂ or drained spontaneously. The area in which the drainage occurred, there is chronic drainage, which remains weeks to months later. The area occasionally flares with pain and increased drainage, and the patient presents with this chronic draining sinus tract. The diagnosis is usually made with history and examination of the perineum. This is considered an elective case, and the procedure is offered to the patient as an exam under anesthesia and fistulotomy or Seton placement. It is important to pre-operatively ask about any history or family history of Crohn disease as well as fecal incontinence. In patients with Crohn disease, as well as females with an anterior fistula, they are best served with a non-cutting Seton placement and not a fistulotomy. If there is uncertainty in the depth of the tract, a Seton is also a safer option.
