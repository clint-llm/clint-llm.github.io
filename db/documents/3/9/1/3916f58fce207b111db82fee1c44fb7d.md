Generally, the prognosis for the less severe infections secondary to GAS is good, with very low morbidity and mortality rates. This is true of pharyngitis, cellulitis, and impetigo, which are effectively treated with standard oral antibiotic therapy and, in the vast majority of cases, even resolve spontaneously without medical intervention. Given the exceedingly low mortality rate from these types of infections, there is very little data to accurately quantify annual mortality rates.

On the other hand, the more invasive and severe infections caused by GAS do carry with them a significant mortality and morbidity rate. Based on most recent studies, toxic shock syndrome carries approximately a 5Â to 10% mortality rate with a worse prognosis for those at the extremes of age and those with preexisting conditions. Even worse, mortality rates are present in those diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. Recent data have demonstrated mortality rates between 25% and 35% and a nearly ubiquitous need for surgical intervention, which adds to morbidity for those who survive their infection. An even worse prognosis exists for those concurrently diagnosed with toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, as these individuals have mortality rates up to 60%.
