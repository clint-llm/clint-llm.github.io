Epigastric artery rupture can occur when there is direct abdominal trauma or excessively forceful contraction of the abdominal wall. The resulting hematoma may present differently depending on whether it arises in the upper or lower abdomen. When the superior epigastric artery is injured, the resulting hematoma is typically smaller and quickly tamponaded within the rectus sheath. On the other hand, rupture of the inferior epigastric artery is not as easily controlled, owing to the lack of posterior sheath. This allows the development of a larger and generally more clinically significant hematoma.

Rectus sheath hematomas are designated as type I, which is unilateral and occurs within the rectus muscle,  type II hematoma, which may be unilateral or bilateral, within the rectus muscle, or between the muscle and transversalis fascia, and type III that extends into the peritoneum and the prevesical space.
