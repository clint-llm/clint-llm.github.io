An intrathecal drug delivery system consists of two parts, a pump, and an intrathecal catheter. The pump serves as the drug reservoir, and it is implanted under the subcutaneous tissue in the abdominal area. The second is the catheter which attaches to the pump and delivers medications directly into the intrathecal space.  Generally, catheter tip placement is at the level of the spinal cord that innervates the body region comprising the primary pain generator.

To date, three medications have been specifically authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intrathecal delivery.  Morphine is a mu-opioid receptor agonist that utilizes its spinal effects by binding to receptors in the substantia gelatinosa located in the dorsal column.  Pre and post-synaptic receptor activation with morphine yields to the dampening of ascending pain-related neural activity. The second FDA-approved approved intrathecal analgesic is ziconotide, a potent drug derived from the neurotoxic venom of cone snails.  Ziconotide exerts its analgesic effect by reversibly antagonizing the pre-synaptic N-type voltage-gated calcium channels expressed by nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn.
