As previously mentioned, necrotizing periodontal diseases are almost always found in patients with immunosuppression or psychological stress.

Patients will usually report excruciating pain, fetid oral odor, and rapid onset of the condition, characteristic of necrotizing periodontal diseases - necrotizing periodontitis can lead to loss of periodontal attachment in as short as a few days.

The most typical clinical sign of NPDs is tissue necrosis, seen as ulcerated and necrotic gingiva, with a distinctive “punched-out” or “cratered” appearance.
