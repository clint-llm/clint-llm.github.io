Empagliflozin works by inhibiting the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) found in the proximal tubules in the kidneys. Through SGLT2 inhibition, empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of glucose and increases urinary excretion of glucose. The glucose-lowering effect of the drug is independent of insulin. In type 2 diabetes patients, urinary glucose excretion increased by approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg of empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg. Empagliflozin reduces sodium and volume load, causing intravascular contraction through its diuretic and natriuretic properties.
