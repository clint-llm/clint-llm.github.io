Common toxins produced by C. perfringens:

- Alpha toxin: Lecithinase (or phospholipase) that breaks down cell membrane resulting in cell death and tissue necrosis. This toxin is also hemolytic and cardiotoxic.

- Beta toxin: Necrosis of tissue

- Delta toxin: Hemolysin

- Epsilon toxin: Acts to increase cell membrane permeability; permease.

- Iota toxin: Necrosis of tissue

- Kappa toxin: Collagenase, gelatinase, necrosis of tissue. Especially leads to destruction of blood vessels and connective tissue.

- Lambda toxin: Protease

- Mu toxin: Hyaluronidase

- Nu toxin: Deoxyribonuclease, hemolytic and necrosis of tissue

- Phi toxin: Hemolysin, cytolysin
