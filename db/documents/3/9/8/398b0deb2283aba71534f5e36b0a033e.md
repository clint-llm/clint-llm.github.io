Prevention revolves primarily in avoiding the risk factors:

-  Vaccination against mumps

-  Safe sex practices to prevent gonorrheal and chlamydial infections

-  Avoid indwelling urinary catheters

-  Surgically correct urinary tract obstructions for eligible patients

All clinical staff should advise patients to take the full course of antibiotics to prevent the emergence of resistance and recurrence.
