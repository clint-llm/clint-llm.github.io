**Acute or Chronic Inflammation**

Acute inflammation has a rapid onset of minutes or hours, usually resolves in a few days, has classic signs and symptoms, and has cellular infiltrate primarily composed of neutrophils. The erythema seen in acute inflammation results from increased blood flow to the affected area due to vasodilation. Cryotherapy is often an effective treatment for the acute inflammation caused by musculoskeletal injury with decreased pain and more rapid “return-to-participation.” Chronic inflammation has a slow onset of days, a long duration of years, less prominent classical signs and symptoms, and cellular infiltrate primarily composed of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes. Chronic exposure to toxic chemicals and environmental agents such as cigarette smoke can cause chronic inflammation.

**Mediators and Biomarkers of Inflammation**

The discovery of cellular and molecular inflammatory mediators and the development of sensitive biomarkers have rapidly advanced our understanding of inflammation and its role in pathology.

- Reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen oxide species (ROS and RNOS)

- Formation of DNA adducts

- Cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-alpha) and chemokines

- Acute-phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein or CRP)

- Prostaglandins

- Cyclooxygenase (COX)-related metabolites

- Inflammation-related growth factors and transcription factors (e.g., NF-kappaB)

- Major immune cell types

The specific immune cells and mediators at play are variable and dependent upon the injury, the onset/duration of the injury, and multiple genetic loci.

CRP is a widely used clinical inflammatory biomarker present in two forms with distinct functions. One form is a homopentamer termed native-CRP (nCRP), and the other is a monomer (mCRP).

**Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease**

Hs-CRP is often used to assess increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

In contrast, the 2018 CANTOS trial on tertiary prevention in patients with a history of myocardial infarction showed that reducing hs-CRP levels by use of canakinumab was effective in reducing (by 25%) a major CVD event but primarily in those patients where treatment lowered hs-CRP to less than 2 mg/ml. Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets interleukin-1-beta and has no effect on plasma lipoprotein levels. It should be noted that most participants in the CANTOS trial were already on statin therapy.

Statins, besides lowering LDL-C, also lower hs-CRP. Nevertheless, a large-scale study found the effectiveness of simvastatin to lower a first major vascular event was unaffected by baseline CRP levels.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic, antipyretic, antiplatelet as well as anti-inflammatory effects. They are among the world’s most used/prescribed medications. The effects of NSAIDs on CRP levels are mixed and dependent upon the particular NSAID. In patients taking NSAIDs for rheumatoid arthritis, naproxen was associated with a decreased CRP; whereas, lumiracoxib was associated with an increased CRP.

**Inflammation, Aging, and Cancer**

Inflammation is closely associated with an increased production of ROS and RNOS, which can damage DNA. Chronic inflammation is, therefore, an ongoing process that can increase mutations and increase cancer risk. Increased cellular or tumor micro-environmental ROS production is associated with diminished control of cell growth. For example, activated macrophages are a major source of ROS, and these inflammatory cells are located in the tumor microenvironment of breast cancer tumors, where they promote growth and metastasis. Chronic inflammation is associated with many types of cancer and all stages of cancer.

Obesity, which increases chronic inflammation, is now recognized as a major (and preventable) increased cancer risk factor. Increasing evidence supports a strong positive association between CRP levels and cancer. For example, elevated CRP (at the time of diagnosis) is associated with breast cancer, breast cancer subtypes, and poor outcome.

Aging is a major risk factor for cancer, and systemic, sterile (non-infection-caused), age-related chronic inflammation (termed inflamm-aging or inflammaging) is thought to be an underlying etiological connection.

**Diet, Exercise, and Inflammation Levels**

Over the last decade, a fairly consistent view has emerged in the relationship between lifestyle and inflammation. Individuals with high CRP levels of greater than 3.0 mg/L tend to be physically inactive, have higher plasma glucose levels, less likely to follow the Mediterranean diet, have a higher incidence of hypertension, have a lower HDL-cholesterol (anti-atherogenic), and increased abdominal obesity. Adopting a Mediterranean diet combined with a medium level of physical activity markedly reduces the incidence of high CRP by 72%.
