Necrotizing gingivitis and necrotizing periodontitis are mainly managed using local measures. The treatment of NPDs depends on the extent and severity of the disease, but in general, initial management includes:

- Gentle mechanical debridement under local anesthesia,

- Removing pseudomembrane with the help of a cotton pellet embedded in 0.12% chlorhexidine,

- Providing oral hygiene instructions

- Indicating either a 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash or hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse

The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as needed should be advised to the patient to help alleviate the pain.

Modifying risk factors and treating underlying systemic conditions are key in managing NPDs. Tobacco smoking, psychological stress, and malnutrition should be managed to reduce the risk of future disease.

Further advice may include taking vitamin supplements, avoiding spicy food, observing appropriate fluid intake, and improving sleep.

Necrotizing periodontitis is a disease of tissue destruction of both soft tissue (gums) and hard tissue (alveolar bone). As a result of the disease, both soft and hard tissue defects can make oral hygiene difficult. After completing the acute treatment phase, patients may undergo treatments to surgically correct any defects, such as a gingivoplasty for smaller soft tissue defects or osteoplasty to repair larger, bony defects.
