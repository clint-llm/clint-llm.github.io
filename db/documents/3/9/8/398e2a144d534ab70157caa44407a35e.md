Parents and patients must be educated about the nature of the disease and should be aware of all the precautionary methods to protect themselves. The patient is advised to avoid unnecessary sun exposure. They should wear protective clothing, use long sleeves, a wide-brimmed hat, shoes (avoid sandals) and wear gloves for driving. They should use reflecting sunscreens that are based on zinc dioxide or titanium oxide as they will be more effective against UVA, UVB, and visible light. During surgery, extra caution is required because these individuals are at risk of burn injuries to the skin and internal organs exposed to the strong lights of operating rooms. Light filters should be used in operating rooms to protect the patient. Patients may need to modify their jobs/employment.

Genetic counseling is very important as EPP is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease. For patients with EPP, the likelihood of having an affected child will depend on whether the other parent carries the hypomorphic IVS3-48T/C allele, which is more common in some populations than others. Testing the other parent can determine this likelihood. If the other parent's FECH genes are both normal, half the children will inherit the severe FECH mutation (which may be passed on to future generations); however, they will not have EPP because they also inherited one normal FECH allele.
