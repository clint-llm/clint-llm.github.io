During an examination of a child suspected of having Little League shoulder, it is important to ask about a history of shoulder or elbow injury. Shoulder and elbow injury history are both important because they could both lead to a child consciously or subconsciously change their throwing mechanics to ease prior elbow pain. Altering mechanics may increase the risk of injury by distributing forces throughout the humerus differently. The examiner should also ask the patient if they have had a recent growth spurt as this likely places him or her at higher risk for proximal humeral epiphysiolysis.

Symptoms typically include a progressive onset of generalized shoulder pain when throwing. As symptoms advance, pain can develop with simply lifting the arm; there may even be pain at rest. However, until the late stages of the condition, the patient will likely report that symptoms improve with rest. Additional symptoms can include diminished throwing accuracy and/or velocity. Up to 13% of patients can have elbow pain in addition to shoulder pain.

On physical exam, patients are often tender to palpation over the growth plate on the lateral aspect of the proximal humerus. There may be subtle swelling; otherwise, inspection and palpation are generally normal. Decreased range of motion and muscle weakness can also be present depending on the severity of the case. Most frequently, weakness is due to guarding secondary to pain.
