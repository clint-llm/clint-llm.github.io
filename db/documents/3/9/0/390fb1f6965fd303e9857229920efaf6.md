The sciatic nerve supplies the vast majority of motor and sensory function to the lower limb. Regional anesthetic blockade of the sciatic nerve can be approached from multiple locations, and ultrasound guidance has become the standard of practice. This activity reviews the anatomy of the sciatic nerve and describes indications, contraindications, and techniques for performing a sciatic nerve block. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing sciatic nerve blocks.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the anatomy of the sciatic nerve.
- Describe the equipment needed for a sciatic nerve block.
- Outline the indications for a sciatic nerve block.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies to enhance coordination, care delivery, and patient outcomes for patients undergoing sciatic nerve blocks.
