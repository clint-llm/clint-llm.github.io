Before beginning TZD therapy and periodically during treatment, patients should have liver function tests (LFT) evaluated. If LFTs are greater than or equal to 3 times the upper limit, then TZD should not be started or should be discontinued. Additionally, physicians should monitor for clinical symptoms of hepatic injury, such as jaundice or dark urine.
