Acute pancreatitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal reasons for hospital admission. Patients should know that although pancreatitis is typically treated using conservative management with IV fluids, complications of pancreatitis can be devastating and might lead to death. It is important to educate patients about the importance of avoiding excessive alcohol intake, which is one of the most preventable causes of acute pancreatitis. Patients should also be encouraged to lead healthy lifestyles to include no smoking, eating a well-balanced diet, and exercising regularly to avoid the development of gallstones, which is one of the most common causes of pancreatitis.
