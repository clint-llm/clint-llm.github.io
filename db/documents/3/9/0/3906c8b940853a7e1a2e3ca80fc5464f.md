Acrokeratoelastoidosis is a rare, benign, and generally asymptomatic condition that usually begins in childhood and is characterized by flesh-colored papules on the lateral areas of the palms, soles, and dorsum of hands. Treatment options have only shown marginal efficacy, however, practitioners should be familiar with this condition so that it can be evaluated properly and other, more concerning forms of ketatodermas that may suggest the possibility of some serious internal disorder or malignancy can be ruled out.
