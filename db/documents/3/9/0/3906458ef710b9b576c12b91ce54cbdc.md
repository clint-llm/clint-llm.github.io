Although central hypersomnia is considered a continuum, the rate of its subtypes differs. IH has the lowest rate compared to narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 (approximately 82%, 13%, and 5%, respectively).

Approximately one-third of cases have a positive family history, with family members having IH or other central disorders of hypersomnolence such as narcolepsy.
