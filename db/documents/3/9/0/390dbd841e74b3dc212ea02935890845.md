Conjunctival biopsy with direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is the most reliable method and the gold standard to confirm the ocular cicatricial pemphigoid diagnosis. About 20% to 40% of patients may have clinical signs of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid but may, in fact, have a negative biopsy result.

A histological analysis will often show positive hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) inflammatory cell staining; periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain, showing decreased goblet cells in the affected tissue; and Giemsa stain, showing an increased mast cell population.
