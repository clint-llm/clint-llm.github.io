Patients and family members should be educated about the natural cause of the condition and the chronicity of it. They need to be aware that there is no cure for laryngeal papilloma and understand the need for multiple surgical interventions in their lifetime. Adjuvant therapy is not effective in all patients, and most modulators are not FDA approved. However, they are a continuous topic of research. Additionally, preventive measures need to be exercised by explaining to patients about the 9-valent HPV vaccine to treat or limit the spread of laryngeal papilloma.
