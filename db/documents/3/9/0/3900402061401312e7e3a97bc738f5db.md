Patients diagnosed with Q fever are best managed with an interprofessional team approach. Healthcare practitioners should make sure that the patient knows the course of the disease and the appropriate treatment available for the disease. The complications with the lack of proper treatment should be described to ensure proper compliance. The pharmacist should play a role to ensure that patients take the right dosage of the drug and that teratogenic drugs, including doxycycline, are not prescribed to pregnant women. The individuals working in the laboratories should follow all the protocols while handling the suspected or confirmed specimens so as to prevent the accidental spread of the organism within the facility.
