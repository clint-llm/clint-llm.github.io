The only agreed upon contraindication to platelet transfusion is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to the increased risk of thrombosis, although studies on outcomes and mortality have shown mixed results.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is another condition where platelet transfusion may increase the risk of thrombosis, but recent studies have shown no risk association.
