Irvine Page first described this entity in 1939. He performed animal experiments in which he wrapped the kidneys in cellophane. An intense inflammatory response followed and produced a fibrocollagenous shell that compressed the kidney. Compression of intrarenal vessels led to ischemia and activation of RAAS. Hypertension developed within 4 to 5 weeks and was cured by nephrectomy of the affected kidney.

In 1955, Engel and Page described the first case of Page kidney in a 19-year-old football player with a 2-year history of hypertension who had sustained flank trauma two years earlier and who was found to have a subcapsular hematoma. Hypertension was cured after nephrectomy.

Hypertension in the Page kidney is mediated by activation of RAAS and the mechanism of hypertension is similar to Goldblatt hypertension. Goldblatt, in his experiments, applied clamps to the main renal artery to reduce blood flow. Hypoperfusion of the kidneys leads to the release of renin, activation of RAAS which led to hypertension. In the Page kidney, external compression of the kidney leads to decreased perfusion in intrarenal blood vessels. Resultant microvascular ischemia causes activation of RAAS leading to hypertension.

Proof of RAAS dependence of hypertension in this entity is suggested by the following:

- Elevated plasma renin activity

- Elevated renin level in the venous effluent from the affected kidney

- Response of blood pressure to Saralasin infusion

- Normalization of blood pressure following nephrectomy of the affected kidney
