The etiology of hyperemesis gravidarum is largely unknown, but several theories exist (see pathophysiology). There are, however, risk factors associated with the development of hyperemesis during pregnancy. Increased placental mass in the setting of a molar or multiple gestations has been associated with a higher risk of hyperemesis gravidarum. Additionally, women who experience nausea and vomiting outside of pregnancy due to the consumption of estrogen-containing medications, exposure to motion, or have a history of migraines are at higher risk of experiencing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Some studies also suggest a higher risk of hyperemesis in women with first-degree relatives, for instance, if her mother or sister experienced hyperemesis gravidarum.

Protective factors include the use of multivitamins before six weeks of gestational age and maternal cigarette smoking.
