Chest radiography may show increased pulmonary vascular markings and pulmonary edema. Echocardiography shows a patent ductus arteriosus. Left to right flow is indicative of a typical PDA. Right to left flow across the PDA indicates pulmonary hypertension for which the PDA may be a secondary finding. A hemodynamically significant PDA manifests on echo with increased left atrial and left ventricular enlargement. Reversal of diastolic flow in the abdominal aorta at the level of the diaphragm may be seen but is technically challenging, so the absence of a reversal of diastolic flow on echo does not mean it is clinically absent. Increased serum creatinine and decreased urine output indicate the level of renal impairment.
