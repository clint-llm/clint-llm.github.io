The pathophysiology of GUTB is not entirely clear, but several hypotheses have been put forward. Primary infection with any of the mycobacterial species of the MTB complex occurs following infection through either inhalation or ingestion. The bacilli then multiply in the tissues at the site of inhalation (lung) or ingestion (gut) and evoke a complex series of immune responses. This can result in either completely eliminating the bacilli or in the containment of the organism by primary granuloma formation (this is called the primary Ghon focus).

The slow replication rate of the organisms in the MTB complex and the intracellular location of the bacilli inside the macrophages leads to a gap following primary infection for clinical GUTB to develop.

In addition to inhalation and ingestion, rarely, cases of primary genital TB of the vulva, vagina, or cervix can occur in women whose male partners have active GUTB or pulmonary TB. The transmission in these cases may be through infected semen or sputum.
