General anesthetics are a class of medications that act on the central nervous system (CNS) to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and enhance the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters to provide a state of unconsciousness. These medications act on several receptors in the CNS, and their effects are generally reversible.  In some patient populations, though, there is an increased risk of neurotoxic side effects, including memory and cognitive impairment. The two patient populations at the highest risk of anesthetic neurotoxicity include pediatric patients less than three years of age and elderly patients over the age of 65.
