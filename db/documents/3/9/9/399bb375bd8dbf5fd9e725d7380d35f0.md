A pericardial effusion refers to the accumulation of excess fluid in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart. In a healthy individual, the pericardial sac contains between 15 and 50 milliliters (mL) of serous fluid. This fluid may be transudative, exudative, or sanguineous and may contain infectious organisms or malignant cells. It may be due to infection, inflammation, or direct filling of the pericardial sac by blood from a defect in the myocardium (iatrogenic or traumatic injury or cardiac wall rupture) or backfilling from an ascending aortic dissection that dissects into the pericardium. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on a differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of pericardial effusion.
- Outline the testing that should be done in patients who present with pericardial effusions.
- Explain management considerations for pericardial effusions.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by pericardial effusions.
