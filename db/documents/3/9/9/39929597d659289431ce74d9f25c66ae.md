Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic and progressive cholestatic liver disorder of unknown etiology. Inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic biliary ducts characterize PSC. PSC is usually a progressive disorder that leads to complications of cholestasis and liver failure. Median survival from the time of diagnosis to death without liver transplantation is around 10 years. This activity reviews the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of primary sclerosing cholangitis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
- Describe how to evaluate for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
- Outline the management options available for primary sclerosing cholangitis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by primary sclerosing cholangitis.
