Methamphetamine is one of the powerful stimulants of the central nervous system (CNS). It is sometimes a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity; however, methamphetamine is better known as a recreational drug. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile/toxicity, pharmacology, monitoring, relevant interactions, and street names of methamphetamine, pertinent for interprofessional team members should they encounter patients who require therapy with or have misused this drug.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of methamphetamine.
- Describe the adverse effects of methamphetamine when used medically.
- Summarize the toxicity of methamphetamine.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who either are or have previously misused methamphetamine or who may require it therapeutically.
