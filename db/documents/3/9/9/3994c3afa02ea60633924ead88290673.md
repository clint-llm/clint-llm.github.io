Several key characteristics should be kept in mind when selecting sealers and core obturation materials. Firstly, most sealers are soluble and subject to dissolution when they come into contact with tissue fluids.

Lastly, most sealers experience shrinkage upon setting and can result in void space being created between the core material and the dentinal wall, with the exception of bioceramic sealers exhibiting expansion upon setting.
