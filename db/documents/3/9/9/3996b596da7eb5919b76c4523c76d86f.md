The American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations on infective endocarditis prevention do not support the necessity of using antibiotic prophylaxis in pulmonic regurgitation for otherwise structurally normal pulmonic valves, especially if there is no audible diastolic murmur. However, PR in congenital heart malformations, acquired valvular dysfunction as in rheumatic heart disease, complex cyanotic heart disease, prosthetic valves, and prior bacterial endocarditis comprise moderate- to high at-risk conditions that warrant antibiotic prophylaxis.

Infective endocarditis prophylaxis is not recommended in PR with a normal valve structure. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in the following circumstances:

- PR with cyanotic heart disease

- A patient with a previous history of infective endocarditis

- Valvular dysfunction with rheumatic heart disease

- PR after repair of congenital heart diseases with residual defects

- Prosthetic valves
