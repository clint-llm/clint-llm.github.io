Many glycosylated S proteins layer the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which helps the virus bind to the ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor) of the host cell, facilitating viral entry. S protein has two subunits - S1 and S2. S1 subunit comprises NTD (N-terminal domain) and RBD (receptor-binding domain).

Etesevimab, bamlanivimab, casirivimab, and imdevimab are neutralizing monoclonal antibodies available against SARS-COV-2. Etesevimab and bamlanivimab bind to the overlapping epitopes in RBD. (Figure 1, Figure 2) Casirivimab and imdevimab bind to non-overlapping epitopes of RBD.
