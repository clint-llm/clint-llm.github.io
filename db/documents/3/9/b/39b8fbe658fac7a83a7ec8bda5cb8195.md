It is not uncommon for patients with renal osteodystrophy to be asymptomatic, although some may present with bone pain or fractures. Low turnover states leading to defective mineralization and the inability to repair any ongoing damage, are more commonly symptomatic. This is seen in patients with adynamic bone disease who have bone pain as the predominant symptom.

Patients with ABD are likely to have an overly-suppressed PTH along with an inability to buffer calcium onto the bone leading to hypercalcemia.
