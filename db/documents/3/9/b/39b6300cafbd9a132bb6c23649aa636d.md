The inguinal ligament spans the gap between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle. Beneath it, the retro-inguinal space is created and is divided by the iliopectineal arch into a muscular compartment and a vascular compartment. The femoral sheath lines the vascular compartment of the retro-inguinal space, which contains the femoral artery, femoral vein, and deep inguinal lymph nodes.

The femoral sheath has a conical shape and is of varying length, typically 3 to 4 cm, before it blends with the adventitia of the femoral vessels. Its anterior aspect is a continuation of the transversalis fascia, whereas the posterior aspect is formed from a continuation of the iliopsoas fascia.

Anteriorly, the femoral sheath is covered by the fascia lata of the thigh, and posteriorly it is related to the underlying iliacus and pectineus muscles. The femoral sheath is bordered medially by the lacunar ligament, and on its lateral side lies the femoral nerve.

The femoral sheath is divided into three compartments by vertical septa of connective tissue that separate it into distinct functional areas:

- Lateral compartment – containing the femoral artery

- Intermediate compartment – containing the femoral vein

- Medial compartment – called the femoral canal, containing loose connective tissue and lymph nodes

The function of the femoral canal (medial compartment of the femoral sheath) is to allow expansion of the femoral vein into this space following increased venous return.

- Anteriorly: the inguinal ligament

- Medially: the lacunar ligament

- Laterally: the septum between the femoral canal and the intermediate compartment of the femoral sheath

- Posteriorly: Pectineus muscle

The ‘mouth’ of the femoral ring is covered transversely by a sheet of peritoneal fatty tissue termed the femoral septum; this area is weak and abdominal viscera can traverse through it into the femoral canal, causing a femoral hernia.

The general function of the femoral sheath is to allow the femoral vascular structures to glide underneath the inguinal ligament during hip flexion and extension. It provides a smooth fascial layer to facilitate this.
