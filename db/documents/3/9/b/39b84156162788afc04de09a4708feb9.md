History should consist of the timing of dermatitis, as it is more common in winter months. Pruritis and dry skin are hallmarks of the disease and therefore are common complaints. Ask about other controllable factors, e.g., frequency of bathing, types of soap used, diet, and medications.

The physical examination will reveal dry and scaly skin. Accentuation of the skin lines (xerosis) is a typical presentation. Red plagues with thin, long, horizontal superficial fissures appear with further drying and scratching. The fissures and scales occur in a curvilinear, polygonal, or curvilinear pattern as the short vertical fissures connect with the horizontal fissures. Fissures are often accompanied by secondary lesions of erythematous and edematous patches that result from rubbing or scratching. Bleeding can occur with disruption of dermal capillaries as the disease progresses or with excoriation. Similar patterns of inflammation may appear on the trunk and upper extremities as the winter progresses.
