Discomfort, retching, and nausea may be observed in awake or under-anesthetized patients. More serious complications would include airway compromise, traumatization in the under-anesthetized, esophageal rupture, cricoid fracture, and potential worsening of cervical spine injuries.

One study found that the incidence of significantly longer intubation time and higher Lehane andÂ Cormack scores indicate that intubation may be more challenging in the cricoid pressure versus the sham group. There was no significant difference in traumatic intubations between the sham and cricoid pressure groups. There was no difference in mortality, length of stay, or aspiration. However, the prevalence of aspiration was low in the study at 0.5%, with pregnant patients (emergent cases not included).
