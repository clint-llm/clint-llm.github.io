Serologic tests - These tests are the preferred method of diagnosis and can be used to identify acute infections (IgM) and remote infections (IgG).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) can be detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in early infections. As viral RNA is only detected in the early days of infection, a negative test cannot rule out the disease.

Autopsy findings - Viral antigen detection and RT-PCR can be used to diagnose hantavirus infections.
