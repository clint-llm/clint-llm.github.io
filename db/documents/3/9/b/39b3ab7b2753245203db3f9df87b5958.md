Many studies on rhabdomyolysis management lack good quality randomized control trials from the cohort in case-controlled studies indicate seriously. Rhabdomyolysis can have significant morbidity on the patient, and the key is education on prevention. When patients are discharged, the nurse and pharmacist play a vital role in educating the patient and the family on the causes of muscle breakdown and how to prevent them. College and high school students need to be educatedÂ regarding heat-related injuries and the importance of hydration. Patients with rhabdomyolysis may also need to enter a rehabilitation or a physical therapy program to regain muscle mass and recover joint function. Finally, the pharmacist should warn the public about the risk of rhabdomyolysis associated with recreational drugs, alcohol, or prescription medications.

**Outcomes**

The outcome of patients with rhabdomyolysis depends on the cause, patient age, and other comorbidities. Ongoing muscle breakdown without an identifiable cause has a mortality rate of 4%. With better treatment, the mortality rates have decreased over the recent years, but the disorder still carries significant morbidity. Rapid intervention with aggressive hydration is the key to prevent renal injury and renal failure. Many patients take months to recover the muscle mass even after recovery, and some even have residual pain for a few years.
