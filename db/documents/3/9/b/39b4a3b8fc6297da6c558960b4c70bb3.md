The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was recently updated in 2018 and remains the dominant staging methodology. The AJCC 8 addition also has a TNM classification system where the T stages correspond to the FIGO stage however it is not regularly used. Classically, the FIGO staging would rely on clinical examination as well as cystoscopy, proctoscopy, hysteroscopy, urography, and plain film X-ray. These relatively basic tests were allowed so that developing countries with fewer healthcare resources could adequately stage patients. More recently, advanced imaging techniques such as MRI and PET became part of the staging workup. MRI is preferred for establishing the T stage given superior tissue delineation compared to CT with contrast. FIGO stage I disease is strictly confined to the cervix with the A/B designation indicating the depth of invasion â‰¤5mm or >5mm. FIGO stage II represents disease that invades beyond the uterus but has not extended into the lower vagina. This stage also has an A/B designation based on the involvement of the parametria. FIGO stage III indicates disease that has extended to the lower third of the vagina (IIIA) or extension to the pelvic side wall and/or hydronephrosis (IIIB). Classically, nodal disease did not influence the FIGO staging system, however, it has been shown that nodal disease is one of the most important prognostic indicators for reduced 5-year overall survival.
