The link of papillomaviruses to squamous cancers was first discovered in the 1930s by the research of Dr. Richard Shope. By the 1950s and 1960s, a potential link between viral infections and cervical cancer was noted. In 1984, Harald zur Hausen discovered, cloned, and attributed cervical cancer to HPV 16 and 18; he would later win a Nobel Prize for his work. Over the next 15 years, scientists worked to link cervical cancer and HPV, showing that HPV is the trigger for cervical cancer.
