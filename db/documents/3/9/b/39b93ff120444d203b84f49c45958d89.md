The entire health care team, including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and pharmacy techs, form a network of checks and balances, all looking to ensure the safety of patients regarding controlled substances that are prescribed and dispensed. A team-centered approach to identifying risk factors, monitoring pain symptoms, and thoroughly assessing patients for chronic pain is the ideal way to limit complications.

The team approach can include evaluating pain symptoms by primary providers, including multi-disciplinary pain modalities (including physical/occupational therapy, recreational therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy), evaluation of medication regimen by pharmacists, and inclusion of pain medicine specialists. Providers (physicians, physicians' assistants, and nurse practitioners), nurses, and pharmacists can also monitor for adverse effects of controlled substances.

Interprofessional communication between all these interprofessional team members can provide care coordination for optimal management of pain, especially regarding controlled substances. [Level 2]
