Patients with tumor-related epilepsy should be educated regarding seizure precautions and avoidance of secondary injury that may occur during a seizure. Family members should also be educated in recognizing seizure activity and the necessary action to take when a seizure occurs. Patients with brain tumors should notify their provider of any new neurological symptoms, potentially representing changes to the tumor.
