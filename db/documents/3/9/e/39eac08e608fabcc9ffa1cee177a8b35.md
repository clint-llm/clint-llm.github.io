Though dermatophyte infections are the most common fungal infections in humans, tinea barbae is a rare dermatophyte infection. Due to its rarity, no large randomized clinical trials are reported in the literature. More detailed, multi-centered randomized control studies are needed before concluding incidence, prevalence, and mortality.

Based on the available information from the literature, the majority of the tinea barbae cases can be handled by primary clinicians in the office setting. However, in special situations involving an interprofessional team, including a dermatologist, pharmacist, veterinarian, and microbiologist will help in attaining the best possible outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. [Level 5] Oral antifungal agents are commonly associated with drug interactions and side effects; hence involving a pharmacist can help in increasing drug safety by choosing the right medication based on the patient's comorbidities and current medications. As discussed, zoophilic dermatophytes are the predominant causative agents for tinea barbae in humans. Once contact with animals is established, the evaluation of domestic pets and farm animals by a veterinarian will help in identifying the source and preventing reinfection. In cases refractory to management with oral antifungal therapy consulting a dermatologist and microbiologist can be helpful in considering alternate diagnosis/causative organism/therapy.
