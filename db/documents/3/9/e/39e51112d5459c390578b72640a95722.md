The genus Ehrlichia includes Ehrlichia chaffeesis, which causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), and Ehrlichia ewingii, which causes Ehrlichia ewingii ehrlichiosis. Other species within this genus include Ehrlichia canis and Ehrlichia ruminantium, which are predominantly veterinary pathogens but may also occasionally infect humans, and the recently described EMLA (Ehrlichia muris-like agent), which also has associations with human disease. Ehrlichia are intracellular, gram-negative organisms transmitted via tick bite and are capable of replicating in both the tick and the infected host. In addition to humans, other hosts include dogs, cattle, sheep, goats, rodents, and deer.
