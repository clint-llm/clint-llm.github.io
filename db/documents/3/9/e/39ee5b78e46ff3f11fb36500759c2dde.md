Multiple triage systems are currently being implemented around the world. Some of the more well-known algorithms include START (simple triage and rapid treatment), SALT (sort, assess, life-saving interventions, treatment/triage), STM (Sacco triage method), Care Flight Triage, and SAVE (Secondary assessment of victim endpoint). There is limited data available to support one system over another. However, it is important to choose one and adhere to its algorithm to maintain an ordered approach.

**START Triage**

Simple triage and rapid treatment (START) is currently the most widely used triage system in the United States for mass casualty incidents. It was developed in 1983 by staff at Hoag Hospital and Newport Beach Fire Department in California for rescuers with basic first-aid skills.  First responders delegate the movement of injured victims to a designated collection point as directed by using four main categories based on injury severity:

- **BLACK**: (Deceased/expectant) injuries incompatible with life or without spontaneous respiration; should not be moved forward to the collection point

- **RED**: (Immediate) severe injuries but high potential for survival with treatment; taken to collection point first

- **YELLOW**: (Delayed) serious injuries but not immediately life-threatening

- **GREEN**: (Walking wounded) minor injuries

The triage colors may be assigned by giving triage tags to patients or simply by physically sorting patients into different designated areas. (see the algorithm below) "Green" patients are assigned by asking all victims who can walk to a designated area. All non-ambulatory patients are then assessed. Black tags are assigned to victims who are not breathing even after attempts to open the airway. Red tags are assigned to any victim with the following:

- Respiratory rate greater than 30

- Absent radial pulse or cap refill greater than 2 sec

- Unable to follow simple commands

Yellow tags are then assigned to all others. The mnemonic “RPM:30-2-can do” is an easy way to remember these decision points.

**SALT Triage**

The sort, assess, life-saving interventions, and triage/treatment approach is similar to the START system; however, it is more comprehensive and adds simple life-saving techniques during the triage phase.

- **SORT**: sort the walking, waving, and still. This can be achieved by asking everyone at the scene to walk to a designated casualty collection point similar to the START method; however, this is followed by asking to wave an arm or leg if they need help. Those who cannot move or follow commands should be assessed first.

- **ASSESSMENT**: assessment and life-saving interventions go hand in hand. When you assess a victim and find life-threatening injuries, you should intervene.

- **LIFE-SAVING INTERVENTIONS**: simple techniques such as controlling major hemorrhage, opening airways, needle decompression, and auto-injector antidotes should be performed as long as it is not time intensive. Once performed, the provider should assign a color-coded tag similar to the START system and move onto the next patient to ensure the forward flow of patients.

- **TREATMENT AND TRANSPORT**: Once tagged, patients will be moved to the designated casualty collection point for transport by emergency management services to receiving facilities.

**JumpSTART**

JumpSTART is a modification to the START system and takes into account the difference in “normal” respiratory rates for children. This tool acts to assess pediatric patients better. The age cutoff for use is eight years old. If the child’s age is unknown, the rescuer can assess for underarm hair in males or breast development in females as an indicator of adult age and exclusion from this cohort.

The differences in this algorithm include:

- Five rescue breaths are to be given to apneic children with a pulse; then, they are given a black tag.

- Normal RR are more than 15 or less than 45

- Neurological assessment is done using the mnemonic AVPU (alert, responds to verbal stimuli, responds to painful stimuli, and unresponsive). Any patient who has abnormal posturing to painful stimuli or is unresponsive gets a red tag designation.
