Management of plasmacytoma requires close cooperation by different departments. Patients getting referred from the primary care physician for further management should be evaluated and treated by an interprofessional approach, including a team of radiotherapists, hematologists, surgeons, and oncologists.Â Collaboration with nurses, pharmacists, and psychologists (if required) is essential for overall patient care. After treatment, patients need to continue to follow up. Patients need to be checked for recurrence or progression of the disease and may be referred to orthopedics or the ear, nose, throat department.

In case of occurrence of new bone pain, additional workup and imaging should be done.

Care should be taken to check for recurrence and progression of the disease to multiple myeloma. Early diagnosis, treatment, and careful monitoring may help provide better healthcare to the patients and improve their quality of life affected by the disease.
