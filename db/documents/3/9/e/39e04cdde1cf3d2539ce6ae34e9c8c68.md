Amylase assays are generally not prone to interference from hemoglobin, bilirubin, or triglycerides. Collecting specimens in tubes containing oxalate, citrate, or EDTA may result in falsely decreased values due to the chelation of necessary amylase cofactors.

Increased amylase activity in serum can result from a condition known as macroamylasaemia – a state in which amylase forms macromolecular complexes, usually with immunoglobulin (IgA or IgG in most cases), but also as self-polymerization or association with other proteins.

The circulating pancreatic amylase is higher in female subjects with O blood type than those with A blood type (lower pancreatic amylase in A blood type).

In pancreatitis with associated hypertriglyceridemia, serum amylase levels may be erroneously normal. This is attributed to an inhibitor associated with triglyceride elevations that interferes with the assay for the enzyme. Diluting the serum can reduce the activity of the inhibitor such that a recalculation of serum amylase can uncover the true serum amylase levels.
