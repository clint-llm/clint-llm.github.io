In the fourth week of pregnancy, the distal part of the foregut and the proximal portion of the midgut form the origin of the duodenum. The junction of the two parts of the duodenum is just distal to the origin of the liver bud.

In the fifth week of the pregnancy, the epithelial cells proliferate, making the duodenal lumen smaller.
