Internal jugular vein thrombosis is asymptomatic in most patients. Clinicians should carefully evaluate swelling, erythema, or tenderness in the angle of the jaw or the side of the neck. Complications such as pulmonary embolism although rare but can occur. Further investigations on malignancy, hypercoagulopathy or infections are necessary for recurrence prevention. Anticoagulation therapy is the treatment of choice for patients without contraindications.
