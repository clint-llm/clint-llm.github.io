The treatment of strabismus in children involves a multidisciplinary approach and might take place in a variety of locations. The groups involved are the patient and family members, hospital administration, medical staff, orthoptists and optometrists, community pediatricians, general practitioners, and health visitors. In addition to these varied groups, teachers, school nurses, and community optometrists also play an important role in their management. Good communication is very important between staff and parents. A detailed clearly written medical and orthoptic record should be made available with both patients and the doctors during clinic appointments and on surgical admissions. Community pediatricians should always be kept in the loop during all correspondences between the patients and the ophthalmologists.
