Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is a primary headache syndrome characterized by recurrent unilateral episodes of headache associated with cranial autonomic symptoms. Headaches are sharp and stabbing in nature and occur more than five times per day, up to forty times per day in some cases. Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is a rare but under-diagnosed headache syndrome. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania can limit patient disability from this headache syndrome. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.
