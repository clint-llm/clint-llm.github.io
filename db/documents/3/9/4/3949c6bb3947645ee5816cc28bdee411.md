Biliary stenting has become a veryÂ useful treatment for biliary drainage. In the majority of instances, biliary stents are used to manage obstructive jaundice from either a benign or malignant cause. The biliary stents are usually implanted by gastroenterologists and interventional radiologist. However, healthcare workers who look after patients with jaundice should be aware of stenting as an option for treatment and can be life-saving. Despite advances in stent manufacture, stenosis of stents is a recurring problem, necessitating removal and replacement. Some studies indicate that covered stents have a higher patency compared to bare stents. Other studies show that metal covered stents work well but are associated with higher rates of pancreatitis compared to uncovered metal stents.
