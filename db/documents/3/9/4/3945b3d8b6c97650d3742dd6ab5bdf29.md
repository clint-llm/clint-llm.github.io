Potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) can be defined as drugs that pose an increased risk of causing adverse events.

The American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria® is a set of recommendations for avoiding potentially inappropriate medications in the geriatric population.

The latest version of the AGS Beers Criteria® was written in 2019 to assist practicing clinicians in outpatient, acute, and institutional settings. It includes medications evaluated in 5 main categories: drugs to avoid, drugs to use with caution, drug-drug interactions, medications to avoid in particular clinical situations, and dosage according to kidney function.

The AGS Beers Criteria® works as a guideline for practitioners to improve prescriptions, outcomes, and quality of care. Although this list is a comprehensive guide for clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, patients, and their families, it is designed to complement clinical judgment as each clinical scenario is unique.

This review aims to present the main issues of concern, clinical significance, and interprofessional aspects of the AGS Beers Criteria®.
