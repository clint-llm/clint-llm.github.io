Trismus interferes with speaking, eating, and swallowing; it has also been associated with aspiration due to impaired swallowing mechanisms. Intubation via the oropharyngeal route may be impossible in patients with significant trismus, necessitating other approaches such as nasopharyngeal intubation or tracheotomy. When its duration is prolonged, it leads to TMJ fibrosis, necessitating directed therapy.
