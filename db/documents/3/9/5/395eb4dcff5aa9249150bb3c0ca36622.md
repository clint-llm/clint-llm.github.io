The microbiology of the oral cavity varies with the position in the mouth and with different systemic conditions. Nonmutans streptococcal species and organisms in the S. mitis group predominate near the root and in the teeth' cracks and fissures.Porphyromonas, Provotella, and Capnocytophaga.Aggregatibacter is associated with aggressive periodontitis.

Organisms involved in periodontal disease organize into complexes in conjunction with certain other species. Fusobacterium species belong to a complex that may herald early periodontal disease.Lactobacillus, and Actinomyces, predominate in biofilms associated with carious teeth.

Organisms implicated in infective endocarditis that may be of oral origin include oral streptococci in 7 to 18%, enterococci in 5 to 10%, and organisms in the HACEK group that include oral anaerobes such as Eikinella corrodens and Aggrigatibacter in 1 to 2%.

Most prosthetic joint infections involve Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which are generally considered rare in the human oral cavity.
