Due to their negative inotropic and chronotropic actions, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists are typically indicated in individuals with chronic cardiovascular disease (hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure) with a significant reduction in mortality. The FDA-approved indication for labetalol is to treat arterial hypertension, which ranges from acute hypertensive crises (urgent/emergency) to stable chronic hypertension. Labetalol in clinical practice has several common off-label uses that include acute hypertension in pregnancy and hypertension associated with acute ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage, including subarachnoid hemorrhage. Today, labetalol is usually reserved for the acute management of hypertensive crises. This activity covers labetalol, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of labetalol therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for clinicians to use labetalol.
- Explain the mechanism of action of labetalol.
- Review the contraindications to labetalol therapy.
- Summarize how interprofessional team strategies can improve patient results in cases where labetalol therapy is indicated.
