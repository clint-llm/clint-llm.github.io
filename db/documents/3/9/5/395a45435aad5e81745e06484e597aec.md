ASA can be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory under moderate sedation or with anesthesia assistance if needed. A coronary angiogram is required to assess any significant coronary artery diseases and locate the septal perforator in the region of interest. Usually, transthoracic or transesophageal, or intracardiac echo guidance is needed to localize the septal perforator by using ultrasound-enhancing contrast agent injection and monitoring LVOT gradients during the procedure.  ASA with echo guidance has resulted in greater success, reduced procedure time, and lower complications like heart blocks and infarct size.
