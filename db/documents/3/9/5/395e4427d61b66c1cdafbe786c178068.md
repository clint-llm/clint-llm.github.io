The prognosis of louse infestations is generally good. The medications are very effective in eradicating nymphs and mature lice when used appropriately. Treatment failure can be the result of several causes including lack of ovicidal activity, failure to remove live nits, non-compliance-especially with retreatment in 7-10 days, inadequate application of the pediculicide (i.e., duration, amount), failure to treat close contacts, insufficient environmental eradication, and drug resistance to the pediculicide. Some patients with body lice may contract a louse-borne infection such as trench fever, typhus, or relapsing/recurrent fever, but these are rare.
