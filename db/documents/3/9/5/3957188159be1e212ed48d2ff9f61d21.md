Vagal nuclei dysfunction can lead to a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms. Wallenberg syndrome or lateral medullary syndrome is one pathological process that frequently involves all four vagal nuclei. It is most commonly the result of atherothrombotic occlusion of the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. There are roughly 60000 new cases of Wallenberg syndrome each year in the United States.
