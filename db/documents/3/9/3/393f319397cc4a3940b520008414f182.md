Hereditary fructose intolerance is an autosomal recessive disorder where patients lack the enzyme to break down fructose-1-phosphate. This disease usually presents during the weaning period with nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and hypoglycemia. Early recognition and prompt institution of dietary measures to restrict fructose are essential. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of patients with hereditary fructose intolerance and highlights the role of an interdisciplinary team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hereditary fructose intolerance.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of hereditary fructose intolerance.
- Outline the management options available for hereditary fructose intolerance.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with hereditary fructose intolerance and improve outcomes.
