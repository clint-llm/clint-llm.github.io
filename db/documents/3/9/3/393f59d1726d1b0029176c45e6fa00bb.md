- Acute transverse myelitis

- Tuberculomas

- Hypervascular neoplasm (ependymoma, hemangioblastoma, astrocytoma)

- Metastatic lesions (renal cell carcinoma)

- Demyelinating lesions

- Resolving hematoma

- Cord infarction

- Neurocysticercosis

- Schistosomiasis

- Type I dural fistula

- Cavernous malformations

Decreased diffusivity within the cavity of ISCA on DWI and the rapidly progressive nature of the lesion is crucial in differentiating it from other clinical mimics.
