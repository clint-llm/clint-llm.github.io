Reoccurrence of, or residual neuromuscular blockade, is possible when sugammadex is underdosed.

Through in vitro and in vivo studies, it has been established that sugammadex can prolong the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). In a study conducted by the drug manufacturer, healthy volunteers receiving 4 to 16 mg/kg of sugammadex demonstrated a 25% prolongation in aPTT and PT that lasted for 1 hour. However, this laboratory coagulopathy has not translated to more bleeding events or a higher incidence of anemia during surgery.
