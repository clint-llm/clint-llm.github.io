Lifelong treatment for patients with confirmed pernicious anemia starts with an intramuscular (IM) injection of 1000 micrograms of B12 (hydroxocobalamin in Europe or cyanocobalamin in the United States) administered daily or every other day for 1 to 2 weeks, followed by weekly injections for 1 to 2 months, then a monthly injection (cyanocobalamin) or every 2 to 3 months (hydroxocobalamin).

Following the initial intensive treatment phase, patients can continue IM injections, or they can be offered high-dose oral B12 supplementation for the lifelong maintenance phase. In a 2016 review of oral B12 replacement for treating pernicious anemia, the authors concluded that "oral vitamin B12 is an effective alternative to vitamin B12 IM injections."
