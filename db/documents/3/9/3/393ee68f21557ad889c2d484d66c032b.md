It is critical to set appropriate expectations with patients prior to reducing nasal bone fractures because of the risk of residual deformity or nasal obstruction. It is also important to educate patients that close follow-up is necessary and that initial surgery is best performed soon after injury. Further education on the use of seatbelts and protective equipment during sporting events may help to prevent further nasal trauma.
