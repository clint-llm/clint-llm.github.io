Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique used to visualize cross-sections of the cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and ciliary body. Because it does not require any patient contact, it is an ideal way to assess the anterior chamber and iridocorneal angle in cases of blunt trauma to the eye. While gonioscopy remains the gold standard for visualization of the angle, its use is generally deferred for acute cases of hyphema to prevent rebleeding. Furthermore, while gonioscopy requires a clear cornea, ASOCT can be used even when the cornea is hazy or edematous. Thus, ASOCT has become a valuable tool in both trauma and routine cases.

**Cyclodialysis Cleft**

A cyclodialysis cleft is defined as a separation of the longitudinal ciliary muscle fibers from the scleral spur, leading to increased aqueous outflow and may result in ocular hypotony. This separation can be visualized on ASOCT, which identifies the exact location and the extent of the disinsertion.
