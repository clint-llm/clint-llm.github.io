**Prerequisites for Operative Vaginal Delivery**

- Cervix fully dilated

- Membranes previously ruptured

- Engagement of the fetal head

- The clinician has determined the position of the fetal head

- Fetal weight estimation performed previously

- Pelvis thought to be adequate for vaginal delivery

- Adequate anesthesia (often an epidural)

- The maternal bladder has been emptied

- The patient agrees to the procedure after informed consent

- A backup plan in case of failure is in place (typically cesarean delivery).

**Classification of Operative Vaginal Deliveries**

Extraction is classified by the status of the fetal head at the time of vacuum application and the degree of rotation necessary.

Outlet delivery

- The scalp is visible at the introitus without separating the labia.

- The fetal skull has reached the pelvic floor.

- The fetal head is at or on the perineum.

- The sagittal suture is in AP or ROA/LOA or OP position.

- Rotation does not exceed 45 degrees.

Low delivery

- The leading point of the fetal skull is at station +2 or more and not on the pelvic floor.

- Without rotation: Rotation is 45 degrees or less

- With rotation: Rotation is greater than 45 degrees

Mid delivery

- The station is above +2, but the head is engaged.
