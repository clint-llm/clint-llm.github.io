Vascular dementia is distinguished from other forms of dementia in that it results from brain ischemia, although the temporal relationship to the ischemic event may be subtle or go unnoticed. There are various subtypes and multiple terms to describe the vascular pathology and affected brain tissue, such as multi-infarct dementia, small vessel disease or Binswanger disease, strategic infarct dementia, hypoperfusion dementia, hemorrhagic dementia, hereditary vascular dementia, and Alzheimer disease with cardiovascular disease.
