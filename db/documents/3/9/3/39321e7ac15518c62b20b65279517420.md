Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR), also known as toxidermia, are skin manifestations resulting from systemic drug administration. These reactions range from mild erythematous skin lesions to much more severe reactions such as Lyell's syndrome. They represent a heterogeneous field, including various clinical patterns without specific features suggesting drug causality. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cutaneous adverse drug reactions and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the range of skin manifestations of cutaneous adverse drug reactions.
- Explain the pathophysiology of cutaneous adverse drug reactions.
- Outline the most common causes of a cutaneous adverse drug reaction.
- Review the importance of the interprofessional team working together to find the underlying explanation for a cutaneous adverse drug reaction to improve outcomes.
