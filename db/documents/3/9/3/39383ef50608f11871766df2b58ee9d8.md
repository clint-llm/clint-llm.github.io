Persistent depressive disorder, also known as dysthymia or chronic major depression, is a poorly understood condition for which the diagnostic criteria are constantly evolving. In the past, this condition was considered a personality disorder, which connotes a permanent, pervasive nature. However, it is likely better conceptualized as a temporary state that can change. This activity reviews the new diagnostic criteria and treatment considerations for persistent depressive disorder and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of persistent depressive disorder.
- Identify the diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder.
- Describe the management considerations for persistent depressive disorder.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination between interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care and optimize outcomes for patients with persistent depressive disorder.
