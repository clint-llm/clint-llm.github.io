Alkaptonuria has a wide range of symptoms with equally wide differential to rule out. However, evaluating for seronegative arthropathies such as spondylosis is the primary approach. Alkaptonuria mimics symptoms closely with arthralgic pain in the large joints.

Sacroiliac sparing is especially concerning, but erosions, pseudo-widening of joint spaces, and sclerotic conversion of bone without articular cartilage involvement are key features to rule out the inflammatory arthropathies.

Arthritis is clinically indistinguishable from osteoarthritis.

A full index of rheumatic blood parameters and observation of symptomatic response to NSAIDs (or DMARDs if started), should be noted as well.

Melasma is an important mimicÂ for exogenous ochronosis, as the most commonly prescribed treatment (hydroquinone) will just worsen symptoms of exogenous ochronosis. Do note that these diseases often overlap, and iatrogenic paradoxical darkening from the overtreatment of melasma is a particular concern. The literature has not settled on the best management for these patients is not settled in the literature.

Other differentials that cause discoloration of the skin should also be considerations. Argyria or chrysiasis from colloidal silver and gold salts respectively can tint the skin a bluish-grey as well.
