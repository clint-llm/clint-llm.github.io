AVM in WMS is typically in the midbrain and ipsilateral retina. Vision loss from Wyburn-Mason syndrome occurs secondary to the presence and location of the arteriovenous malformations in the retina or the orbit. The tortuosity of AVM may increase over time which can cause obscuration of the visual centers, choroidal infarctions, retina ischemia, or by causing compression of the optic nerve or retinal vascular occlusions. These high-flow arteriovenous malformations usually do not bleed or cause exudation in the retina. However, intracranial AVMs can bleed.
