- Liver transplantation: There is a tendency for bleeding. It is a complicated surgery in which the surgeon must revascularize a grafted liver. However, rejection episodes are milder and require less immunosuppression.

- Skin grafting: Used to treat severely burned patients; HLA typing is not done in practice because of the endogenous immunosuppressive effect of severe burns.

- Corneal grafting: There is no need for HLA typing. Corneas are obtained from cadaveric donors.

- Heart transplantation: The use of cyclosporin improves the survival of this graft. It requires ABO compatibility but not HLA typing. Serial endomyocardial biopsies that show increased HLA class I expression by myocardial cells suggest early rejection. It speeds up a major post-operative problem: atherosclerosis in the graft coronary arteries, which is a cause of death in those that survive over 1 year.

- Lung transplantation: It is indicated for chronic airways disease, cystic fibrosis, and other potentially fatal lung diseases. Acute rejection is a leading cause of death in this transplantation. Current immunosuppressive regimen and best practice surgical operation give a 3-year survival of over 50%. Infection is a common cause of death.

- Pancreatic transplantation: Graft survival correlates with HLA compatibility. Transplantation of isolated islets is more successful to reduce their immunogenicity.
