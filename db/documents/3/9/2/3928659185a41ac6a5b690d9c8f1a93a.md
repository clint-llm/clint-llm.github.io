With the rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, numerous companies have created medications to hopefully decrease the spread and potentially cure this problem. At the forefront of these medications are the reverse transcriptase inhibitors. To date, the FDA has approved the use of reverse transcriptase inhibitors for two main viral infections. The first approved use is for the treatment of HIV, specifically the HIV-1 strain. The second virus is hepatitis B.

Research and trials are currently underway to assess the efficacy of reverse transcriptase inhibitors for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Studies show that there is anywhere from a 67% to 75% reduction in the risk of becoming infected by using pre-exposure prophylaxis.
