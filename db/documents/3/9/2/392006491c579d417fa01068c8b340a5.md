An electrophysiology study can be used for risk stratification as well as diagnosis of conduction disorders.

**Diagnostic Indications**

a) Unexplained syncope without any conduction disturbance or in patients with ischemic heart disease, sinus node dysfunction or sinus bradycardia, bifascicular block, or patients with palpitations or high-risk occupations (driving, air traffic controller, pilots, etc.)

b) Wide complex tachycardia where non-invasive testing shows equivocal results

c) Cardiac arrest survivors as part of the diagnostic workup

**Risk Stratification Indications**

a) Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic heart disease, AV conduction abnormalities, asymptomatic young patients with pre-excitation syndromes, congenital cardiac disorders ( ToF, BrS, ARVC), and acquired disorders (sarcoidosis and amyloidosis).
