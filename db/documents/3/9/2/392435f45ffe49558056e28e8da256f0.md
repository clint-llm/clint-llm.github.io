**Diagnosis Dictates Treatment**

For osteoarthritis: Correction of the biophysical abnormality, weight loss, reduction of joint stress, maintenance of heat and warmth, strengthening exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDS), injection of corticosteroids, are all helpful in that sequence. Joint replacement therapy will have the final word.

For collagen vascular diseases: Biologic medication and anti-inflammatories are in use and have revolutionized the management of diseases that in the past used with gold salts as a treatment! Half a century ago, there was a therapeutic pyramid for rheumatisms that would start with NSAIDs and escalate to steroids and then penicillamine and gold salts for refractory cases. Such an approach would permit joint destruction to advance before any real attempt at treatment was initiated. Nowadays, the pyramid is reversed, and early aggressive treatment with biologic medication can prevent joint damage at an early stage.

Rheumatologists use NSAIDs as a palliative measure for advanced disease and significant damage before they consider surgical approaches. Many new biologic agents are in the market and used in oral or injectable forms for a variety of approved indications.

**For infections: Antibiotic Treatment**

For crystal-induced arthritis: Chelating agents are the treatment of choice. They will reduce the level of an offending agent in blood and prevent further damages.
