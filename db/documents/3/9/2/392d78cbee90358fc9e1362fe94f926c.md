Pressure ulcers are primarily diagnosed clinically. It is helpful to look at other lesions on the individual’s skin to see the body's response to physical trauma. It is also easier to diagnose pressure ulcers by inspection and palpation, which usually reveals erythematous macerated texture. History should also include assessing comorbid conditions like diabetes and spinal injuries. Prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers are very important to avoid the life-threatening complications mentioned.
