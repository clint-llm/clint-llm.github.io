Trichomonas vaginalis is among the most common causes of protozoal infections in the United States, and it is also a common cause of symptomatic vaginitis in women. It is a motile organism that lives in the lower genitourinary tract of females and the prostate and urethra of men. Often, men inhabited by T. vaginalis are asymptomatic. When considering other non-viral sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent in the United States. Of concern is that trichomoniasis increases the risk of transmission of  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in both women and men. In addition, the infection is also associated with adverse outcomes during pregnancy. The disorder is underdiagnosed and self-treatment of the infection by patients is also common. In many cases, clinicians often do not test the sexual partner and thus, the cycle of transmission continues. The drug of choice is oral metronidazole but if this fails, clinicians may use other nitroimidazoles.
