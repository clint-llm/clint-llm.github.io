Infantile botulism infection is responsible for approximately 70% of all new botulism cases a year. In the United States (US) alone, 1.9/100,000 live births yield approximately 77 new cases annually. There is an equal distribution of males and females. Risk factors for infantile botulism include higher birth weights, infants of mothers of advanced maternal age, and breastfed infants. Over 50% of the new cases of infantile botulism in the past 30 years have occurred in California.

The C. botulism toxin is the most implicated in infected food and dust particles. There is a strong association with foods that have been canned and preserved at home or with incorrect sterilization techniques or poor refrigeration. Approximately 20% of cases involve honey or corn syrup. How the spores areÂ transported in these foods is still unclear. Also, living near construction sites with excessive dust particles and vacuum cleaner debris has also been implicated in infections.

Hispanics and Asian families have a higher incidence of infantile botulism because of their use of herbal medications and raw honey.
