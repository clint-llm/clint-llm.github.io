An interprofessional approach to lissencephaly is recommended. Lissencephaly is a spectrum of disorders characterized by severe mental insult. Patients with lissencephaly are at an increased risk of having learning disabilities, developmental delays, seizures, and muscle spasms. An interprofessional team consisting of a geneticist, primary clinicians, physiatrist, and neurologist is recommended to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this disease. The primary clinicians should refer these patients to the appropriate specialist as soon as the diagnosis is made.
