Bone mineral density (BMD) is expressed by the mass of calcium hydroxyapatite present in a given area or volume of bone in a unit of mass/area (g/cm2) or mass/volume (g/cm3), respectively.

The peak bone mass (PBM) is the total amount of bone tissue at the end of skeletal maturation. In newborns, there is no evidence of a gender-related difference in bone mass.

In general, peak bone mass is 8-10% higher in men compared to women, which can also justify a decreased prevalence of osteoporosis in men.

Elderly men have a progressive and slow decrease in sex hormones as opposed to the sudden decrease observed in women after menopause. Aging is accompanied by an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) serum levels, resulting in a reduced availability of free testosterone and estradiol. Estradiol is important in males for the maintenance of BMD and bone remodeling, whereas free testosterone promotes periosteal apposition.  Men with inactivating mutation on the estrogen receptor gene or with aromatase deficiency lack epiphyseal fusion and have higher bone remodeling markers and low bone mass, despite higher testosterone plasmatic levels. These patients usually respond to estrogen with an increase in bone mass, endorsing the importance of estrogen in the regulation of male bone metabolism.

Androgens also play a role in the preservation of muscle mass, and with the progressive androgen deficiency seen with aging, men develop sarcopenia, with decreased body strength and increased risk of falls.

In age-related osteoporosis, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) decline is also observed which might be associated with an increase in SHBG, as IGF-1 inhibits SHBG production by hepatocytes. The decrease in IGF-1 also impairs the production of GH resulting in reduced periosteal apposition, bone remodeling, and muscle mass.

There are differences in the way men and women lose bone mass upon aging. Bone loss usually starts in the 4th decade for both, however, while bone loss accelerates in women after menopause, it is more gradual in men. In secondary causes of osteoporosis, such as when undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or chronic glucocorticoid therapy, men can experience a sharper decrease in bone mass with a further higher risk of fracture. During the normal aging process, trabecular bone loss in women involves the decline in the number of trabeculae, whereas in men the trabeculae become thinner, but the quantity remains relatively constant. This difference in the mechanism of bone loss could also contribute to the decreased fracture risk in men.
