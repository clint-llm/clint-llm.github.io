The compression of meningocele can cause symptoms of increased intracranial pressure due to the displacement of extra spinal cerebrospinal fluid into the intracranial cavity. Raised intracranial tension may cause erosion of the skull base and may result in a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Recent reports indicate that meningocele is often associated with tethered cord syndrome, and those symptoms of tethered cord syndrome occur in a considerable proportion of children who had meningocele repair. Myelomeningocele is commonly associated with hydrocephalus.
