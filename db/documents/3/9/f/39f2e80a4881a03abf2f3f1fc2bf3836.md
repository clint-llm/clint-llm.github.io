Obstructive parotitis follows sialolithiasis (stone in the gland or duct). Occasionally calculi can extravasate out of the gland and into the neck, generating an inflammatory mass.

Pneumoparotitis occurs when air enters the parotid past the one-way valve of the parotid ducts from elevated pressures in the oral cavity, such as with wind instrument players, scuba divers, and glass blowers. Occasionally bacterial parotitis can result, and rarely parotid gland rupture.

Sialosis (sialadenosis) is a noninflammatory disorder that usually produces bilateral parotid gland enlargement and is characterized by soft, non-tender, bilaterally enlarged parotid glands.
