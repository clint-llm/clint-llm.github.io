A mastectomy is a surgical procedure involving the removal of all or part of the breast. The term originates from the Greek word mastos, meaning “woman’s breast,” and the Latin term ectomia which signifies “excision of.”  Mastectomy classifies into partial, simple, modified-radical, and radical. Other variations in terminology or technique include skin-sparing mastectomy and nipple-areolar sparing mastectomy, which are techniques that often accompany breast reconstruction.
