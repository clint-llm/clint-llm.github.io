The treatment of anisocoria depends on the underlying condition causing the condition. Most causes of anisocoria only require observation. A referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist, ophthalmologist, or neurologist may be warranted in cases that do not resolve. Acute onset anisocoria that is concerning for a compressive third nerve palsy or horner syndrome should be sent to the emergency department immediately for imaging.

Physiologic anisocoria and Adie tonic pupil simply require observation and proper documentation of the condition to prevent unnecessary medical workup in the future potentially. Anisocoria due to medication will resolve over time. Anisocoria due to trauma may remain permanent but also may improve over time. Surgical management is rarely warranted. Anisocoria due to uveitis, ICE syndrome, and neovascularization of the iris require treatment of the underlying condition.
