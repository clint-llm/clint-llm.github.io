The pathophysiology of persistent depressive disorder and depression continues to be a major area of research.Â  There is a complex interplay between neurotransmitters and receptors that affect the brain chemistry of mood. Serotonin is often the implicated neurotransmitter and target of pharmacologic intervention, but researchers have identified other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, GABA, and glutamate as affecting mood.
