The diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) remains challenging due to its variable presentation and range of injury. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria. However, the crucial factor in caring for these patients is to have a high suspicion in trauma patients. ECG and cTnI levels can be used as screening tools, followed by admission and echocardiography for any resultant abnormalities, with the understanding that BCI can take up to 48 hours to manifest. An interprofessional consensus should be employed to identify BCI based on the specific injury.

While the majority of cases diagnosed as BCI may be inconsequential, the true significance of the diagnosis remains controversial due to inadequate assessment of long-term outcomes. Those suspected of having BCI who are hemodynamically stable without dysrhythmia should at least have a short period of observation. Further consensus and research among providers are warranted to better define the management and long-term significance of BCI.
