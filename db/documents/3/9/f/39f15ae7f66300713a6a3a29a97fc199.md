Infected regions may initially appear normal and often present with only severe pain that seems out of proportion to the exam. Later, the skin will start to appear shiny and taut, eventually becoming dusky and then to a bronze discoloration. Hemorrhagic bullae are later noted, and massive swelling and edema follow. Muscles can start to appear dark red, black, or greenish. Thin, serosanguinous exudate with a sweet odor can also form along the infected area. Tissue gas can be found in the subcutaneous tissue and between muscle fibers.
