The Bartholinâ€™s glands (or greater vestibular glands) are important organs of the female reproductive system. Danish anatomist Caspar Bartholin Secundus first described them in 1677.

Bartholin gland pathology may present as an asymptomatic mass, causing only vulvar asymmetry. Symptomatic masses may exhibit severe tenderness, surrounding erythema, and edema. Cysts and abscesses often form in women of reproductive age and do not require treatment. Rarely, mass biopsy and excision may be necessary if malignancy is suspected.
