Due to the anatomy of the right bundle branch, damage typically occurs at 3 different locations. The proximal right bundle nearest the endocardium is the most common location to be affected. The distal right bundle is typically only injured when the moderator band is transected during surgery. The terminal right bundle is injured during ventriculotomy or transatrial resection.

A right bundle branch block is typically caused by disease processes that change the myocardium of the right bundle branch, for example, structural changes, trauma, and infiltrative processes. Rarely, hyperkalemia can alter the conduction physiology by slowing electrical impulse conduction through cardiac tissue, causing a right bundle branch block.
