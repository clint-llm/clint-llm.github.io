Every medical intervention has a side effect profile, and every IR or surgical intervention has its associated risks, as described in detail above. Counseling patients on the adverse effects of medications such as altered bleeding profile and medication-induced menopause are worth mentioning to patients when they are deciding on treatment modality. Informing patients about the risks of bleeding, infection, injury to nearby organs, scarring, and failed treatment are all important to mention when consenting a patient for surgery or alternative procedure. Although the overall risk of hysterectomy for uncontrolled intraoperative bleeding is fewer than 1 out of 100 women, it is especially important to mention this risk to patients, particularly in women with multiple large fibroids.
