While many patient economic and health risk factors cannot be modified in the peripartum period, healthcare providers can modify several factors to decrease the patient risk for infection. Care bundles of evidence-proven measures have been shown to reduce infection associated with cesarean delivery.

Prior to delivery, interventions can be taken to reduce patient risk for infection. Shaving before delivery should be avoided, and patients should be counseled on this prior to their expected delivery date.

During labor, limiting vaginal examinations during labor and avoiding internal fetal monitoring, if possible, can decrease the risk of postpartum infections.

Finally, outbreaks of GAS infection in postpartum women have often been linked back to colonized or infected health care providers prompting the CDC to recommend health care worker screening when two or more episodes of postpartum GAS infection cases are identified over a six-month period.
