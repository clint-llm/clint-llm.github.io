The typical presentation leading to an evaluation for a hiatal hernia is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Patients typically complain of heartburn and sometimes regurgitation. While heartburn is the most common complaint, some patients will present with extra-esophageal symptoms such as a chronic cough or asthma. The presentation of regurgitation or extra-esophageal symptoms typically is a sign of disease progression. However, not all patients with regurgitation have GERD, and it is important to note if the regurgitated food is digested or undigested.

Undigested food may represent another pathology such as achalasia or a diverticulum. Dysphagia is another problem seen with advanced disease. This is typically secondary to a mechanical obstruction. When this is encountered, it could represent additional pathology such as a peptic stricture, tumor, diverticula, or primary motor disorder. Physical examination in patients with a hiatal hernia and GERD rarely helps confirm the diagnosis. The presence of abnormal supraclavicular lymph nodes in patients with heartburn and dysphasia may suggest esophageal or gastric cancer and is an important part of the evaluation.
