During the embryological formation of the gastrointestinal tract, the foregut is suspended from the abdominal wall by a double layer of peritoneum called the mesentery. The hepatoduodenal ligament derives from the ventral mesentery between the liver and the stomach as part of the lesser omentum. After the stomach migrates to its final location, the space posterior to it becomes the lesser sac, and the opening to this sac appears at the distal edge of the hepatoduodenal ligament. This opening is called the foramen of Winslow.
