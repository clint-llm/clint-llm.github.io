Diffuse toxic goiter consists of a diffusely enlarged, vascular gland with rubber-like consistency. Microscopically, the follicular cells are hypertrophic and hyperplastic with little colloid in them. Lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate into the gland andÂ can ultimately aggregate into lymphoid follicles.

All cases of diffuse toxic goiter are not Graves disease and there may be various non-autoimmune causative processes although the majority of cases are autoimmune in nature. In Graves disease, antibodies are directed towards the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHr) which is present on thyroid follicular cells. The chronic stimulation of these receptors results in the production of excess amounts of T3 and T4 hormones and causes the enlargement of the thyroid gland that eventually results in a goiter.
