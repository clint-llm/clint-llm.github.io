The surgical treatment of breast cancer requires contribution from a comprehensive interprofessional care team.  A radiologist must be available in coordination with the surgeon’s schedule to verify the specimen contains any biopsy clip, seed, or complete intact wire.  This approach ensures the removal of the target lesion before the completion of surgery. Some surgeons also elect to have pathology verify margins intra-operatively.
