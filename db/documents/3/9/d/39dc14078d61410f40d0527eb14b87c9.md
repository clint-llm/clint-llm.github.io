Most cases of heterochromia are sporadic and isolated benign conditions without any clinical significance.

The most important group of conditions with heterochromia are congenital heterochromia which may be the only presentation of congenital Horner syndrome. There may be associated miosis, partial ptosis, and facial anhidrosis. Not all of these signs need to be present to be diagnosed as congenital Horner syndrome. The iris stromal melanocytes derive from neurocrest cells in embryological development. The sympathetic neurons also derive from neurocrest cells. Any disruption of sympathetic innervation of the iris melanocytes due to disruption of the post-ganglionic cervical sympathetic pathways, especially early in life as in congenital Horner syndrome, will result in decreased brown melanin color of one iris and heterochromia. Any syndromic illness associated with impaired neurocrest cells or tissues development and migration may also cause heterochromia, such as Waardenburg syndrome and Parry-Romberg syndrome. Other congenital diseases include ocular melanosis and neurocutaneous syndromes such as Sturge-Weber syndrome (abnormal hyperpigmented iris), oculodermal melanocytosis (nevus of Ota), and neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen disease, iris hamartoma).

**Congenital Causes of Heterochromia**

- Benign heterochromia

- Congenital Horner syndrome: with other presentations of miosis, partial ptosis, and/or impaired facial sweating (anhydrosis)

- Waardenburg syndrome: hearing loss, heterochromia, lateral displacement of medial canthus, hypertrichosis of medial eyebrows, and prominent broad nasal root

- Parry-Romberg syndrome: progressive facial hemiatrophy

- Sturge-Weber syndrome: facial port-wine stain with meningeal angiomatosis. Patients may present with unilateral neurological deficits, seizures, and a large facial nevus. The ipsilateral eye may have melanocytosis of the uveal coat and retina. Glaucoma is not an uncommon complication.

- Neurofibromatosis I: Lisch nodules in the iris associated with other clinical features. Children with NF1 may also develop optic nerve pathway glioma, which can be detected by simple ophthalmoscopy showing the absence of red reflex in one eye.

- Oculodermal melanocytosis: hamartomatous congenital melanocytosis

- Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndromes

- Iris ectropion syndrome

- Incontinentia pigmenti

**Acquired Causes of Heterochromia**

- Acquired Horner syndrome

- Other causes of sympathetic heterochromia such as neuroblastoma or paravertebral neurilemmoma

- Ocular trauma

- Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis

- foreign body including use of colored contact lens

- Iron deposition: siderosis and hemosiderosis

- Melanocyte infiltration as in diffuse nevus or melanoma

- Local iris tumors

- Certain eyedrops such as prostaglandin analogs
