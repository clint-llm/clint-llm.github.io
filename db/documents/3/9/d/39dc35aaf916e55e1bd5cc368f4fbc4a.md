The clinical presentation of ocular hypotony depends on the etiology. Aside from the history of presenting symptoms, it is essential to investigate for a history of ocular trauma or surgery and other ocular conditions such as uveitis and retinal detachment that are known causes of hypotony. Systemic diseases associated with ocular hypotony should be determined, such as pregnancy, uremia, diabetes, and myotonic dystrophy.

The attending clinician should search for vascular causes of decreased blood flow to the ciliary body, such as ocular ischemic syndrome. It is not unusual for the patient's ocular hypotony to be drug-induced. Therefore, the use of any topical and systemic medications that can cause ocular hypotony should be explored.

A history of vision loss or distortion in images may suggest a significant effect of ocular hypotony on the eye. However, in several cases, the patient is asymptomatic and will have reasonably good vision with an IOP of 5 mm Hg or less. Clinical ocular hypotony may be consequential to any previously listed ocular sequelae of hypotony, including hypotony maculopathy, keratopathy, optic disc swelling, and even refractive error changes. In some cases of ocular hypotony, rapid progression of cataract occurs.

On clinical examination, the visual acuity may be reduced or normal. The measured intraocular pressure is significantly reduced to 5 mm Hg or less. There may be a demonstrable compromise to the globe integrity, such as leakage from a bleb, perforation of the globe, or corneal laceration. In all cases of aqueous humor leakage from the eye, a Seidel test utilizing fluorescein dye should be used to demonstrate the leakage.

The Seidel test assesses the occurrence of aqueous humor leakage through a defect in the integrity of the cornea or sclera from the anterior chamber, as shown in **Figure 1**. The defect in the cornea or sclera could be from several causes, including trauma, post-surgical leak, and corneal perforation.

Furthermore, examination using the slit lamp biomicroscope could reveal the presence of corneal striae and corneal edema. This finding may be associated with a shallow anterior chamber. There may be trembling (donesis) of the intraocular lens (pseudophacodonesis) or the crystalline lens (phacodonesis), or iris (iridodonesis) during ocular movements. Signs of intraocular inflammation may be evident such as keratic precipitates and fibrin in the anterior chamber. Cyclic membranes and synechiae may also be observed.

In some cases of ocular hypotony, there is the formation of cataracts consequent to decreased nourishment from reduced circulating aqueous supply to the crystalline lens. Though tasking to perform in a hypotonic eye, Gonioscopy could reveal a cyclodialysis or other anterior chamber angle trauma signs.

Fundus examination could indicate the presence of ciliochoroidal detachment, which arises from transudation from the choroidal vessels in the suprachoroidal space. Rupture of these vessels may create a hemorrhagic component to the serous fluid. Other posterior segment findings include tortuosity of the blood vessels, optic disc edema, choroidal folds, and macula striae characteristic of hypotony maculopathy.

Retinal pigment epithelial changes in the macula can also be seen. Lastly, posterior segment examination may also reveal causes of ocular hypotony such as rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, advanced stages of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), and features of significant ocular ischemia.
