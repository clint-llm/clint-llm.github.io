Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organs. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, nephrologist, ophthalmologist, otolaryngologist, and internist/pediatrician. Nurses and pharmacists are also part of this interprofessional team, counseling patients and working with their medications. In most cases, the disorder presents during the first decade of life. Once the diagnosis is made, the workup of siblings and other family members is recommended. Within the first three decades of life, most Alport syndrome patients develop ESRD and need dialysis. Here again, nurses and pharmacists will play a prominent role, the former in administering dialysis and the latter in fine-tuning drug dosing regimens around dialysis. All care team members must exercise open communication with the rest of the team and maintain accurate, updated records to ensure open information sharing among all professionals on the case.

Collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients suffering from Alport syndrome is crucial to optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
