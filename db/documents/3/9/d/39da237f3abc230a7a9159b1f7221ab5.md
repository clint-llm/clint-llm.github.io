There are multiple surgical approaches for the management of pituitary neoplasms. A nonfunctioning adenoma only gets surgically resected when the tumor causes compression or mass effect to the adjacent structures like the optic chiasm causing bitemporal hemianopsia field defect. This specific visual field defect is due to the compression of the nasal retinal fibers that decussate within the optic chiasm. A prolactinoma only gets surgically resected if they fail medical management with dopaminergic medications. Transsphenoidal surgery is a commonly chosen procedure for resection, especially in Cushing disease.

The transcranial, microscopic transsphenoidal, and endoscopic endonasal approaches are the different methods for surgery. Microscopic transsphenoidal surgery is the commonly used method for pituitary resection. However, the endoscopic approach is more favorable as the duration of the surgery is reduced, shorter hospital stay, is minimally invasive, has a lower chance of developing complications, and the patients experienced less post-operative pain. Researchers are studying new imaging techniques for better visualization of the adenomas using a high field intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as they may provide better spatial resolution. Stereotactic radiosurgery may have a role in patients who are not willing to repeat surgical management for recurrent or residual adenomas.
