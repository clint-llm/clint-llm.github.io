The greater occipital nerve block is generally a well-tolerated, low-risk procedure. Absolute contraindications include patient refusal, anesthetic allergy, open skull defect, and infection at the procedure site. It is also contraindicated to perform the nerve block at a surgical site due to the risk of intracranial infiltration.

Other relative contraindications that should be considered before performing the procedure include:

- Coagulopathy

- History of Arnold Chiari malformation

- Inability to lie still in a prone or sitting position
