A significant minority of atypical moles evolve into melanoma; indeed, it is for this reason that they are clinically significant lesions.

Additionally, the lifetime melanoma risk to individuals in the United States is less than 1% but is significantly greater in those with atypical moles, greater than 10%.Â The risk of malignant transformation in common moles to melanoma amongst the population of the United States is about 1:30,000 in males, and 1:40,000 in females.

Those at higher risk include patients with familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma syndrome (FAMMM) who have a near 100% lifetime risk of atypical mole transformation to melanoma in situ.
