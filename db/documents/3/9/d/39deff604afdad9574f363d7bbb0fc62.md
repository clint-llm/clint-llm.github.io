It is now clear that clinicianâ€™s technical skills are associated with patient outcomes including post-procedure complications, and rates of reoperation, readmissions, and emergency department visits.

There is evidence that EMT can be utilized to teach skills to novices. Medical students without prior ultrasound experience were randomized to EMT or EAT for performing fetal sonographic evaluations.

An important factor in medical training is the durability of the skills learned. General surgery interns were randomized into EMT and EAT groups for a simulation-based curriculum on internal jugular and subclavian central line placement.

The encouraging results of these studies indicate a need to create a formalized curriculum for integrating EMT into medical training. Riefkohl-Ortiz et al. published their work creating an intensive EMT based curriculum for emergency medicine residents and fellows to learn how to manage iatrogenic critical care procedure complications.

For healthcare practitioners to provide excellent patient care, they need a training method that supports clinicians progressing to independent practice who have the skills to recognize and mitigate errors while taking care of patients. Combining EMT and medical simulation may provide a means by which to achieve this goal more effectively than traditional training methods, such as EAT.
