The effects of toluene and benzene toxicity is usually acquired through inhalation.

Inhalation occurs by three different methods

- Huffing: the individual soaks a rag with a chemical and then places it over the mouth and nose.

- Bagging: the individual puts the chemical in a bag and repeatedly inhales deeply from the bag.

- Sniffing: the chemical is directly inhaled via the nostrils.
