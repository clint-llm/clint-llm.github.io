The most prevalent cause of primary hyperaldosteronism is aldosterone-producing adenomas. Other causes include aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma, ectopic aldosterone secretion from the kidneys or ovaries, and bilateral zona glomerulosa hyperplasia. There are familial causes as well. Type I is glucocorticoid-remediable hyperaldosteronism that results from the formation of a chimeric gene containing the regulator portion of 11B-hydroxylase (usually regulated by ACTH) and the synthetic region of aldosterone synthase; as a result, ACTH stimulates aldosterone synthase and hence aldosterone production. Type II causes are unclear; it correlates to a gene on 7p22 (band 11q13), and histologic findings are consistent with hyperplasia or adenomas.
