The three embryonic germ layers, developed through the process of gastrulation, form the basis for all the tissues and organs in the body.

- **The endoderm**will form the epithelium of the digestive tract, lungs, liver, pancreas, and thyroid

- **The mesoderm**will give rise to muscle, cartilage and bone, heart and circulatory system, gonads, and the urogenital system

- **The ectoderm**will give rise to outer components of the body, such as skin, hair, and mammary glands and part of the nervous system (see neurulation).
