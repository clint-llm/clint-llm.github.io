Initial treatment can be with conservative management, starting with observation, especially with small cysts (several millimeters in size). Aspiration and excision are also options. It is recommended to avoid using corticosteroid injections as these can cause the skin to become thinner in this region of the body.

Surgical Excision:  Meticulous technique is required to avoid damage to the germinal matrix, which is often in close proximity to or underlying the cyst. The germinal matrix of the nail can be up to 5 mm proximal to the fold of the eponychium.

An H shaped incision is performed overlying the dorsum of the DIP joint, the transverse limb of the H is located at the dorsal DIP crease or centered along the cyst. The longitudinal limbs are placed along the midaxillary line on both the radial and ulnar side of the digit. After identifying the cyst, careful dissection around the stroma should occur down to the stalk. The stalk can be tied off or ligated, and any osteophytes removed with a rongeur.

Removal of osteophytes at the time of surgery can also decrease the rate of recurrence (<10%). If there is a concern for the thickness of the skin after removal, the surgeon should consider performing a full-thickness graft (thenar crease of palm), a local advancement flap, or a rotational flap.

DIP joint arthrodesis is the only way to guarantee no recurrence postoperatively.
