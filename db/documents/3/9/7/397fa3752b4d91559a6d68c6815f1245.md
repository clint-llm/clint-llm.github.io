Clinical presentations in these patients vary widely as they can range from asymptomatic bradycardia to cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors and hemodialysis. Despite these variations, all patients will present with profound bradycardia. As this syndrome is often precipitated by decreased renal perfusion, history often includes recent gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, recent medication changes, or other history components identified as risk factors for acute kidney injury. It is important to note that this syndromeÂ is not dose-dependent when considering the role that AV nodal blockers play.
