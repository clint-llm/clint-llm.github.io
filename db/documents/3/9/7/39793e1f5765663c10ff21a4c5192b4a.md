Cervical cancer screening can be achieved using two methods the liquid-based or the conventional method. Both methods collect cells from the transformation zone of the cervix. The liquid-based method involves transferring cells into a vial of preservatives, which can undergoes further processing in a laboratory. The liquid-based technique allows for easier interpretation, filtering of excess debris, and more importantly fewer unsatisfactory results.  Another advantage of using the liquid-based technique includes using a single specimen to perform cytology, HPV testing and gonorrhea and chlamydia testing.

In contrast, the conventional method of screening involves transferring cervical cells from the transformation zone directly to a slide and then fixing the specimen. Specimen interpretation may be difficult with the presence of blood, discharge and lubricant use.
