The two main functions of vWF in hemostasis include platelet adhesion and Factor VIII stabilization. During primary hemostasis, vascular injury exposes vWF bound to subendothelial collagen. Then, glycoprotein 1b (GP1b) receptors on the surface of nearby platelets adhere to the exposed vWF, triggering platelet activation and a cascade of events which includes the release of platelet storage granule content such as vWF from alpha granules and the recruitment of more platelets to form a plug at the site of damaged endothelium.

Plasma vWF supports the intrinsic coagulation cascade by stabilizing factor VIII, thereby increasing its circulating half-life. During the intrinsic coagulation pathway, thrombin cleaves the factor VIII binding site with vWF, allowing the release (activation) of factor VIIIa to continue the clotting process.
