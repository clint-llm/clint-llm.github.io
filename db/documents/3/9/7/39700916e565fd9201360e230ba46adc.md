Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are rare salivary gland-type tumors that comprise mucin-secreting cells, squamous cells, and intermediate-type cells. They make up a distinct group of lung malignancies accounting for less than 1% of all lung cancers. Based on the current World Health Organization classification of pulmonary tumors, mucoepidermoid carcinomas are sub-classified into low-grade and high-grade tumors. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of mucoepidermoid tumors of the lung, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classification of lung mucoepidermoid tumors.
- Outline the workup of a patient with a lung mass.
- Summarize the treatment options for lung mucoepidermoid lesion.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by mucoepidermoid lung mass.
