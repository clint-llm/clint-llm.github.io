Because the sympathetic nervous system supplies the peripheral blood vessels, the radial artery is supplied by sympathetic nerves. It is supplied primarily by the sympathetic branches of the C6 nerve root, although the hand can also be supplied by C7 on the radial side. Note that this terminology of the autonomics having a sensory function is a contradiction in terms, as the sympathetic nervous system, like the autonomics in general, is defined as a two-neuron general visceral efferent (motor) system. In reality, the sympathetics also carry visceral sensory fibers as well. Note, for example, the sympathetics through the cardiac nerves supply the sensory innervation of the heart, although some authorities believe the base of the heart may carry vagal sensory innervation as well. This concept of vagal innervation has been used to explain the precordial pain (sympathetic) radiating into the neck (vagus) observed in angina pectoris.
