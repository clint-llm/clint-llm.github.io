There is currently no vaccine available and treatment remains largely supportive, thus emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and disease prevention. Patients who have been diagnosed with HCPS should be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) as early ICU care may lead to better treatment outcomes. Preventative measures include limiting contact with infected rodents by sealing up holes around the house or using mouse traps if you have an infestation.
