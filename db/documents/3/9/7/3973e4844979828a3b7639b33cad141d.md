Corneal dystrophies are a collection of genetic diseases that affect corneal transparency and refraction due to increased deposition of abnormal material. This activity will review the classification of these diseases, their clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and clinical management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the corneal dystrophies based on the affected anatomical layer.
- Outline various corneal dystrophies based on genetic etiology, history, physical exam findings, and laboratory diagnostics. 
- Review the management of corneal dystrophies, from non-invasive treatments to corneal transplantation, as well as the risks and complications of surgical intervention. 
- Summarize an interprofessional team-based approach to the management of corneal dystrophies for early diagnosis, proper treatment and improved outcomes.
