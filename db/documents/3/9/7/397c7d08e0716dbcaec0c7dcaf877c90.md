Arterial catheterization is frequently indicated in intensive care settings, where clinical situations often require continuous arterial blood pressure monitoring and frequent arterial blood sampling to analyze the partial pressure of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and serum pH. This monitoring is critical during the administration of vasoactive medications, as minute-to-minute evaluations are necessary to titrate these medications effectively.

Arterial catheterization allows for the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure to be readily displayed on the monitoring system using a transducer device attached to a noncompliant tubing system.

Other indications for arterial catheterization include cardiac catheterization and radiological interventional procedures, manual or automated exchange transfusions, plasmapheresis, continuous arterio-venous perfusion or hemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Some of these modalities require a surgical approach to arterial catheter placement.
