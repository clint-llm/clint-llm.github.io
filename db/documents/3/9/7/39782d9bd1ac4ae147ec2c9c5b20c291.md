Adenoid tissue typically regresses around puberty; therefore, the typical patient with adenoiditis is a prepubescent child with a recent history of URI. The patient may also have a history of recurrent acute otitis media, chronic nasal obstruction with mouth-breathing, chronic otitis media, sleep-disordered breathing/obstructive sleep apnea, or GERD/LPR.

Physical findings include purulent rhinorrhea, post-nasal drip, nasal obstruction, snoring, fever, mouth breathing, and halitosis. An indirect mirror exam may allow the clinician to observe enlarged adenoids with exudates, though this can be a very challenging exam to perform in children. A flexible nasal and laryngeal endoscopic exam can allow for better evaluation of the adenoids but can require advanced training to use as well as the cooperation of the child and parents. In rare cases, the adenoid may be large enough that it protrudes downwards and is visible beneath the edge of the soft palate (see image). When the adenoid is large enough to displace the soft palate, whether acutely or chronically, it is liable to affect the quality of the patient's speech.

Long-standing adenoiditis with subsequent adenoid hypertrophy in early childhood can lead to the development of what is known asÂ adenoid facies or long-face syndrome. Enlarged adenoids block the nasopharynx and result in obligate mouth breathing, which can lead to craniofacial abnormalities, including a high-arched palate and retrognathic mandible.
