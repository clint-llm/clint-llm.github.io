Type 1 narcolepsy (historically known as narcolepsy with cataplexy) is due to a deficiency of orexin-A, a wakefulness-promoting peptide neurotransmitter.

Secondary narcolepsy, on the other hand, is due to the development of lateral hypothalamic lesions. Although rare, lesions secondary to arteriovenous malformations, cerebrovascular accidents, inflammatory processes, and neoplasms result in the destruction of orexin-A-producing neurons.
