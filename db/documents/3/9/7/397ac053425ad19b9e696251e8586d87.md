Since cerebral salt wasting (CSW) is still a debated condition, its exact incidence and prevalence may be hard to pin down. Cerebral salt wasting is most commonly seen after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage but can be seen after other insults to the central nervous system. Other conditions in which cerebral salt wasting has been reported include: after surgery for a pituitary tumor or acoustic neuroma or calvarial remodeling, glioma, infections including tuberculous meningitis and viral meningitis, metastatic carcinoma, and cranial trauma.

Some have calculated that cerebral salt wasting accounts for up to one-quarter of severe hyponatremia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of cerebral salt wasting for other CNS insults is mostly reported as case reports. The incidence and prevalence of cerebral salt wasting outside of patients with CNS insult are not reliably reported.
