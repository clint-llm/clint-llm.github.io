The diagnosis of millipede exposure is typically made clinically. A thorough history and physical examination, as always, are useful in narrowing down the differential. History should include the timing of symptom onset and progression, duration, travel history, environmental exposures, occupational risk factors, and any dermatological disorders, to name a few. No additional laboratory or radiographic testing is typically needed.
