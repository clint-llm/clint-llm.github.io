Rectus sheath hematomas are uncommon

Overall, rectus sheath hematoma is more common in females than males. A higher female incidence has been linked to decreased muscle mass. While pregnancy is a risk factor in women, trauma and exercise seem to be the most common causes in men. Rectus sheath hematomas are more common on the right side, and the majority are located in the lower quadrant of the abdomen below the arcuate line.
