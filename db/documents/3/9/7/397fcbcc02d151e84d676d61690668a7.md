- Maintain a high index of suspicion for BSS in a bleeding patient with large platelets and thrombocytopenia, especially if they do not respond to the first-line treatment for ITP.

- Low to absent response to ristocetin is a reliable indicator for the diagnosis of BSS (rules out vWD). Flow cytometry is used to confirm the diagnosis.

- Platelet transfusion is the first line of treatment for a bleeding patient. Antifibrinolytic can be used to control mucocutaneous bleeding.

- Desmopressin has no role in the treatment of BSS.

- Activated rfVII is not approved for BSS, but has been used in anecdotal cases with success.

- HLA-matched platelets must be used in all planned surgeries.

- Prevention of bleeding is the best approach in patients diagnosed with BSS. Extensive education programs must be conducted for patients and families with BSS.
