Marfan syndrome is a serious chronic disorder with no cure. A significant number of patients do develop life-threatening complications like aortic aneurysms and dissections, retinal detachment, aortic regurgitation, and pectus deformities.

Management of MFS and its related complications involves an interprofessional team including the patient's primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and with appropriate referrals to a cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, ophthalmologist, and orthopedics. Care coordination should take place between the different providers as well as with the nurses taking care of these patients so that they can quickly report any potential complications. Pharmacists should be aware of medications that should require avoidance in patients with MFS. Physical therapists should be involved in guiding patients with MFS on appropriate exercise activities, which should not include high-intensity exercises.

The key is close follow-up and monitoring for complications. The interprofessional team members should communicate with each other so that the patient is provided with the optimal standard of care treatment.

The lifespan of untreated patients with the classic MFS was approximately 32 years in 1972 but has markedly increased to 72 years in 1993.
