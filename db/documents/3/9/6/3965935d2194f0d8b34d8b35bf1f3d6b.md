The formation of an intestinal stoma (ileostomy or colostomy) is one of the most usual surgical operations performed by general surgeons and, in many cases, is considered to be a life-saving surgical procedure. However, up to 10% to 70% of ostomates will suffer a complication related to their ostomy, which can change the patient's life dramatically. Preoperative and postoperative stoma education is critical because patients can better manage their stoma and adapt to living life with an ostomy.
