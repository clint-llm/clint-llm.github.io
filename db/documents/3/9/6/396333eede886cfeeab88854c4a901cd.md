Osmolarity is the number of osmoles of solute per liter solution, which is different than osmolality, which is the osmoles of solute per kilogram of solution. Osmoles are different from moles in that it takes into account the dissociation of cations and anions in water.

For example:

If  1 kg of water gets added to 1 mole of NaCl salt, then we observe the salt separate into its ions. As a result, there will be 1 mol of Na and 1 mol of Cl. Restated, this means there are 2 osmoles of ions in 1 kg of water, which results in a solution with an osmolality of 2osm/1kg.

Components that contribute to plasma osmolality:

Any solute in the plasma will contribute to the osmolality. Examples include proteins, ions, urea, and sugars. The relative osmoles of each are summed to give the total osmolality per 1 kg of plasma.

How to calculate plasma osmolality?

The Dorwart and Chalmers formula is widely used to estimate plasma osmolality. It utilizes the basic metabolic panel (BMP) to measure sodium, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen.

Serum Osmolality=1.86 (Na)+(Glucose)/18 +(BUN)/2.8+9

Normal serum osmolality ranges from 275 to 295 mmol/kg.
