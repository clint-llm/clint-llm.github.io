Transposons can be divided based on the mechanism of transposition and integration. Class I elements, retrotransposons, use an RNA intermediate that is reverse-transcribed into a cDNA copy that reintegrates into a new genomic home.  Class II elements are DNA transposons mobilized by a DNA intermediate or by replication involving a circular DNA intermediate. Each of these classes can further sub-categorize based on common genetic or monophyletic origins.

Class I elements are also called retrotransposons. They begin as DNA and become transcribed into RNA via the normal mechanism. Then reverse transcriptase and an endonuclease, which are generally coded for within their transposable element, are used to reverse transcribe the RNA back into DNA. This DNA is then inserted back into the chromosome at its new location. Their life cycle and structure are very similar to retroviruses.

Class II elements, called DNA transposons, are the classic “cut-and-paste” transposons whose mechanism begins which excision from the genome. They are not replicated like Class I elements but often include a transposase gene. Transposase is an enzyme that facilitates transposon movement. TIRs (terminal inverted repeats) flank transposase, which transposase uses to excise the transposon. When the transposon is inserted into a new location, the DNA at the target site duplicates producing TSDs, or target site duplications. TIRs and TSDs are unique to transposons and are used to classify transposons into different families.
