Histopathology of Dalen-Fuchs nodules shows granulomas consisting of epithelioid histiocytes. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of enucleated specimens show B-cells and T-cells in choroid and loss of choroidal melanocytes.

Recurrent episodes lead to an appearance known as a sunset-glow fundus, defined by progressive fundus depigmentation in the setting of optic disc pallor – a marker of poor visual outcome in these patients. In the late stage of VKH, peripheral fundus scars are seen histopathologically as chorioretinal atrophy and scarring; Dalen-Fuchs nodules are not common in this stage.
