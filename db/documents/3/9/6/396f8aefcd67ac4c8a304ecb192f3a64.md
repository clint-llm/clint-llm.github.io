A patellar tendon rupture involves a complete tear of the tendon that runs from the patella's inferior pole to the tibial tubercle. It is typically seen in males in their third or fourth decade of life. It tends to result when a weakened tendon is placed under high tensile forces. These tendon ruptures are best classified into acute versus chronic tears. This type of injury requires prompt diagnosis and surgical repair as the patellar tendon is a part of the extensor mechanism of the knee, which is crucial to the function of the lower extremity. Surgical intervention depends on the timing and location of the rupture. Acute ruptures are amenable to primary repair, whereas chronic ruptures often require tendon reconstruction. This activity describes the causes, evaluation, and management of patellar tendon rupture and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of patellar tendon rupture.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patellar tendon rupture.
- Outline the treatment options available for patellar tendon rupture.
- Summarize how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with patellar tendon rupture.
