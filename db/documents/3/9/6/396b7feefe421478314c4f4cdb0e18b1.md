**Root Canal Sealers**

The role of the sealer is critical for establishing a fluid-tight seal of the root canal as it fills the vacant space between the prepared dentinal wall and the core filling material.

Most sealers are toxic before setting, so care should be taken to avoid the extrusion of sealers into the periapical tissues.

Several types of sealers are available, which vary in formulation and properties. They are classified into five main groups according to their composition: zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) based, calcium hydroxide based, glass ionomer-based, resin-based, and bioceramic sealers.

The properties of an ideal sealer have been outlined in the literature. It is important to note that no material has been proven to eliminate leakage completely nor fulfill all the ideals.

Properties of an ideal sealer material:

- Ability to establish a fluid-tight seal

- Radiopaque (to be visible on radiographs)

- Antimicrobial

- Non-shrinking upon setting

- Non-staining

- Non-irritating to periapical tissues

- Insoluble in tissue fluid

- Biocompatible

**Core Obturation Materials**

Core materials exist to fill the bulk of the root canal space and act as a plug to prevent any leakage or ingress of foreign material. They take up most of the area within the canal and rely on the sealer to fill any voids or irregular spaces between it and the canal walls. Although other materials have been fabricated in recent years, gutta-percha remains the most widely used and accepted core filling material.

Properties of an ideal core obturation material:

- Ease of manipulation

- Dimensional stability

- Excellent sealing ability (apically and laterally)

- Non-irritating to periapical tissues

- Radiopaque (to be visible on radiographs)

- Non-staining or discoloring

- Antimicrobial

- Biocompatible
