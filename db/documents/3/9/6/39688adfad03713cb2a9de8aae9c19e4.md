- Chigger bites typically occur during summer and early fall in those with recent outdoor exposure. However, in tropical areas of the world, chigger bites can occur year-round.

- Patients usually display pruritic papules, sometimes clustered around tightly fitting clothes.

- Itching usually lasts a few days but can sometimes extend as long as two weeks.

- Lesions can sometimes form vesicles or bullae and may have surrounding violaceous macules.

- Treatment is usually restricted to oral antihistamines, cold compresses, and topical corticosteroids.

- Prevention in those with recurrent exposure can be achieved by completelyÂ covering the skin or using insect repellents such as DEET and/or permethrin.

- Notable complications of chigger bites include secondary cellulitis, summer penile syndrome, and transmission of other diseases such as scrub typhus.
