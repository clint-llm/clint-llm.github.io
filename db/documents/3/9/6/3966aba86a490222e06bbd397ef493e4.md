Little is known or understood regarding the pathophysiology of the disease, or at least there is little consensus of agreement. However, there are theories that vestibular symptoms may be an aura, an associated symptom to a headache, or due to actual peripheral vestibulopathy. In 2011, Eggers et al. reported vertigo in a vestibular migraine as an associated phenomenon rather than an aura.

Another theory involves the idea of "kindling." Just as epileptic seizures may lower the threshold for future seizures, a similar thought process exists for vestibular migraines. The possibility that vestibular migraineurs become sensitized to stimuli such as motion in the visual field, and this may lead to recurrent vestibular migraine symptoms.

Finally, one study showed that caloric testing triggers a migraine in some individuals. In this study, 39 individuals with a history of a migraine underwent caloric testing. Within 24 hours, 19 of these individuals developed their typical migraine symptoms. 47% of those that developed a migraine within 24 hours actually developed a migraine during testing. This study design used a matched control group and only one of 21 from this group developed a migraine within the initial 24-hour period after testing.
