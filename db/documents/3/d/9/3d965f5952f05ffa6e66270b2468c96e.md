Despite recent advances in the medical field, the exact mechanism of JHR is still unclear and thought to be multifactorial. The breakdown of the spirochete after the use of antibiotics causes the release of toxins and cytokines. JHR is thought to be caused by an acute inflammatory reaction when cytokines and lipoproteins enter the patient's bloodstream. JHR causes an increase in inflammatory cytokines during the period of exacerbation, including interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which result in the development of body aches, fevers, rashes, nausea and vomiting, and flushing, along with other symptoms. The symptoms usually begin 2 hours from the administration of the antibiotic and resolve within 24 hours.
