Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is predominantly used to treat low-lying rectal carcinoma by removing the sigmoid colon, rectum, and anus, leaving behind a permanent colostomy. The procedure was first described by Sir William Ernest Miles in 1908, developed from earlier operations such as the transcoccygeal Kraske approach, which typically left patients with sphincter dysfunction.

Total mesorectal excision (TME) was introduced in the 1980s and was an important advancement in rectal surgery. The TME hypothesis governs that lymph nodes are randomly distributed in the mesorectum and are not easily visible or palpable. Rectal cancers tend to spread extramurally, both in distal and anterior directions, within the surrounding mesorectal lymphovascular tissue (mesorectum). The TME procedure removes the rectum alongside its associated lymph nodes while preserving structures outside the rectal fascia. This technique has reduced local recurrence (12 to 6%) and improved 5-year survival rates (53 to 87%) significantly for upper to mid rectal tumors and is considered the gold standard for rectal cancer resections.

However, for low-lying rectal cancers, conventional APR remains a non-standardized procedure, associated with poorer results than anterior resection, including higher rates of perforation and resection margin involvement.

In the last 30 years, APR has become increasingly advanced with the introduction of laparoscopic surgery and, more recently, robotics
