Bupropion is a frequently prescribed medication by the primary care provider,s nurse practitioners, psychiatrists, and internists. However, all healthcare workers who prescribe this agent need to be familiar with its adverse effect profile, occurring in at least 10% of patients. The most serious adverse effects are lowered seizure threshold and potential worsening of suicidal ideation. Clinicians should perform a mental health assessment of patients at each visit and educate them on what to do if and when a seizure develops.
