Atlantoaxial instability can be classified into three general categories: inflammatory, congenital, and traumatic.

Several congenital disorders are associated with atlantoaxial instability. The most well-known of these is DS. Patients with DS are more prone to atlantoaxial instability due to ligamentous laxity and osseous abnormalities. Os odontoideum is the separation of the odontoid process from the body of C2. Previously it was thought to be a congenital lesion, but it is more likely due to a traumatic insult early in life. Patients with os odontoideum require dynamic studies to demonstrate the degree of movement and canal compromise accurately. Trauma as the sole cause of atlantoaxial instability is a unique entity, usually resulting from a disruption of the transverse, alar, or apical ligaments. This type of injury is commonly associated with head trauma. Fractures of C1 or C2 also are traumatic causes of atlantoaxial instability.
