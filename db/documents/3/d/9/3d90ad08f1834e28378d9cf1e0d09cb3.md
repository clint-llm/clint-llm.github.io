SSN dysfunction epidemiological data are lacking and often debated given the heterogeneous reports in the literature in general, combined with the relatively recent increases and advancements in diagnostic imaging modalities. Moreover, the clinical significance of SSN dysfunction varies from complete irrelevance in asymptomatic patients who can be diagnosed with possible SSN dysfunction incidentally to increasing degrees of shoulder pain and dysfunction related to the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus atrophy and degeneration. Thus, incidence and prevalence rates remain elusive.

Estimations have cited SSN neuropathy, mechanical irritation during repetitive traction and overhead motions, and focal entrapment to represent anywhere from 0.4 to 2% of cases of shoulder girdle pain.Â Consensus does exist that SSN dysfunction is often seen in association with various sport-specific positions and elite levels of performance. Isolated infraspinatus muscle atrophy is often utilized as it is readily detectable on physical exam or other diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, electromyographic (EMG) studies, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While the clinical relevance of isolated infraspinatus atrophy remains unclear, with most patients reporting normal shoulder function and no pain, the associated incidence rates seen in the dominant shoulder of overhead athletes ranges from 4% to 52%, with the highest rates recently reported in a 2015 study that investigated the incidence seen in elite professional female tennis players.
