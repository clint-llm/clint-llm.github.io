Bartholin glands can form a cyst and an abscess in women of reproductive age. Both are difficult to differentiate on a physical exam. The cyst is usually 2-4 cm in diameter and may cause dyspareunia, urinary irritation, and vague pelvic pain. The cyst is usually filled with nonpurulent fluid that contains staphylococcus, streptococcus, and E.coli.
