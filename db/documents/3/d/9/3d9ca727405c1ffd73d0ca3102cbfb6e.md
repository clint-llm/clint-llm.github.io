CO2 retention is known as hypercapnia or hypercarbia. Hypercapnia is often caused by hypoventilation or failure to remove excess CO2 and may be diagnosed by an arterial or venous blood gas. Elevations of CO2 in the bloodstream can lead to respiratory acidosis. Normal respiratory drive, and thus CO2 exhalation, is primarily maintained by the chemoreceptor reflex. The chemoreceptor reflex is important in allowing the body to respond to changes in pO2, pCO2, and pH. Chemoreceptors can be categorized as peripheral or central. Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid and aortic bodies. The carotid body is the principal sensor of increased pCO2, decreased pO2, and overall decreased pH. The glomus cells of the carotid body relay changes in peripheral arterial pH to the central nervous system via the glossopharyngeal nerve.

Central chemoreceptors are located near the ventrolateral surfaces of the medulla. While peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to changes O2 and CO2, central chemoreceptors are responsive to changes in pCO2 and pH. Central chemoreceptors are able to rapidly detect changes in PCO2. The blood-brain barrier is permeable to CO2, thus allowing chemosensitive cells within the medulla to respond to elevations in blood CO2, and the subsequently lowered pH. The decrease in pH of the cerebrospinal fluid ultimately increases minute ventilation, defined by the product of respiratory rate and tidal volume. Interestingly, central chemoreceptors have shown a greater response to hypercapnic acidosis rather than isocapnic acidosis, in part likely due to the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier to H+ ions.
