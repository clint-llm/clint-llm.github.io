Deep inspiration generates negative intrathoracic pressure, leading to an increased venous return to the right atrium and, subsequently, the right ventricle. This phenomenon, in the healthy adult, enhances blood flow in the right heart chambers and causes decreased jugular venous pressure (JVP). It is by this mechanism that Carvallo noted that deep inspiration caused augmentation of right-sided heart murmurs, such as that of tricuspid regurgitation.

As noted by Pasteur, sustained abdominal pressure, similar to the mechanism described above, also causes an increased venous return. This forms the basis of the hepatojugular reflux, in which a sustained elevation of JVP on applying abdominal pressure is used as a marker of right ventricular failure.
