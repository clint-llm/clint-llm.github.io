It has become increasingly apparent as of early 2019 that the duration of an outpatient opioid prescription can have a significant impact on the chance of future development of opioid use disorder. There is moderately strong evidence thatÂ there is a growing intensity of likelihood of development of opioid use disorder if outpatient opioid consumption continues longer than five days past the date of injury, with this risk intensifying as subsequent days pass and opioid consumption for the pain related to the injury has not yet ceased. Some studies suggest that NSAIDs work as well for acute pain as opioids, but others have suggested there may be confounding by genetic opioid response heterogeneity, which as this point remains poorly characterized.
