Surgery remains the only definitive curative option available.Â In the event of surgery, preservation of functional lung tissue is the primary goal. Therefore, enucleation and wedge resections are the most common surgical choice, with more radical lobectomy or total pneumonectomy reserved for particularly deep lesions, multiple or large lesions that are making wedge resection impossible, or lesions adhering severely to the hilum of the lung. To avoid overlooking underlying malignant potential, obtaining intraoperative frozen sections is generally recommended.
