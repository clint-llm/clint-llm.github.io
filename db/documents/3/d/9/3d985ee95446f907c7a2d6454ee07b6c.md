Both major histocompatibility complex class I and class II molecules are responsible for the acute immune response that progresses to graft rejection. Because of the significant genetic variability in HLA antigens between individuals, donor organs can contain highly immunogenic antigens. It is the donorâ€™s HLA molecules themselves that get recognized as non-self HLA, which leads to the generation of anti-HLA antibodies and subsequent graft damage.

Donor organs are often preferentially taken from siblings or close family members and tested for HLA compatibility to minimize this risk. Patients typically undergo crossmatching to identify any preexisting HLA antibodies. However, post-transplant monitoring for anti-HLA antibodies is still required as they can develop even years after the transplant.
