The role of imaging is critical in the evaluation of a hemangioma including lesion size, site, and degree of lytic involvement of the spinal canal and neuroforamina. Radiograph usually shows a prominent trabecular pattern with vertical striations. The density of the vertebral body is often increased giving a sclerotic appearance. Vertebral body height and size should remain unaffected. On CT imaging, hemangiomas have a classic corduroy(accordion) pattern from coarsening of the trabeculae. Although rare, bone destruction and extension into the adjacent soft tissues including the spinal canal can be evaluated on CT imaging. MR imaging can definitively assess for soft-tissue extension.
