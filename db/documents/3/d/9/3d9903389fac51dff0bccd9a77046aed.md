The main vascular supply to the knee joint is from the popliteal artery though there is a rich network of collaterals that join the deep femoral artery. In the popliteal fossa, the popliteal artery branches into the four genicular arteries that supply the anatomical structures of the knee. Branches of the medial superior genicular artery and the network of genicular anastomosis supply the MPFL and surrounding structures.
