Although steroid use is of utmost benefit in many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, regular monitoring of the patientâ€™s ocular condition is mandatory to detect this complication at the earliest stage. This workup should include baseline IOP measurements, followed by checking IOP after two weeks, then every 4 to 6 weeks for about three months, and then six-monthly (if the initial response is ruled out). Although steroid-induced glaucoma is a dangerous and potentially blinding condition, it is manageable by early detection and prompt initiation of anti-glaucoma treatment.
