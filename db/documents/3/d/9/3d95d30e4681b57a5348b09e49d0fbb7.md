The etiology of traumatic diaphragm injuries occurs via blunt and penetrating injuries. Blunt mechanisms include motor vehicle accidents, falls from a significant height, or pedestrian strikes. Penetrating injuries can include gunshot wounds, stab wounds, or any foreign object which transverses the diaphragm disrupting the thoracoabdominal partition.

When at rest, the diaphragm is a concave tendinous structure. This downward projection towards the abdominal cavity at rest causes compression on the abdominal contents, which results in an outward projection of the abdominal wall. The chest wall is lowered, and the vertical diameter of the chest decreases. The presence of recoil brings the thorax back to its original position in exhalation. The diaphragm contracts and loses shape to a taut central tendon which becomes flat. This helps to expel air out of the lungs. With the exchange of air, the displacement of the diaphragm varies between one and two inches.

In blunt trauma, an abrupt increase in the pleuroperitoneal gradient causes an increase in kinetic energy transfer to the diaphragm, which results in the disruption. Petrone and colleagues

In penetrating trauma, the injury follows the tract of the foreign body and is typically small, with over 80% being smaller than 2 cm.
