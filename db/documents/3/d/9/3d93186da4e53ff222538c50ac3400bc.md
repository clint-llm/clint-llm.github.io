Yellow nail syndrome (YNS) is a rare condition defined by a presence of two of the following: (1) slow-growing, hard, yellow, and dystrophic nails, (2) lymphedema, and (3) respiratory tract disease.

Anatomically, YNS affects the fingernails, toenails, the respiratory tract, and gravity-dependent areas that can accumulate fluid (typically lower extremities). These signs and symptoms are believed to be due to dysfunction in lymphatic drainage.

**Nails**

As the name suggests, xanthonychia (yellow nail coloration) is a common feature of YNS; however, yellow nails are not required if two of the other clinical signs are present. Discoloration varies from pale yellow to dark green; nails can be opaque or translucent.

**Respiratory Tract**

The respiratory tract is involved in more than half of patients with YNS.

**Lymphedema**

Lymphedema typically manifests in the bilateral lower extremities and does not differ in appearance from primary lymphedema.

**Natural History**

The diagnosis of YNS can be difficult because patients rarely present concurrently with all three clinical criteria. Lymphedema is the initial symptom in approximately one-third of YNS diagnoses.
