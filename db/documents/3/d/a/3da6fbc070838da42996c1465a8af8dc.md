A significant concern of herbal supplementation is that many patients use herbal supplements but underreport them to their clinicians. In a Spanish study, 20% of patients reported taking an herbal supplement in addition to prescription drugs.

Not knowing if a patient uses herbal supplements may inadvertently complicate treatment. Since some herbal supplements are known to inhibit or enhance prescription drugs, not knowing what herbal supplements a patient is taking can lead to either ineffective treatment or toxicity and harmful side effects.
