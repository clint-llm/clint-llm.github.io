Persistent truncus arteriosus (TA) is a rare, congenital, cyanotic heart defect characterized by a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a single truncal valve, and a common ventricular outflow tract (OT). Systemic venous blood and pulmonary venous blood mix at the VSD level, and the resulting desaturated blood is ejected into the single OT. Because the pulmonary arteries arise directly from the truncus, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) will determine the pulmonary blood flow, which is usually torrential. Without surgical intervention, death in infancy is the rule. Long-term surgical outcomes are good, but there are often residual and potential complications that require regular, long-term cardiology follow-up.
