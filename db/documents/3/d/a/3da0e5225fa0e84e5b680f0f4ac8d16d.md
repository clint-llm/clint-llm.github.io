Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis can be a frustrating condition for patients and providers. Because the condition, by definition, is recurrent, patients benefit from having a medical home in which a primary care provider can monitor their condition over time and coordinate care. Other interprofessional team members may include a combination of a general otolaryngologist, rhinologist, pharmacist, nurse, and in some cases, an ophthalmologist. Management must be tailored to each patientâ€™s needs, as responses to specific treatments vary among individuals. Primary care and specialty providers are crucial to making diagnoses and formulating optimal treatment plans. Pharmacists ensure that medication selection and dosing are appropriate in the context of patient allergies and comorbidities. Nurses provide direct patient care and education and often facilitate communication between patients and physicians. Otolaryngologists, rhinologists, and ophthalmologists are often required to manage complications or perform surgical procedures when medical management fails.
