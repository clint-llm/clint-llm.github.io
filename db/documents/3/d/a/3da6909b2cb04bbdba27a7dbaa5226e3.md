In certain patients who are too unstable to move on from their primary survey and are unable to be resuscitated and stabilized, a secondary survey should not be performed. The only contraindication to the secondary survey would be if the patient succumbs to their injuries. Otherwise, the secondary survey must be completed on all trauma patients.  If the patient is severely injured, they might not be capable of providing a history.  In these situations, the history can be obtained from EMS and family members or even bystanders.
