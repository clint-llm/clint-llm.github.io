Inotersen toxicity may result in glomerulonephritis and renal failure in some patients. Additionally, patients with pre-existing renal conditions may experienceÂ exacerbated symptoms.

Additionally, with the exception of previously described rare occurrences, current data supports inotersen use for up to 5 years without significant toxicity concerns, so as long as bloodwork is monitored accordingly and contraindications are avoided.
