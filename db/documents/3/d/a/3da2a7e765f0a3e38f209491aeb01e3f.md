Always remember to order a urine pregnancy test!

Bear in mind that hormonal contraceptives inhibit the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, so patients must be off hormonal contraceptives for at least three months before testing FSH and estradiol. In addition, standard estradiol assays do not detect ethinyl estradiol, the estrogen in birth control.

Remember that it is common and not pathologic for patients on hormonal contraception to be amenorrheic. Amenorrhea on birth control does not require further evaluation unless there are other concerning symptoms.
