Few randomized clinical trials to effectively compare the antisialogogues exist, and therefore, an interprofessional effort necessary to coordinate the highest level of care for each patient. Individualizing each patient and prioritizing symptom relief to provide supportive care at the end of life must be discussed to improve patient safety and enhance patient-centered care. Coordinating end-of-life care with antisialogoguesÂ may at times appear to be a clinically challenging pathophysiological endeavor, and as such, requires the efforts of an interprofessional team, including a clinician who specializes in end-of-life medicine. Nursing interventions alone have demonstrated significant improvement in death rattle therapy; nurses can monitor the patient's response as well as check for adverse events and report to the prescriber.
