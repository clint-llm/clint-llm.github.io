Currently, two topical photosensitizers are FDA approved for dermatology indications. These are aminolevulinic acid and methyl aminolevulinate, the methylated derivative of ALA.

ALA is an unstable molecule and has low lipid solubility. This restricts the penetration of ALA through skin or cell membranes. Hence there is a requirement of longer contact times with ALA and limitation of ALA use in superficial skin diseases. Novel preparations of ALA have been developed, which have increased penetration and better molecular stability.

MAL, on the other hand, is a more stable molecule with better lipid solubility and hence deeper penetration as compared to ALA.

Light sources: Protoporphyrin 9 can be activated by visible light in the 404 to 420 nm (Blue wavelength, Soret band) and 635 nm (red wavelength regions).

Longer wavelengths of light result in deeper penetration. Hence blue light is used in the treatment of thin actinic keratoses, and red light is required for the treatment of deeper and thicker lesions and to target deeper tissues like the sebaceous glands.

Light sources include xenon lamps, halogen lamps, lasers (PDL, LP, Argon, Diode), IPL, LED, and fluorescence diagnostic systems.
