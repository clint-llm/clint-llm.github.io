Currently, the mainstay of the treatment of tracheal bronchus is symptomatic management. Asymptomatic cases require only observation, whereas symptomatic tracheal bronchus is treated based on the severity of symptoms. Given the broad range of symptoms that tracheal bronchus can present, medical management includes bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, muscarinic antagonists, and antibiotics. However, if the symptoms are refractory to medication, then surgical treatment is the next step in management. Segmentectomy and lobectomy have been performed for the treatment of recurrent pneumonia resulting from the tracheal bronchus and have shown to be curative.

One lung ventilation with the use of bronchial blocker in cases of unilateral thoracotomy or use of a double-lumen endotracheal tube is an option for intubation in these patients. Use of small caliber tubes, keeping the endotracheal tube high above the carina level by withdrawing it a little, and confirmation via fiber optic bronchoscope to double-check that there is no tracheal bronchus obstruction is done by anesthetics.
