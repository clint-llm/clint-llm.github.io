Patients should understand the importance of hygiene and the association of poor hygiene with penile cancers. Phimosis should be treated quickly as chronic inflammation can lead to the development of penile cancer. High-risk sexual behavior that makes the patient at risk for HPV and HIV should be discontinued, as well as tobacco use. Most importantly, patients need to understand that any lesions on the penis must be evaluated by a medical professional as soon as possible. Prompt diagnosis allows for intervention at an earlier stage and improved cosmetic and survival outcomes.
