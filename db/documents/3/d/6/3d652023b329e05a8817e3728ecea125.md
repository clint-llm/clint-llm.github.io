Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly reported side effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. These result from the degradation of undigested carbohydrates by bacteria in the colon, which causes excessive gas formation. Flatulence is the most commonly reported side effect, appearing in about 78% of the cases. Diarrhea and abdominal pain may also occur. The use of acarbose (but not other AGIs) has potential links with hepatitis in some instances. These abate with time, and their severity can be further reduced by starting with a low dose. A carbohydrate-rich diet can precipitate these adverse effects.
