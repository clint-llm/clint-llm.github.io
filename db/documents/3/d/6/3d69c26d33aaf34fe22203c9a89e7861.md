When compared to other illnesses, the incidence of chronic pancreatitis is hard to identify. In cases where the disease is secondary to alcohol, it can go largelyÂ undiagnosed since chronic pancreatitis is progressive. The diagnosis can take a long time to be discovered. The latest epidemiological report in 2014 estimated an incidence that has been consistent over the years. However, the prevalence might be underestimated. Further studies are needed.

In the US, the condition affects African Americans more frequently than caucasians. In addition, chronic pancreatitis due to alcohol is more common in males, whereas that due to hyperlipidemia is more common in females. The median age at diagnosis is 45.
