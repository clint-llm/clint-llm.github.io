The prescription of prisms is complex and requires expertise. Optometrists, orthoptics, and ophthalmologists need to work in coordination and understand the underlying pathology causing symptoms to treat it. Patients may present with complaints of headache, eye strain, or other asthenopic symptoms to anyone involved in eye healthcare. Thus it is essential to understand the basics for evaluation and prescription of prims.

The optometrists and orthoptists should check the fusional vergences in any patient complaining of asthenopic symptoms despite wearing correct refractive power.Â Vision therapy exercises should be prescribed to patients with any underlying fusional weakness. Patients complaining of double vision need a complete detailed evaluation by the ophthalmologist. Appropriate referrals should be made to a physician or neurologist to rule out underlying associations.

Systemic conditions like myasthenia gravis Graves disease can often present to the ophthalmologist first, and thus detailed examination and a high index of suspicion can lead to the correct diagnosis. Neurological lesions may present with gaze palsy, skew deviation, or internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Thus it is essential to evaluate the patient thoroughly and refer the patient to the radiologist for necessary investigations. Opinions from neurologists or neurosurgeons can be lifesaving in some emergency conditions, and a lower threshold should be used for the same.
