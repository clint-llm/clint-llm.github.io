The differential diagnosis of Muir-Torre syndrome would include other syndromes in which multiple cutaneous papules and nodules appear on the face and/or body, such as Cowden syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome. Syndromes such as the Grzybowski-type generalized eruptive keratoacanthomas and the Ferguson-Smith-type multiple eruptive keratoacanthomas should be considered in patients with numerous keratoacanthomas. The sporadic versions of sebaceous tumors and keratoacanthomas also should also be considered although the former is not common in the general population. As noted previously, sporadic sebaceous neoplasms occur most often on the head while they are rarely seen below the neck. Sebaceous neoplasms found below the neck should raise suspicion of Muir-Torre syndrome.
