The role of a trauma nurse is to intervene rapidly and identify all injuries. Nurses follow similar protocols to physicians during trauma cases, but with subtle differences. Although much more in-depth than the material covered in trauma care principles, this abbreviated, step-by-step mnemonic helps nurses provide standardized care during a trauma case:

- Airway & alertness with cervical immobilization

- Breathing/ventilation

- Circulation and control of hemorrhage

- Disability (neurologic status)

- Exposure and environmental control

- Full set of vitals and family presence

- Get resuscitation adjuncts (LMNOP)

- Laboratories: ABG, lactic acid, CBC, and CMP
- Monitor: telemetry, ECG
- Naso/orogastric tube
- Oxygenation/ventilation
- Pain assessment and management

Providing adequate nursing care to a trauma patient is difficult, especially if the patient presents to the trauma bay with multiple injuries. One of the most challenging nursing interventions is to identify injuries missed during the primary survey. The secondary survey involves a history and a head-to-toe assessment, including the patientâ€™s posterior surfaces. Overall, the nursing team plays a pivotal role in these cases.
