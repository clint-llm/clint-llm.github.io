Situs inversus is a rare congenital condition where the visceral thoracic and abdominal organs are flipped in the vertical axis.

Dextrocardia is a rare congenital condition where only the heart has flipped in the vertical axis. Although dextrocardia usually does not present with symptoms, other heart abnormalities are commonly present.

90% of congenital abnormalities of the thoracic wall include pectus excavatum (depressed sternum) and pectus carinatum (protrusion of the sternum).
