Napalm toxicity occurs almost exclusively as a result of military action. Military uses include dropping napalm containing bombs from aircraft, napalm use in flamethrowers (handheld or vehicle-borne), and napalm use in ground explosive devices.

Non-military-related exposure may arise from improvised hand-held firebombs or "Molotov cocktails." Home-made firebombs may employ fuel thickening agents to create a weapon with an effect similar to military-grade napalm. Individuals or groups utilizing these weapons may not necessarily have affiliations with a uniformed military.
