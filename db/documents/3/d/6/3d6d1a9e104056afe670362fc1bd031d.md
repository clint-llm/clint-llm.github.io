Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) refers to a group of conditions involving the orofacial region divided into those affecting the masticatory muscles and those affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The typical features include pain in TMJ, restriction of mandibular movement, and TMJ sounds. These symptoms may resolve by themselves without further treatment. If not, conservative methods are the first to be used with positive results in most patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of temporomandibular disorder and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.
