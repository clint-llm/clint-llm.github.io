The true incidence of serotonin syndrome is unknown, most likely because mild cases are frequently overlooked or dismissed. Even more serious cases may frequently be attributed to other causes. There is no confirmatory test or specific laboratory findings, and the syndrome has a broad spectrum of severity ranging from barely perceptible to lethal. Serotonin syndrome occurs in all age groups, and the incidence is increasing with the increased use of serotonergic agents. SSRIs are the most common class of medications implicated in serotonin syndrome due to widespread use.
