Since the ethmoid bone forms part of the orbit, it is associated with seven extraocular muscles. All but the inferior oblique arise from the orbital apex. The inferior oblique arises from the orbit floor near the orbital rim while the rectus muscles arise from the annulus of Zinn. All of the extraocular muscles have an insertion to the globe apart from the levator palpebrae superioris, which expands to form the levator aponeurosis.
