Until recently, gallium scans can detect many pathologies and have been phased out due to newer developments (ex. 18F-FDG). Gallium was limited to detecting cancer and inflammatory processes only, but now the gallium redux is expanding to detect all kinds of pathology with gallium-68 as a radiotracer. Gallium scans are adjuncts for diagnosis, although some conjugates have specific receptors. Gallium distributes in the body according to the conjugate used. If citrate is used, gallium's natural properties allow the body to metabolize it like ferric iron.

If gallium is chelated with other molecules (ex. DOTATATE), it distributes in the body according to the receptor's affinity to that molecule. An abnormal accumulation of gallium implies a localization of underlying pathology, either tumor or inflammation with citrate as a conjugate or specific pathologies (ex. NETs) depending on the conjugate molecule.

68Ga can be conjugated with various molecules to help diagnose multiple pathologies. Currently, it is primarily used for cancer detection (NETs and prostate cancer). It can be used in the detection, staging, post-treatment response, and surveillance of cancer. It can be usedÂ alone but is usually used complementary to other imaging methods (ex. 18F-FDG PET, CT, MRI, etc.) for more detailed anatomy and specificity. Further developments and research may allow gallium-68 scans to adequately diagnose pulmonary embolisms, cardiac pathologies, respiratory pathologies, Alzheimer's disease, bone infections, and other cancers.

67Ga-citrate is primarily used to help diagnose lymphomas (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's, especially for restaging), fever of unknown origin. It may be used in certain cancers (ex. bronchogenic carcinoma), although 18F-FDG has superseded it.
