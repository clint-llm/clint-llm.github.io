Typically, Muehrcke's nails are the result of hypoalbuminemia. Although the exact pathophysiology is unclear, it is thought that a localized edematous state in the nailbed results in increased pressure on the vasculature in this region. As a result, the normal appearance of erythema observed through the nail plate is not seen. Instead, a Muehrcke's nail/line is seen. This theory is corroborated by an array of studies documenting this finding in patients with hypoalbuminemia, ranging from <2.2 g/100 mL as in Muehrcke's original study up to 2.7 g/100 mL.

Trauma may similarly result in local edema or damage to the nail bed and associated vasculature, limiting visible erythema. In extreme elevations, physiologic changes to blood circulation may predispose to Muehrcke's nails. What is less understood, however, is how systemic chemotherapy induces Muehrcke's nails as reports in this patient population document higher (e.g.,>3.4 g/100 mL) and even normal albumin levels.
