The causes of akinesia can be classified based on the age group of presentation.

1. Adult-onset akinesia has been associated with the following two causes:

- Pure isolated akinesia

- Late stages of disorders affecting the basal ganglia or frontal lobes

- Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (also known as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome)
- Parkinson's disease (PD)
- Multiple system atrophy
- Normal-pressure hydrocephalus.

2. The fetal akinetic syndrome (fetal arthrogryposis or Pena–Shokeir syndrome type 1), is a cause of intrauterine fetal death or rarely a live birth, related to diffuse contractures across the body (arthrogryposis) of the fetus and subsequently reduced movement, further leading to intrauterine growth restriction, short umbilical cord, and pulmonary hypoplasia.
