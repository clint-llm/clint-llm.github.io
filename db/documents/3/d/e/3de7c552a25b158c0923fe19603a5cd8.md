Patients usually present in the neonatal period between 3 and 15 months after a period of fasting, acute illness, or a combination of the two. Altered mental status, emesis, dehydration, drowsiness, and poor feeding may all be presenting symptoms. On exam, hepatomegaly may be identified, and neurologic exam may be abnormal if encephalopathy is present. Breastfeeding infants are particularly high risk in the first 72 hours, depending on maternal breastmilk supply. If supply and milk let down has not occurred, then neonates may experience prolonged periods of fasting resulting in an early presentation of metabolic crisis.
