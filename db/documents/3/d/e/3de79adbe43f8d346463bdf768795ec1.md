Skin biopsy in conjunction with physical exam findings are the primary methods of diagnosis in GLPLS. Histology of the cicatricial areas and the hyperkeratotic papules reveals features of lichen planopilaris. Biopsy shows areas of perifollicular inflammation leading to pilosebaceous destruction, with late-stage GLPLS causing corruption of arrector pili muscles. Clinical evaluation of GLPLS shows erythematous follicular papules varying in size from 1 to 4 mm, non-cicatricial alopecia of the perineum and axillae, and patchy cicatricial alopecia on the scalp. Hyperkeratotic papules are typically present on the trunk, thighs, inner arms, outer arms, and wrists with or without pruritus. Initial onset of the hyperkeratotic papules can precede the development of alopecia on the scalp. However, there is no set chronological order of symptoms.
