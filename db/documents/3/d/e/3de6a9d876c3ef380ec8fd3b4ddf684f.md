Significant racial and ethnic differences exist in the incidence and prevalence rates of ESRD. The highest incidence is found in African Americans; followed by American Indians and Alaska Natives; followed by Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders; followed by whites. Hispanics have higher incidence rates of ESRD than non-Hispanics.

Early-stage CKD and ESRD are associated with increased morbidity and health care utilization rates. A review of the USRDS 2009 annual data report suggests that the number of hospitalizations in ESRD patients is 1.9% per patient-year. In a study by Khan SS et al., the prevalence of cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease in earlier stages of CKD was comparable to those in the US dialysis population. It was also found that patients with CKD had 3-fold higher rates of hospitalization and hospital days spent per patient-year compared to the general US population.

Patients with CKD and particularly end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease. A review of USRDS 2009 data suggests that 5-year survival probability in a patient on dialysis is only around 34%.
