Atheroembolic renal disease is caused by the occlusion of small arteries in the kidneys by cholesterol crystal emboli from ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques and is a part of systemic atheroembolic disease. The proximity of the kidneys to the abdominal aorta and high renal blood flow makes them the most frequent target organ. This activity examines when this condition should be considered in the differential diagnoses and how to properly evaluate it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients having with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of atheroembolic renal disease.
- Describe the reasons for a delayed diagnosis of atheroembolic renal disease.
- Outline the risk factors for developing the classic findings associated with atheroembolic renal disease.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with atheroembolic renal disease.
