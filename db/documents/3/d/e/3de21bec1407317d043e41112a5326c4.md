# Continuing Education Activity

Postpartum psychosis is an acute illness of multifactorial origin and is considered a psychiatric emergency. In this activity, the common presentations, diagnosis, and treatment options for postpartum psychosis are reviewed. This activity also outlines the role of interprofessional team members in increasing awareness and decreasing latency between onset and diagnosis of this condition to improve treatment outcomes in patients experiencing postpartum psychosis.

**Objectives:**
- Review the potential risk factors for developing postpartum psychosis.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with postpartum psychosis.
- Explain the pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options and the indications for immediate admission to the hospital in a patient with postpartum psychosis.
- Explain the importance of improving communication and collaboration between interprofessional teams to enhance the delivery of care in postpartum psychosis.

# Introduction

Childbirth is considered a major physical, emotional, and social stressor in a woman’s life. Following days to weeks after childbirth, most women experience some mental disturbance like mood swings and mild depression (also known as post-baby blues), but a few can also suffer from PTSD, major depression, or even full-blown psychosis.

# Etiology

Postpartum psychosis has a complex multifactorial origin. Risk factors include a history of bipolar disorder,  history of postpartum psychosis in a previous pregnancy, family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, history of schizoaffective disorder or schizophrenia, and discontinuation of psychiatric medications during pregnancy. The overall prevalence is higher in patients suffering from affective disorders like bipolar one, two, and first-time pregnancy with a previous family or personal history of bipolar one disorder is considered the single most important risk factor.****Lack of sleep and hormonal fluctuations after birth, especially the rapidly falling levels of estrogen, may also pose a risk; previous postulations proposed that treatment with estradiol may be beneficial as an adjunctive treatment for women with psychosis in schizophrenia.

# Epidemiology

With an estimated global prevalence of 0.089 to 2.6 per 1000 births, postpartum psychosis classifies as an illness with a low incidence rate. However, it carries the potential for serious medical and social consequences, including the risk of suicide and filicide, if not promptly detected and treated.

# History and Physical

When a patient presents with symptoms of psychosis and recent history (days to few weeks) of giving birth a  careful and thorough history and neuropsychiatric evaluation is required to expedite correct diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. It is essential to rule out a previous personal or family history of psychiatric illness. Prenatal and perinatal health records should undergo an evaluation to rule out medical comorbidities, organic causes, and a complicated obstetrical history like preeclampsia and eclampsia or negative birth outcomes. The clinician should note whether the patient with a psychiatric history who was previously stable on psychiatric medications was compliant with her prescribed psychiatric medications throughout the pregnancy as often medications are discontinued before or during pregnancy.

Substance abuse, medication history, and a history of any other recent major stressors or traumatic events merit attention. The care team should also evaluate the patient’s social support network, including the role and responsibilities of her partner and other available caregivers in the family. Symptoms of puerperal psychosis include confusion, lack of touch with reality, disorganized thought pattern and behavior, odd effect, sleep disturbances, delusions, paranoia, appetite disturbances, a noticeable change in the level of functioning from baseline, hallucinations, and suicidal or homicidal ideation. Safety of the patient and newborn is of utmost importance, and thus, immediate hospitalization is warranted if there is a risk of harm to either one.

# Evaluation

Postpartum psychosis has been underdiagnosed and underreported because there are no standard screening procedures in place during the prenatal and postnatal periods.

- A complete blood count (CBC)

- Electrolytes

- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

- Blood glucose

- Creatinine

- Vitamin B12

- Folate

- Thiamine

- Calcium

- Thyroid function tests

- Liver function tests or LFTs

- Urinalysis

- Urine drug screen

- Urine/blood cultures for patients with fever

- CT/ MRI brain

The above lab tests help to rule out medical conditions and organic causes that may present as psychosis. Examples include hypo and hypernatremia, hypo and hyperglycemia (insulin shock and diabetic ketoacidosis), abnormal liver function tests (hepatic encephalopathy), and hypo and hyperthyroidism (thyroid storm in Graves disease). Other examples are uremia, substance abuse, hypercalcemia (in hyperparathyroidism), urine and blood cultures to rule out infection and CT, and MRI to see for a possibility of a stroke, especially in women with a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia.

# Treatment / Management

Timely identification of the illness is of utmost importance as it is a psychiatric emergency. Postpartum psychosis usually has a sudden onset but is a brief and limited illness that responds rapidly to treatment. Mothers who are at risk for harm to themselves or the baby require immediate hospitalization. There are no current guidelines to manage postpartum psychosis, and the management depends on the cause. Once organic causes have been ruled out, medications to control acute psychosis may be started. These include mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, and antiepileptic drugs. Common drugs from these classes include lithium, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines, quetiapine, olanzapine, etc.

Although prophylactic treatment for women with bipolar disorder throughout pregnancy is a recommendation for women at high risk of relapse, benefits and risks merit careful discussion.

For women with a previous history of postpartum psychosis, the recommendation is high therapeutic target level lithium prophylaxis (zero points eight to one mmol/liter) to prevent future episodes. In that case, lithium blood levels should be obtained twice a week for at least the first two weeks postpartum. Women should abstain from breastfeeding while taking lithium as it is eliminated in breast milk and may cause higher exposure levels in infants as their metabolic systems and mechanisms of drug excretion are underdeveloped.**.**

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is recognized as a means of treatment with a tremendous benefit in patients with psychosis related to schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder refractory to antipsychotic pharmacotherapy.

The patient and the family must make an informed decision, carefully weighing the risks and benefits of medication management during pregnancy. Of the main pharmacological options, lithium has a 2.8% rate of causing major congenital malformations, valproate is highest at 5 to 8%, and carbamazepine 2 to 6%.

# Differential Diagnosis

Following psychiatric

The psychiatric differential may include:

- Bipolar 1 relapse (current and past history of low and high moods plus family history)

- Unipolar major depression with psychotic features with postpartum onset

- OCD and schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder (past treatment history and medication non-compliance)

- Hyperthyroidism-thyroid storm as in Graves disease (thyroid function tests), fever due to these conditions: infections such as sepsis, meningitis, encephalitis, (complete blood count/ESR /differential, lumbar puncture)

- Diabetic ketoacidosis (fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, history of glucose tolerance during pregnancy)

- Substance misuse (drug screen for drugs of abuse)

- Uremia (kidney function tests, BUN, creatinine)

- Hepatic encephalopathy (LFTs, AST, ALT, hepatitis screen if a history of exposure or disease, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin direct/indirect, lipase)

- Vitamin B12 deficiency

- Thiamine deficiency

- Hypercalcemia

- Pregnancy-induced hypertension and stroke due to preeclampsia or eclampsia (CT/MRI to rule out stroke)

- Metabolic or nutritional causes (electrolytes)

- Immunological causes like SLE

- Certain drugs like corticosteroids, antivirals (acyclovir and interferon), antibiotics (gentamicin, vancomycin, isoniazid), anticholinergic medicines like atropine, benztropine, and sympathomimetic stimulants like amphetamine, ephedrine, and theophylline

# Prognosis

Postpartum psychosis is a severe mental crisis that warrants immediate medical attention. Although considered a psychiatric emergency, most patients respond to treatment and demonstrate fast recovery and remission.

# Complications

Postpartum psychosis is a rare occurrence but may lead to undesirable outcomes. The proper identification of risk markers would enhance the ability to prevent and manage the condition. If left untreated, it can result in tragic consequences like suicide or filicide. It is a period of tremendous stress for the partner and other family members involved in taking care of the patient and has notable psychosocial implications.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Like any other mental illness, postpartum psychosis not only affects the mother and the infant but has an equal impact on families and caregivers. It is crucial for the treatment team to be able to understand the magnitude of physical and emotional stress the partner and other family members are going through and address all their questions and concerns in an empathetic manner.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Regular screening for signs of mental illness during pregnancy and after childbirth should be protocol. Social services, nurses, and other relevant departments may be involved to assess the situation and provide support and assistance if needed; reporting to clinicians whenever there is evidence suggesting a lack of improvement. When a patient seeks prenatal or postnatal care, primary care providers should pay attention to the entire bio-psycho-social model and not just the patient's physical and medical issues related to pregnancy. EPDS (Edinburgh postnatal depression scale) and MDQ (mood disorder questionnaire) are quick and effective screenings to identify telltale signs of possible mental illness in women during and after pregnancy.

Postpartum psychosis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, mental health professionals, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
