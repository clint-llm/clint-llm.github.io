Theophylline toxicity is best managed in an interprofessional fashion. The drug can affect many organ systems, including the heart, lung, central nervous system (CNS), and GI tract. The key to theophylline toxicity is prevention. First, healthcare providers should avoid prescribing this agent for asthma when other safer drugs are available. All patients should be educated about the dangers of theophylline. Parents should be told to store theophylline in a safe place away from the reach of children. For those who intentionally overdose on the drug, a mental health consult is recommended before discharge.

**Outcomes**

Only anecdotal reports and small case series exist on short-termÂ outcomes after theophylline toxicity. However, despite the few cases being reported, the drug is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Several deaths have been reported both in the United States and abroad following theophylline toxicity. But overall, the number of cases of theophylline toxicity subsides as healthcare providers no longer prescribe this agent for asthma.
