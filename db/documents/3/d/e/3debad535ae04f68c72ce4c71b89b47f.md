Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 have three major biological properties that play an important role in disease pathogenesis. These include neurovirulence, latency, and reactivation. Neurovirulence is the ability to invade and replicate in the nervous system, and latency is the ability to maintain the latent infection in the nerve cell. Reactivation is the ability to replicate and cause the disease process again, once induced by specific stimuli. HSV-1 causes herpes gingivostomatitis and eventually herpes labialis using the same biological properties. The pathogenesis of herpes gingivostomatitis involves the replication of the herpes simplex virus, cell lysis, and eventual destruction of mucosal tissue. Exposure to HSV-1 of the abraded surfaces allows the virus to enter and rapidly replicate in epidermal and dermal cells. This results in the clinical manifestation of perioral blisters, erosions of the lips and mucosa, and eventual hemorrhagic crusting. Sufficient viral inoculation and replication allow the virus to enter sensory and autonomic ganglia, where it travels intra-axonally to the ganglionic nerve bodies. HSV-1 most commonly infects the trigeminal ganglia, where the virus remains latent until reactivation, most commonly in the form of herpes labialis.
