Given the potential cardiotoxic effects of certain antihistamines, they are relatively contraindicated in any patient with QTc prolongation. Patients using other QTc-prolonging drugs require careful monitoring for further prolongation of the QTc interval due to the risk of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Usage in pregnant women is a relative contraindication. Additionally, women who are lactating should also avoid usage of antihistamines.

Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should use antihistamines with caution.

Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, urinary retention, increased ocular pressure are relative contraindications to the use of antihistamines.
