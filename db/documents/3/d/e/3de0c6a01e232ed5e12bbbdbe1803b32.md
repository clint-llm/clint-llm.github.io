Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the hepatocytes. Cytological features depend on the differentiation of hepatocytes. From well-differentiated to poorly differentiated HCC. The trabecular architectural pattern is the commonest. Other patterns include pseudoacinar (acinar with proteinaceous material), compact and sarcomatoid.

Histology may show variation, according to the differentiation of the tissue:

**Well-Differentiated:**cells smaller than normal, minimal nuclear atypia, nuclear density two times of normal liver

**Moderately Differentiated:**larger tumor cells with more eosinophilic cytoplasm, pseudoglands, distinct nucleoli, bile, and giant tumor cells

**Poorly Differentiated:**large tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei prominent pleomorphism may have spindle cell or small-cell areas
