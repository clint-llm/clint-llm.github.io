The resolution of symptoms is dependent on the etiology of cervicitis. According to the CDC guidelines, empiric treatment is recommended for women at higher risk of STIs, which include women <25, those with a new sexual partner, a partner with an STI, or multiple concurrent sexual partners. For these women, antimicrobials to cover for chlamydia and gonorrhea is given. Empiric treatment is also suggested for women with no identifiable pathogen on testing. Treatment can be deferred until the confirmatory tests are available for women at lower risk of STIs. According to the guidelines published by Institut national d’excellence en Sante et en services sociaux (INESSS), the empiric regimens are as follows:

- 1g single oral dose azithromycin PLUS either 800 mg cefixime in a single oral dose or 250 mg intramuscular ceftriaxone in a single dose

- 100 mg oral doxycycline twice daily for 7 days PLUS either 800 mg cefixime in a single oral dose or 250 mg intramuscular ceftriaxone in a single dose

- For severe allergy to penicillins/cephalosporins: 2g oral azithromycin in a single dose

For infectious agents identified by laboratory investigations, the treatment is as follows:

- Chlamydia: A single oral dose of 1g azithromycin OR 100mg doxycycline twice daily for 7 days

- Gonorrhea: 250mg intramuscular ceftriaxone PLUS a single oral dose of 1g azithromycin

- Mycoplasma: 400mg moxifloxacin after treatment failure with 1g oral azithromycin

- Trichomonas: A single oral 2g dose of metronidazole OR tinidazole
