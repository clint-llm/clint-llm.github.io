Workup should include the following:

- Serum theophylline level

- Serum glucose: Hyperglycemia is common theophylline toxicity

- Complete metabolic panel: Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis are common with theophylline toxicity

- Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cells can be elevated due to increase catecholamine release

- Serum calcium: Hypercalcemia is seen in theophylline toxicity

- Serum acetaminophen level, serum salicylate level, urine drug screen: Evaluate for co-ingestion or unknown ingestion

- Serum iron level: Iron toxicity can have a similar presentation to theophylline toxicity

- Creatine kinase: Evaluation for rhabdomyolysis

- Liver function tests: Evaluation of liver dysfunction as the liver metabolizes theophylline.

- ECG to evaluate arrhythmias, ischemia, or other toxic ingestions

- Consider CT Head: Evaluation of other potential causes of altered mental status or seizures
