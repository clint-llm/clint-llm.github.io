Blood transfusions and hemolysis can interfere with the body's iron distribution; thus, it is not recommended to have a gallium-citrate scan after a recent transfusion due to uptake anomalies. Depending on the conjugated molecule for 68Ga scans, there could be metabolic interference from various substances. For example, therapeutic somatostatin analogs may interfere with 68Ga-DOTATATE scans, so if possible, short-acting somatostatin analogs should be stopped 24 hours before the scan.

Motion artifact may be a source of error. Other sources of error include but are not limited to: misinterpreting physiological uptake areas, anatomical uptake variation, clothing and skin contamination with urine, recent procedures or trauma, recent or current chemotherapy, medication-related uptake changes (ex. somatostatin analogs decreasing uptake of 68Ga-DOTATATE, or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor increasing bone uptake of gallium), and rarely instrumentation calibration error (ex. PET/CT superimposition error).
