Although there are no specific drug monitoring requirements, variations in gene codons for receptor type can yield various sensitivities to ephedrine. Specifically, variations at codons 16 and 27 for the beta-2 adrenoreceptor have significant differences in ephedrine requirement to combat hypotension post-spinal anesthesia. Due to the variation in responses and the fact that vasoactive medications can immediately affect blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry require close monitoring.
