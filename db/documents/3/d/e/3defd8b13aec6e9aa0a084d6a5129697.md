The male reproductive system consists of the internal structures: the testes, epididymis, vas deferens, prostate, and the external structures: the scrotum and penis. These structures are well-vascularized with many glands and ducts to promoteÂ the formation, storage, and ejaculation of sperm for fertilization, and to produce important androgens for male development.
