The diagnosis of opioid use disorder helps modify clinicians prescribing practices to recognize patients taking chronic opioids. Clinicians should offer all patients with the opioid-use disorder naloxone, a mu-opioid receptor antagonist. It saves lives.

During and after tapering off methadone, close contact with the patient should be maintained because discontinuation of maintenance carries high risks of relapse to the use of illicit drugs and overdoses that may lead to death.

Over 90% of patients go through opioid withdrawal and relapse one month later.
