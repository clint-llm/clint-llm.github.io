Upper airway resistance syndrome, commonly known as UARS, is a disorder included with many others that encompass an umbrella of conditions characterized as a sleep-related breathing disorder. UARS aimed to understand what was not historically covered by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients suffering from UARS show a decrease in oxygen saturation while sleeping, as observed in patients suffering from OSA during a clinical sleep study. Even though their oxygen levels remain in the "normal" range, patients suffering from UARS can still suffer from metabolic and cardiovascular consequences we see presented in patients who have been clinically diagnosed with OSA.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) can be identified in individuals with risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing.
- Explain the evaluation of patients with upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS).
- Outline a treatment plan with appropriate oral appliances for patients with upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS).
- Review interprofessional measures to help identify and manage upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS).
