The domains from BCR include:

- CC domain

- Ser/Thr kinase domain (contains a docking site Y177)

- Rho/GEF kinase domain

The domains from ABL1 include:

- SH domain (SH1/SH2)

- Proline-rich domain

- DNA & actin-binding domains

The CC domain and Y177 of BCR are essential for the activation of the ABL1 gene and have shown to be closely associated with sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The Rho/GEF kinase domain plays a vital role in activating differentiation in the protooncogene induced leukemogenesis.

The SH domain of ABL1 controls the gene’s activation and deactivation, and hence this domain is an important site for pharmacologic intervention.

As a result of different breakpoints in the BCR gene, that occur over quite a short DNA stretch of 5 -6 kilobases in the middle of the gene, three different BCR/ABL1 proteins are formed namely P190, P210, P230 which are usually associated with ALL, CML and CNL respectively. The numeral value represents the kDa size of the hybrid protein. There have been some reports showing correlations of P190 with CML, P210 with ALL, and P190 or P210 with AML. P230is formed by the fusion of the ABL1 gene with almost the entire BCR gene leading to the production of a 230-kDa protein.

In CML, the oncoprotein P210 forms by the fusion of exon 2 (b2) or exon 3 (b3) of the BCR gene with the exon 2 (a2) of the ABL1 gene leading to the formation of either b2a2 or b3a2 11345193. Both of the transcripts produce a hybrid P210.
