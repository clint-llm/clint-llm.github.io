Fat embolism (FE) and fat embolism syndrome (FES) are a clinical phenomenon that are characterized by systemic dissemination of fat emboli within the system circulation. The dissipation of fat emboli will disrupt the capillary bed and affect microcirculation, causing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and presentation of fat embolism syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the difficulty in making a diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of fat embolism syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment of fat embolism syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by fat embolism syndrome.
