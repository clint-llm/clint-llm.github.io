Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is usually progressive over time and can cause permanent median nerve damage. The syndrome recurs to some degree even after surgical management in up to one-third of the patients after 5 years. Almost 90% of mild to moderate CTS cases respond to conservative management. However, many patients progress to requiring surgery. Patients with CTS secondary to diabetes or wrist fracture tend to have a less favorable prognosis than do those with no apparent underlying cause. Patients who have normal electrophysiologic studies have much less favorable operative outcomes than do individuals with abnormalities on these tests and also more complications. Axonal loss on electrophysiologic testing is also a poor prognostic factor.
