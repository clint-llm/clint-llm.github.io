Episodes of night terrors most often occur in the first third of the night during slow non-rapid eye movement sleep when the child is in the transitional state of being wakeful and sleeping. This particular period is referred to as the arousal state.

Episodes can appear to be very dramatic in presentation with the child screaming and thrashing without realization of his or her surroundings. Children may show signs of excessive autonomic activity such as tachycardia, tachypnea, mydriasis, and excessive sweating. In some cases, enuresis can also occur.

Unfortunately, children often do not respond to verbal cues, being comforted, or attempts to awaken. It is extremely difficult to wake these children in the middle of an episode. These spells can last approximately 10 to 20 minutes and then the childÂ will abruptly return to sleep. Most do not recall the episodes.
