- Akinesia refers to the inability to perform a clinically perceivable movement

- It occurs because the time taken to initiate the reaction is significantly increased, preventing a rapid build-up of adequate power from starting the movement.

- Adult-onset akinesia can present as pure isolated akinesia or in late stages of disorders affecting the basal ganglia or frontal lobes.

- Fetal akinesia syndrome has been primarily found to be lethal in utero. However, the rate of disease in live births is 1 in 3000 cases.

- In parents with a live/stillbirth suggestive of fetal akinesia syndrome, fetal surveillance in subsequent pregnancies is essential.

- Akinesia in adults can often present as an emergency, known as akinetic crises, which include dysphagia, hyperthermia, dysautonomia, the increment of muscle enzymes, and alterations of mental status.

- The management of akinesia is supportive rather than curative.

- Progressive resistance exercise is useful in improving symptoms of an improved static posturography and gait in the akinetic rigid variant of Parkinson disese.
