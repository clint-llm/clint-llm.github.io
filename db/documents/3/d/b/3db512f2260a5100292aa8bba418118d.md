Streptokinase is a polypeptide derived from beta-hemolytic streptococci of Lancefield group C bacteria. It forms a complex with plasminogen, which then converts to the proteolytic enzyme plasmin. This process results in a cascade that ultimately leads to the lysis of fibrin clots. Streptokinase causes a systemic thrombolytic state that usually resolves within 48 hours of administration. The half-life of streptokinase is between 23 and 29 minutes; however, it has been reported as high as 89 minutes in some instances.
