Histological grade is the single most important predictor of local recurrence and metastasis. Low-grade chondrosarcomas, which grow insidiously and rarely metastasize, have a good prognosis. The 5-year survival of grade I chondrosarcomas is 83%. High-gradeÂ chondrosarcoma and dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, by comparison, have an inferior prognosis due to the rapid growth of the tumor and the propensity for early metastasis
