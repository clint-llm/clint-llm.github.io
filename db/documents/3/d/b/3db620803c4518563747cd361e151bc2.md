Trigger Finger is a common condition which may cause significant functional impairment. It is a tenosynovitis in the flexor sheaths of the fingers and thumb as a result of repetitive use. A narrowing of flexor pulley sheaths combined with hypertrophy and inflammation of the tendon/sheath interface causes trigger finger or stenosing tenosynovitis. The inflammation may cause the tendon to become nodular.  It most commonly occurs in the ring finger and the thumb but can present in any finger. It classically involves the A1 pulley sheath (at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint) which is the proximal portion of the tendon sheath.  It can also occur at A2 (at the proximal interphalangeal joint) or A3 (at the distal interphalangeal joint). Patients complain of locking of the digits during either flexion or extension. Usually, the extension is more problematic.

Trigger finger is painful. It usually begins as an odd ache in the palm during movement of the affected finger. Gradually there is snapping sound of the flexor tendon as the individual extends and flexes the digit. Trigger finger commonly affects the dominant hand and the most common digit involved is the thumb.
