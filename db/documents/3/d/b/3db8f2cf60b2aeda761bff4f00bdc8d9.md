While there are no formal contraindications for a clear liquid diet, there are some significant considerations when utilizing this diet choice.

Many foods available to this diet are high in carbohydrates and simple sugars, and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for hyper- and hypoglycemia. Blood glucose should be monitored frequently and any insulin doses adjusted.

Most common clear liquids are thin liquids, and some patients may be at risk of aspiration. The majority of these liquids can be thickened easily and effectively, though the choice of thickener is also important as some are starch-based. The input of a speech and language pathologist is very helpful.

It can be challenging to provide the necessary nutrients and calories needed while maintaining a clear liquid diet, so the transition to solid foods should take place as rapidly as possible and interprofessional communication can produce the best patient outcomes.
