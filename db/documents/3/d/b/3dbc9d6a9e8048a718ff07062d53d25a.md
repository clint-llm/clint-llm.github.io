Continuous monitoring is necessary as brexanolone can cause excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness. Because of this, brexanolone is only available through the restricted distribution program. During infusion, patients need continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry and must be accompanied at all times by staff or family members while interacting with their children.

If patients experience hypoxia, infusion needs to be stopped immediately and should not be resumed. The FDA has cautioned providers to monitor patients every 2 hours for sedative effects during non-sleep periods. In the case of excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness, dose interruption is recommended. Patients regain consciousness within 15 to 60 minutes of dose interruption.

Patients are prohibited from driving or operating machinery until the sedative effects of the drug have entirely resolved.

Patients require close monitoring for worsening depression and suicidal thoughts or behaviors. In such cases, it is recommended to change the dosing regimen or discontinue brexanolone altogether. Concomitant use with central nervous system(CNS) depressants such benzodiazepines, alcohol, opioids, and antidepressants also requires close monitoring and/or avoidance of these agents.
