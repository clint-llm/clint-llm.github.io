Second-generation antipsychotics such as risperidone, ziprasidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole are all potent antagonists of dopamine D2 receptors, while clozapine and quetiapine are weak D2 antagonists. These antipsychotics also have additional properties such as 5-HT2A antagonism and 5-HT1A agonism. Atypical antipsychotics also have antidepressant properties in combination with other antidepressants and when administered alone. Mechanisms linked to antidepressant actions include serotonin and/or norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Quetiapine and ziprasidone have weak binding at these sites. Alpha2 antagonism is the mechanism with quetiapine, clozapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole with variable degrees of potency.

Atypical antipsychotics with D2 antagonism and partial agonism combined with 5HT2A antagonism have greater efficacy for mania, and these include aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and asenapine. Antipsychotics also have histamine, muscarinic (cholinergic), and alpha-adrenergic antagonism. Almost all atypical antipsychotics bind to alpha-adrenergic receptors, but the most potent are clozapine, risperidone, iloperidone, and clozapine. Quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine have high anticholinergic properties, whereas other atypical antipsychotics very weakly bind to muscarinic cholinergic receptors.
