Diseases that produce leukocoria

Retinoblastoma can present in a younger child below one year; Coats disease is not as common in this age group and generally presents after 2 or 3 years. The large vessels in retinoblastoma go subretinally within the tumor, whereas in Coats disease, the telangiectatic vessels are always noted in the retinal surface. Bilaterality is common in retinoblastoma but very rare in Coats disease. Retinoblastoma often has a family history, but family history is usually not present in Coats disease. Retinoblastoma presents with leukocoria, and Coats disease has xanthocoria. On USG, retinoblastoma presents as a solid mass and calcification with shadowing. This feature is absent in Coats. The calcification in retinoblastoma is randomly distributed. Calcification in Coats is rare but, if present, is curvilinearly distributed along the retinal pigment epithelium.

FEVR and Noorie disease can be differentiated based on bilaterality, a positive family history, and the presence of retinal dragging, all of which are rare in Coats disease. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is seen in preterm low birth-weight babies. Proliferative retinopathy due to chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and pars planitis is another differential.

The classical finding in Coats is dilated telangiectatic vessels, aneurysms, hard exudates, peripheral avascularity, and exudative retinal detachment.

Sometimes a mass forms which might simulate

- Melanoma,

- Papillary or retinal capillary hemangioblastoma,

- Choroidal granuloma (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis), and

- Vasoproliferative tumor.

Other differential diagnoses of diseases with extensive hard exudates include

- Branch retinal venous occlusion,

- Vasoproliferative tumor,

- Capillary hemangioma,

- Chronic retinal detachment,

- Trauma, and

- Inflammation.

A Coats-like response (retinal telangiectasia, aneurysm, and hard exudates) may also be noted in

- Retinitis pigmentosa

- Healed choroiditis

- Tubercular subretinal abscess

- Retinal vasculitis,

- Pars planitis

- Leber Congenital amaurosis

- Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and deafness,

- Progressive facial hemiatrophy or Parry-Romberg syndrome or progressive hemifacial atrophy or hemifacial atrophy

- Isolated hemihyperplasia

- Tuberous sclerosis

- Alport's syndrome

- X-linked retinoschisis and regressed retinopathy of prematurity

- 'Blood-filled senile retinoschisis'

- Linear Scleroderma

- En coup de sabre scleroderma

- Epidermal nevus syndrome

As described by Gass and Blodi, type I macular telangiectasia is characterized by nonfamilial and usually unilateral disease with retinal telangiectasia and hard exudates.
