Clandestine production of GHB contributes to its abuse. GHB is easily manufactured and available on the street as a powder or more often, a clear, odorless liquid sold in mini shampoo bottles. It has a salty or soapy taste, but only a small capfulÂ is needed for the immediate euphoric high that users seek. Alcohol or other coingestants may mask the taste. Strength and purity vary widely, which makes it difficult to determine the toxic dose that a user ingests accurately. Furthermore, misinformation on the internet downplays the potentially lethal effects of GHB toxicity and boosts its popularity as a bodybuilding or club drug.
