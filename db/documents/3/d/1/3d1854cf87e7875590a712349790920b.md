Patient education regarding oligohydramnios should focus on the importance of receiving routine prenatal care throughout the course of pregnancy. Regular prenatal care allows the health care team to recognize and diagnose gestational complications, such as oligohydramnios. The clinical care team can then formulate an appropriate follow-up plan to minimize the risk of both the fetal and maternal complications associated with oligohydramnios.
