The intrinsic and extrinsic musculature of the tongue is controlled by the 12th cranial nerve, the hypoglossal nerve, except for the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the 10th cranial nerve, the vagus nerve.

The hypoglossal nerve travels superficially to the hyoglossus muscle. Damage to the hypoglossal nerve results in ipsilateral deviation of the tongue, i.e., damage to the left hypoglossal nerve will cause deviation of the tongue to the left side.

Taste sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is supplied via the chorda tympani branch of the facial (VII) nerve and the glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve to the posterior one-third; the glossopharyngeal nerve also supplies somatic sensation to the posterior one-third of the tongue. The lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal (V) nerve, supplies somatic sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.
