Hemangiomas are speculated to develop through a combination of angiogenesis (the growth of new vessels from established vessels) and vasculogenesis (the novel formation of vessels from stem, or progenitor, cells). Three characteristic stages of growth have been noted: (1) endothelial cell proliferation, (2) rapid growth, and (3) spontaneous involution. Growth begins after progenitor cells, possibly originating from the placenta, move through the circulation and implant on distant regions of the body.

During the proliferative phase, endothelial cells rapidly multiply, stimulated by factors such as VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Estradiol-17 beta-receptors are also uniquely present in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells during this first phase, although their role in proliferation is not completely understood. During the rapid growth phase, the number of endothelial cells stabilizes, and the cells themselves will enlarge, leading to an overall increase in structure size.

Lastly, spontaneous involution occurs when the vessels decline in number, and endothelial cells are replaced by fat, fibroblasts, and connective tissue. The inciting event for involution is unclear but may involve the Notch pathway, which includes transmembrane Notch receptors and its ligands (delta and jagged).
