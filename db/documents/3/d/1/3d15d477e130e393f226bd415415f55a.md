Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have traditionally been considered superior to histamine receptor-2 (H2) blockers to prevent stress ulceration in critically ill patients at risk. Recent studies have raised the concern of increased mortality in patients who receive PPIs for stress-ulcer prophylaxis. Large trials directly comparing the agents for stress ulcer prophylaxis are lacking, and further studies are needed to determine whether PPIs are harmful.
