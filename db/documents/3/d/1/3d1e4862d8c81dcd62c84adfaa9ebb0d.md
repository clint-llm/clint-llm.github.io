Usually, the curative treatment of acute appendicitis is appendectomy. Perioperative antibiotic treatment should provide coverage for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (usually with a second-generation cephalosporin) and coverage for anaerobes (clindamycin or metronidazole). Delaying surgical intervention for more than 24 hours after the symptoms first appear increases the risk of perforation.

If an appendiceal perforation is present, the management will depend on the nature of the perforation. A free perforation that causes the dissemination of pus and fecal material into the peritoneal cavity will likely result in a very ill-looking and septic patient with an increased risk of preterm labor and delivery and fetal loss. These patients require urgent laparotomy for appendectomy with irrigation and drainage of the peritoneal cavity.

Nonpregnant patients that present with a long duration of symptoms (more than five days) and have findings of a contained perforation (phlegmon or abscess) are usually treated initially with antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and bowel rest. Since the appendiceal process has already been walled-off, most patients will present a good clinical response to nonoperative management. Immediate surgery in these patients correlates with increased morbidity because of the presence of adhesions and inflammation that requires extensive dissection that may lead to injury of adjacent structures. There may be the development of serious postoperative complications such as abscesses or enterocutaneous fistulae, requiring reoperation for more extensive resections, and the need for colostomies. Therefore, in these patients, a nonoperative approach is a reasonable option as long as they are not ill-appearing. Although there is solid evidence to support this approach to contained perforation in nonpregnant individuals, the evidence regarding pregnant women is sparse.

The two mainstream approaches for appendectomy are laparoscopic and open techniques. No randomized trials have been performed to suggest that one technique is better than another; therefore, the choice of technique should have its basis on the patient's clinical status and preferences, gestational age, and the surgeon's experience level. However, current guidelines state that laparoscopic appendectomy is the standard of care in pregnant patients as it is safe, allows easier identification of the variable location of the appendix, and offers an opportunity for an evaluation of the abdomen for any associated pathologic process.

Some of the recommendations for the laparoscopic technique are modifications that include a slight left lateral positioning of the patient (during the second half of pregnancy), the use of an open-access approach (Hasson technique) for initial trocar placement to avoid injury to the gravid uterus, limiting intraabdominal insufflation pressure to less than 12 mmHg, and adjustment of port position for fundal height.

When performing an open appendectomy technique in a pregnant woman, a transverse incision is made at the point of maximal tenderness and not necessarily at McBurney point.
