Ocular toxocariasis is a childhood disorder resulting from the ingestion of Toxocara ova. The patient may present with peripheral granuloma, posterior granuloma, or endophthalmitis. It is a serious ocular condition causing permanent vision loss, and it is an important differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma. It must be promptly diagnosed and treated after excluding other differential diagnoses to avoid the high morbidity associated with ocular toxocariasis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ocular toxocariasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**

- Summarize the typical presentation/examination findings of a patient with ocular toxocariasis.
- Explain the appropriate treatment of ocular toxocariasis.
- Describe the common complications, differential diagnoses, and role of interprofessional approach for patients with ocular toxocariasis.
