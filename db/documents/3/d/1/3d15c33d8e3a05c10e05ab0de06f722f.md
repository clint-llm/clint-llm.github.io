The final diagnosis is made as follows:

Documenting the visual acuity with Snellen's chart and pinhole acuity. For example

- Uncorrected distant visual acuity (UDCVA) or visual acuity without correction – 20/40

- Best-corrected distant visual acuity (BCVA) or corrected distant visual acuity (CDVA)- 20/20

- Spherical correction- -2D sphere

- Cylindrical correction- -1D cylinder

The prescription is written as follows:

OD-  -2 D/ -1D x 60 – 20/20

OS-  -2 D/ -1D x 150 – 20/20
