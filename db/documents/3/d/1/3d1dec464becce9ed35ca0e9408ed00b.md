Patterns of necrosis (liquefactive or coagulative) are determined by the cause of cell death, organ affected, and duration of cell death.

Liquefactive necrosis is a pattern of cell death caused by several etiological factors.

**The major causes of liquefactive necrosis are:**

**In all solid organs of the body:**

- Infectious agents (bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites**)**

**In the brain**

- Infectious agents

- Hypoxia/Ischemia (the occurrence of liquefaction as a pattern of necrosis in response to hypoxic injury in the brain is an exception to observed findings in the rest of the body. Tissues in all other mammalian body systems usually undergo cell death by coagulative necrosis in response to hypoxia. The reason for this difference is poorly understood).
