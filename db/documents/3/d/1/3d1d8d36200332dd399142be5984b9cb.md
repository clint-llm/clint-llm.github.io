Rare cases presenting with spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage and hypotension have been reported in the literature. In a case series of 67 patients with renal vein leiomyosarcoma (LMS), 50% of the patients experienced disease progression despite treatment. Metastasis to distant body sites (liver, lungs, bones, soft tissue) occurred in 30% of patients. The rate of local recurrence was 4.5%, while 15% of the patients experienced combined local recurrence and distant metastasis.
