The initial management of lactational mastitis is symptomatic treatment.

If the symptoms of lactational mastitis persist beyond 12Â to 24 hours, antibiotics should be administered.S. aureus is the most common cause, antibiotic therapy should be tailored accordingly. In the setting of mild infection without MRSA risk factors, outpatient treatment can be initiated with dicloxacillin or cephalexin. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, erythromycin can be used. If the patient has risk factors for MRSA infection, treatment options include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or clindamycin. TMP-SMX should be avoided in women who are breastfeeding infants less than 1-month-old, and in infants who are jaundiced or premature. If a patient requires hospitalization, empiric treatment with vancomycin should be initiated until cultures and sensitivities return. There are not sufficient studies on the appropriate duration of outpatient treatment, but most sources recommend a 10-14 day course.

Periductal mastitis is treated empirically with amoxicillin-clavulanate. Alternative options include dicloxacillin plus metronidazole or cephalexin plus metronidazole. If an abscess is present, ultrasound-guided needle aspiration plus antibiotic therapy is the preferred management strategy.

The treatment of IGM remains controversial. Current treatment strategies vary broadly and can include observation, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antibiotics, and surgery.
