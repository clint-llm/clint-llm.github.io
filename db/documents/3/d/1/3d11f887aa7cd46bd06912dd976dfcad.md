Cafe-au-lait macules represent a localized area of melanin formation. The exact etiology of CALMs is not known except when associated with genetic syndromes. CALMs are associated with several genetic syndromes like neurofibromatosis (NF1, NF2),Â McCune-Albright Syndrome, ring chromosome syndromes, constitutional mismatch repair deficiency, tuberous sclerosis, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, and Silver-Russell syndrome.

CALMs may also serve as a marker for RASopathies (disorders related to RAS mutations). CALMs associated with RASopathies are Legius syndrome, Watson syndrome, and Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome).

The etiology of different conditions associated with CALMs include:

- NF1: Due to mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17

- NF2: Due to mutations in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 22

- McCune-Albright Syndrome: Due to a mutation in the GNAS gene

- Legius syndrome: Due to a mutation in the SPRED-1 gene
