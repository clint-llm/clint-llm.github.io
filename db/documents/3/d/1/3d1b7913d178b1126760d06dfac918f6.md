Soft tissue radionecrosis refers to the delayed effects of radiation therapy which result in tissue breakdown from the impaired blood supply radiation damaged tissue. Radiation can damage capillary beds and arterioles which lead to relative tissue hypoxia resulting in the characteristic fibrosis, and these tissue changes can develop over time, remote from the time of the original radiation exposure. The soft tissue radionecrosis can develop 6 months to several years after the exposure. Capillaries can regrow by the process of angiogenesis, but in the hypoxic radiation-damaged tissue, the new capillaries tend to grow disorganized resulting in telangiectasias. This activity reviews the evaluation of soft tissue radionecrosis and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the evaluation of a patient with
soft tissue radionecrosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of radiation induced soft tissue necrosis.
- Outline the management of
soft tissue radionecrosis.
- Summarize the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by soft tissue radionecrosis.
