All patients should be educated well and encouraged to practice good sleep hygiene. "Sleep hygiene" is a term used to describe good sleep habits.

The following advice should be given to the patients to practice good sleep hygiene:

- Maintain a regular schedule, i.e., go to bed and wake up at the same time every day

- Use the bed for sleep and sex only. Avoid watching television, looking at phones, or reading in the bed

- Exercise almost every day, but not right before bedtime

- Avoid caffeine or smoking, mainly during the evening

- Maintain a dark, calm, and quiet environment in the bedroom

- Avoid struggling to fall asleep in bed. If you can't sleep, get up and try again later or change the bed.

Also, if the patient takes sedative-hypnotic medications, this should be documented in the medical record. Patients should be counseled to avoid driving and operating machines when under these medications.
