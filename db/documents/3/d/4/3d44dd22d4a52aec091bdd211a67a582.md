The prognosis of central vertigo depends on the underlying cause. The most common is acute lateral medullary syndrome due to occlusion of the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Patients often recover relatively good functional outcome with appropriate therapy. On the other hand, basilar thrombosis will carry a much worse prognosis with much higher mortality. Brainstem involvement as a presentation of acute demyelination as in multiple sclerosis does make the prognosis worse compared with other patients without brainstem relapse. The acute relapse does tend to remit commonly after a course of IV steroid, yet the long term prognosis will depend on other factors including the age, gender, frequency, and severity of relapses.
