While the neurosurgeon is almost always involved in patient care with a contrecoup injury, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a trauma surgeon and a critical care specialist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs, neurological status, intracranial pressure and assist with the education of the patient and family. The pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, sedatives, and appropriate antibiotics. The radiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause and mechanism of the injury.

Since contrecoup injury is only one type of traumatic brain injury, it is difficult to make specific recommendations for its treatment. The patient must have a treatment plan to include multiple types of associated traumatic brain injuries such as subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral edema, DAI, and coup and contrecoup brain injury. Any other body traumatic injuries have to be treated simultaneously.
