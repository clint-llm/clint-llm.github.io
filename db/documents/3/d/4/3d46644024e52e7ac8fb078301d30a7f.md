Identifying which patients may develop this as a complication of their underlying disease process is paramount. Early recognition of hypercapnia can help prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition into CO2 narcosis. Prodromal symptoms to recognize before CO2 narcosis develops can include increased confusion and increased work of breathing. After identification, treatment should be sought immediately. A modifiable risk factor is tobacco abuse. Encourage patients to stop abusing tobacco and provide information regarding nicotine replacement therapy and other cessation treatment.
