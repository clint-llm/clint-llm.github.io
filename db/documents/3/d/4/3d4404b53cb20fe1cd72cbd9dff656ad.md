The cerebral cortex gives rise to the corticospinal tract, specifically, the pyramidal cells from layer V in the rostral and frontal parts of the cerebral cortex. Corticospinal projections arise from both the motor and the somatosensory cortices. Despite its importance, the corticospinal tract develops slowly and rather late. The tract reaches the level of pyramidal decussation at about eight weeks after fertilization and subsequent development is slow. Â Myelination of its axons can take up to two to three years. Due to this lengthy development, malformations can occur after birth. The genetic factors involved in tract development are complicated, and much of this process is yet to be known.
