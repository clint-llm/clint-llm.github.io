The greatest risk to pregnant women is exposure to urine or saliva of young children. Preventive steps that can reduce primary infection in pregnancy include education of pregnant women to increase awareness of CMV. Specific strategies that can be employed to decrease transmission include thorough hand washing after handling potentially infected articles, e.g., soiled diapers and toys, and limited intimate contact with children less than 6 years of age (such as kissing on the mouth or cheek, bed sharing, and wiping drool). Pregnant women should be counseled not to share utensils with their children or put a childâ€™s pacifier in their mouth.
