It is important to differentiate THI and CVID especially in children younger than 6 years of age because patients with CVID have defective vaccine responses whereas patients with THI produce an adequate response to vaccines and infections. Early recognition of the condition can avoid prolonged delays between symptom onset and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Prognosis depends on the clinical manifestation of the disease.

Comorbid mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, and somatization were also associated with pediatric-onset CVIDÂ and need to be identified and treated.

Management of immunodeficiencies is complex and needs a multidisciplinary approach involving the immunologist, allergist, infectious disease specialist, pediatrician, pharmacist, and a primary care physician for identification, monitoring, and timely intervention.

Educating the parents about the possible causes, identifying warning signs, evaluating family members with frequent infections, genetic counseling, and compliance with the treatment plan play a crucial role in the management of hypogammaglobulinemias.
