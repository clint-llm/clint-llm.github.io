The esophagus is a muscular conduit, approximately 25 cm long, extending from the lower end of cricoid to the stomach. In the neck, the esophagus originates at the level of the sixth cervical vertebral body. The esophagus then descends anterior to the vertebral column through the superior and posterior mediastinum. It terminates at the cardia, corresponding to the level of 11th-12th thoracic vertebrae. The esophagus has four layers: the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and adventitia. The muscularis propria is critical to esophageal structure and function. It is composed of two layers of muscle fibers: The inner (or circular) layer and the outer (or longitudinal) layer.

The esophagus is divided into three main anatomical regions: cervical, thoracic, and intra-abdominal esophagus. The corresponding arterial supplies of the esophagus are as follows: inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, supplies the cervical esophagus; branches of the thoracic aorta and bronchial arteries supply the thoracic portion, and the left gastric/inferior phrenic arteries supply the the abdominal esophagus. In terms of venous drainage, the inferior thyroid vein drains the cervical esophagus; the azygous, hemizygous and bronchial veins drain the thoracic esophagus; and the coronary veins drain the abdominal esophagus.

The upper one-third of the esophagus is under voluntary control whereas the mid- and distal thirds are under involuntary control. Because of other nearby anatomic structures, these three distinct esophageal regions tend to have different injury patterns, mechanisms, and presentations. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches vary based on the anatomic region involved. Esophageal injuries are graded based on the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) classification, as follows:

- Grade I - Contusion/hematoma, partial thickness tear

- Grade II - Laceration less than 50%

- Grade III - Laceration greater than 50%

- Grade IV - Less than 2cm disruption of tissue or vasculature

- Grade V - Greater than 2cm disruption of tissue or vasculature

Injuries can occur along the entire course of the esophagus. The preferred approach to abdominal perforations is a surgical repair. For many thoracic and cervical perforations, non-operative primary management is acceptable, with surgery being the second-line therapeutic option. The approach was chosen often depends on the patient's clinical presentation and the presence (or absence) of associated injuries to nearby anatomic structures. The cervical esophagus is surrounded by the trachea anteriorly, the spine posteriorly, and the carotid sheath on both sides. Morbidity and mortality of penetrating trauma to the cervical esophagus are closely related to associated injuries to nearby vital structures. In the normal esophagus, the greatest at-risk location for iatrogenic instrumentation injury is the cervical esophagus around the region bounded by the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and the cricopharyngeus muscle. Cervical esophageal injuries are the most common overall and carry the lowest mortality due to significant advances in both operative and non-operative management. Thoracic esophageal injuries occur less commonly but are associated with the highest morbidity and mortality, primarily because of the proximity of the thoracic esophagus to other vital structures and the risk of severe mediastinal sepsis. The abdominal esophagus is the least commonly injured, with intermediate morbidity and mortality. The lack of the serosal layer, combined with a relatively poor blood supply, combine to increase the overall risk of subsequent complications following injury.
