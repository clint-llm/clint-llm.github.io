Postoperative pulmonary complications require extraordinary attention from the entire medical community, as they are a direct cause of morbidity and mortality. The incentive spirometer can be easily used in pulmonary rehabilitation as a tool in inspiratory muscle training to reduce or prevent postoperative pulmonary complications and exercise the lungs. The role of the interprofessional team is critical in evaluating, treating, and managing the care of patients who are indicated to receive pulmonary rehabilitation.

Any medical professional providing bedside care to a patient at risk for pulmonary complications should be educated in inspiratory muscle training and verify that the patient is proficient in using an incentive spirometer. To derive good outcomes, the goals and objective of using the incentive spirometer must be defined for the patient's compliance to be at the optimal level. An incentive spirometer regimen should include ten workouts per day, used correctly (i.e., inspire up to 500 ml ten times per workout).

Other postoperative interventions to prevent lung complications include but are not limited to oral care, elevating the head of the bed at least 30 degrees, dangling legs the day of surgery if indicated, transferring multiple times per day when cleared by the surgeon, ambulation, and sitting up for meals.

To improve outcomes in the postoperative setting, the role of the nurse and therapist is critical. The nurses will assist the team by monitoring the patient to ensure pain is adequately controlled and communicate with the clinician as needed if any common postoperative complications such as atelectasis are suspected. The therapist can assist by preventing prolonged immobilization and encouraging transfers and mobility training when indicated.

Further emphasizing the need for an interprofessional approach to the prevention of pulmonary complications includes the need for meticulous planning and discussion with other professionals involved in managing the patient. Quick and efficient patient training on an incentive spirometer may prevent morbidity, prevent future hospitalizations, and improve outcomes.
