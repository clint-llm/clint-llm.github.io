Risk factors for ICVT include etiologies leading to hypercoagulable states. Protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, G20210 prothrombin gene variant, and factor V Leiden thrombophilia all lead to a hypercoagulable state. Elevated homocysteine levels, factor VIII, and fibrinogen can also increase prothrombotic states.

Acquired hypercoagulable conditions include malignancy, oral contraception, oncology medications (tamoxifen, thalidomide, and bevacizumab), pregnancy, estrogen supplementation, hormone replacement therapy, antiphospholipid syndrome, previous history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and myeloproliferative disorders such as essential thrombocytosis or polycythemia vera.

Recent studies suggest that infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to increase the relative risk of cortical venous thrombosis by inducing a hypercoagulable state. Associated hypoxemia with SARS-CoV2 infection increases blood viscosity by activating hypoxia-related genes that initiate coagulation and fibrinolysis, increasing the risk of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
