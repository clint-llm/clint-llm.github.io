Microdontia is typically treated for cosmetic purposes or to aid in function. Patients with abnormally small teeth will typically present with diastemas (gaps) between adjacent teeth. These gaps may be best addressed by orthodontic interventions.

Macrodontia is a dental anomaly that likely requires an interdisciplinary approach to treatment. The determination should be made whether or not the macrodont can and be maintained in the dental arch due to their abnormally robust size or altered dental anatomy.

Taurodont teeth present a challenge to almost every dental specialty. Due to the large pulp chamber and subsequent large pulp horns, the risk of pulp exposure due to decay is increased.Â Taurodont teeth have a wide variety of shapes and sizes of the pulp chambers, resulting in the potential for apically positioned canal orifices and accessory root canal systems, complicating endodontic therapy.

From a prosthodontic perspective, post-placement is extremely difficult and, in most cases, contraindicated due to the unpredictability of the pulp chamber and the inability to achieve an intimate fit of the post with the surrounding tooth structure.

Teeth that exhibit fusion are prone to restorative, periodontal, endodontic, and surgical complications. Patients should be counseled on maintaining optimal oral hygiene and care for these teeth to prevent further complications.
