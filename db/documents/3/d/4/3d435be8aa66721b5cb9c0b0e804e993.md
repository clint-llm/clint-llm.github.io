Alaskan Natives and American Indians constitute both a diverse and heterogeneous community. Based on the 2010 consensus, this population represents over 560 federally recognized tribes and compromises over 2.9 million people.

One of the shortcomings of many of these statements is examining Alaskan Natives and American Indians as an entire population. In reality, Alaskan Natives and American Indians exhibit many differences within their population, with many tribes having distinct languages, cultures, and customs.Â These differences also include vastly different alcohol and substance abuse levels, which vary by geographic location and tribe.
