**Indications**

Radiation is important for palliation of symptoms, especially in spinal involvement, as it may alleviate pain. Sometimes it may relieve hydrocephalus and associated symptoms and facilitate the administration of IT chemotherapy. However, a retrospective study has failed to show any survival benefit. Eradication of tumor craniospinal radiation is required, which carries very high systemic and CNS toxicities and risks myelosuppression and other complications. Given the poor prognosis, it is considered technically impractical.

**Dosage**

Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is usually given at a dose of 30 to 40 grays (Gy) in 2 to 3 Gy fractions. Focal radiotherapy is done for spinal lesions.

**Adverse effects**

Cognitive impairment, somnolence, and late leukoencephalopathy when combined with IV or IT chemotherapy.
