Besides solitary lesions, sometimes an individual can display multiple enchondromas; the condition is called enchondromatosis. One such syndrome is Ollier disease.

Another condition presenting with multiple enchondromas is Maffucci syndrome. In this syndrome, the enchondromas are associatedÂ with multiple soft tissue hemangiomas and lymphangiomas. Maffucci syndrome is very rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the English literature.
