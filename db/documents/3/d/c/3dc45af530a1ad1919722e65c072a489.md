Awareness of the possible complications and drug influence in this condition is a key concept in diagnosing and treating lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Improving care coordination among interprofessional team members is crucial to improve outcomes for patients affected by lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs) will direct the overall treatment and management of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, but it requires the efforts of an interprofessional team that also includes specialists, nursing staff, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists to successfully manage the case. Open communication among all team members is crucial to success, and all professionals involved in care must document every intervention or interaction with the patient so that everyone on the team has access to the same accurate, updated patient data. The interprofessional model will yield optimal patient results with the fewest complications. [Level 5]
