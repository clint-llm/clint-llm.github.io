Blood supply and lymphatic drainage of the head and neck is a very complex picture. Lymph node clusters primarily involved in the drainage of structures integral to swallowing are as follows.

The submental group of nodes primarily drain the floor of the oral cavity and the anterior part of the tongue. The submandibular group drains both the hard and soft palates, the mucosa of both cheeks, and contributes to drainage of the mouth and anterior tongue. The upper jugular cluster of nodes drains the parotid gland and receives secondary drainage from the submental and submandibular node clusters, as well as the pharynx and larynx. The middle jugular cluster of nodes directly drains the base of the tongue, hypopharynx, as well as receiving drainage from the upper jugular cluster. The lower jugular group of nodes primarily drains efferent lymphatics from the upper and middle jugular nodes as well as drainage from the hypopharynx. The medial supraclavicular cluster of nodes receives drainage from the lower jugular nodes, as well as the hypopharynx and esophagus. The posterior triangle group of nodes drains the nasopharynx and oropharynx. The anterior compartment of nodes drains the anterior floor of the mouth, the anterior-most part of the tongue, hypopharynx, and cervical esophagus. The retropharyngeal nodes drain the nasopharynx and the soft palate, while the retrostyloid nodes drain just efferent lymph via the nasopharynx.

Blood supply to structures found in the head and neck that are integral to human swallowing can be summarized as follows. The tongue receives its blood supply via the lingual artery, which is a branch of the external carotid. The hard palate receives much of its blood supply via the superior alveolar artery as well as contributions from the greater palatine artery, while the soft palate is maintained by branches of the ascending palatine artery, which is a terminal branch of the maxillary artery.

Pharyngeal muscles primarily receive their blood supply via the external carotid artery, with the ascending pharyngeal artery branch being of utmost importance. Pharyngeal constrictor muscles receive blood via the inferior thyroid artery and the tonsillar branch of the facial artery, while the salpingopharyngeus and palatopharyngeus muscles receive vascular supply from a branch of the facial artery and maxillary artery.

The vascular supply of the esophagus divides segmentally. The inferior thyroid artery supplies the cervical esophagus. The proximal thoracic esophagus is supplied by branches of the bronchial arteries, while the distal thoracic esophagus receives its blood supply via branches directly stemming from the aorta.
