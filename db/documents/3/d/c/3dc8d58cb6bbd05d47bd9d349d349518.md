Ocular toxocariasis is suspected if a child presents with unilateral loss of vision or squint. Definitive diagnosis is made by the demonstration of Toxocara larva in the histological sections of the affected tissue.

USG shows a hyperreflective retinal mass located in the posterior pole or periphery. Often, vitreous membranes are noted to be adherent to the mass with or without calcification.

Immunological tests can be done for the diagnosis of toxocariasis. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which employs antigens of the second-stage larva (usually excretory/secretory antigens), is the best indirect test for diagnosing the infection. It is a qualitative immunoenzymatic determination of antibodies against the Toxocara. ELISA may show cross-reactivity with Ascaris lumbricoides which can be minimized by using excretory/secretory antigens for the assay. ELISA has a high degree of sensitivity (78%) and specificity (92%) at a titer of more than 1:32.Toxocara infection. A significant rise in antibody level over time confirms active infection.

Complete blood count may show eosinophilia.

Serum total immunoglobulin-E (IgE) level may be markedly raised in patients with toxocariasis, though the titer may be lower in ocular toxocariasis due to reduced worm burden.
