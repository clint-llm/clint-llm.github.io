The diagnosis and management of SD are very difficult and best done with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, infectious disease expert, pharmacist, primary care provider, and a nurse practitioner. SD is not a benign disorder and the symptoms may last for more than 2 years in some patients. In addition, despite treatment, recurrences are common. In general, when SD is present, the patient should be referred to a cardiologist to rule out valvular heart disease.

Prevention of the SD by aggressively treating Group A B-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection and reducing the likelihood of rheumatic heart disease is effective. Once SD is diagnosed, secondary antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated to decrease the risk of neurologic and cardiac problems with future streptococcal infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends secondary prophylaxis up to the age of 21 years.

The prognosis of patients with SD is guarded. During the acute phase, the symptoms are disabling and the quality of life is poor.
