Broca area is a region in the inferior frontal lobe of the dominant hemisphere of the brain made up of Brodmann area 44 and 45. Language function lateralized to the left hemisphere in 96% to 99% of right-handed people and 60% of left-handed people. Various pathways connect Broca area to the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and contralateral hemisphere.

As a result of a lesion in Broca area, there is a breakdown between one's thoughts and one's language abilities. Thus, patients often feel that they know what they wish to say but are unable to produce the words. That is, they are unable to translate their mental images and representations to words. This affects the normal fluency of speech. The loss of language function may be because Broca area serves a role in ordering sounds into words, and words into sentences, and thus creates relationships between linguistic elements.
