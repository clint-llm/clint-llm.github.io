There is no known toxicity or side effects associated with vitamin K1. Vitamin K1 is a naturally occurring, fat-soluble form of vitamin K. Before the introduction of vitamin K1, vitamin K3 was used. Vitamin K3 is a synthetic, water-soluble derivative of menadione. In higher doses, it has been associated with kernicterus, hemolytic anemia, and hyperbilirubinemias.

Vitamin K was earlier thought to be associated with an increased risk of childhood cancers. However, studies have shown no such association.

Due to having a safe profile, vitamin K1 is widely accepted as routine prophylaxis in most countries.
