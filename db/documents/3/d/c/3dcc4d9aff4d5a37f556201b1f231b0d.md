Palpitations are defined as rapid pulsations or abnormally rapid or irregular beating of the heart. They are often described as the perception of a skipped beat, rapid fluttering in the chest, pounding sensation in the chest or neck, or a flip-flopping in the chest. Palpitations are common, nonspecific and can be a symptom or a diagnosis. While the cause of palpitations is usually benign, there are underlying life-threatening conditions that may present with palpitations. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of palpitations and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.
