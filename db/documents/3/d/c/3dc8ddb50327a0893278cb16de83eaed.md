Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia should be educated about a healthy lifestyle, quitting smoking, and taking measures to avoid being overweight. A healthy lifestyle should include reducing food and beverages with high cholesterol, trans fat content, and saturated fat. Also, patients should consider foods resulting in a decrease in cholesterol, such as plant stanols and sterols.

Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia should also receive education regarding their risk of CV disease. Patients should learn about controlling all modifiable risk factors for CV disease and treatment strategies for familial hypercholesterolemia once a diagnosis is made. All first-degree relatives of patients with FH should be counseled about the importance of screening.
