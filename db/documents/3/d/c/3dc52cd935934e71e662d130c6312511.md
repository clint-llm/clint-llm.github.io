Appetite and satiety are controlled through neuroendocrine feedback mechanisms.

- Gastrointestinal hormones like ghrelin stimulate appetite, whereas GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), Peptide YY, CCK (cholecystokinin), and vagal neural feedback inhibit appetite and promote satiety.

- Adipose tissue provides feedback on energy stores by adiponectin and leptin via satiety signals.

- These hormones provide feedback to the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus, which sends behavioral and autonomic outputs to the solitary tract nucleus in the brainstem, leading to gastrointestinal hormonal secretion.

- Neuropeptides in the brain, including peptide yy (PYY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), and orexin, stimulate appetite, whereas melanocortin and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormones promote satiety.

- Lack of sleepÂ has been shown to decrease circulating leptin levels and increase ghrelin levels, as well as self-reported hunger. Ghrelin is the "hunger hormone" that activates PYY and AgRP to stimulate appetite.

- The balance between appetite stimulation and adiposity is maintained by neuroendocrine interaction between the gut, adipose tissue, and brain. Mutations in genes involved in secreting these hormones have been of interest in epigenetic modifications and are potential therapeutic targets.
