Complications from NSCLC depend on the local extent of the disease process and the involvement of potential metastases of cancer. Intrathoracic complications can include malignant pleural effusion, which can lead to dyspnea or respiratory failure depending on the extent of the pathology and comorbid conditions. Non-small cell lung cancer is also the most common malignant cause of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and accounts for approximately 50 percent of all cases.
