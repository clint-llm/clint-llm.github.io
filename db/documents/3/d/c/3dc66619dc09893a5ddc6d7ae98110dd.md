There are several contraindications for IDDS therapy, and these can subdivide into absolute and relative exclusion criteria.  Absolute contraindications include systemic infection, known allergies to materials in the implant, active intravenous drug abuse, psychosis or dementia, and infection at the implantation site.  Relative contraindications include an atrophied patient (underweight BMI), ongoing anticoagulation that cannot be discontinued, active bleeding, high opioid tolerance, lack of social or family support, and lack of access to medical care.  Intrathecal pump placement is an elective procedure; thus one must assess all potential absolute and relative contraindications before proceeding.
