- Overall, the majority of patients suffering from paraphilic disorders rarely seek treatment voluntarily, as many individuals feel indignity, culpability, or discomfiture, while others focus on the difficulty and lack of desire to halt efforts of achieving intense sexual pleasure and ultimate satisfaction.

- Furthermore, the very nature of paraphilic disorders in many individuals leads to victimization and often legal repercussions. This will only further deter patients from seeking treatment. Those patients involved in treatment plans are often either mandated legally or convinced by family, friends, or sexual partners.

- Despite the medications used in managing paraphilic disorders discussed above, better preventative measures are deemed necessary to reduce victimization. Many of those with paraphilic disorders will only be evaluatedÂ following incarceration after the harm has been inflicted.

- Childhood sexual abuse is considered a leading cause of pedophilia, among other paraphilias and resultant paraphilic disorders. Maybe preventative measures should start here.

- Many psychiatrists and mental healthcare providers feel that the only cure for a pedophilic disorder is incarceration. As paraphilias and paraphilic disorders are deeply engrained thoughts and irresistible behaviors of the individual, whether viewed as right or wrong, it is currently deemed as merely impossible to fix.
