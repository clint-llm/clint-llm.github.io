Collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Collagen vascular disease-associated interstitial lung disease typically bears a better prognosis than idiopathicÂ interstitial lung disease and a slower progression than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Mortality is highest in those who develop pulmonary hypertension, have higher oxygen requirements, and require mechanical ventilation.
