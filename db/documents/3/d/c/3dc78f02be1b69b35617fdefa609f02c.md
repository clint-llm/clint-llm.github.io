Acromioclavicular joint injuries follow the Rockwood classification system of type I to type VI. Type I is referred to as a sprain of the acromioclavicular ligaments only and demonstrates no radiographic displacement. Type II involves tearing of the acromioclavicular ligament and sprain of the coracoclavicular ligament with less than 25% increase in the coracoclavicular interspace or with the clavicle elevated but not superior to the border of the acromion. Type I and II sprains are managed non-operatively with a sling, analgesia, ice, and physical therapy. Type III AC joint separation involves tearing of both the acromioclavicular ligament and coracoclavicular ligaments resulting in clavicle elevation above the border of the acromion with a 25 to 100% increased coracoclavicular distance on x-ray compared to the contralateral side. Type III injuries are frequently managed non-operatively similar to type I and II; however, if the displacement is greater than 75%; the patient is a laborer, elite athlete, or concerned about cosmesis; or is not improving with conservative management, then surgical intervention may be considered. Posterior displacement of the distal clavicle into the trapezius defines type IV injuries. Superior displacement of the distal clavicle by more than 100% compared to contralateral defines type V injuries. Type VI is rare and is defined as an inferolateral displacement in a subacromial or subcoracoid displacement behind the coracobrachialis or biceps tendon. Type IV through VI injuries are typically managed surgically, and warrants referral to an orthopedic surgeon.

**Management of Acute Acromioclavicular Joint Disruption**

If the AC joint injury presents within six weeks, it is considered acute. The main goal of treatment is acromioclavicular joint stabilization. Following techniques are used for stabilization and reduction of AC joint.

**Hook Plate**

In the setting of Rockwood type Types III and V injuries, a distal clavicle hook plate may be employed to restore the alignment of the acromioclavicular joint. The "hook" portion of the hook plate is placed inferior to the acromion, with superior plating on the clavicle. While this does provide excellent reduction of the joint, the plate must be removed in a subsequent surgery to prevent subacromial irritation, subacromial impingement, acromion osteolysis, and iatrogenic damage to the rotator cuff.

**Bosworth Screw**

All types of AC joint injuries can be treated with the Bosworth screw (CC screw fixation), which has outstanding results and is very cost-effective. Bosworth screw along with acromioclavicular (AC) and coracoclavicular (CC) ligament reconstruction provide excellent long-term outcomes. A 6.5mm screw is placed from the clavicle to the coracoid through a mini-open incision or percutaneously. Early screw removal (usually 8 weeks) is necessary to prevent fatigue failure and crew breakage.

**Tension Band Wiring**

Tucek et al. compared tension band wiring versus hook plate in 80 patients with type 5 AC joint disruption. Tension band wiring(TBW) provides comparable clinico-radiological results however hook plate allows an earlier range of motion and has a reduced rate of complications. TBW should be removed after 8 weeks to prevent wire malposition, migration, and breakage.

**EndoButton**

A suitable treatment option for acromioclavicular dislocation is coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction utilizing an endobutton, which has the benefits of solid fixation and an early functional range of motion.

**Management of Chronic Acromioclavicular Joint Disruption**

There are three main goals of treatment

- AC joint debridement

- Ligament reconstruction ( acromioclavicular/ coracoclavicular)

- Stable fixation

Following procedures are used for chronic AC joint disruptions.

**Modified Weaver-Dunn procedure**

An incision is made from the acromioclavicular joint the tip of the coracoid. After raising skin flaps, the acromioclavicular joint is debrided and a distal 1cm of the clavicle is excised. The coracoacromial ligament is transferred to the distal end of the clavicle along with a small piece of the acromion. The modification in the original procedure is done in the form of added fixation with a screw or plate.

**Mazzocca Technique**

The incision extends from the tip of the coracoid to 2 cm posterior to the AC joint. The distal 1 cm of the clavicle is excised after AC joint debridement. A semitendinosus autograft is prepared and looped around the coracoid. The anatomical reconstruction is done by making bony tunnels in the shaft of the clavicle at foot print of the conoid and trapezoid ligament.

**Neviaser Technique**

The coracoacromial ligament is mobilized from the coracoid along with a small bony piece from its attachment site. K-wires are used to anchor the ligament to the distal end of the clavicle.

**Rockwood Procedure**

The original procedure includes the transfer of coracoacromial ligament from the acromion to the distal end of the clavicle. The bony tunnels are made through the lateral end of the clavicle to anchor this CA ligament. Stable reduction is provided by a Bosworth screw to secure this ligament reconstruction.

**Docking Technique**

The coracoacromial ligament is transferred from the acromion into the distal end of the clavicle. The docking procedure involves tensioning the CA ligament into the distal clavicle's medullary canal by using 2 nonabsorbable sutures.

**Mumford Procedure**

This procedure is required for chronic type 1 & 2 AC joint disruptions in which ligaments are intact. The distal 2.5 cm of the clavicle is excised to reduce joint pain. The soft tissue and periosteum are pilcated over the lateral end of the clavicle.
