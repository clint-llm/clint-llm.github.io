Testing should be guided byÂ the presentation and may include:

- Observation without testing in asymptomatic low-risk patients

- Serum electrolytes, kidney function testing, urinalysis

- Serum CK

- Liver enzymes, coagulation studies

- Complete blood count

In severely symptomatic patients, target additional studies based on the presentation of hepatic failure, altered mental status, hypoxia or respiratory distress.
