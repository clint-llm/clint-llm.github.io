Hypopigmented macules are the most common presentation of skin lesions. Often, the skin lesions are benign, and successful repigmentation can be achieved with prompt treatment. The lesions, in some cases, affect patientsâ€™ psychological and social well being. Therefore, it is important to continue medical education about hypopigmented skin lesions among healthcare professionals to improve the quality of care for their patients. Things to note-

- Follow the right approach to diagnosis (complete history and physical examination).

- Interspeciality communication for achieving better outcomes.

- Always evaluate for non-cutaneous signs and symptoms along with cutaneous findings to rule out underlying systemic disorders.

- Empathize and address psychological problems like depression, stress, and anxiety.

- Reassure patients about the benign nature of lesions and possible repigmentation.

- Re-evaluate, if the lesions are progressive and are not improving with treatment and rule out any underlying systemic disorders or associated malignancy.

- Educate patients about the course of treatment (how long they should be on medication, chances of repigmentation, benefits, and adverse effects of medications, phototherapy).

- Advise patients to avoid direct sun exposure, and use sunscreen for better outcomes of the treatment.
