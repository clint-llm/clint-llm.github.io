The structure has links to a condition called area postrema syndrome (APS), defined as otherwise unexplained episodes of nausea, hiccups, and vomiting, usually intractable. When coupling this syndrome with the neuroinflammatory involvement of the area postrema, it is characteristic of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). The name APSÂ is only a recent appellation, but there have been many examples in the medical literature from the past. Although non-demyelinating lesions in the medulla or the upper cervical cord might also lead to APS, the syndrome has diagnostic and prognostic significance in relation to NMOSD. The involvement of the medulla with the diagnosis of APS may indicate a more severe disease course of NMOSD.
