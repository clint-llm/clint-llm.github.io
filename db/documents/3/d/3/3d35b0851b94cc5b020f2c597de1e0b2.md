Azithromycin is generally regarded as a safe antimicrobial agent, and only a few patients discontinue azithromycin due to adverse effects.

- Azithromycin, like other macrolides, can cause QTc prolongation and has been associated with torsades de pointes and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.

- Azithromycin is also rarely associated with hepatotoxicity, consisting mainly of hepatocellular injury within 1 to 3 weeks of medication use. Clinical features of hepatotoxicity include cholestatic jaundice and elevated transaminase concentrations.

- Like other macrolides, gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea and diarrhea are commonly reported for azithromycin. All macrolides exhibit dose-dependent activation of intestinal motilin receptors, which stimulate gastric motility. (Clinicians widely prescribe erythromycin for the treatment of gastroparesis due to this mechanism.)

- Life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions to azithromycin, such as anaphylaxis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), are extremely unusual.

- Macrolides also correlate with the development of Clostridioides difficile infection, but to a lesser degree than other common antimicrobial classes (e.g., clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins).
