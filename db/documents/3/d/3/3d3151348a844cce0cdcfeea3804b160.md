- Temporal bones require an immense amount of lateral force to fracture.

- Look for hemorrhagic or clear otorrhea, hemotympanum, hearing loss, vertigo, nystagmus, facial paralysis, and/or Battle’s sign.

- Fractures should be classified as either otic capsule sparing or violating, with violation being more likely to cause SNHL, perilymphatic fistula, facial nerve paralysis, and requiring surgery.

- High-resolution non-contrast CT with slice thickness less than or equal to 1.5 mm is the modality of choice.

- Look for associated intracranial and cervical pathology.

- Once stabilized, temporal bone fracture complications can be treated.

- Complications include facial nerve paralysis, CSF leak, hearing loss, vertigo.

- Hearing loss requires immediate characterization of conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss, with formal audiogram deferred to allow for resolution of hemotympanum or edema.

- Facial nerve paralysis workup should include an EnOG and EMG if paralysis is evolving, and surgical exploration if it is immediate.

- CSF fistulas usually resolve spontaneously but may require lumbar drainage or surgical repair if persistent.
