A phase 3 clinical trial in children in China documented the efficacy and safety of an oral recombinant H. pylori vaccine. This could be considered as a future option to reduce the incidence of H. pylori infection, especially in the developing countries. The vaccine offered protection against H. pylori infection up to 3 years; however, longer follow-up is needed in the vaccinated cohort along with a study to identify the timing for booster doses for long-term protection against H. pylori infection.
