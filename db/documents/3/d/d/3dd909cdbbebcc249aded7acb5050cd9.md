Acitretin must be withdrawn all at once in case of acute overdosage. Overdose symptoms are similar to acute hypervitaminosis A (headache and vertigo). In both mice and rats, the acute oral toxicity (LD50) of acitretin was only observed at greater than 4,000 mg per kg dose. In one case report of an overdose, a 32-year old adult male patient with Darier’s disease took 525 mg single dose. Later, he has vomited for several hours; however, he did not experience any other ill effects. One case of fulminant hepatic failure following an intentional overdose of 600 mg of acitretin was reported where the patient demonstrated a rapid recovery and did not require liver transplantation.
