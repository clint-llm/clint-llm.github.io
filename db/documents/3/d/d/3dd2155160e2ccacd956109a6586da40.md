The worldwide prevalence of cerebral aneurysms is approximately 3.2%, with a mean age of 50 and an overall 1:1 gender ratio. This ratio changes significantly after age 50, with an increasing female predominance approaching 2:1, thought to be due to decreased circulating estrogen causing a reduction in the collagen content of the vascular tissue. The rate of rupture causing SAH is about 10 per 100,000. This is higher in certain populations such as the Finnish and Japanese. However, this is not due to a higher prevalence of aneurysms in these populations. The overall mortality due to aneurysmal SAH is considered to be 0.4 to 0.6% of all-cause deaths, with an approximate 20% mortality and an additional 30 to 40% morbidity in patients with known rupture.
