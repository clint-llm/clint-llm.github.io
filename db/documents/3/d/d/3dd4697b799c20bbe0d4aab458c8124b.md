In addition to the clinical examination, other studies are necessary to diagnose, characterize, and appropriately stage the disease. In the case of the tongue, lesions are usually readily accessible and, therefore, amenable to incisional biopsy or punch biopsy under local anesthesia in a clinic setting. In the case of the base of the tongue lesions, if not accessible trans-orally, tissue diagnosis may be obtained during flexible laryngoscopy or under direct visualization with general anesthesia. In the case of patients with gross neck lymphadenopathy, ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is also an option.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck with intravenous contrast is also part of the diagnostic workup. This will provide information regarding tumor size, location, extension, and radiologic appearance of the draining neck lymph nodes. In the case of advanced disease at presentation, further imaging of the chest with a CT scan or whole-body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT is usually done to rule out distant metastatic spread of disease.
