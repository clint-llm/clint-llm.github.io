Chronic anemia is managed predominantly in outpatient settings. They need hospitalization if:

- Patient is symptomatic

- There is a significant drop in hemoglobin/HCT

- Transfusion is needed

- Extensive investigations are needed

If hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL or if a patent is symptomatic, transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) are indicated.

Transfusions should be performed with caution in patients with volume overload status like end-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis) and congestive heart failure (CHF).

Other treatments include treating underlying conditions as below.

- Iron deficiency anemia: Intravenous (IV) iron versus oral iron

- Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency with B12 and folic acid supplementation

- Treating underlying bone marrow disorders

- EPO injections in chronic kidney disease patients

- Synthroid in patients with hypothyroidism

- Avoiding any culprit medications

- Treatment of GI causes of blood loss (PPI for gastritis and PUD)

- Regulation of menstrual cycles in patients with menorrhagia

Admission if:

- The patient has acute bleeding with hypovolemia, tachycardia and altered mental status

- Presence of pancytopenia

- Non-compliant patients or those who require extensive workup
