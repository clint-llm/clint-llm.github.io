Viral encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain parenchyma caused by a virus. It is the most common type of encephalitis and often coexists with viral meningitis. Viruses invade the host outside the central nervous system (CNS) and then reach the spinal cord and brainÂ hematogenously or in a retrograde manner from nerve endings.

Viral encephalitis tends to be more common in younger people compared to elderly individuals. However, the environment also plays a critical role. Many cases of viral encephalitis go undetected because of the lack of tests and mild symptoms. In addition, studies show that many patients develop high levels of antibodies to viruses but show no symptoms.
