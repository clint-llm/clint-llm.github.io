Ramipril overdose can result in severe hypotension (due to vasodilation and effective hypovolemia).

A study conducted in 2006 to investigate the effects of ramipril overdose on blood pressure concluded that in most cases, a drop in blood pressure occurs within the first 4 to 4.5 hours after ingestion. Monitoring the patient for a minimum of 6 hours after taking the overdose is essential. If the blood pressure remains normal in the first 6 hours after exposure, the patient can be considered for discharge.
