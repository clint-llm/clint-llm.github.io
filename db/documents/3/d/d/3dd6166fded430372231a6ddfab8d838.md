The incidence of the SEA is 0.2 to 1.2 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions. Risk factors include diabetes, intravenous drug use, chronic renal failure, alcoholism, or immunosuppression. SEA is nine-time more common than IEA and also more likely to be acute.

Although not common, IEA is still the third most common focal pyogenic intracranial infection, after brain abscess and subdural empyema. It was historically a result of head and neck infections such as sinusitis, mastoiditis, and otitis; but nowadays is mostly a complication of neurosurgical procedures.
