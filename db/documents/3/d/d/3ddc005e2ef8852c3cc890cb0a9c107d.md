Soft-tissue radionecrosis of the brain generally occurs in the area of the brain where the tumor was radiated. The resulting brain tissue necrosis can occur as early as 6 months after the radiation treatment. The brain tissue necrosis is a delayed effect of radiation therapy and can occur several years after the radiation treatment, but it usually occurs within the first 1 to 2 years.
