High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE) is a severe and potentially fatal manifestation of high altitude illness and is often characterized by ataxia, fatigue, and altered mental status. HACE is often thought of as an extreme form/end-stage of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). Although HACE represents the least common form of altitude illness, it may progress rapidly to coma and death as a result of brain herniation within 24 hours, if not promptly diagnosed and treated. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist and an emergency department physician

Even with robust training regimens, acclimatization, and prophylactic medications, HACE can strike any individual at any altitude, at any time. Even those with considerable experience at altitude may fall prey to the wares of HACE. Thus careful attention to the signs and symptoms of AMS and HACE should always be given proper consideration and respect.
