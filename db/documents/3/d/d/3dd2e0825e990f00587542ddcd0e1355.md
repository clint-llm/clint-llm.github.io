Optimal stroke care requires coordination and communication between providers at all healthcare levels. This starts from the initial patient contact by EMS to stroke team assessment upon hospital arrival (including clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses), to initial imaging interpretation by radiology, and finally to acute surgical or endovascular intervention with inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation. Hospital transfer may also be involved in any step of the process. As effective treatment modalities require prompt recognition and implementation, it is critical that all levels of the stroke network are operating efficiently as a team. Patient outcomes are improved when each component recognizes and effectively communicates to contribute to the overall stroke care system.
