The laboratory workupÂ  of secondary thrombocytosis (reactive thrombocytosis) includes the following:

- Complete blood count shows an increased platelet count

- Peripheral Blood Smear

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP)

- Antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF)

- Iron studies (serum iron, serum ferritin)

If the clinical condition does not differentiate between primary and secondary thrombocytosis, further tests like genetic testing and a bone marrow biopsy may be indicated.
