Each facelift technique must be tailored to a patient’s individual needs. The extended SMAS technique is beneficial for patients who require midface rejuvenation along with the lower face and neck. The firm texture of the SMAS allows for less recurrence, less skin tension, and more stability of the facelift. This technique allows the SMAS to the carry tension applied to the face, while the skin overlies the flap without tension on the incisions. Excess skin that is brought up is then removed. By bringing this layer cephalad, the patient receives increased facial volume, enhanced malar prominence, and a smooth jawline that lead to a youthful appearance and hence increased patient and surgeon satisfaction.
