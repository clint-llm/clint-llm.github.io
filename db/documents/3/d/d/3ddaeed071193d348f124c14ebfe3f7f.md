The parathyroid glands are a group of endocrine glands located on the posterior thyroid. These glands are responsible for the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), and play a role in calcium homeostasis. Typically, there are four glands divided into pairs - the superior parathyroid glands and the inferior parathyroid glands. The superior parathyroids generally are located superior to the inferior thyroid artery and posterolaterally to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, bilaterally. The inferior parathyroids are most commonly nearÂ the inferior pole of the thyroid and anteromedially to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, bilaterally. Branches of the inferior thyroid artery deliver arterial blood supply. Venous drainage is via the thyroid veins (superior, middle, inferior).

Embryologically, the parathyroid glands derive from the endoderm of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The third pharyngeal pouch gives rise to the inferior parathyroid glands, while the superior parathyroids arise from the fourth pharyngeal pouch. Due to their relatively long course of descent, the final location of the inferior glands is more variable.
