Classically, LMS arises from the smooth muscle cells or the mesenchymal cells committed to becoming smooth muscle cells in the future.

Uterine LMS is the most common form of LMS. Uterine LMS subcategorize into spindle cell, epitheloid, myxoid, and rare types. On gross inspection, most uterine LMS are large solitary lesions with irregular and infiltrative borders. They are usually present intramurally; however, 5% can originate from the cervix. If a specimen contains multiple leiomyomas, then the biggest one must be evaluated for LMS. LMS lacks the whorled appearance of benign leiomyoma and has alternating areas of necrosis and hemorrhage.

The uterine LMS accounts for 1 in 800 uterine smooth muscle cell tumors, which raises the possibility that LMS is a de novo entity.

**Immunohistochemistry**

LMS is usually identifiable on light microscopy. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains are used for confirmation or in highly undifferentiated tumors. Stains like desmin, smooth-muscle actin and h-caldesmon, may be used to confirm the smooth-muscle origin. For epithelioid tumors, histone deacetylase-8 and myocardin are considered superior to desmin and h-caldesmon. Immunopositivity for p16 and p53 with a high Ki-67 proliferation index has also demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating LMS and leiomyomas. Compared to leiomyoma, LMS has a lower expression of estrogen (40% in LMS versus 70% in leiomyoma) and progesterone receptors (38% versus 88%).

Most uterine LMS express the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alfa, Wilms’ tumor gene 1, aromatase, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. The expression of CD117 (KIT mutation) is seen consistently amongst LMS, but this does not translate into oncogenic mutation. Hence drugs targeting KIT mutation (Imatinib) are not effective for uterine LMS. Uterine LMS consistently lacks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2) expression.

**Resection Margins**

Concerning surgical margins, resection of the tumor classifies under three categories.

- R0 resection- No cancer cells are seen microscopically at the resection margin.

- R1 resection- Cancer cells are only seen microscopically at the resection margin.

- R2 resection- Tumor is present at the margins at the time of resection, which can be seen by the naked eye.
