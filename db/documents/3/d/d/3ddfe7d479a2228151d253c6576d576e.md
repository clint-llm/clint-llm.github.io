The causative agent is Toxoplasma gondii, an exclusively intracellular, coccidian protozoan parasite with worldwide distribution. Transmission occurs following ingestion of infectious oocysts from contaminated meat, other food, or water. The oocysts are abundant in the soil, cat litter contaminated with feline feces or undercooked meat from an infected animal (especially felines). Felines are the only animals in which T. gondii can complete its reproductive cycle. After ingestion, the organisms encyst in nucleated cells and can lie dormant within the tissues for the life of the host (latent infection). In most scenarios, disease occurs following reactivation of latent infection because of progressive loss of cellular immunity. This can occur in the setting of advanced HIV, following solid or stem cell transplant, prolonged steroids, use of monoclonal antibodies, or chemotherapy.
