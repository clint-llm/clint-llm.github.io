Managing patients undergoing CT scanning with possible contrast administration is a multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach. Accurate and timely information on the patient's allergies, hemodynamic status, current medications, hydration, and renal status must be easily accessible. It is the duty of any healthcare professional to question whether contrast administration could lead to an adverse outcome for the patient based on the available clinical data. Appropriate documentation and communication of the patient's past and present allergies and any history of previous reactions to contrast materials are essential to prevent adverse clinical outcomes. When in doubt, clear communication with the ordering provider and the radiologist should be facilitated to coordinate the patient's best clinical plan.
