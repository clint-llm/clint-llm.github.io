The patient's initial assessment with small bowel bleeding must include a good clinical history and physical examination. A small bowel bleed can present with varying presentations. It can be overt or occult bleeding. It can be a massive bleed presenting as shock or could be persistent bleeding leading to anemia. A detailed history can help in guiding towards a specific diagnosis.

- Medical history (valvular heart disease, liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis, radiation therapy)

- Surgical history (liver transplantation, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, bowel resection)

- Medications (NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antiplatelets)

- Family history (Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Peutz Jegher syndrome)

- Social history (alcohol intake)

The physical examination findings can help to narrow down the diagnosis. The findings of telangiectasia in HHT (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), spider angioma, and caput medusa in portal hypertension, pigmented lips in Peutz Jegher's syndrome can be found on examination.

The history of chronic pancreatitis can lead to the diagnosis of rare causes like Haemosuccus pancreaticus.
