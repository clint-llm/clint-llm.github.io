As the drug acts as a cholinergic agonist, pilocarpine may propagate muscarinic side effects, particularly when used in the oral form. The muscarinic receptors are present in nearly all major organ systems, and muscarinic medications can mediate autonomic function wherever the receptors are present. Due to the receptor's role in mediating the response of the parasympathetic nervous system, stimulation of the receptors will cause "rest and digest" functions throughout the distribution of M1-M5 receptor locations: the neuronal, cardiac, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, digestive, and urinary systems.
