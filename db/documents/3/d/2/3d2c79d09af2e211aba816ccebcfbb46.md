All interprofessional healthcare team members are responsible for educating patients on the harms of smoking. This includes physicians (MDs and DOs), mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and mental health professionals. The patient should be told about the available nicotine replacement therapies, and the nurse, pharmacist, and clinician should counsel the patient on optimal usage to enhance the odds of successful treatment.Â Evidence has shown that using NRT helps increase the chances of quitting by about 50% to 70%. Withdrawals include restlessness, more than usual hunger, feeling depressed or irritable, and craving another cigarette.

Bupropion is also an antidepressant with smoking cessation effects, and clinicians can combine it with the nicotine patch for a higher chance of success. These patients need continual support and positive reinforcement, and it is incumbent on all interprofessional team members to participate in this support and to alert other team members of any changes in the patient's status, including relapse, adverse events, or lack of compliance. Unfortunately, with all therapies, relapse rates are high. Using an interprofessional team approach and Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC) is associated with increased rates of smoking cessation in primary care settings.
