Patients presenting for hyperbaric oxygen treatment for late or delayed effects of radiation should have a formal consultation with the hyperbaric physician and treatment team. Information needed to determine the diagnosis and develop a treatment plan include:

- Radiation therapy record: Specifically the total dose received and the dates the therapy was given

- Any history of chemotherapy and agents used

- Recent imaging results such as PET, CT, or MRI scans to document that the patient is currently cancer-free

- Reports and records from the referring physician requesting the hyperbaric medicine consultation.
