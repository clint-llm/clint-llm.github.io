Predisposing factors for anaerobic infections include Bacteroides fragilis are recent surgery, trauma, and malignancy. Foul-smelling discharge and abscess formation are usually present on the clinical exam on anaerobic infections, including Bacteroides fragilis. Different clinical presentations depending on different tissues of involvement exist in the literature. Anaerobic bacteria, including Bacteroides fragilis, have been isolated from chronic pressure ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers. Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis may have involvement in inflammatory diarrhea. Bacteroides fragilis may also present in various clinical scenarios, such as necrotizing fasciitis and synergistic anaerobic infections. Bloodstream infection usually results from the spread of uncontrolled local infection into the bloodstream, or it could be a central line-associated bloodstream infection. In a review of anaerobic bacteremia, the Bacteroides fragilis group was the most common causative organism (41%), and the source was mostly intraabdominal infections.Bacteroides fragilis infection.Bacteroides fragilis endocarditis was present in a patient with Crohn disease.
