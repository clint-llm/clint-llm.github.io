Patients who continue to have symptoms of nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or abdominal pain after cholecystectomy may be suffering from post-cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS).

Patients may also have symptoms of PCS caused by extra-biliary disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, pancreas divisum, pancreatitis, pancreatic masses, mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis, or intestinal motility disorders.
