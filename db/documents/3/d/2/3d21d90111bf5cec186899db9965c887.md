Optic atrophy is the hallmark of damage to the visual pathway. It appears as a pale disc on fundus examination. This clinical appearance is not a disease, per se. It only indicates damage to the anterior visual pathway, which can occur in several conditions. Management of a patient with optic atrophy includes proper history and systemic/ocular examination. Treatment is directed to the cause and involves a multidisciplinary approach. Early diagnosis of the causative factors is necessary. Low vision aids can be tried if the patient has some useful vision left. In certain situations, nursing care is paramount. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of optic atrophy.
