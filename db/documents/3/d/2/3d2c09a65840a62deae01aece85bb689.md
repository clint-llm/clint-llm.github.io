The posterior auricular nerve branches off of the facial nerve close to the stylomastoid foramen, the location in which the facial nerve exits the cranium.  The stylomastoid foramen is on the undersurface of the skull, between the styloid and mastoid processes. Upon branching from the facial nerve, the posterior auricular nerve ascends along the mastoid posterior to the external auditory meatus, where it again divides into two separate branches.  The auricular branch supplies the auricularis posterior muscle as well as some of the intrinsic muscles of the ear and the interscutularis muscle. The second branch, the occipital branch, proceeds posteriorly to supply the occipitalis muscle, running along the superior nuchal line. The occipitalis muscle, supplied by the occipital branch of the posterior auricular nerve, connects to the frontalis muscle by the epicranial aponeurosis, and thus may also be considered to be one muscle, occipitofrontalis.

As the posterior auricular nerve ascends superiorly between the mastoid and the external auditory meatus, it joins with the posterior branch of the great auricular nerve and the lesser occipital nerve, which provide sensation to the skin overlying the mastoid, parotid gland, and posterior pinna. The posterior auricular nerve also joins with part of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, known eponymously as Arnold’s nerve, which may be involved in Arnold nerve cough reflex, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and Hitselberger sign.
