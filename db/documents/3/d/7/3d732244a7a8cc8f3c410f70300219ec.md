There are two forms of normal pressure hydrocephalus:

- Idiopathic (primary) NPH - There is no identifiable cause.

- Symptomatic (secondary) NPH - Cases with risk factors of earlier brain infection, hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or radiation contributing to hydrocephalus fall into this category.

Common features of iNPH and secondary normal pressure hydrocephalus are that both are communicating types of hydrocephalus and both carry a similar prognosis. The significant difference between them is that secondary NPH affects persons of all ages, while iNPH is mainly a disease of the elderly.

The basal intracranial pressure must be initially elevated for at least some period of time for NPH to develop.
