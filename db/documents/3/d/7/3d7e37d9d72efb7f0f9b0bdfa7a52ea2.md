The pituitary is an important endocrine gland located at the base of the brain. It is involved in nearly all processes of homeostasis, as well as growth and development. This gland commonly develops pathology, which may result in a mass effect on adjacent intracranial structures or be hormonally active. Pituitary adenomas are present in 14% of autopsy studies and 23% of radiology studies.
