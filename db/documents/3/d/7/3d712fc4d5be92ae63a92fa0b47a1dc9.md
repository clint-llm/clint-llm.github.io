Glass ionomer cement is also known as man-made dentin because it simulates dentin in terms of modulus of elasticity, resilience, coefficient of thermal expansion, and thermal conductivity. It has chemical adhesion to the tooth structure, biological compatibility, and fluoride-releasing properties.

GIC and its modifications have a wide array of uses. Owing to resiliency, very low shrinkage, and thermally compatible with tooth structure, these materials have proven results as liners underneath different restorative materials like dental composites (sandwich technique).

GICs are highly successful as luting agents for cementation of stainless steel crowns for deciduous teeth, cast metal crowns, fixed dental prostheses for permanent teeth, space maintainers, orthodontic bands, and brackets. Resin modified GIC is used for luting zirconia and alumina-based crowns.

GICs can be used to repair defects in tooth structure before crown preparation to stabilize the weakened portions of the tooth.

Along with amalgam and composites, GICs are used as core build-up materials. GICs are preferred as core build-up materials because of their property of chemical adhesion to the tooth structure. When used as fissure sealants and cervical restorations, GIC demonstrates good performance.
