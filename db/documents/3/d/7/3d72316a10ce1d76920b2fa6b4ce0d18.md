Tracheo-innominate artery fistula should be prevented in the following ways:

- limit the time of intubation to less than 3 weeks

- Use proper technique to perform a tracheostomy

- Use blunt and flexible tracheostomy tubes

- Place the tracheostomyÂ  between the 2nd and 3rd tracheal ring

- Avoid repetitive head and neck movements- this will help limit the contact between the underside of the tube and the innominate artery
