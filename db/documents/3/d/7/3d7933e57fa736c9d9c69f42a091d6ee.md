HPV infection is a significant risk factor for developing endocervical adenocarcinomas.

Endometrial carcinoma is classically divided into two subtypes (type 1 and type 2) related to clinical characteristics. Type 1 includes endometrioid and mucinous adenocarcinoma and is associated with increased exposure to estrogen and PTEN, KRAS, PAX2 gene alterations; type 2 includes poorly differentiated subtypes (clear cell, serous, undifferentiated, and carcinosarcomas) with aggressive clinical outcomes and often associated with TP53 alteration.

**Molecular classification of endometrial carcinoma**according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), divides it into four prognostic groups from best to worst prognosis:

- POL-E: a group with polymerase ε exonuclease domain mutations

- MSI: endometrial carcinoma with microsatellite instability

- Copy number low (CNL)

- Copy number high (CNH)

Molecular analysis by microarray revealed the upregulation of CEACAM5, TACSTD1, S100P, and MSLN, with the expression of CEACAM5 and TACSTD1 associated with worse survival outcomes in endocervical and uterine adenocarcinoma.
