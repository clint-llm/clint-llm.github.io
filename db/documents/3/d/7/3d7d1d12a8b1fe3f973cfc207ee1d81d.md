Both disk diffusion and MIC methods employ the phenotypic identification of susceptibility, and therefore, requires the following process:

- Preparation of a standardized inoculum from a bacterial culture:

- Choosing well-isolated colonies
- Creating a bacterial suspension (inoculum)
- Standardizing the bacterial suspension using McFarland standards

- Dilution of bacterial suspension (only for MIC method)

- Inoculation of bacterial suspension to one of the following:

- A particular growth medium (e.g., Mueller Hinton Agar, MHA for disk diffusion)
- A MIC panel

- Addition of antimicrobial disks (only for disk diffusion)

- Incubation of plates (disk diffusion) or panels (MIC)

- Measuring the zone of inhibition or reading MIC panel

- Interpretation of AST results

Commercial systems have their own sets of laboratory procedures that should be followed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Generally, the “direct colony suspension method” is used for preparing inoculum from colonies grown within 18 to 24 hours, while the “growth method” can be used by incubating the inoculated broth (with fast-growing bacteria) within 2 to 6 hours.  The usual McFarland standard for the turbidity of the inoculum is 0.5.

Dilution of bacterial suspension (commonly 1:20) for MIC must occur within 15 minutes after making the standard inoculum.  Saline can be used as a diluent for a small amount of inoculum to create a concentration of 5 x 10 colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter.  As the inoculum is carefully poured over the panel tray and transferred to the panel prongs, the final concentration is expected to be relatively the same.

Before the inoculation of bacterial suspension in a growth medium, for instance, MHA, check that there must not be an excessive amount of inoculum.  This check is accomplished by pressing the swab on the sides of the bacterial suspension tube before inoculating it to the MHA plate.  Inoculate the MHA plate with the swab by starting from the top, carefully swabbing from side to side down to the bottom of the plate.  This step is done three times after each rotation of the plate (usually 60 degrees) to cover the whole MHA plate with evenly swabbed inoculum.

In the MIC method, the inoculum is delivered to each well via panel prongs.  These panel prongs containing inoculum must be pressed on all sides and at the center, ensuring that the right volume of bacterial suspension transfers to each well, which is approximately 0.1 ml.

The addition of antimicrobial disks on inoculated MHA plates can be done manually using sterile forceps placing each disk within equal distances from other disks.  An example of a recommendation states that a 150-millimeter diameter plate can be best applied with only 12 antimicrobial disks.  Each disk must be pressed towards the surface of the agar to ensure that disk displacement will not occur during incubation.

Incubation of the inoculated MHA plates with disks must take place considering the type of pathogen.  Commonly non-fastidious pathogens are incubated at 35°C for about 16 to 18 hours in ambient temperature.  Other organisms require longer times (e.g., 24 hours).  Fastidious pathogens such as Haemophilus and Neisseria spp. require 16 to 18 and 20 to 24 hours, respectively.  In the MIC method, the inoculated panel can be incubated using the same temperature and incubation time requirements.  Additionally, panels are recommended to be covered by a plastic seal or be contained in a plastic bag to prevent the panels from dehydration since each well contains a relatively minimal amount of bacterial suspension.
