The treatment of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is aimed at reducing the basal pressure and resistance of the valve.

Invasive interventions for the treatment of SOD includeÂ ERCP with sphincterotomy. This modality has been shown to be highly effective and generally safe for patients with SOD, with reports of 90% and 70% resolution of symptoms in types I and II SOD, respectively.

Patients with type I and type II sphincter of Oddi dysfunction should be referred for management with ERCP and sphincterotomy. Type III SOD has been shown in a trial not to respond to procedural intervention.
