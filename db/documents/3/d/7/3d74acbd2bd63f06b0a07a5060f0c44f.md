The greater petrosal nerve is supplied by the superficial petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery, which anastomoses with the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular arteryÂ and the artery of the pterygoid canal.

The superior petrosal vein is the drainage route that affects the superficial petrosal nerve.

Lymphatic drainage of the nerve affects the glymphatic system of the skull, although the details of this relationship remain unknown.
