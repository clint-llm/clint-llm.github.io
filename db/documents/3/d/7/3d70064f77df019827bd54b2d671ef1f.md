Common complications include recurrent acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis leading to loss of exocrine function, pancreatic pseudocyst, and necrotizing pancreatitis. Acute severe pancreatitis can also cause multiorgan failure and increases morbidity and mortality.

Some reported complications are lead to anxiety related to recurrent pancreatitis attacks.

Despite adherence to a low-fat diet, some patients continue to suffer from the symptoms of fatigue, indigestion, abdominal pain, and confusion. The symptoms cause a significant clinical and psychosocial burden that leads to limited social interaction and increased unemployment.
