At birth, neonates with FXS often exhibit no clinical signs of FXS with most parameters (e.g., head circumference, weight, and height) in the normal range. In early childhood FXS, physical and developmental features become more apparent, including developmental delays, psychomotor delays, intellectual disabilities, and a long face with prominent ears and flat feet.

Pubertal macroorchidism development in males is a hallmark of male FXS. Frequent bouts of otitis media and sinusitis are often present. Otitis media can cause conductive hearing problems, further contributing to developmental delays. Delays occur in receptive and expressive language skills, with a more prominent delay in expressive language skills

**Signs Include**

- Long face with long palpebral fissures as well as a broad philtrum

- Prominent forehead and protruding ears with soft cartilage

- High-arched palate and dental crowding

- Strabismus, refractive errors

- Pes planus

- Inguinal hernia

- Hyperextensible finger joints and thumbs

- Postpubertal macroorchidism

- Hypotonia

- Biting, hand flapping, poor eye contact, language disorders from cluttered speech to complete lack of speech depending on phenotype severity

- Moderate to profound intellectual disability

- Some have a Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) phenotype with obesity, hyperphagia, and hypogonadism but lack the characteristic hypotonia and feeding problems in infancy.

- Chronic Otitis media

- Seizures

**Premutation**

Many with premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are undiagnosed, but studies have shown that males with premutation have a higher likelihood of developmental delays, seizures, and other related problems.
