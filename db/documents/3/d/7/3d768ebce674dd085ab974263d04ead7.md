Aflatoxin toxicity has important impacts on agriculture, livestock, and human health. Providing knowledge to the public about aflatoxin toxicity will help to ensure food safety and decrease the incidence of aflatoxin-related health problems. Aflatoxins are found in various kinds of cereal, oilseeds, spices, nuts, and animal products. Therefore, patients should be wise in their selection of food products. In addition, farmers should keep an eye on possible aflatoxin contamination during crops' growth, harvesting, storage, and transportation.

The public should be informed about early signs of aflatoxin toxicity and encouraged to seek medical help without delay. Some studies have shown that a regular diet consisting of apiaceous vegetables, such as celery, carrots, parsley, and parsnips, may help reduce the carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin.
