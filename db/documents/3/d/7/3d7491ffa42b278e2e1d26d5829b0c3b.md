Breast reduction is by no means an easy procedure, and even though several techniques have been developed to perform this procedure, each has its own risks and complications. All patients need to be educated about the procedure and potential complications. The downtime can be long and avoiding scars may not always be possible. Recently liposuction has been utilized to elevate the nipple-areolar complex, but since the tissue is being removed without being histologically analyzed, the safety of this procedure is being questioned. There is a small risk that a malignancy may be missed with liposuction. Mesh has also been advocated to support the breast parenchyma, but there is a potential risk of infection and distortion of tissue planes. While minimally invasive procedures offer small scars and rapid recovery, patients should always be informed about the pros and cons of these surgeries.
