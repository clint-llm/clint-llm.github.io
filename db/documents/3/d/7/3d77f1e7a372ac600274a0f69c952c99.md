Paget's disease of the breast is an uncommon manifestation of underlying breast cancer in postmenopausal female patients. Underlying breast lesion is usually a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but can be invasive cancer. The condition can easily be overlooked or misdiagnosed as the presentation is very similar to many common skin rashes that a woman experiences in her life. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of mammary Paget disease.
