In acquired subglottic stenosis, the endotracheal tube causes pressure necrosis at the point of interface with the tissue causing mucosal edema and ulceration. This interrupts normal ciliary flow causing mucociliary disruption and can lead to infection. Primary healing is also prevented due to mobile and loose subglottic submucosa and insufficient vascularization of the cartilage resulting in stenosis secondary to granulation tissue proliferation. Idiopathic subglottis stenosis, more specifically, is often located at the cricoid cartilage, with the narrowest part being between the cartilage’s upper edge and the first tracheal ring. This is often circumferential, though it can be eccentric.
