Examining data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) database from 1973 through 2007, the annual incidence for medulloblastoma was reported at six per million children, in other words, approximately 450 new pediatric cases per year. Children age 4 to 9 years old had the highest incidence at 44%, followed by adolescents (10 to 16 years old) at 23%, and only a 12% incidence in infants/toddlers (0 to 3 years old). Pediatric incidence was calculated to be ten-fold higher than adultÂ incidence. Medulloblastoma affected males 1.5 times more than females.
