Cefotaxime is a beta-lactam antibiotic classified as a third-generation cephalosporin, which was first synthesized in 1976 and is FDA approved to treat gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.

Among the susceptible strains, Enterobacteriaceae is particularly sensitive to cefotaxime and may treat multi-drug resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae.Neisseria gonorrhoeae has shown a positive outcome in both men and women. Cefotaxime has beneficial therapeutic activity treating pneumonia affecting the lower respiratory tract primarily caused by Gram-negative bacilli, and the bactericidal agent has shown significant efficacy in treating complicated infections affecting the urinary tract.

Compared with the other cephalosporins, a favorable characteristic of cefotaxime is that it does not cause a notable occurrence of coagulopathies and pseudocholelithiasis.Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae (HACEK) organisms.
