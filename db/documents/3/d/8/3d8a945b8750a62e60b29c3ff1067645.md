Reliable and reproducible measurements are required to obtain meaningful data from anthropometric measurements. As such, clinicians should ensure the use of well-calibrated, quality equipment that isÂ checked regularly for accuracy. Typical equipment list required to obtain anthropometric measurements includes:

- Weight scale

- Calibration weights

- Stadiometer

- Knee caliper

- Skinfold calipers

- Nonstretchable tape measure

- Infantometer to measure the recumbent length
