# Introduction

The brachioradialis is a superficial forearm muscle located in the lateral forearm. The brachioradialis primarily flexes the forearm at the elbow but also functions to supinate or pronate depending on the rotation of the forearm. The muscle originates along the proximal two-thirds of the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and distally inserts into the lateral surface of the styloid process of the radius. The brachioradialis has unique attachment points compared to other muscles in the body because it originates from the distal end of one bone and inserts into the distal end of another bone.

# Structure and Function

The brachioradialis muscle can be palpated in the anterolateral forearm. The brachioradialis originates proximally from the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus and inserts distally to the radial styloid process of the radius. Given these attachments, the brachioradialis only crosses the elbow joint. The muscle has a fusiform shape where it widens at the muscle belly and narrows distally to become a thin tendon at its distal insertion point. The brachioradialis contributes to the muscle mass overlying the anterolateral forearm.

The brachioradialis muscle contributes to the boundaries of the cubital fossa, forming the lateral boundary along with the wrist extensors. The cubital fossa is on the anterior surface of the elbow and contains important structures such as the brachial artery, median nerve, and biceps tendon.

There are five compartments of the forearm which include the volar superficial, volar deep, dorsal superficial, dorsal deep, and mobile wad. The brachioradialis is located in the mobile wad compartment along with the extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis muscles.

The brachioradialis primarily acts as a flexor of the elbow. The muscle has been shown to be active during elbow flexion whether the forearm is supinated, neutral, or pronated. The brachioradialis functions to stabilize the forearm during elbow flexion.

# Embryology

The upper limb originates from the lateral plate of the mesoderm and somatic mesoderm and emerges as a limb bud around 26 days.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The brachioradialis muscle is supplied by the radial recurrent artery. The radial recurrent artery is a branch of the radial artery below the elbow joint that runs distal to proximal to contribute to the collateral circulation elbow joint.

The brachioradialis lymphatic drainage is part of the upper limb lymphatic system, consisting of superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial lymphatic vessels closely follow the superficial venous vasculature. Part of the superficial lymphatic system follows the basilic vein to drain into the cubital lymph nodes. Lymphatic vessels around the cephalic vein drain to the axillary lymph nodes. The deep lymphatic vessels also drain lymph from the brachioradialis and travel with the deep veins, eventually draining to the axillary lymph nodes.

# Nerves

The brachioradialis muscle is innervated by the radial nerve.

# Muscles

The brachioradialis arises with the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle from the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus. The brachioradialis is one of seven muscles in the superficial layer of the forearm which attach to the lateral epicondyle and supracondylar ridge of the humerus. The other six muscles originating at these attachments include the extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, extensor carpi ulnaris, and anconeus muscle.

# Physiologic Variants

There are several variations of brachioradialis anatomy that have been reported. One variant described has two superficial radial nerves and two muscle bellies of the brachioradialis. One of the superficial radial nerves runs between the two muscle bellies of the brachioradialis putting the nerve at risk for entrapment. The unique double muscle belly variant of the brachioradialis formed superficial and deep layers which both shared a common origin and insertion tendon.

Another variant of the brachioradialis muscle features additional muscle fibers contributing to the brachioradialis from a more proximal origin. These additional muscle fibers originate from the shaft of the humerus near the deltoid insertion and blend distally with the brachialis muscle. Some fibers have been reported to originate as proximal as the acromion. These variant muscle fibers then fuse distally with the brachioradialis.

A variant insertion of the brachioradialis has been reported where the tendon distally inserts to the third metacarpal.

# Surgical Considerations

The brachioradialis is an important structure in the volar approach to the radius (Henry approach), which is an exposure used for distal radius volar plating in the treatment of distal radial fractures.

During superficial surgical dissection in the volar approach to the radius, the surgeon must take care to not damage the superficial radial nerve that runs along the undersurface of the brachioradialis or the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve.

Wartenberg syndrome can be caused by compression of the superficial radial nerve resulting in pain in the dorsoradial wrist and hand.

# Clinical Significance

Wartenberg syndrome occurs when the superficial radial nerve is compressed by the brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus tendon and by fascial bands in the subcutaneous plane

The brachioradialis tendon is used clinically to test the C6 spinal nerve. Striking the brachioradialis tendon causes elbow flexion with forearm pronation or supination.

A midshaft fracture of the humerus can damage the radial nerve within the radial groove of the humerus. The brachioradialis is the first muscle to be innervated by the radial nerve distal to the fracture and is an important muscle to check during the recovery process of the nerve. The brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus are the two muscles that first recover innervation following an injury to the radial nerve at the radial groove. The radial nerve recovers about 1 mm per day.
