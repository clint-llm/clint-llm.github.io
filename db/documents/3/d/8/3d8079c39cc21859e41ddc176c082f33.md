Most commonly, this causes numbness in a stocking-glove distribution over the extremities. In addition to peripheral neuropathy, patients can experience ataxia and disequilibrium as well.

One study examined the role of pyridoxine toxicity on human cells to examine the neurotoxic effects further. They found that pyridoxine induced cell death in a concentration-dependent fashion and inhibited pyridoxal-5-phosphate dependent enzymes.
