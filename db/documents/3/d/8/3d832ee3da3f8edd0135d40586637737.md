The ventricles of the brain are the sites of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production. The lateral ventricles are the largest, and most proximal, ventricles in the central nervous system (CNS). CSF produced in the lateral ventricles goes into the interventricular foramen of Monro. The interventricular foramen of Monro connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle. The third ventricle connects to the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius. CSF flows through this entire pathway and then exits the fourth ventricle into the surrounding CNS tissue or the central spinal canal. This article will focus on the anatomy, function, and clinical relevance of the fourth ventricle.
