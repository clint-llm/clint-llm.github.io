Treatment includes avoidance of UVR, topical medications, systemic medications and in select cases, surgery.

Methods of UVR avoidance include reducing sun exposure, judicious use of sunscreen, and use of long-sleeved UV-protective clothing. This may be difficult for some patients with brachioradial pruritus, as many enjoy outdoor activities during the warm summer season. Topical medications include capsaicin, mild steroids, anesthetics, antihistamines, and amitriptyline/ketamine. Earlier reports stated topical capsaicin was the most commonly prescribed initial therapy. A newer study reported the oral tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline, was the most commonly prescribed medication for brachioradial pruritus, although gabapentin may be more efficacious.

Other oral medications include risperidone, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and hydroxyzine. For unknown reasons, systemic antihistamine therapies are ineffective in brachioradial pruritus. Response to treatment was greatest in patients who rated their pruritus as severe and those that continued with longer treatments.
