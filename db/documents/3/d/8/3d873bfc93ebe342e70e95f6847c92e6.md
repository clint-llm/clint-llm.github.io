The mechanism of action of hydrogen sulfide toxicity is similar to that of cyanide. Oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain during aerobic glucose metabolism is disrupted via inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase. Cells, therefore, largely are diverted to anaerobic metabolism, producing metabolic acidosis due to lactate accumulation.
