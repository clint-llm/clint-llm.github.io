Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder. Individuals with HNPCC are at increased risk for synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancer (CRC). The most common extracolonic manifestation in HNPCC is endometrial cancer. Individuals with HNPCC are also at increased risk of cancer of the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, renal pelvis and ureter, brain (glioma), and sebaceous neoplasms. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of HNPCC and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.
- Review the treatment and management options available for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and improve outcomes.
