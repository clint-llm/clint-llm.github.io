**Laboratory Tests**

Laboratory evaluation may be performed to evaluate for other diseases as the causes of the injury. These laboratory tests can include:

- CBC: to evaluate for anemia and thrombocytopenia

- Coagulation profile: PT/INR, PTT

- Metabolic: glucose, BUN, creatinine, albumin, protein

- Liver: AST, ALT

- Pancreas: amylase, lipase

- Bleeding diatheses: von Willebrand antigen, von Willebrand activity, Factor VIII, Factor IX, and platelet function assays

- Bony disorders: calcium, magnesium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase

**Radiology**

Any child < 2 years of age for whom there is a concern regarding physical abuse should have a complete skeletal survey obtained as part of the evaluation. Additionally, any sibling < 2 years of an abused child should also have a skeletal survey performed. A skeletal survey consists of 21 dedicated X-rays, as recommended by the American College of Radiology. The views include the skull, spine, chest/ribs, pelvis, femur, leg, foot, humerus, forearm, and hand. If the findings are abnormal or equivocal, either further dedicated X-rays of the area of concern and/or follow-up X-rays are indicated in 2 weeks to evaluate for healing fractures.

One should consider that the most common differential diagnosis of non-accidental injury is an accidental injury.
