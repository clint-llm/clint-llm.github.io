Caloric intake is of great importance for one’s health. Calories in food supply our bodies with the energy needed to sustain life. All of the cells in our body need the energy to carry out their specific tasks, from protein metabolism to the Krebs cycle. When we eat foods, they are broken down to release this energy which is either used by the body immediately or stored for later use, depending on the body’s needs at the time.
