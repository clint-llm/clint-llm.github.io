Darier disease is a rare genetic skin disorder that has no cure. The disorder is treated symptomatically. The avoidance of triggers is paramount in preventing exacerbations of Darier disease. The primary care provider, internist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner/PA, nursing staff, and pharmacist should function as an interprofessional team to educate the patient on avoiding triggers like sunlight, heat, occlusive clothing, and friction.

Because the disorder has a profound effect on cosmesis, a mental health consult may be necessary to manage depression and anxiety.
