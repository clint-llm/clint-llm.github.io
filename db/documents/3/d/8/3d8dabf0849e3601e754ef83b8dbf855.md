Depending on the presenting symptoms, the initial differential diagnosis can be extensive. Clinical history, physical exam, lab values, and imaging can narrow the possibilities. However, specific diagnoses present with similar symptoms and lab values and require exclusion. These include metastatic disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and renal osteodystrophy.

Osteoblastic bone metastases have similar lab findings and may also show multiple zones of uptake by bone scintigraphy. Further evaluation may be warranted to exclude malignancy. Multiple myeloma can present with similar clinical symptoms (i.e., bone pain and weakness), but will often reveal lytic lesions on radiographs. Patients with multiple myeloma may also have anemia and decreased renal function.

Primary hyperparathyroidism should present with hypophosphatemia, increased bone alkaline phosphatase, and increased zones of uptake. However, it usually presents with hypercalcemia, which is atypical in osteomalacia. In renal osteodystrophy hyperphosphatemia, rather than hypophosphatemia, is typically observed.
