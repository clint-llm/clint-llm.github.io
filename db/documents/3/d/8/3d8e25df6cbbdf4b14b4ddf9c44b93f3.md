The clinician should first observe how the patient moves, how he compensates, and whether there are any differences in muscle shape between the two calves. The clinician will palpate the tone of the muscles, both on the fleshy level and on the fascia (aponeurosis and tendon); the movement is first activated by the patient so as not to condition the person or the perception of pain. Passively evaluate the knee and ankle after active movements. Finally, the anamnesis will be fundamental.

**Correct Evaluation of the Equine Foot**

To perform the Silfverskiold test correctly, the force applied by the operator must be about 2 kilos, with the hand placed under the sole or under the head of the second metatarsal. If the patient has a non-rigid flat foot, the heel is in a position of valgism; in this case, pure dorsiflexion does not occur, with a movement that expresses itself on an oblique plane, thanks to the joints of the hindfoot. To obtain a clean movement and to improve the execution of the test, the hindfoot must be placed in a neutral or slightly variant position. Before performing this test, it is possible to carry out the Taloche test or the Taloche sign. If the gastrocnemius muscle is contracted, the patient will not be able to maintain the orthostatism if it is resting on an inclined plane (a tablet).

**Tibial Nerve Trapping**

A tibial nerve tract can be palpated both in the popliteal cavity and slightly below; in these areas, it is superficial and very simple to hear manually. The nerve becomes the posterior tibial nerve when it reaches the ankle area and travels in the tarsal tunnel, deeper than the flexor retinaculum and the posterior tibial artery and vein.

The tibial nerve rarely undergoes an entrapment to the popliteal cavity, while it more frequently has an entrapment to the tarsal tunnel, as previously mentioned. At this level, there are different causes such as a tumor, a previous intervention, trauma, systemic diseases such as diabetes or neurological diseases, and deformity of the same foot. It is possible to carry out a stress test with the Tinel test to evoke the painful or paresthesia symptoms.

**Calcaneal Tendon Rupture Evaluation**

The Thompson squeeze test or sign of Simmonds-Thompson is a semiotics maneuver of the objective examination of the lower limb, which, if positive, indicates a complete rupture of the calcaneal tendon. The examiner compresses the patient's calf between the fingers, lying in a prone position with the feet over the edge of the bed. Under normal conditions, the squeezing of the muscular masses causes the plantar flexion of the foot, while when there is a full-thickness tear of the posterior calcaneal tendon structures, it evokes intense pain with no movement of the foot.
