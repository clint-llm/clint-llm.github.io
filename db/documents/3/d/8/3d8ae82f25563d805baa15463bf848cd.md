A cholinergic crisis develops as a result of overstimulation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors at the neuromuscular junctions. This is usually secondary to the inactivation or inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine (ACh). Excessive accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junctions and synapses causes symptoms of both muscarinic and nicotinic toxicity. These include cramps, increased salivation, lacrimation, muscular weakness, paralysis, muscular fasciculation, diarrhea, and blurry vision. This activity examines the presentation and evaluation of a patient undergoing a cholinergic crisis and the role of the health professional team in coordinating the care of this acute condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with cholinergic crisis. 
- Review how to evaluate for cholinergic crisis. 
- Identify the components involved in the management of a cholinergic crisis. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by cholinergic crisis.
