The equipment needed for spinal cord stimulator implantation includes stimulation leads, a cable to connect the leads to a generator, and an implantable pulse generator. The pulse generatorâ€™s electrical impulse can be modified to help provide pain relief. There are various types of generators. Paresthesia-based and paresthesia-free (high frequency or burst) stimulators are two types of generators.
