Intra or extra lobar sequestration diagnosed perinatally requires complicated management in a hospital equipped to provide vigorous resuscitation and appropriate treatment for pulmonary hypoplasia.

If a fetus is less than 30 weeks gestation and is showing signs of hydrops, thoracoamniotic shunting is recommended. Post-delivery of the baby in large sequestration, supportive management with ventilator support, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be necessary. Immediate tube thoracostomy is indicated for large pleural effusions. Surgical resection is indicated for symptomatic infants although thoracotomy is deferred until stabilization is achieved in infants with pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.

Pulmonary lobectomy is the treatment of choice for established pulmonary sequestration. It is recommended even in asymptomatic patients to avoid infection), and progressive inflammation of the lung parenchyma. However, in the largest retrospective case series in adults by Xiao et al., there was a lack of clear evidence of the benefit between preemptive surgery and a conservative approach in asymptomatic patients.

Resection can be achieved by open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic procedures  (VATS). In recent years uniportal VATS guided lobectomy has also been successfully performed.

Anesthetic and surgical risks of resection tend to be lower after 2 months of age.

In the retrospective review from Mayo Clinic, 56% of patients underwent surgical resection. The postoperative complication rate was 28%.

Berna et al. also had an equivalent postoperative complication rate of 25% in their sample of 26 adult patients. Complications included prolonged air leak and bronchopleural fistula, hemoptysis, empyema, and arrhythmia.

In the past few years, endovascular embolization and coiling have emerged as a therapeutic alternative.

Embolization is associated with a recurrence rate of 25% to 47%. Etiology of recurrence could be:

- Incomplete closure

- Displacement of the embolic agent

- Opening of collaterals

- Formation of shunts

Some authors have explored the role of preoperative embolization of sequestration, to minimize bleeding risk, as the area of sequestration arteries with anomalous blood vessels with fragile wall integrity, thus prone to hemorrhagic complications during surgery.
