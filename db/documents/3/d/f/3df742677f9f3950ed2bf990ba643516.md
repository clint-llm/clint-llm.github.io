Arterial blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and vascular compliance (systemic vascular resistance), therefore a high cardiac output and high systemic vascular resistance are the primary mechanisms of hypertension.

Renal parenchymal diseases lead to impaired renal function that results in intravascular volume expansion. While an inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic system is the other mechanism responsible for hypertension in renal parenchymal diseases.

In endocrine disorders, different hormones are responsible for hypertension. In primary aldosteronism, higher levels of aldosterone result in volume expansion (by salt retention), while cortisol plays a similar role in Cushing`s syndrome.
