Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) though rare individually are common, as a group. The pediatrician is often the primary care provider (PCP) to see the patient. The PCP will have clues to observe at birth, during infancy, and childhood, leading to the suspicion of LSDs as the likely cause. Sometimes a specialist or sub-specialist may diagnose the condition which testifies as to the multi-faceted presentations of LSDs.

The clinical biochemist who performs the enzyme assay will similarly need all the information, and so too the radiologist. Likewise, different specialists will be involved in the care of some aspect of the child's illness and coordinated care, and efficient interprofessional communication is vital to good outcomes. Allied health professionals like nurses, physiotherapists, and clinical psychologists play a significant role in patient education and care. Pharmacists are crucial to monitor ERT and SRT.

LSDs are classic examples in healthcare where dedicated centers with multi-disciplinary specialist groups see the patient together on the same premises, discuss their findings, and arrive at a consensus on management's next step. It helps prevent delays, decreases patients lost to follow-up, and vastly improve outcomes. [Level 5]
