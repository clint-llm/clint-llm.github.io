Carbon dioxide refers to the lasing medium within the device, the part of the laser that produces the beam of collimated, coherent, and monochromatic light. The lasing medium of medical carbon dioxide lasers contains CO2, nitrogen, hydrogen, and helium gasses and produces infrared light with a peak wavelength of 10,600 nm. The chromophore - the molecule that predominantly absorbs the laser's energy - for this wavelength is water.

Laser-safe protective eye equipment is required for use by both the laser operator and the patient. The patient's eyes can be protected with wet/moist gauze as well as photoprotective opaque eye shields. The operator and all other personnel should also use goggles that are laser-protective for 10,600 nm. Protective goggles for CO2 lasers are typically clear.
