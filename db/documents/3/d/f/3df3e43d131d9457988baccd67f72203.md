Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful orthopedic procedures performed today with an estimated 300,000 total hip arthroplasties performed each year in the United States. THA is a surgical procedure that replaces the diseased articular surface with synthetic components to attempt to restore native hip anatomy, resulting in pain relief and improved joint kinematics. Performing a THA requires a nuanced understanding of hip anatomy and biomechanics.

THA can be performed through multiple approaches and is dictated by surgeon preference, prior incisions, obesity, risk of dislocation, implant selection, and degree of deformity. Standard approaches include direct anterior (Smith-Peterson), anterolateral (Watson-Jones), direct lateral (Hardinge), posterolateral (Kocher-Langenbach), and posterior (Moore or Southern). A recent study comparing the relatively newer direct anterior approach with the conventional posterior approach suggests that the direct anterior approach may be associated with functional advantages early in recovery, although randomized trials are needed to validate these findings.
