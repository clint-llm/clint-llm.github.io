Adhesions are fibrous tissues that develop inside and between organs and structures after inflammation or stimulation. They go through different phases, similar to the normal wound healing process. In the initial phase, they are friable edematous—inflammation results in an exudation of fibrinogen, which in turn cleaves into fibrin. The fibrin then binds with fibronectin and formes a temporary wound bed.

On maturing, the fibrous tissue shrink and attain strength, taking the form of mature fibrous tissue in about six weeks. Management (if any) depends on the etiology, the location, and the associated symptoms. Surgical lysing of the adhesions is called adhesiolysis. It involves cutting across and releasing the adhesions bands to alleviate their unfavorable effect.
