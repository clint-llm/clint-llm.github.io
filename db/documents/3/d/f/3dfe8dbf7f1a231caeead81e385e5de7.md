The diagnosis and management of brain AVM are with an interprofessional team that consists of a neurosurgeon, neurologist, internist, and an invasive radiologist. The follow-up of these patients is usually by the nurse practitioner and primary care provider. The management of brain AVMs depends on the size, location, patient age, and status of the AVM (high risk of rupture). While surgery is the mainstay treatment, embolization is another option. The outcomes of these patients depend on the AVM size, presence of symptoms, location, patient comorbidity, and mental status. Complications following surgery are common and recovery in many patients is prolonged requiring extensive rehab. The most significant risk factor for death is the rupture of the AVM.
