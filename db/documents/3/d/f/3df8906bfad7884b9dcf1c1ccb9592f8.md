Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is administered in an approved and inspected pressurized chamber. The chambers are either monoplace chambers which hold only one patient at a time or multiplace chambers that can accommodate several patients and an overseeing physician. The multiplace chambers can accommodate a wider variety of patients, such as those on ventilators or those who need special accessory equipment that would not fit into a monoplace chamber. This activity regulates everything from exhaust carbon dioxide to the purity of oxygen and air. Frequent inspections are mandated, and the staff has to be specially trained to oversee hyperbaric dives. There is also a safety director appointed to each facility, ensuring compliance with specifications.

The most catastrophic event associated with a hyperbaric dive is a failure of the chamber or fire. Hopefully, the frequent inspections and keen vigilance of the staff will avoid the failure of the chamber. Fire prevention is also at the forefront of concern with dives. Three things are needed for a fire; a combustible material, a spark or fire source, and oxygen. Patients are limited to what they can bring into the chamber. No oils, electronics, or other non-approved items are allowed. They must wear only specially approved gowns, and no street clothes are permitted. Patients are also grounded to prevent static sparks. Any non-approved electronic equipment can only be used away from the open chamber.
