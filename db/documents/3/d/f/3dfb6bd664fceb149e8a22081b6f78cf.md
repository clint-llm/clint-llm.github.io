Taking a medical history is one of the first things required of a health care provider to diagnose anemia. Symptoms of normocytic anemia can be slow to develop depending on the causation.

**Common Symptoms**

- Fatigue

- Dizziness or lightheadedness

- Dyspnea

- Exercise intolerance

- Generalized weakness

- Palpitation

- Headaches

- Decreased concentration

**Important History Questions**

- Diet

- History of abdominal pain, reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease

- Medications, including frequent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- History of autoimmune conditions, malignancies

- Blood loss including menstrual history (e.g., hematochezia, melena stools, gross hematuria, hematemesis)

- Family history of thalassemia or sickle cell disease

- Medications

A physical exam may help confirm the diagnosis. The first signs of normocytic normochromic anemia or any type of anemia are usually generalized weakness and a pale complexion.

**Physical Exam Signs**

- The pallor of the skin, conjunctivae, lips, palmar creases, and nail beds

- Postural hypotension secondary to intravascular volume loss

- Jaundice caused by hemolytic anemia

- Bone pain and/or organomegaly with an infiltrative disease of the bone marrow

- Splenomegaly secondary to hemolysis, lymphoma, leukemia, myelofibrosis
