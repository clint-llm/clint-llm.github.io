A thorough history including the details of the injury should be elicited from patients to help identify the cause. Victims of envenomation typically seek medical help within 2 hours because of the systemic symptoms stated above, a puncture wound, intense pain (often with proximal radiation), or lymphedema associated with the injury. Erythema, pallor, or ecchymoses may be associated with the wound. Patients may report anesthesias or paresthesias in addition to the intense pain. The lymphedema associated with the injury is usually most severe in lower leg injuries caused by stonefish, and lymphadenitis is also possible in such cases. Systemic symptoms noted on physical exam may include hypotension, diaphoresis, respiratory distress, abdominal tenderness, and decreased strength.
