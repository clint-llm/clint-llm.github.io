The treatment of a child with 5 [9alpha-RD2 deficiency depends on many factors, the most important being the phenotypic findings and gender of the childÂ at the time the physician diagnoses the problem. If there is a critical defect in the formation of external male genitalia, then it will be better if the child is raised as a female. Further, if the child wants to be raised as a female, then the testes have to be removed, and corrective surgery will be necessary. The removal of testes has to occur before the child attains puberty and virilization of the child.

If the child is raised as a male, then corrective surgery should be done depending on the phenotype of the child. The developmental size of the penis at the time of diagnosis and its ability to develop into a functional penis is the main criteria of consideration before raising the child as a male.

The parents of the child with ambiguous genitalia have legal rights to seek assistance, support, and any information on the child's problem. They can take adequate time on deciding the treating options and deciding the gender of the child.
