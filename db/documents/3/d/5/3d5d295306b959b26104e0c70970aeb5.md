Patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV infection) have been noted to have various forms of neuropsychiatric illnesses. These include symptoms of both cognitive disorders as well as mood and anxiety symptoms. This activity reviews the epidemiology, etiology, clinical signs and symptoms, evaluation, and treatment of neurocognitive disorder secondary to HIV disease and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating this condition. This activity also reviews basic screening tools for the disease and evidence-based treatment guidelines. This activity also covers a section on current research studies on neurocognitive disorders secondary to HIV.

**Objectives:**
- Review the impact of HIV disease on major cognitive disorders or dementia.
- Identify the different stages of dementia or neurocognitive disorder secondary to HIV disease.
- Outline the management options available for dementia or neurocognitive disorder secondary to HIV disease.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by neurocognitive disorders secondary to HIV disease.
