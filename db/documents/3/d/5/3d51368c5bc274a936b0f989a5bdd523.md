Inflammatory back pain (IBP) is a condition of pain localized to the axial spine and sacroiliac joints that is chronic and is differentiated from mechanical back pain by a set of key diagnostic features. Inflammatory back pain is associated strongly with, but not diagnostic of, several inflammatory conditions that may have both axial and peripheral pain features. Pain in inflammatory back pain is more often localized to the lumbar spine and may be associated with buttock pain that alternates from one side to another; though, it is patient characteristics, chronicity, and pain progression that set IBP apart from other causes. The classic association of inflammatory back pain symptoms is with ankylosing spondylitis; however, IBP may also be present in other seronegative spondyloarthropathies such as psoriatic arthritis, enteropathic arthropathy, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. The cause of inflammatory back pain may also be undifferentiated given the absence or combination of diagnostic features of any of these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common etiologies of inflammatory back pain and associated critical situations.
- Outline the appropriate workup (history, physical exam) for inflammatory back pain.
- Summarize the management options available for inflammatory back pain.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team in the management of inflammatory back pain.
