Fetal surgeries are challenging endeavors, requiring collaboration between multiple teams, including but not limited to surgeons, otolaryngologists, obstetricians, neonatologists, feto-maternal physicians, anesthesiologists, nursing, and other ancillary staff. An inter-disciplinary discussion should be held in advance to create an elaborate plan. Shared decision-making should also involve the parturient to set expectations. These procedures are physically and emotionally taxing for the mother and could be associated with multiple complications for both the mother and the child. Thorough, closed-loop communication is monumental. The team should ensure a seamless continuation of care from the antenatal period into preoperative optimization and care in the operating room and care in the NICU to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes.
