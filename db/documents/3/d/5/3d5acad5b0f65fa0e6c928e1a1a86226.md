Canalicular lacerations occur in all age groups with a wide range of etiologies. It is important to understand the anatomy when considering the importance of a laceration to this structure. The canaliculi are located at the most medial margins of the four eyelids. The punctum is a superficial opening into the canaliculus functioning to draw tears out of the eye and into the canaliculus. In most people, an upper and lower canaliculus from each eye then drain into a common canaliculus and finally into the lacrimal system.

Lacerations to this region affect the drainage system of the eye, can affect the muscles and tendons of the orbit, and potentially even the facial bones. Damage to the underlying facial bones, or more significant injury to the eye, is beyond the scope of this article.Â  Our primary focus will be on explaining the etiology, epidemiology, important elements of the history and physical examination, and to list management strategies for a canalicular laceration.
