**Posterior Pituitary/Renal Systems**

- The posterior pituitary and renal organ systems are crucial to maintaining appropriate plasma osmolality. Although albumin contributes to the oncotic pressure, it only makes up to 5% of the plasma, which means it has a lesser effect. Albumin gets formed in the liver and, in pathologic processes, can be underproduced or lost in the extracellular matrix and urine. See the Mechanism section below for details.

**Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS)**

The RAAS system is crucial because it maintains extracellular volume, sodium concentration, and blood pressure. It does this by secreting a hormone called renin by the kidneys. Renin then circulates to the adrenal glands, and downstream effects occur. SeeÂ the Mechanism section below for details.
