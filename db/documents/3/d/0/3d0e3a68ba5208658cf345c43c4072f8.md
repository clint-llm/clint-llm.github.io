Hypoxic stress at high altitude induces a variety of physiological changes. Many organ systems utilize vasodilation to enhance oxygen delivery in the setting of hypoxia.  In contrast, the lung responds to hypoxia with increased pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Blood is shunted away from poorly oxygenated lung zones towards healthy alveoli in an effort to minimize V/Q mismatch.

Vascular remodeling plays a major role in the pathophysiology of HAPH. Hypoxia ultimately leads to vascular remodeling by triggering pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance in the small pulmonary veins and arteries. At the cellular level, chronic hypoxia causes channelopathy of both potassium and calcium channels, increasing intracellular calcium.  The proliferation of smooth muscle within the pulmonary vasculature occurs, a structure normally devoid of smooth muscle cells ( fibroblasts).

Endothelial nitrous oxide (NO) is theorized to play a role in the development of HAPH. Longstanding hypoxia is known to decrease NO synthesis, contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension.
