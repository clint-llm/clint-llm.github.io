Pleomorphic adenoma mostly presents as a  solitary mobile slow-growing, painless mass, which may be present for many years. Symptoms and signs mainly depend on size, location, and potential to undergo malignant transformation. In the parotid gland, signs of facial nerve weakness occur when the tumor is large or if it undergoes malignant change. Pleomorphic adenoma in the deep lobe of the parotid gland may present as an oral retro tonsillar or para-pharyngeal mass which is visible or usually palpable. Rapid enlargement of a tumor nodule should raise a concern of malignant change. Minor salivary gland tumors may present with a variety of symptoms, including dysphagia, hoarseness,  dyspnea, difficulty in chewing, and epistaxis dependent on the site of the tumor.
