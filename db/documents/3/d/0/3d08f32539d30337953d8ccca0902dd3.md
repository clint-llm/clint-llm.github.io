MTS is a rare syndrome associated with various dermal and visceral malignancies. These patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes oncology nurses. Once the diagnosis is made Muir-Torre syndrome patients should undergo annual surveillance for visceral and cutaneous malignancy. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed. Colonoscopy may begin as early as 18 years while upper endoscopy is recommended around 25 to 30 years. Men should undergo annual testicular and prostate exams, and women should have annual breast and pelvic exams along with transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial sampling for suspicious findings. Other potentially beneficial tests would include chest x-ray, cervical and urine cytology, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, fecal occult blood testing, liver function tests, and complete blood counts.

The skin lesions are managed with topical ablative therapies or surgical excision. The prognosis for these patients is poor as most succumb to malignancies.
