If prehospital EMS is to be considered an extension of the care provided in an emergency department (ED), then their methods, interventions, and protocols must be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny as the ones employed byÂ ED staff. Emergency warning lights and sirens are ubiquitous in society, but this does not mean that their use cannot be optimized for the safety of EMS providers, their patients, and the public. Local and state ordinances often govern the use of emergency vehicle lights and sirens, but those laws should be created with hard data in mind, and not driven by the emotions and traditions of the members of the services involved. EMS directors should play a definitive role in the creation of specific ordinances. Attempts to study and refine the use of emergency lights and sirens must continue.
