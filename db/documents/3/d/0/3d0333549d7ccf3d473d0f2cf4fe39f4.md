PenicillinÂ has a small risk of toxicity. Compared to other biologically active substances, clinicians can administer these drugs at relatively high doses without harming patients. Estimates are that it would take 5 g/kg body weight intravenously to cause convulsions in a patient. However, penicillin can cause local toxicity due to high dose injections at sensitive sites such as the anterior chamber of the eye or the subarachnoid space. There are reports that pure preparations of penicillin cause no harm to the lungs and veins. Other reports indicate that topical penicillin can prevent coagulation in dental cavities.
