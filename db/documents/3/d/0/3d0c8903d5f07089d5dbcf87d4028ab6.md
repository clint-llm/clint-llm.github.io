Angioid streaks occur due to breaks in a degenerated and mineralized Bruch's membrane, that typically radiate outward from the optic disc. Angioid streak may be associated with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) causing metamorphopsia and/or visual decline. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of angioid streaks, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the further evaluation and care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histopathology of angioid streaks.
- Summarize the physical findings associated with angioid streaks.
- Outline the management of angioid streaks.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with angioid streaks.
