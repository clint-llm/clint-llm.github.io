It is important to understand the weight loss process and where an individual may be in that journey. If someone complains of worsening fatigue and has lost a large amount of muscle mass, they may need a "recovery phase" to increase or regain lost muscle mass. An increase in lean muscle mass has a positive impact on improving metabolism.

Another factor to consider is non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). NEAT is the energy expended from daily activities throughout the day, such as walking to work, typing, and even fidgeting.
