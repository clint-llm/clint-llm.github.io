The International Council on Standardization in Hematology (ICSH) published in 1995 a recommendation that blood volume should be predicted based on body surface area as compared to bodyweight for reasons already mentioned.

The ICSH also recommended that the normal range for blood volume should be within 25% above or below the predicted blood volume.

Mild hypo- or hypervolemia ranges from 8 to 16% above or below that predicted. Moderate ranges from 16 to 24% above or below predicted. Severe ranges from 24 to 32% above or below predicted. Finally, any value for blood volume greater than 32% above or below the predicted value represents extreme hypo- or hypervolemia.
