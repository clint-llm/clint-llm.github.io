All interprofessional healthcare team members should be aware of the nature of nystagmus and, depending on specialty, be capable of varying degrees of interpretation. However, the ability to recognize the condition is essential so that the patient can be referred to the appropriate clinician for further workup and diagnosis. It must be charted in the patient's record so that all healthcare team members are aware and appropriate action can take place, leading to a more accurate diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.
