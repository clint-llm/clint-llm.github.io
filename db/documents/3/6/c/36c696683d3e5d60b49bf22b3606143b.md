Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be divided into subgroups of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. ACS carries significant morbidity and mortality and prompt diagnosis, and appropriate treatment is essential. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndrome.
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with NSTEMI.
- Summarize the treatment options for NSTEMI.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by NSTEMI.
