The cornerstone of treatment involves an appropriate antibiotic regimen, remembering that the infection is often polymicrobial and frequently caused by gram-negative aerobes, anaerobes, and streptococcus species. No randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating empiric antibiotic regimens, and numerous studies advocate for broad-spectrum coverage even if bacteremia is absent.

Once culture results and susceptibility data become available, antibiotics should be narrowed accordingly. Initially, antibiotics should be administered via a parenteral route, but ultimately, consideration may be given to transitioning to an oral route pending antimicrobial susceptibility data and clinical complications. The typical duration of antibiotics is approximately four to six weeks, but consultation with an infectious disease specialist is advised.

At the present time, there is no clear consensus on the role of anticoagulation in pylephlebitis, mainly due to the paucity of randomized controlled trials and high-quality data. In one review of 100 cases, 35 patients received anticoagulation in addition to antibiotics, compared to antibiotics alone, and a lower mortality rate was observed.

Due to the lack of high-quality evidence, it is reasonable to consider anticoagulation in a patient with an underlying neoplasm, inherited thrombophilia, or extension of the thrombus into the mesenteric veins. It should also be considered when bacteremia is due to a Bacteroides species as it possesses surface components that enhance fibrin clotting in addition to the ability to elaborate enzymes that degrade heparin.
