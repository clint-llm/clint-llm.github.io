Patients may not initially present with signs and symptoms of intoxication but may report neurological symptoms, loss of coordination, and mood changes. Auto-brewery syndrome should be considered in any patient presenting with an elevated blood alcohol level who denies ingestion of alcohol, including those arrested for DWI.

Auto-brewery syndrome is more likely in a patient with chronic intestinal obstruction, gastroparesis, diabetes, or liver dysfunction such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). An interprofessional approach that includes a psychiatric evaluation should be employed.

EvaluationÂ should include:

- A complete history and physical; include history from family members regarding diet and alcohol intake and episodes of unexplained intoxication

- Lab tests including CBC, metabolic panel, blood alcohol level, drug screen, and stool culture and sensitivity (bacterial and fungal)

- Elimination of other primary causes such as head injury, secret drinking, psych diagnosis

- A 24-hr. observation with a high carbohydrate diet and a carbohydrate challenge of 200g glucose with BAC and BrAC testing at intervals of 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours; confirmation of auto-brewery syndrome if levels are elevated during the test.

- Upper and lower endoscopy with samples for culture and sensitivity (bacterial and fungal).

Clinicians should be aware that not all patients have an episode (or flare) within 24 hours depending on transit time and location of fermenting microbes.
