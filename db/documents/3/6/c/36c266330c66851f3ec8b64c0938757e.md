Central nervous system (CNS): Most common side effects are neurobehavioral, like sedation, fatigue, mood swings, headache, agitation, irritability, aggression, depression, memory loss, confusion, paresthesia, a decline in cognition, and increased suicide risk. Most of the time, the side effects are mild. About 1% of patients experience serious side effects like psychosis, hallucinations, and suicidal thoughts. These side effects are more common in the first month of treatment but can develop during treatment and improve once the drug is discontinued. Dose reduction is associated with improvement in behavioral problems. A systematic review suggests that pyridoxine supplementation might be of benefit in relieving levetiracetam-induced neuropsychiatric adverse events.

- Cardiovascular (CVS): Increased diastolic blood pressure in infants and children

- Gastrointestinal (GI): Vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia

- Infections: Pharyngitis and rhinitis have been reported in 7% to 15% of patients

Hypersensitivity reactions: Rarely serious, life-threatening reactions have been reported using levetiracetam. These include angioedema, anaphylaxis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hives, respiratory distress, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Hematologic: Leukopenia, eosinophilia, and rarely pancytopenia have been reported using levetiracetam.

Hepatotoxicity: Likelihood score: C (probable rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury). Levetiracetam administration has been associated with rare cases of serum enzyme elevations and rare cases of clinically apparent liver injury. The onset of liver injury is from 1 week to 5 months. The typical pattern of injury is hepatocellular.

**Drug Interactions**

Since levetiracetam can cause sedation and CNS depression, it may enhance the CNS-depressant effect of alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs like azelastine, carbamazepine, and opioids. A concurrent prescription with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) increased the clearance of levetiracetam by 9 to 22%. Coadministration enzyme-inhibitor drugs such as valproate decreased the clearance of levetiracetam by 18.8%.
