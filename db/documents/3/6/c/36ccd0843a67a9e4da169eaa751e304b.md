EPI: Chronic exposure to alcohol is the most common etiological factor for chronic pancreatitis. The other notable risk factors for chronic pancreatitis include predisposing genetic mutations (PRSS-1, SPINK-1, CFTR, CTRC), autoimmune pancreatitis, pancreatic duct obstruction, and chronic nicotine exposure.

CF is a multisystem disease as a result of mutations in the gene which encodes the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).

Cholestatic Diseases: The mechanisms underlying the development of chronic cholestatic liver diseases, including PBC and PSC, are not entirely understood. Both these disorders are characterized by portal inflammation and progressive fibrosis and eventually resulting in end-stage liver disease. Here, the reduction in bile flow results in the accumulation of toxic bile products, which leads to biliary epithelial damage.

Celiac Disease: It is a chronic autoimmune-mediated enteropathy related to exposure to dietary gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. The genes which encode for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 are prerequisites for this disease. Ingestion of gluten (specifically the gliadin peptides from wheat, rye, and barley) by susceptible individuals, along with some unknown trigger factors, leads to pathogenesis.

SIBO: Under physiological conditions, several defense mechanisms regulate the microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent small intestine bacterial overgrowth. The significant factors in SIBO prevention include immunoglobin A, gastric acidity, bile, and defensins.
