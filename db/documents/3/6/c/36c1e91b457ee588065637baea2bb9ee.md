Nearly 95% of the world’s population of adults have been infected with the Epstein Barr virus.

Worldwide prevalence rates of Epstein Barr virus vary. In England, the Epstein Barr virus prevalence rate for children ages 11 to 24 was 74.6%. Younger patients 11 to 14 years old had a lower prevalence rate of Epstein Barr virus when compared to older children. Young adults 22 to 24-year olds had 93% seropositivity.

One study found that the infection rates tend to increase between June and August, most likely due to increased human interaction during the summer months.
