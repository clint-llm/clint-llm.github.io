A classical symptom of AAS is severe aortic pain, which is chest and/or back pain commonly described as being tearing, ripping, migrating, or pulsating in nature.

Dissection in the ascending aorta can be found associated with myocardial ischemia, aortic regurgitation from the involvement of the aortic valve, or pericardial effusion.
