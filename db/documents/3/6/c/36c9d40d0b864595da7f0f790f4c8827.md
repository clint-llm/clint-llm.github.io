Extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), commonly referred to as drug-induced movement disorders are among the most common adverse drug effects patients experience from dopamine-receptor blocking agents. A variety of movement phenotypes has since been described along the EPS spectrum, including dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism, which occur more acutely, as well as more chronic manifestations of tardive akathisia and tardive dyskinesia. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of EPS and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the types of drugs known to cause EPS.
- Differentiate the types of EPS symptoms.
- Summarize the treatment of EPS.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by EPS.
