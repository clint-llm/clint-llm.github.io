The only accepted indication for the abdominal thrust maneuver is that of the conscious choking adult from a lodged supra-laryngeal foreign body. The universal choking sign is the main indication for the Heimlich maneuver. This sign consists of the inability to speak, breathe, or cough while holding both hands up to one's own throat.

Although initially reported to help with asthma and drowning patients, the Heimlich maneuver has not proven to help with these diagnoses.
