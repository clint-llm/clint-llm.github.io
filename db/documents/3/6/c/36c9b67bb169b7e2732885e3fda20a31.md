The ACLS allows quick assessment of a person’s level of cognitive function via task-based assessment. The tool used for the screening is a leather plate with small circular holes all along the periphery. Using two needles and two strings, the therapist performs three various stitching tasks, with each task increasing in complexity in the level of lacing. The stitches performed are running stitch, whipstitch, and a cordovan stitch; error-correcting is also an assessed capability in the screening. A numerical score between 3.0 and 5.8 is assigned based on the test subject’s ability to replicate these stitches accurately.
