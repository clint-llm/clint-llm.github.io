Conservative treatment will generally be indicated in less displaced fractures in an above-elbow cast. Immobilization is advised for a minimum period of 4 weeks. Further immobilization for another two weeks may be indicated depending on fracture healing at this stage.

The indications of surgery are fracture displacement >2 mm and articular surface incongruency. Also, when there is a loss of reduction seen on serial radiographs, operative management is required. When fracture displacement exceeds 2mm, operative management is necessary. Closed reduction and percutaneous fixation are options where possible, mainly for Weiss type 2 and Song stage 2-4 fractures. The main goal of surgical management is to reduce the articular surface anatomically.

Cannulated screws can be an option with similar outcomes. This approach can prevent skin infections commonly associated with Kirschner wires, although they will require further surgery for their removal.
