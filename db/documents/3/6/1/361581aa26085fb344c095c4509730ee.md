Pneumothorax is gas in the pleural space. This condition can present in one of three ways: spontaneous (primary), secondary, and traumatic. This activity focuses on a subset of traumatic pneumothoraces known as iatrogenic pneumothorax This refers to a pneumothorax that has developed secondary to an invasive procedure such as pulmonary needle biopsy (transthoracic and transbronchial), placement of a central venous line or positive pressure ventilation. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of pneumothorax and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pneumothorax.
- Review the presentation of a patient with a pneumothorax.
- Summarize the treatment options for pneumothorax.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by pneumothorax.
