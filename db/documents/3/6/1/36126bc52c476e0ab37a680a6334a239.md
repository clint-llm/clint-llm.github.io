The provider should evaluate the patient for underlying comorbidities, as parasomnias can commonly present as sequelae; i.e., the onset of first-episode sleepwalking in adults should prompt the investigation of nocturnal seizures, breathing-related sleep disorder, and medication profiles.

Traits of variant parasomnias can overlap with one another, thus producing some difficulty in the demarcation between disorders. However, some features of salience can help the clinician delineate parasomnias. For instance, generally, during NREM sleep disorders, the patient's eyes remain open, whereas, in REM sleep disorders, they remain closed.
