Most tumors are sporadic, but one-third of cases may beÂ associated with Beckwith-Weidemann, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Edward syndrome (trisomy 18), nephroblastoma, and Down syndrome.

The most common genetic mutation involves the Wnt signaling pathway which results in the accumulation of beta-catenin; these mutations are present in a higher proportion of the sporadic cases.
