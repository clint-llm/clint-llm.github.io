Health care workers have serious concerns about exposure to bodily fluids. Accidental exposures to bodily fluids present a wide variety of issues to healthcare workers. These issues include transmission of communicable diseases such as human immune deficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). These exposures have led to a significant public health hazard since they have become a known occupational hazard in 1978. Among healthcare workers, nursing staff/students seem to have the highest rate of exposures at 45%, and providers come next at 17%. Further dividing the provider group, surgeons were the most likely to be at risk of being exposed.
