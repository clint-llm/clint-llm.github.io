Patients who present with CNS bleeding are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, neurosurgeon, radiologist, intensivist, neurosurgery nurses, physical therapist, pulmonologist, and other allied health specialists like speech, occupational and physical therapists. Many of these patients need admission to the ICU and the care depends on the degree of physical and other neurological deficits. The outcomes depend on the type and extent of bleed, age, other comorbidities, and severity of neurological deficit at the time of admission.
