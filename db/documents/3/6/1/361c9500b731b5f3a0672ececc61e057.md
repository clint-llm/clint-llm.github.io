Posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD) represents an acquired, progressive disease of the foot and ankle that is seen commonly in middle-aged patients. It is the most common cause of adult acquired flatfoot deformity. Treatments involve conservative and surgical options depending on the severity of the disease. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of PTTD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction.
- Describe the physical exam findings associated with posterior tibial tendon dysfunction.
- Identify treatment and management options available for all stages of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of posterior tibial tendon dysfunction and improve patient outcomes.
