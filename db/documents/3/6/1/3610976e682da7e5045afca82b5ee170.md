A query of the National Health Interview Survey in 2016 reported 1 in 5 adults in the United States have chronic pain

About 20% of patients with CNCP who visit physicians’ offices receive an opioid prescription. Even though the efficacy of opioids in the treatment of pain for an acute or short period works, the use of opioids for long-term treatment of CNCP does not show a positive effect or improvement in the quality of life for patients. In 2005, based on data from the United States health system, an estimated 9.6 to 11.5 million adults (3% to 4%) of U.S. adults were prescribed opioids for long-term therapy.[8]

Using opioids for long-term therapy has risks of dependency and overdose. From 1999 through 2014, there were more than 165,000 deaths due to opioid pain medication overdose in the United States In 2011, the Drug Abuse Warning Network estimated that the misuse or abuse of narcotic pain medications caused more than 420,000 emergency department visits.
