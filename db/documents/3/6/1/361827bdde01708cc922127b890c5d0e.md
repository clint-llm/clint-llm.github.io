This condition is primarily a degenerative process. Aside from degenerative changes, histological findings include granulation tissue, micro-tears, collagen disarray, and notably a lack of traditional inflammation. Ultrasound evaluation often reveals calcifications, intrasubstance tears, and thickening and heterogeneity of the plantar fascia. These changes, often seen on ultrasound, suggest a non-inflammatory condition and dysfunctional vasculature.

It is believed that the condition starts with microtears due to the repetitive stress associated with standing upright and weight bearing. The constant stretching of the plantar fascia results in chronic degeneration of the fasica, eventually leading to pain during sleep or at rest.
