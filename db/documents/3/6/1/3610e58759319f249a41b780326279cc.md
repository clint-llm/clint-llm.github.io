Esmolol (esmolol hydrochloride) is an intravenous cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic antagonist.

- Esmolol is FDA-approved for short-term use in controlling supraventricular tachycardia, such as a rapid ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. It is also a useful emergency drug for focal atrial tachycardia, especially in patients with active bronchospasm.

- Esmolol has also been reported to be a safe and effective drug for perioperative blood pressure control, owing to its short half-life.

- It is also indicated in sinus tachycardia, where a rapid rate requires emergent intervention, especially in acute coronary syndrome.

- Esmolol is also recommended for treating tachyarrhythmia in critically ill patients and hypertension induced by intubation.

- Off-labeled, it is used in aortic dissection, acute coronary syndrome, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, hypertensive emergencies, thyrotoxicosis, refractory ventricular tachycardia, refractory to defibrillation ventricular fibrillation.

- It is also used to decrease catecholamine response during electroconvulsive therapy.

- According to a recent study, esmolol may improve survival for patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation (RVF) in prehospital settings.

- According to 2019 AHA/ACC/HRS (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/ Heart Rhythm Society) guidelines, intravenous beta-blockers such as esmolol are recommended to slow a rapid ventricular response in patients with AF who do not have heart failure, hemodynamic instability, or bronchospasm.
