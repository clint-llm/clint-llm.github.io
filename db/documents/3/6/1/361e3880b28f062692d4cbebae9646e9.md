Infants with nasolacrimal duct obstruction initially present to the pediatrician, nurse practitioner or the primary care provider. It is important to refer these patients to an ophthalmologist for further workup because there are many causes. The ophthalmic nurse should educate the caregiver on home care management; the primary treatment of uncomplicated nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a regimen of nasolacrimal massage, usually 2  to 3 times per day, accompanied by a cleansing of the lids with warm water and topical antibiotics; this will resolve the infection in 76% to 89% of cases. When the conservative methods fail to relieve the obstruction, some type of surgery procedure is performed to relieve the blockage. The advantages of early probing in the office setting are avoidance of general anesthesia, speedy resolution of symptoms, fewer physician visits, fewer antibiotic prescriptions, and less costly procedures.
