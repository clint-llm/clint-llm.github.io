Histopathology evaluation is rarely needed in the diagnosis and management of chalazia. If obtained, histologic examination reveals a chronic granulomatous reaction with numerous lipid-filled, Touton-type giant cells. Typically, the nuclei of these cells are located around a central foamy cytoplasmic area that contains the ingested lipid material. Mononuclear cells, including lymphocytes or macrophages, may also be found at the periphery of the lesion as this is an inflammatory process. If a secondary bacterial infection develops, then one could expect to find an acute necrotic reaction with PMNs.
