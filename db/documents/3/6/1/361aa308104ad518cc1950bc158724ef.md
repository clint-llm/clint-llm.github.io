In the United States, a 2013 report documented 1300 single mercury exposures, and only 24 had moderate to major effects. However, internationally, there are much higher rates of exposure, including mercury mining in China, small-scale gold mining, and food contaminated with mercury. Two major toxic incidents occurred in Minamata Bay, Japan, and Iraq. Mercury was dumped into Minamata Bay, and members of the community developed toxicity from eating the fish containing methylmercury. In Iraq, over 6000 people developed toxicity from eating bread baked with grain that was treated with methylmercury-based fungicide.

Children and fetuses have a higher susceptibility to mercury toxicity and, therefore, more severe clinical manifestations. The primary source of dietary ingestion is the consumption of contaminated fish. Since the fetal brain is more susceptible to toxicity, the FDA recommends pregnant or breastfeeding women, as well as children, avoid fish with high mercury content. These fish include shark, king mackerel, tilefish, swordfish, and tuna. Freshwater fish, including pike, walleye, muskellunge, and bass, should be eaten in moderation.
