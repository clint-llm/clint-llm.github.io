Minocycline is a semi-synthetic second-generation tetracycline antibiotic. Synthesized in 1967, it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in the management and treatment of many infectious and non-infectious diseases, with similar anti-infectious activity to that of other tetracyclines. Aside from anti-infectious activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, it also has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects. It is known to be the most effective tetracycline derivative at providing neuroprotective effects, as it is a highly lipophilic molecule that can cross the blood-brain barrier.

Susceptibility to tetracycline is typically predictive of susceptibility to minocycline.Borrelia recurrentis, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, Vibrio vulnificus, and susceptible strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). Minocycline is also used toÂ treat rickettsial infections, chlamydial infections, syphilis, pelvic inflammatory disease, acne, nocardiosis, brucellosis, ehrlichiosis, amebiasis, actinomycosis, anaplasmosis, leptospirosis, melioidosis, tularemia, traveler's diarrhea, Lyme disease (early stage), Legionnaire disease, and Whipple disease.

Nonantibiotic indications for minocycline include rosacea, bullous dermatoses, neutrophilic diseases, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, aortic aneurysms, cancer metastasis, periodontitis, as well as autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
