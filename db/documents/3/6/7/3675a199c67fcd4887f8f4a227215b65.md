Primary spontaneous pneumothorax mainly occurs at 20-30 years of age. The incidence ofÂ PSP in the United States is 7 per 100,000 men and 1 per 100,000 women per year

Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is seen more in old-age patients 60-65 years. The incidence of SSP is 6.3 and 2 cases for men and women per 100,000 patients, respectively. The male-to-female ratio is 3:1. COPD has an incidence of 26 pneumothoraces per 100,000 patients.

The leading cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax is transthoracic needle aspiration (usually for biopsies), and the second leading cause is central venous catheterization. These occur more frequently than spontaneous pneumothorax, and their number increases as intensive care modalities advance. The incidence of iatrogenic pneumothorax is 5 per 10,000 admissions in the hospital.

The incidence of tension pneumothorax is challenging to determine as one-third of cases in trauma centers have decompressive needle thoracostomies before reaching the hospital, and not all of these had tension pneumothorax.

Pneumomediastinum has an incidence of 1 case per 10,000 admissions in the hospital.
