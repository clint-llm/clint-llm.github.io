When cells die of necrosis, they exhibit different microscopic and macroscopic appearances.

1) Coagulative necrosis: Ischemia in most organs except the brain can lead to coagulative necrosis. In this type of necrosis, **the cell architecture remains preserved**. Under the microscope, the cells appear anucleate, eosinophilic, with preserved structure. Eventually, the dead cells are cleared by phagocytosis and leukocytes.

2) Liquefactive necrosis: This morphology is most commonly observed in the central nervous system.

3) Caseous necrosis: The term caseous means "cheese-like," which refers to the whitish appearance of the necrotic area. This necrosis takes place in tuberculous infection, and the necrotic area is referred to as a granuloma.

4) Gangrenous necrosis: This is not a morphological pattern but rather a clinical term for ischemic necrosis of the limbs. It has two types i) dry (ischemia leading to coagulative necrosis), and ii) wet (ischemia with superimposed bacterial infection leading to liquefactive necrosis).

5) Fat necrosis: This type of necrosis occurs in acute pancreatitis. The release of pancreatic enzymes leads to liquefaction of the fat cells in the peritoneal cavity. These liquified fat cells then combine with calcium and are identified as chalky white areas. This process is referred to as saponification. Under a microscope, this is visible as basophilic calcium deposits on the outlines of the necrotic fat cells. Fat necrosis also occurs in breast tissue due to fat saponification.

6) Fibrinoid necrosis: This type of necrosis occurs in blood vessels due to the deposition of immune complexes in blood vessel walls leading to leakage of fibrin. This observed staining appears as a bright pink amorphous material.
