One advantage of most bacteriostatic antimicrobials, as a class, is that they usually do not require intensive monitoring as other classes of bactericidal drugs. Tetracycline antimicrobials do not typically require monitoring of blood drug concentrations, nor do they have an easily identifiable metabolite to monitor their activityÂ in vivo.in vivo. However, if patients are taking other agents with macrolides, corresponding concentrations of other drugs should be monitored for alterations in their activity.
