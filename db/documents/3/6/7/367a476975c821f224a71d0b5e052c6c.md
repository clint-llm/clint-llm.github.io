Cisatracurium is contraindicated if there is a known hypersensitivity. Caution is advisable in patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic syndrome, as a profound effect may occur.

Severe anaphylactic reactions to NMBDs, including cisatracurium, have been reported. Precautions are also advisable in those patients with a history of prior anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents as there are reports of cross-reactivity in the neuromuscular blocking agent drug class, with both depolarizing and non-depolarizing agents.

Cisatracurium should be kept refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and protected from light to preserve potency. The rate of loss of potency is as high as 5% per month at 25 degrees Celsius. Once removed from refrigeration to room temperature storage, it should be used within 21 days.
