Hyperplasia of the wall of the gallbladder is seen with characteristic Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. Another finding is the presence of calculi and cholesterol crystals form within the sinuses. The cause of hyperplasia and sinus formation is unknown, although reactive changes to chronic inflammation have been proposed. The hypothesis of chronic inflammation as the underlying cause of adenomyomatosis is supported by the fact that patients are most frequently diagnosed in their 50s.
