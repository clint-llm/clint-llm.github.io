Systolic hypertension is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Because it is a major risk factor for adverse cardiac events, the condition must be appropriately managed. The nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, cardiologist, and emergency room provider must be aware of the latest ACC guidelines on the management of hypertension. Because of the numerous drugs available to treat hypertension, a consult with a cardiologist is highly recommended if there is any doubt about the efficacy of the drug. There is ample evidence showing that when systolic hypertension is well treated, the patients have good outcomes with an interprofessional approach to care.
