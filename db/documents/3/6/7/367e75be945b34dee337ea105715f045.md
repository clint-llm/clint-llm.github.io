For chemotherapy drug administration and monitoring, the role of nursing and pharmacy is very crucial. All healthcare providers need to collaborate as an interprofessional team to ensure optimal care and minimal adverse effects with any drug therapy, even more so with a chemotherapeutic agent like ifosfamide. Nursing is helpful in closely monitoring the patient during and after drug administration, identifying adverse reactions, and reporting them immediately. Oncology nurses have specialized training in the administration of chemotherapy. The role of pharmacists is crucial as they help formulate the dosing and monitor them for potential toxicity. Nursing and pharmacists can provide patient counseling about the drug, including what to expect following administration and as the cycles progress. For better outcomes, the plan requires detailed discussion among all the members involved in patient care like nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and family to lower mortality and morbidity. [Level 5]
