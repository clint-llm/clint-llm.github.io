Evaluation of a patient for participation in sporting activities has a traditional role in ensuring their health before enduring the effects and stresses of that particular sport. This form of patient evaluation has been used by both professional as well as amateur athletes, hence having a variable level of comprehensiveness. Many sports associations and leagues require a health exam, documentation, and paperwork from health care providers to certify that the subjects are healthy and ready for their sport of choice. Patients will undergo an assessment that includes personal medical history, family medical history, history of supplemental or enhancer drug use, a physical examination, and potential diagnostic tests. This activity reviews the fundamental components of a medical evaluation by the interprofessional team for an athlete and how these evaluations can be optimized to ensure that patients are medically safe, to a certain degree, for their choice of sporting activity.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the history that should be evaluated in a prospective athlete.
- Identify the physical exam features in a prospective athlete that would prohibit sports participation.
- Review the indications for various diagnostic tests that should be considered in a prospective athlete.
- Outline how the interprofessional team can work together to screen and educate patients on safe sports participation.
