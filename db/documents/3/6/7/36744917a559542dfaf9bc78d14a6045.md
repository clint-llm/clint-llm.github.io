Cultures of A. haemolyticum can be detected as a part of normal skin flora and pharynx of healthy individuals. This causes difficulty in the early detection of the pathogen since the organism is often overlooked as the cause of symptoms during an infection. In symptomatic patients, A. haemolyticum has been cultured as the sole pathogen or as a part of a polymicrobial infection.

There are two biotypes of A. haemolyticum: smooth and rough. In the smooth-type form, even colonies on a growth medium are beta-hemolytic, beta-glucuronidase negative, and ferment sucrose and trehalose. Smooth-type colonies are more commonly associated with soft-tissue infections. The rough-type form uneven colonies on a growth medium, are non-hemolytic, beta-glucuronidase positive, and do not ferment sucrose and trehalose. Rough-type colonies are more commonly associated with pharyngitis.
