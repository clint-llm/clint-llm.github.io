It has been well established that American Indians and Alaska Natives are disproportionately affected by different health conditions, including many mental health disorders compared to other ethnic and racial groups. The health disparities among this population group may in part be explained by the numerous sociodemographic and socioeconomic differences, including lower educational achievement, income, and health status.

It is important for clinicians and public health officials to recognize these demographic and socioeconomic determinants of health inequalities and prioritize further research and efforts towards combating these disparities. Besides, it is also important to realize that there are cultural issues and other risk factors that may contribute to the high prevalence of mental health disorders among AI/ANs. The National Institute of Health (NIH) has taken the initiative to provide funding towards promoting health and disease prevention in Native Americans, including American Indians and Alaska Natives. Through this funding opportunity, multiple projects to improve health outcomes in this population group have been launched.

Continued research relevant to the surveillance, prevention, and treatment of mental health disorders is necessary so that there may be further development of culturally appropriate interventions, and ultimately a reduction in the existing health disparities.
