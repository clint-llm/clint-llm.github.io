Lactose intolerance is a common disease; however, it is rare in children younger than 5. It is most often seen in adolescents and young adults. On average, 65% of the world's population is lactose intolerant.

The primary form is the commonest (found in up to 70% of the world's population, but not all of them are symptomatic).

In the US, the primary disease is much more common in certain ethnicities, such as African-Americans, American Indians, Hispanics or Latinos, and Asian-Americans, than in White Americans.

The age-related decline in lactase activity is generally complete during childhood; however, the decline has also been seen to occur later, in adolescence, particularly in Whites.

The onset of the disease is generally subtle and progressive in primary illness, and many patients first experience symptoms of intolerance in late adolescence and adulthood.

The sexes are affected equally.
