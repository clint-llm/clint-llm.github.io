Forming a four-chambered heart involves coordination and organized fusion of several mesenchymal tissues. Mesenchymal tissue deposition on these endocardial cushions aids in the process of fusion, which in turn leads to the separation of the common AV canal. AV canal has superior and inferior endocardial cushions that fuse around 4 to 5 weeks of gestation. The failure of fusion of this endocardial cushion at various levels leads to septal defects ranging from partial to complete defects.

The AV canal defects can primarily be classified into complete vs. partial defects based on the anatomical abnormalities.

- Complete: Complete failure of fusion of endocardial cushions leading to single AV valve, ostium primum septal defect, variable deficiency of IVS.

- Partial (intermediate/transitional): Incomplete fusion causing mitral valve abnormalities, usually a cleft in the anterior leaflet leading to MV regurgitation.

Further down, the complete AV canal defect may further be classified based on the AV valve morphology (Rastelli classification). The Rastelli classification is based on the insertion of the chordae and the morphology of the superior bridging leaflet.

- Type A: This is the most common type associated with Down syndrome. The superior bridging leaflets by means of chordal attachments are inserted onto the left ventricle.

- Type B: This is the least common. The superior bridging leaflets by means of chordal insertion are extended onto the body of the right ventricle.

- Type C: This is associated with the tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), transposition of great arteries (TGA), etc.
