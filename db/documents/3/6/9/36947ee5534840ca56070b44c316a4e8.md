The masseteric nerve innervates the masseter muscle. The masseteric nerve is a branch of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V).  The trigeminal nerve carries both sensory and motor fibers. Sensory fibers travel along the trigeminal nerve, enter the trigeminal ganglion and travel to their final destinations via V1 (ophthalmic), V2 (maxillary) and V3 (mandibular) divisions. The motor fibers of the trigeminal nerve do not synapse within the trigeminal ganglion, but rather bypass the trigeminal ganglion via the portio minor, a small branch of the trigeminal nerve which passes inferior to the trigeminal ganglion and through the foramen ovale, where it then rejoins the mandibular nerve. The mandibular nerve (V3) splits into anterior and posterior trunks, with the anterior portion supplying motor innervation to the muscles of mastication, and sensory innervation to the buccal (cheek) area. The masseteric nerve branches off of the mandibular nerve and crosses over the mandibular notch with the masseteric artery to the deep portion of the masseter muscle where it supplies motor innervation.
