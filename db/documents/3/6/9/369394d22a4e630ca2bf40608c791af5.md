Osteopathic manipulative treatment is a form of hands-on therapy that, in the appropriate setting, can help to enhance patient-centered care and improve outcomes. HVLA is a specific treatment modality that is more suited for the younger population. Some of the contraindications mentioned previously occur more in the elderly population, thus not allowing them to receive HVLA treatment. It is crucial to weigh the risks and benefits of HVLA treatment in these patients before attempting this type of maneuver. Other, less forceful techniques such as counter strain, kneading and stretching, muscle energy, or articulatory techniques should merit consideration before HVLA.

Regardless of treatment modality, osteopathic manipulative treatment serves as a mannerÂ by which to reduce the number of pain medications a patient is taking.
