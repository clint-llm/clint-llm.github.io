History in a patient with secondary amenorrhea should include a full menstrual history. It is important to ascertain what birth control method the patient is using, as the progestin-containing birth control methods (including combined oral contraceptive pills) suppress the growth of the endometrium and may lead to secondary amenorrhea. The pattern of menses is also important - does the patient have a long history of infrequent and irregular periods (suggesting anovulation), or was the amenorrhea abrupt? Were there any inciting events before the onset of secondary amenorrhea, such as childbirth, surgery, trauma, pelvic infection, or D and C? Patients should be asked about headaches, vision changes, and galactorrhea to assess for hyperprolactinemia from pituitary prolactinoma. Thyroid symptoms should also be evaluated (fatigue, weight changes, skin/hair/nail changes, palpitations, tachycardia). Hirsutism and acne suggest PCOS, so patients should be asked about unwanted hair growth and acne. Patients should be asked about stressors and exercise routines, as excessive stress or exercise may lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Physical examination should include calculation of body mass index (BMI), as well as assessment of acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, acne, and virilization.
