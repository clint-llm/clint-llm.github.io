The multi-modal approach consisting of hematologic and serologic testing, imaging, electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and biopsy findings is used to evaluate a patient with suspected polymyositis. A complete blood count (CBC) can show an elevated lymphocyte count in the majority of the patients and frequently thrombocytosis as well. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be elevated due to chronic inflammation. Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels can be as high as up to 50 times the normal range (22 to 198 units/liter), indicating myocyte damage due to chronic inflammation. It can be of great clinical use to monitor disease progression by having serial examinations and CK monitoring.

Multiple antibodies can be elevated in polymyositis, such as a non-specific antinuclear antibody (ANA), which can be positive in around 33 percent of the patients with polymyositis. If ANA turns out to be positive, then specific antibody testing is done to confirm PM, which is the anti-signal recognition particle (SRP) in the serum. The presence of anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) antibodies can show the association of PM with an autoimmune syndrome know as the anti-synthetase syndrome. This is characterized by a group of varying physical presenting features such as inflammation-induced myopathy, joint pain, Raynaud's phenomenon, and fibrotic lung disease.

Almost all the patients with PM will have abnormal electromyography (EMG) findings such as varying amplitude and velocity of the membranous action potential, and fibrillation in potentials due to membrane irritability, etc. A vital investigation to make a definitive diagnosis of myopathy is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or EMG guided biopsy that shows perivascular and endomysial mononuclear infiltrates (cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages) and areas of necrosis staining pink due to high eosin stain binding.

Imaging studies such as MRI, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasonography can be useful to locate an area of muscle damage and also to diagnose underlying malignancy. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging is of utmost significance to exactly diagnose the damaged muscular area.

If the patient presents with dysphagia, a barium swallow can be performed. In the case of lung disease, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) can be done. If PM has caused damage to cardiomyocytes, then an electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiography can be performed.
