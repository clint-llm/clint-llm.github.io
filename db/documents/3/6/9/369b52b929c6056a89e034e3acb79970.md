**Patient Counseling**

In cosmetic procedures, understanding patient’s views, goals, and expectations are of utmost importance. Let the patient sit comfortably in front of you, give them a mirror, and ask them about things they are most concerned about or what changes they want/expect out of the surgery. The patient should be thoroughly counseled regarding all the options available to them and what they can expect out of each procedure, as well as the risks and potential complications. Once a shared plan is agreed upon, the procedure can be scheduled. Photographs should be taken for documentation.

**Preoperative Assessment**

- Lower lid position - The position of the lower lid in the primary gaze is assessed at the limbus. Slight variations depending on the size of the eyeball or race are seen. Any cause of lid retraction such as prior surgery, thyroid orbitopathy, cicatricial skin diseases like pemphigus, Steven-Johnson syndrome, chemical burn, etc., must be explored in great detail. Any preexisting lid asymmetry should be explicitly pointed out to the patient and documented in photographs.

- Lower lid margin - Look for any active blepharitis or meibomian gland dysfunction.

- Snap-back test - Pull the lid inferiorly. Normal lids snap back to the original position immediately; the longer it takes to snap back, the more laxity is present. This should be incorporated into the surgical plan.

- Distraction test - Distract the lower lid forward using thumb and index finger. Any distraction more than 2 mm from the globe is considered abnormal.

- Lateral canthus laxity - Pull the lower lid medially away from lateral canthus. Normal displacement can be 0 to 2 mm; the greater the displacement of lateral canthus more laxity of the canthal tendons is present.

- Preoperative grades of the lower lid (based on both snap-back and distraction test) before performing lower blepharoplasty who require ‘tightening/anchoring procedure’
- Grade +1 (Mild): Snap-back test - 1-2 seconds; Distraction test - 2-4 mm
- Grade +2 (Moderate): Snap-back test - 2-4 seconds; Distraction test - 4-6 mm
- Grade +3 (Severe): Snap-back test - next blink; Distraction test - greater than 6 mm

- Medial canthal laxity, punctal version, or punctal patency should be checked.

- Lower lid fat pads medial, central, and lateral should be assessed. The presence of the tear trough and lid-cheek junction is noted.

- The relation of the center of the cornea to the most prominent part on the cheek should be assessed. Normally they lie at the same level. Any recession of the cheek or negative malar vector may cause lid retraction after any blepharoplasty.

- Skin changes like thinning, the position of wrinkles, crow feet, pigmentation, festoons, etc., are also noted in eyelids and surrounding skin. Redundancy of skin assessed by a pinch test.

**Preoperative Investigation**

Systemic investigations can include the measurement of blood pressure, blood sugar levels, electrocardiogram, thyroid profile (if required). Patients on anticoagulant therapy should stop them for 1 to 2 weeks.

**Patient Preparation**

Local antiseptic solution (povidone-iodine ophthalmic paint) is used to clean the area to be operated. Skin markings are made using a marker pen and always in an upright, sitting position. The prominent fat pads and their margins should be marked along with the nasojugal and malar groove. Intravenous sedation is to be given (if planned, or general anesthesia, if planned). Local anesthesia (1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine) is infiltrated in the marked area. An infraorbital nerve block can also be performed. The lateral orbital rim area can also be infiltrated if lateral canthal tightening procedure is to be performed, and topical ophthalmic tetracaine drops can be used to anesthetize the cornea and conjunctiva.
