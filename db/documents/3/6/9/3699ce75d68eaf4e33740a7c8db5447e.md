Vertebral compression fractures of the spinal column occur secondary to an axial/compressive load with resultant biomechanical failure of the bone, resulting in a fracture. Vertebral compression fractures by definition compromise the anterior column of the spine, thereby resulting in compromise to the anterior half of the vertebral body and the anterior longitudinal ligament. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of vertebral compression fractures and underscores the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with vertebral compression fractures.
- Review the pathophysiology of vertebral compression fractures.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with vertebral compression fractures.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with vertebral compression fractures.
