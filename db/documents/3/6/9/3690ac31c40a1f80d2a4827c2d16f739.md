Sydenham chorea (SD), also referred to as St. Vitus dance, is caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections and is a manifestation of rheumatic fever (RF) that occurs in up to 40 percent of patients with RF. Anti-basal ganglia antibodies develop and attack portions of the brain, leading to pathologic findings and symptoms. SD is much less common today than it was in the past. When it does occur, however, the symptoms are typically less severe and the relapses less frequent. This activity reviews the causes and presentation of Sydenham chorea and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of Sydenham chorea.
- Describe the presentation of Sydenham chorea.
- Summarize the treatment options for Sydenham chorea.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by syndenham chorea.
