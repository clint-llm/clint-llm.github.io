The challenging aspect of tubulointerstitial nephritis is the nonspecific and highly variable clinical presentation that delays the diagnosis and treatment, eventually worsening the outcome. History of onset and duration, age of the patients, and drug intake are of utmost importance while assessing for TIN. The classical presentation of drug-induced hypersensitivity in a study series showed fever (27%), rash (15%), and eosinophilia (23%). The classic triad of fever, rash, and eosinophilia is found in only 10% of cases. Even the symptoms may vary in different classes of medications. However, some studies suggest that allergic features dominate the clinical presentations in drug-induced TIN.

In a retrospective study, acute kidney injury due to medications initially presented without oliguria, but as the disease worsened and progressed, oliguria was seen in 51% and arthralgia in 45%.

On physical examination, skin rashes in the form of morbilliform, maculopapular, erythroderma, and epidermal necrolysis are seen. These rashes are highly variable extrarenal manifestations more common in agents that cause hypersensitive reactions, such as penicillins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, and allopurinol. The kidney is palpable occasionally in severe cases when markedly enlarged. Flank pain and tenderness due to capsular distension by inflammation and edema are likely in those taking rifampicin.
