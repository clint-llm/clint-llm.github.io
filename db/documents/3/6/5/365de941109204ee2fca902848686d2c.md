Polishing can only remove extrinsic stains. They can be caused by various dietary and environmental factors, like tobacco smoking, betel quid chewing, coffee, tea, and wine drinking.

Furcation areas, root proximities, near restorations, orthodontic brackets, among others, can be polished using different types of devices suited to individual needs.
