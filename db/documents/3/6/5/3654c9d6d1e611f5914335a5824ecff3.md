Duret hemorrhages are attributed to descending transtentorial herniation from any cause. It can be challenging to distinguish Duret hemorrhages from primary brainstem hemorrhages. Traditionally, the presence of Duret hemorrhages is associated with grave prognosis, often leading to the withdrawal of care. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, etiologies, radiological appearance of Duret hemorrhages along with the prognosis in such patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and mechanism of Duret hemorrhages.
- Describe the radiological appearance of Duret hemorrhages.
- Summarize some of the reported cases with Duret hemorrhages that are associated with good outcomes.
- Enhance the knowledge among the interprofessional team to help improve outcomes in patients with Duret Hemorrhages.
