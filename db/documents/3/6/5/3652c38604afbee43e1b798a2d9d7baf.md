Carcinoma is the most common cause of secondary bone cancer. Many bone metastases originate from disseminated breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Although, increasingly renal cell and thyroid cancer can metastasize to bone. Carcinomas are of epithelial tissue origin and go on to form the covering over solid organs and glands throughout the body. Non-epithelial cell lines produce cancers that spread to the bone. Hematologic malignancies such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma involve bone. Similarly, mesenchymal tumors such as sarcomas, can exhibit late metastases to the bone as well.
