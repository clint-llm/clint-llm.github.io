Treatment for HE involves proper identification and treatment of the underlying cause.  Antibiotics (e.g., rifaximin, neomycin/paromomycin/metronidazole, or vancomycin) are often given empirically due to the frequency of infection as an underlying cause.  Additional treatment measures include lactulose/lactitol (a non-absorbable osmotic laxative that also helps convert ammonia to non-absorbable ammonium in the gastrointestinal tract), LOLA (L-ornithine and L-aspartate preparation - increases the use of ammonia in the urea cycle to produce urea), zinc (to correct underlying deficiency common in cirrhotic patients) either alone or in combination with each other and/or antibiotics.

Patients at risk for aspiration or respiratory compromise should be prophylactically intubated and monitored in the ICU.  In the case of patients with concomitant alcohol withdrawal, medications that depress the central nervous system (e.g., benzodiazepines) should be avoided.
