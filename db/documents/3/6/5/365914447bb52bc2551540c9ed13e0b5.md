The vast majority of patients do not have anatomically difficult airways. However, in the emergency setting and particularly in the prehospital environment, even patients whose airways are physically normal may still present with “physiologically difficult” airways due to inadequate preoxygenation and serious intercurrent illness or “situationally difficult” airways due to lack of skilled assistance, time pressures, poor patient positioning or other adverse conditions.
