**Parathyroid Hormone**

The function of parathyroid hormone is to increase serum calcium levels as part of the calcium homeostasis mechanism. To accomplish this, it performs three principal activities. First, it increases the rate of bone resorption, which releases calcium and phosphate into the serum. Secondly, it decreases urinary calcium excretion by increasing its reabsorption in the distal convoluted renal tubule and thick, ascending loop of Henle. Finally, it activates 1-α-hydroxylase in the renal proximal tubule, which converts relatively inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This active vitamin D then increases gastrointestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.

Parathyroid hormone also increases urinary phosphate excretion, which explains why patients with hyperparathyroidism are hypophosphatemic despite increased gastrointestinal phosphate absorption and higher bone resorption rates.

Parathyroid glands are made up of two cell types:

- Chief cells are the most common and produce parathyroid hormone. They have a very prominent Golgi apparatus and a very developed endoplasmic reticulum.

- Oxyphil cells are larger, but their exact function is unclear. It is thought they may have additional endocrine functions or may be supportive of chief cell activity.

Secretion of parathyroid hormone is inversely related to the ionized calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G-protein coupled receptor whose activity varies with changes in serum calcium. As the calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid increases, this receptor is activated, and parathyroid chief cells decrease their production and secretion of parathyroid hormone. Conversely, the activity of the CaSR decreases, and parathyroid hormone secretion increases as serum calcium levels decline.

Parathyroid hormone activates PTH receptors increasing the resorption of calcium and phosphate from bone, enhancing the distal tubular reabsorption of calcium, and decreasing the renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus which increases urinary phosphate excretion. Furthermore, parathyroid hormone plays an essential role in vitamin D metabolism, activating the vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase, which increases the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

**Renal failure**elevates serum parathyroid hormone levels. This becomes clinically significant as the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 ml/min.

Hyperphosphatemia develops due to the inability of the kidneys to excrete phosphate (while hypophosphatemia is seen in classic primary hyperparathyroidism). Band keratopathy, from corneal calcium phosphate crystal deposition, has been reported in dialysis patients but is rarely visible without a slit lamp examination; even then, it is quite uncommon.

Treatment includes a low phosphorus diet, oral phosphate binders, vitamin D supplements, calcimimetic agents, parathyroid surgery (total parathyroidectomy with or without auto-transplantation, and subtotal parathyroidectomy).

**Normal Calcium Homeostasis**

Under physiologic circumstances, calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid is maintained within a very narrow range. Normal calcium homeostasis is dependent upon a complex set of hormonal regulatory mechanisms that include the effects of parathyroid hormone, vitamin D metabolites, and calcitonin on calcium transport in the bones, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract.

Only about ten to twenty percent of ingested calcium is ultimately absorbed in the small intestine; the rest is excreted untouched.

Approximately 50% of total serum calcium is protein-bound, principally to albumin. Forty-five percent is ionized, while a small proportion forms complexes with anions such as phosphate and citrate. Only the ionized calcium is biologically active, yet most laboratories routinely report total serum calcium levels. Measurements of ionized calcium are available when requested. An approximate correction of serum calcium can be made by adjusting for differences in the serum albumin level.

Corrected calcium = Measured calcium + 0.8 x (4.0 - albumin).

Caution is necessary when evaluating normal total serum calcium levels in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Such patients may have elevated ionized calcium levels and are truly hypercalcemic. Conversely, the ionized calcium is often normal when there is a low total calcium concentration in the presence of hypoalbuminemia.
