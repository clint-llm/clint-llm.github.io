The differential diagnoses of Alport syndrome include the following:

- Immunoglobulin A nephropathy

- Thin GBM disease

- Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

- Medullary cystic disease

- Multicystic renal dysplasia

- Polycystic kidney disease

The most important diagnostic consideration in patients with Alport syndrome is thin basement membrane (TBM) disease, a collagen 4-related nephropathy closely related to Alport syndrome. The same genes appear to be involved in many individuals with the disorder. Unlike those with Alport syndrome, few extra-renal findings are present, symptoms are less severe, with progression to renal impairment is rarely found. Differentiating these disease processes is challenging, particularly in younger or female patients who are less likely to have other associated symptoms.
