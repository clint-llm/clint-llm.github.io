There are relatively few absolute contraindications. Most notably, individuals who have genetic contraindications, such as those that carry gene variations for malignant hyperthermia, should avoid anesthetic gases. Relative contraindications are patients with severe hypovolemia and those with severe intracranial hypertension as anesthetic gases might further decrease cerebral perfusion.

Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients undergoing craniotomies, bowel surgery, intraocular and middle ear surgeries. Nitrous oxide is thirty times more soluble than nitrogen. This leads to the rapid removal of nitrogen in these closed spaces. Nitrous oxide will quickly diffuse into these closed spaces leading to increased pressure/volume in the brain, bowel, eye, and middle ear. In addition, patients with pneumothorax or pulmonary hypertension can have worsening of the pneumothorax and increases in pulmonary hypertension related to the use of nitrous oxide.
