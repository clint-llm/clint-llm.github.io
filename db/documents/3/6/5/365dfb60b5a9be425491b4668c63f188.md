Medial epicondyle apophysitis (MEA), also known as little league elbow, is an overuse injury prevalent among adolescent athletes whose sport involves repetitive overhand throwing, racket use, or other overhead arm motions. The medial epicondyle is a bony protrusion on the medial elbow with its own ossification center, separate from the main distal humeral physis, known as an apophysis. This growth center at the medial epicondyle develops around 6-7 years of age and typically fuses by age 15.

Medial epicondyle apophysitis occurs due to excessive and repetitive valgus stress placed on the apophysis before its closure. Over time, the repetitive strain results in a traction-type injury and may cause pathologic widening and inflammation of the apophysis or even an avulsion fracture.
