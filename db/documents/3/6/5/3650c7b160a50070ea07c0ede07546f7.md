Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit. When onychomycosis is caused by dermatophytes, it is called tinea unguium. The term onychomycosis encompasses not only the dermatophytes but the yeasts and saprophytic molds infections as well. An abnormal nail that is not caused by a fungal infection is a type of dystrophic nail. Onychomycosis can infect both fingernails and toenails, but onychomycosis of the toenail is much more prevalent. The disease burden, clinical types, staging, diagnosis, and management of toenail onychomycosis will be discussed.
