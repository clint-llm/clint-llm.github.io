Developmental dysplasia of the hip management requires early identification from pediatricians, family physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and appropriate use of technology ultrasound vs. x-ray and referral to a specialist. American Academy of Pediatrics,  American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, and the Canadian Task Force provide clear guidelines for identifying and managing DDH.

The treatment depends on the age of the patient and the degree of dysplasia. Minor hip instability (Barlow positive, Ortalani negative) spontaneously recovers in 90% of cases in the first two weeks of life.

Without early treatment, the child may develop limp, leg length discrepancy, limited hip abduction, and in fact, DDH is the most common cause of early osteoarthritis in women under age 40.

Screening and identifying DDH before six months of age should be the goal to prevent long term complications.
