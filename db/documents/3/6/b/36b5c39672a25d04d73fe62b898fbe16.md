Blue nevi have a distinct appearance but are often misdiagnosed. One less common variant, amelanocytic blue nevus, may be mimicked by dermatofibroma or scar due to lack of melanin pigment and the histologic presence of spindle cells, collagen, and/or sclerotic stroma. It also may be confused with amelanocytic melanoma. Another variant, desmoplastic blue nevus, histologically shows exaggerated dermal fibrosis and may be confused with desmoplastic melanoma.
