Patients with gas gangrene will need daily or repeated surgical debridement until the necrotizing infection is controlled, receive twice-daily hyperbaric oxygen therapy until tissue necrosis stops, and signs of tissue recovery with granulation tissue formation occur. The patient will also need ongoing intensive care and may require hemodialysis for renal failure and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Once the infection resolves, many of these patients will require further wound care, often with negative pressure wound therapy, advanced tissue regeneration techniques, and plastic surgical therapies such as skin grafting and flap procedures to close the surgical wounds. Many patients with gas gangrene required prolonged ICU stays, followed by long rehab to improve survival and restore function. Many patients will require transfer to a long-term care facility for ongoing wound care, sometimes hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and therapeutic rehab programs with physical therapy and occupational therapy.
