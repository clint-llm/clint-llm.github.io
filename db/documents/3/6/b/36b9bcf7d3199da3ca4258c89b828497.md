Patients with symptoms that recur or are refractory to treatment after four weeks, present with associated pathologic phimosis or urinary obstruction, should be referred to urology. A biopsy may be warranted to investigate etiology further.

Refractory cases may represent cancerous or precancerous lesions, including balanitis xerotica obliterans or squamous cell carcinoma.
