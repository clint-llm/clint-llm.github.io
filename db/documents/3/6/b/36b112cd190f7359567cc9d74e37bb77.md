The general management of cinchonism is discontinuing the offending drug with supportive care in the interim. For mild symptoms and a planned short course of treatment with the offending drug (5Â to 7 days), most patients can finish therapy without increased or permanent side effects related to cinchonism.

Charcoal hemoperfusion has had mixed results in the treatment of cinchonism. Early studies have shown less efficacy thought to be due to protein binding; however, small sub-studies have shown a reduction in serum quinine levels up to 125 mL/min without increased detrimental side effects.

Regarding the blindness and visual defects associated with these medications, several modalities have been studied. Originally, a vasospastic hypothesis of vision loss was decided as the primary culprit. To evaluate this, stellate ganglion blocks were performed to reduce vasospasm. However, later studies showed that the most likely culprit was optic nerve neuropathy and direct toxicity to the retina; therefore, a stellate ganglion block would not be beneficial.

In limited case studies, hyperbaric oxygen was used to reduce the significance of visual loss with good benefits and a low side effect profile. However, further studies must be performed to test the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen in the setting of cinchonism before its use.
