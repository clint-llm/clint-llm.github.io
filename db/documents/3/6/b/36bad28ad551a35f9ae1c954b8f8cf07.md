The primary tools used to diagnose conversion disorder are the history and physical exam; however, laboratory studies or imaging may be required to rule out underlying medical conditions. The studies ordered are highly dependent on the nature of the patientâ€™s symptoms and their initial presentation. For example, patients that present with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures may undergo an electroencephalogram to show a lack of true seizure activity, or they may have laboratory studies such as prolactin or creatine phosphokinase drawn to help differentiate their condition from an epileptic seizure. A vast majority of patients presenting with weakness as a primary symptom will undergo electromyography or magnetic resonance imaging tests. Studies may also be ordered for patients with possible comorbid diagnoses.
