Since the two chief indications of Jodhpur technique include repigmenting stable lesions of vitiligo, and induction of healing in CNHUs, few important aspects of the functional anatomy of these conditions should be known to the dermatosurgeons:

1) **Vitiligo Surgery**- The quintessential criteria to be fulfilled before considering a vitiligo patient as a suitable candidate for surgical intervention pertains to acceptable stability of the lesions and the disease to prevent graft failure, recurrence at recipient site as well as the appearance of vitiligo at the donor site due to Koebner's phenomenon. In the past, arbitrary clinical criteria suggested by many workers were considered to be sufficient for this qualification.

2) **CNHUs**- It is important to note that the diverse etiologies leading to non-healing ulcers mandate thorough pre-surgical evaluation, medical correction of any modifiable factors, and assessment of the possibility of the Jodhpur technique or any skin grafting method in healing them. The majority of CNHUs is located on the lower limbs, primarily owing to gravity-associated compromised vascular supply (whether overt or occult) and higher possibility of trauma. Since vascular replenishment of the ulcer bed is an important consideration in CNHUs (in contrast to vitiligo), consideration of flaps, techniques like platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM), injection of growth factors, hyperbaric oxygen, etc. must be considered before being convinced that the Jodhpur technique may suffice and provide healing without the logistic and infrastructural essentials required for the other approaches.

**Coverage Ratio with Jodhpur technique**

In cases of vitiligo, the Jodhpur technique allows coverage of a recipient area with the harvesting of as low as 20 to 30% of that area from the donor site.
