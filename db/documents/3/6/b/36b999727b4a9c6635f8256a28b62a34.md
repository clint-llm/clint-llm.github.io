Sudden, colicky, flank pain, should not be assumed by the diagnostician to automatically be a renal calculus, evenÂ in a patient with a past medical history of nephrolithiasis. Other causes of this presentation must be considered to avoid missing another possibly life-threatening diagnosis. Other diagnoses that must be considered are a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal cell carcinoma, pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, small bowel obstruction, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, renal vein thrombosis. If a clinician misses or delays their diagnoses of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, which may present similarly to the classic presentation of nephrolithiasis, poor outcomes including death may occur. Thus it is prudent for a clinician to consider other causes to a patient's symptoms actively.
