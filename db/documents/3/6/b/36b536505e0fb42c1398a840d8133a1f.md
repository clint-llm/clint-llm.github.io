The therapeutic management of copper toxicity focuses on 4 major principles: Reduction of absorption, close observation, supportive measures with the management of complications, and chelation therapy.

D-Penicillamine is the primary chelator used in copper toxicity, although EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid)Â and DMPS (dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid) may also be used for heavy metal toxicity with copper.
