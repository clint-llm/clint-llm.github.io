Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are the most common benign gynecologic tumors, occurring in up to 70% of women by menopause.

The most common symptoms include abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), pelvic pain and pressure, anemia, and bladder and/or bowel dysfunction. Importantly, the presence of one or multiple fibroids may affect fertility, as the distortion of the uterus can prevent successful implantation and/or continued survival of an intrauterine pregnancy.

The presence of fibroids can introduce obstetrical complications, such as recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), preterm labor (PTL), abnormal placentation, increased rates of cesarean section, and postpartum hemorrhage.  With the current trend of increased childbearing age, fertility-sparing management of uterine fibroids is critical.  In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation of fibroids in women of reproductive age and the medical and surgical management options available for women with fibroids who wish to become pregnant in the future.
