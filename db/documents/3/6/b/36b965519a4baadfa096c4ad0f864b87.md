There are currently no laboratory tests forÂ encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, and radiographic imaging is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. CT is the definitive imaging modality of choice for EPS, with one studying affirming 100% sensitivity and 94% specificity for diagnosing EPS. CT imaging would reveal peritoneal enhancement, thickening and calcifications, bowel tethering, thickening, dilatation, and fluid septation/loculation. This can be seen in the CT imaging below.

EPS can be diagnosed with clinical signs of intestinal obstruction with radiological imaging of bowel encapsulation. However, it is essential to note that other imaging modalities, such as abdominal radiography, can be used to diagnose EPS. This is because abdominal radiography does not have the same level of sensitivity or specificity. Still, air-fluid levels, signs of bowel dilation, and peritoneal calcifications can be used to suspect EPS in the setting of intestinal obstruction.

It should be noted that X-ray films can have a normal presentation despite having EPS. The most sensitive and specific method to confirm EPS can be made through a laparoscopy or laparotomy procedure, which can visualize the peritoneal thickening that encloses the bowel. But due to the invasive nature and the elevated risks of surgery, this is rarely done to diagnose EPS.
