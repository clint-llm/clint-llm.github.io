CCTA testing centers should be equipped and staffed to manage the rare complication of an anaphylactic response to any of the agents administered during testing. Where specific contrast allergies are noted, standard oral steroid and diphenhydramine pre-test treatments should be prescribed.

CT scans utilize x-rays, which is a type of ionizing radiation that can damage cells on a molecular level. The potential for harm from radiation exposure is cumulative over a patientâ€™s lifetime. Thus, children and young adults are, particularly at risk. Organs with high cellular turnover are also at increased risk for genetic damage from ionizing radiation exposure. Radiation exposure during CCTA should be kept to as low as reasonably achievable to obtain diagnostic results.
