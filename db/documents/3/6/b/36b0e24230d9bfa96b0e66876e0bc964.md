History should assess the risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and any underlying dermatologic (e.g., eczema, psoriasis) or systemic (e.g., reactive arthritis) diseases. Along with inspection of the glans and foreskin, the physical examination should also include an assessment of the urethral meatus for inflammation and discharge, and any extragenital manifestations such as a generalized rash, oral ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and arthritis. Persistent inflammation and edema may cause scarring and adherence of the foreskin to the glans. Ultimately, this process can evolve into a tightening of the foreskin, known as “phimosis.” Phimosis is an abnormal constriction of the opening in the foreskin that prevents retraction over the glans. Paraphimosis refers to trapping of the foreskin behind the glans penis and requires urgent reduction.

Signs and symptoms usually include:

- Tight, shiny skin on the glans

- Redness around the glans

- Inflammation, soreness, itchiness, or irritation of the glans

- A thick cheesy white discharge under the foreskin (smegma)

- An unpleasant smell

- Tight foreskin cannot retract

- Painful urination

- Swollen glands near the penis

- Sores on the glans
