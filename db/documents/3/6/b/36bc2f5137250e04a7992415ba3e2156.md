Microscopically, the central nidus is comprised of highly vascularized bone and intertwined osteoid.  Remodeling of the bone occurs through osteoblastic activity.  In the periphery of the nidus, an area of lucency is visible due to resorption of bone from osteoclastic activity.  New bone formation occurs around the nidus and appears as sclerotic bone.
