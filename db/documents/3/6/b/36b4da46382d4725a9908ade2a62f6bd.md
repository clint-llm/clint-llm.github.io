Given the high-stakes nature of healthcare, preventing workplace accidents is of utmost importance. Even the most attentive and knowledgeable provider can make mistakes, especially when performing shift work. Having safeguards to prevent errors from reaching patients is critical to avoiding unintentional harm.

All providers (physicians, pharmacists, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and technicians) are valuable members of the interprofessional team and are responsible for preventing mistakes from reaching the patient. Any team member may recognize a potential error and take action to prevent it. Creating a culture that encourages respectful, open, and non-judgmental communication amongst the interprofessional team promotes this collaborative behavior and improves patient safety.

While patients are often the primary victims of medical accidents, unintentional errors may also substantially impact the psychological health and well-being of healthcare providers.
