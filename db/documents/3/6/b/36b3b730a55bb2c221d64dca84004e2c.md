Aspirin is available over the counter and is commonly involved in pediatric overdoses. The medication should be kept in a closed cabinet away from the reach of children. Given its wide availability, potential adverse effects, therapeutic uses, and potential interactions, all interprofessional healthcare team members should be aware of when patients are using aspirin and monitor and counsel the patient to optimize therapeutic outcomes and prevent any potential adverse effects of salicylic acid. This interprofessional team includes all clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and pharmacists, all of whom need to have access to the same patient information and coordinate their activities and openly share information, so the patient receives the best possible healthcare, including how aspirin is used.
