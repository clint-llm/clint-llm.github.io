Catastrophic events can range from natural disasters such as Hurricane Maria which devastated Puerto Rico on September 20, 2017

A multi-casualty incident (MCI) is an event in which the resources available (rescue personnel, healthcare providers, facilities, and equipment) are insufficient to deal with the incident. In a disaster, not only are there not enough resources, but there is a complete breakdown in communication and the ability to deliver these resources. The local rescue workers and health care personnel, may themselves become the victims or be unable to arrive at work. The local health care facilities may be damaged or destroyed.
