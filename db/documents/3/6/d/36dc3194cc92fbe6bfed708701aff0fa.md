Given pulmonary embolism serves as the etiology of pulmonary infarction in most cases, it is important to understand the clinical picture representing both conditions. The presenting features of a pulmonary infarction overlap those of a pulmonary embolism with a few important distinctions.

In patients with concurrent pulmonary embolism and pulmonary infarction, the following features have been shown to be present: dyspnea (69% to 78%), chest pain (49% to 70%), swelling or pain in a unilateral lower extremity (27% to 31%), fever (5% to 11%), and hemoptysis (4% to 19%).

Among patients incidentally found to have a pulmonary infarction after a biopsy of a radiographically discovered lung nodule, 65% of patients had no respiratory complaints, 26% had dyspnea, 7% had chest pain, and 5% had hemoptysis.
