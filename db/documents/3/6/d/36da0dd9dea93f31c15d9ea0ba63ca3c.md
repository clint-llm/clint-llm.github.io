Hearing loss affects up to 1.1 billion people to some degree worldwide, and about half is preventable through public health measures.

Presbycusis: A progressive loss of ability to hear high-frequency sounds with age.

Noise-induced hearing loss: Loud sounds can damage the stereocilia of the hair cells within the inner ear. Up to 12.5% of children from ages 6 to 19 have permanent hearing loss due to exposure to loud noises.

Genetics: Most hearing loss disorders are inherited conditions passed on in a recessive manner. Some syndromes that include hearing loss are Alport syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 2, and Usher syndrome.

Medications: Some ototoxic medications include loop diuretics, quinine, and macrolide antibiotics.

Otosclerosis: An autosomal dominant condition where the ossicles in the middle ear become fixed and cannot vibrate accordingly. It presents as painless progressive hearing loss.
