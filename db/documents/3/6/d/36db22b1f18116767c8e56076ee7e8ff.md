It is vital to balance the risks and benefits of intervention versus surveillance. When surgery is indicated, it is essential to evaluate the risk of infection, bleeding, and renal failure. Therefore, it is essential to assess patients before undergoing invasive procedures. When a patient is not a candidate for surgery, ablation is an option. Although there are fewer complications than surgery, the risk for recurrent, requiring multiple treatment sessions, is higher in the ablation group. Providers must inform patients about the risks and benefits before undergoing interventions.
