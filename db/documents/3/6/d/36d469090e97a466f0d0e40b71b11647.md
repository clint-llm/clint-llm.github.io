Metachromatic leukodystrophy is caused by deficient activity of arylsulfatase A. In almost all cases, mutations are in the arylsulfatase A gene (ARSA gene), on chromosome 22q13.3-qter. Two alleles, A and I have contributed to approximately 50 percent of cases and are responsible for different clinical expression of the disease.
