The collagen vascular diseases are immunologically mediated diseases that may be idiopathic or influenced by genetic and environmental factors, such as medications, smoking, and sex hormones. The causes of connective diseases are mostly unknown, though the role of autoimmunity is well-established.Mycoplasma, and Borrelia bacterial species, have also been implicated as causes of systemic lupus erythematosus. Vascular injury is believed to be the initial pathologic event in scleroderma, while similar mechanisms of inflammation are implicated in Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis.
