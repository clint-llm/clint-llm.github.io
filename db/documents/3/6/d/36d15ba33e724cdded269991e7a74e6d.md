Danazol is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its ability to cause virilization in female fetuses. It has been shown that female fetuses exposed to danazol after eight weeks of gestation were more likely to experience virilization, which followed the pattern of clitoromegaly, fused labia, and fused urogenital sinus formation.

Being an androgen, danazol should also be avoided in androgen-dependent tumors, e.g., prostate cancer. Danazol also induces the ALA synthase enzyme and induces porphyrin metabolism and, therefore, should be avoided in people with any form of porphyria. Danazol should be avoided with a previous history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its' metabolites. Danazol is also contraindicated during lactation.

If danazol is being used to treat fibrocystic breast disease, breast cancer should be ruled out first. If any nodule persists or enlarges during danazol treatment, consider and rule out breast carcinoma.

Danazol should not be given to women with undiagnosed vaginal bleeding and patients with severe renal, liver, and cardiac disease.
