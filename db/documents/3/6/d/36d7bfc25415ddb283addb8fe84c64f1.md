Post-operative pain is a major issue for patients and is often managed with opioids and muscle relaxants. It is important that the patient and his/her family understand that their physicians cannot overmedicate. Pain medications are a double-edged sword. The risk/benefit ratio must be weighed carefully. Oversedation with opioids may put the patient at risk for developing complications such as pneumonia. The physician must carefully titrate the dose of pain medications to allow maximum comfort with minimum risk of complications for the patient. It is crucial that the patient, family, and friends comprehend and respect this balancing act. A well-informed patient can assist their physician in the process by comprehending the proposed strategy for the diagnosis, workup, and subsequent treatment.
