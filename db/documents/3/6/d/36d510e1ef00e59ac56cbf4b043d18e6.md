Before performing a percutaneous liver biopsy, patients should understand the risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure, along with why it is clinically indicated. Informed consent should then be obtained. Most liver biopsies take place in the outpatient setting. The clinician conducts history and physical, and routine laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, platelet count, and prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), are checked. Some practices also choose to obtain an activated partial thromboplastin time, bleeding time, and/or blood type. Guidelines from the Society of Interventional Radiology recommend platelet transfusion if the platelet count is less than 50000 platelets per microliter and correcting an elevated INR to less than 1.5 before the biopsy.
