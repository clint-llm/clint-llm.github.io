Most cases of Lambl excrescences remain asymptomatic and are detected incidentally on echocardiography or on autopsy. These, especially when found on aortic valve cusps, have a higher potential of breaking off and embolize to distal organs usually in association with embolic strokes, coronary artery embolisms that result in acute coronary syndromes, or pulmonary embolisms. If large enough, even without embolization, these can cause mechanical valvular obstruction. Depending on the target distal organ affected patients can present with varied neurological and cardiopulmonary symptoms.

Patients can present with stroke-like features such as motor deficits, sensory deficits, aphasia, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual disturbances, cranial nerve palsies, and ataxia to name a few. Cardiopulmonary features such as chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, syncope, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, hypoxia, hypotension, arrhythmias, ischemic changes on the ECG, and elevated cardiac biomarkers can also be present.
