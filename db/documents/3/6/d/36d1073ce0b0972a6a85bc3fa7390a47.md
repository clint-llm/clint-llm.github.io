In hemoglobin synthesis, there are numerous steps and processes where errors can arise. For example, heme synthesis involves multiple enzymes (described below). Issues arise when one of these enzymes is deficient or inadequately functioning. During globin subunit production, potentially serious consequences can ensue if there are mutations or deletions in genes coding for globin chains; this relates to disorders in which abnormal hemoglobin predominates in the blood.
