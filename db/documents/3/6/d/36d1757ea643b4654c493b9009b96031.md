The face has two main nerve innervations. The nerves that innervate the face are cranial nerves. The facial nerve is responsible for the innervation of the muscles that participate in facial expression. The facial nerve penetrates through the parotid gland and then branches into five nerves: temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular, and posterior cervical nerve. The temporal branch of the facial nerve travels toward the temporal and forehead region. The zygomatic branch of the facial nerve travels along the zygoma and cheek region. The buccal branch of the facial nerve travels toward the buccal region. The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve travels toward the mandible. Lastly, the posterior cervical branch of the facial nerve travels toward the cervical region. These nerve branches provide motor innervation to the facial muscles that are near their corresponding paths/territories.

As for the sensory innervation of the face, the trigeminal nerve proves the sensory innervation to the face. The trigeminal nerve branches into three nerve branches. These branches are the ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular nerves. The ophthalmic nerve travels toward the forehead and provides sensory to the forehead and eye region. The maxillary nerve travels toward the maxilla bone and provides sensory innervation to the cheek and nose. The mandibular nerve travels with the mandible and provides sensory innervation to the jaw and lips. The trigeminal nerve also innervates the masseter muscle that contributes to the fullness of the cheeks.Â The eyes also receive additional innervation from the optic, oculomotor, trochlear, trigeminal, abducens, and facial nerves. The nose also receives special sensory innervation from the olfactory nerve. Lastly, the ears funnel in sound and convert it into audible sound via the vestibulocochlear nerve.
