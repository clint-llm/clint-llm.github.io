Ergotamine poisoning and overdose symptoms are rarely seen in todayâ€™s clinical practice because newer, safer anti-migraine medications such as triptans are used more widely due to fewer side effects. However, intoxication symptoms could still manifest in sensitive patients taking it for migraine relief. In such cases, treatment involves the initial withdrawal of the drug, which could relieve symptoms. One study also noted that sodium nitroprusside administered intravenously, along with low molecular weight Dextran and Heparin, was successful in treating ergotamine poisoning.
