The tensor tympani muscle attaches to the malleus to prevent excessive oscillations produced by loud sounds. A branch of the mandibular nerve innervates the muscle. The mandibular nerve arises from the third branch of the trigeminal nerve. The stapedius is innervated by a branch of the facial nerve.

Other important nerves within the middle ear are the chorda tympani and facial nerve. While these nerves are not directly involved with the ossicles, they have important anatomical relationships with the ossicles. The chorda tympani travels closely to the ossicular chain and is often stretched and damaged during surgery.
