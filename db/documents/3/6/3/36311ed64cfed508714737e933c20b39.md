Histological examination of a testis biopsy is the definitive method of diagnosis.

In Sertoli cell-only syndrome, all seminiferous tubules are lined exclusively with Sertoli cells. No germ cells are present, although there may be focal areas of normal, preserved spermatogenesis somewhere in the testis.

There are two histological types of Sertoli cell-only syndrome; primary and secondary.

Primary or pure Sertoli cell-only syndrome is generally thought to arise from a disorder of gonocyte migration that fails to reach the gonads. This causes uniform or primary Sertoli cell-only syndrome with no focal spermatogenesis.

Secondary Sertoli cell-only syndrome is thought to occur following some insult to otherwise healthy testes, which may not affect all of the seminiferous tissue sparing some focal areas.

Four different types of Sertoli cells have been described.

Histological differentiation of Sertoli cells can generally be done according to these criteria:

- Normal mature cells which typically demonstrate a vaguely triangular shape and a prominent nucleolus

- Immature cells with round nuclei but immature cytoplasm

- Dysgenetic cells with immature nuclei

- Involuted cells with irregular nuclei
