Hand infections comprise a broad spectrum of pathology, dependent upon which superficial or deep structures are involved. Given the anatomical complexity of the hand and its delicate function, prompt recognition and treatment are required to optimize patient outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of various hand infections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the features of the history of present illness that are most important in guiding decision making for hand infections.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with a spectrum of common hand infections.
- Summarize the scenarios and disease patterns in which hand infections commonly require surgical management.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team when treating hand infections to ensure prompt evaluation of patients who may require inpatient admission, surgical intervention, or specialist consultation for antimicrobial selection.
