Mitochondria are important cellular organelles and contain their own deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The mtDNA is a small circular molecule composed of 16,569 base-pairs and consists of 37 genes. These genes encode for 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 13 polypeptides, and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). These genes are important for the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) to generate cellular energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The mtDNA does not follow the laws of Mendelian inheritance and has a strict maternal inheritance. During fertilization, the zygote receives mitochondria only from the oocyte. Thus, mtDNA is transmitted vertically from mother to all her male and female offsprings.

Multiple mtDNA mutations have been identified in MERRF. The most common mutation observed is an A-to-G mutation at nucleotide 8344 (m.8344A>G) of the mtDNA lysine tRNA gene (MT-TK). It is present in about 80% of MERRF patients. Some of the other mtDNA mutations identified in MERRF are m.8356T>C, m.8363G>A, m.3243A>G, m.3255G>A, and m.3291T>C.
