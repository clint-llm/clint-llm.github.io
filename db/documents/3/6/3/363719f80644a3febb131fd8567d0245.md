Patients around 40 years of age present with complaints of difficulty in reading finer prints at usual reading distance. Typically, patients report improvement in near visual acuity if the reading distance is increased slightly beyond the usual reading distance. At the outset of symptoms, patients often complain of headaches. Asthenopic symptoms appear relatively earlier in patients with longer screen time exposure due to latent accommodative dysfunction.

Other symptoms includeÂ delayed focussing of near and distance, squinting, drowsiness during near work, and need for bright light for reading.
