The diagnosis and management of patients with deafness is with an interprofessional team. The key is early diagnosis as it leads to better outcomes. Newborn hearing screening programs are available in all 50 states, and these programs recommend universal newborn hearing screening be performed within the first 3 months of life. The American Academy of Pediatrics program called Early Hearing Detection and Interventions has goals of screening by 1 month, diagnosis of hearing loss by 3 months and entry into early intervention services by 6 months.
