Although vasodilation is a natural response necessary for our bodies, in specific scenarios, excessive vasodilation can cause harm:

**Anaphylaxis**

Severe anaphylactic shock occurs when a rapid release of inflammatory mediators and cytokines triggers widespread vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. This situation leads to the activation of the inflammatory cascade, and immediate epinephrine is the first-line treatment.

**Septic Shock**

Vasodilation is a normal response that occurs during inflammatory processes to increase blood flow to affected areas. However, in response to overwhelming infection, our bodies release numerous vasodilatory chemicals that cause inflammation and can lead to lethal hypotension.
