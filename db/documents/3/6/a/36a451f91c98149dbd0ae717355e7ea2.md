Terazosin is a selective, quinazoline-derived post-synaptic alpha-1 antagonist.

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are also present in many other organ systems, including the central nervous system, endocrine system, and gastrointestinal system. The primary anti-hypertensive action occurs by blocking vascular smooth muscle in the arterioles. The anti-obstructive urinary tract effects result from smooth muscle relaxation in the ureters, bladder, and urethral sphincter.
