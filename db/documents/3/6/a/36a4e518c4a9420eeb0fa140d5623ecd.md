In medullary sponge kidney, the primary abnormality is the dilatation of the medullary and papillary portions of the collecting ducts. The dilated duct often communicates proximally with a collecting duct that is of normal size.

The cysts themselves typically measure 1 to 8 millimeters in diameter and contain clear, jelly-like material. Small calculi are often present. The kidney may appear enlarged with the involvement of multiple papillae. The exact pathogenesis of medullary sponge kidney is unclear. During embryogenesis, a disruption in the ureteric bud–metanephros interface has been postulated as a possible cause.

Abnormalities in embryogenesis of the distal nephrons results in collecting tubule dilation and cyst formation. This causes distal tubular acidosis and nephrocalcinosis from urine concentration defects which leads directly to hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria (typically renal leak type) and stone formation.

About 70% of patients with medullary sponge kidney will develop urinary stones.
