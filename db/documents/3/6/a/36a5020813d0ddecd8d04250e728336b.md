Epidural steroids injections (ESI) have been utilized forÂ the treatment of pain due to lumbar disc injuries since the 1950s.

Approximately 14% of patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy will eventually require surgery for severe pain that may or may not be associated with neurological deficit.

The 3 routes for epidural steroid delivery include the transforaminal, interlaminar, and caudal approach. Utilization of fluoroscopy or, less commonly, computed-tomography (CT) guidance to ensure needle placement in the proper position using contrast flow has become the standard of care.

Cervical ESIs similarly have been shown to provide effective short-term relief for radicular cervical pain, but long-term outcomes have not been well studied. There is limited high-quality evidence that cervical ESIs can provide benefits in radiculitis secondary to disc herniation and discogenic pain.
