After treatment, the patient needs pain control, laxatives or fiber supplements to avoid constipation, and instructions on properly performing sitz baths.

Outpatient antibiotics are rarely indicated but should be considered if the patient demonstrates signs of systemic infection such as fevers or high leukocytosis. Cultures and sensitivities of the causative organism are rarely helpful.

Because of a high recurrence rate, all patients need to be followed up until there is complete healing, which may take up to 8 weeks. Additionally, up to one-third of patients may either already have a fistula in ano or develop one after their abscess, which is another reason to have a close follow-up. If there is a recurrent abscess, further evaluation is needed for potential Crohn's HIV, neoplasm, or other underlying etiology.
