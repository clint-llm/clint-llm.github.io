Neural crest cells play an essential role in giving rise to its derivatives, including bone, pigment, smooth muscle, endocrine cells, neurons, glia as well as cartilage. Anomalies in neural crest-derived tissues can cause CHARGE syndrome. Deficiency in the passage of cervical neural crest cells into the pharyngeal pouches and arches, lack of mesoderm development, the defective interface between neural crest cells and mesoderm can subsequently lead to multiple phenotypic abnormalities. Mutations in the DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7) gene cause CHARGE syndrome, as CHD7 plays a vital role in neural crest development.
