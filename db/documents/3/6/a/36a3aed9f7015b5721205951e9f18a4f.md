There are risks and benefits to both neuraxial and general anesthesia. There are no clear advantages to one type of anesthesia over the other when either would be appropriate. Decisions about an anesthetic technique should be made based on different factors, including the patient, surgeon, type of procedure, and the anesthesiologists' preference. Specific protocols should be used to conduct regional anesthetic procedures to ensure patient safety and improve patient outcomes.
