Certain conditions can mimic pain at the end of life and need an evaluation to provide appropriate therapy. Severe dehydration can lead to an alteration of mental status, lethargy, and discomfort. This discomfort can be misdiagnosed as pain, and pain medications can worsen the change in mental status. As illness proceeds, multi-organ failure can set in, renal and hepatic impairments can lead to a build-up of toxic metabolites. Long-term use of opiates can lead to dependence, with a drop in dose signs of withdrawal can ensue mimicking pain. Long-term use of opiates can also lead to opioid hyperalgesia leading to a vicious cycle of pain.
