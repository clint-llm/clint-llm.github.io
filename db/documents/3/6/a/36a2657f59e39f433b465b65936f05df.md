Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disease characterized by repeated episodes of a diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which over time, can lead to multiple respiratory complications and permanent lung damage. Though the exact cause of IPH is not well-understood, some believe the disease is from autoimmune damage to the capillaries of the alveoli leading to repeated bleeding into the alveolar space. It is because of this repetitive bleeding that permanent damage occurs, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. When no cause for repeated episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is apparent, the entity is referred to as IPH.
