According to the Vaughan Williams classification, antiarrhythmic drugs classify into five main classes based on their mechanism of action. The class I antiarrhythmic works mainly by blocking the sodium ion channels, which are responsible for the fast inward depolarizing current of the cardiomyocytes. This classification then is grouped again according to their effect on the length of the action potential of the cardiomyocyte to Ia., Ib, and 1c, with the type Ic. is the strongest. The type Ib is the weakest with respect to its binding affinity to the sodium channels.

Compared to the ischemic myocardium, the normally perfused adjacent myocardia display a minimal difference in refractoriness due to APD lengthening hence disopyramide's protective effect from the reentry phenomenon. On the contrary, although theoretically useful to prevent reentry phenomenon from ischemic myocardia, a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study involving 1985 subjects (n treatment = 995, n placebo= 990 ) evaluating oral disopyramide for patients admitted due to myocardial infarction (MI) found that there is no decrease in mortality rate.

Disopyramide and other class I.A. antiarrhythmics also block the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current when blocking the sodium channel resulting in QT interval prolongation.
