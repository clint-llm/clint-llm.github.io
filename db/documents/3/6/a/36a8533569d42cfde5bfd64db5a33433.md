It is challenging to accurately estimate the number of women affected by anterior vaginal wall prolapse. This derives from the fact that a large percentage of these patients have minimal or no symptoms, and therefore never present to medical professionals. Secondly, many patients feel reluctant to seek medical advice because of social embarrassment.

The Women's Health Initiative study estimated that the prevalence of bladder prolapse is 34.3% for women with a uterus and 32.9% for women who have undergone a hysterectomy.

A cross-sectional analysis of 1961 non-pregnant women above 20 years old revealed that 2.9% of the participants had a degree of pelvic organ prolapse.
