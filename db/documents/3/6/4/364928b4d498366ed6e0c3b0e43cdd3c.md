The unresectable disease is an absolute contraindication to performing a neck dissection. This includes invasion of the skull base or deep neck musculature. Carotid artery involvement may be considered either an absolute or relative contraindication to surgery. If the carotid artery may be sacrificed, preoperative evaluation with carotid artery balloon occlusion studies with xenon CT or SPECT-CT imaging should be undertaken to determine the role of carotid reconstruction. There is no definitive evidence to suggest this improves survival, but it is occasionally performed if the risk of a carotid blowout is felt to be high.

Other relative contraindications include uncompensated coagulopathy, poor overall health with a high risk of anesthetic complications, and poor neurocognitive state. The surgeon should always consider whether an operation may be detrimental to the patient's overall health due to underlying comorbidities and the inherent stressors of surgery.
