Many different diseases involve increased or decreased dopamine leading to different effects. The two primary conditions discussed here along with the pharmacology targeting dopamine receptors are Parkinson disease and schizophrenia.

Parkinson disease

- A disease caused by decrease amount of dopamine in the substantia nigra (in the nigrostriatal pathway)

- Symptoms include resting tremor, bradykinesia, shuffling gait, postural instability

- Treatment for Parkinson disease includes medications that target to increase dopamine availability

- Bromocriptine is a D2 receptor agonist; other dopamine agonists include pramipexole and ropinirole
- Amantadine increases dopamine availability by increasing the release of dopamine and decreasing reuptake
- Carbidopa and levodopa are commonly used together; in the CNS levodopa is converted into dopamine to increase the amount of dopamine in the CNS and carbidopa inhibits DOPA decarboxylase, which blocks the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine - this decreases the peripheral side effects of dopamine
- Other medications, such as selegiline and tolcapone inhibit the breakdown of dopamine, which increases the availability at the synapse

Schizophrenia

- Associated with an increase in dopaminergic activity

- Genetic and environmental risk factors affect the dopamine function

- Diagnosis includes greater than 6 months of at least 2 of the following: delusions, disorganized speech, hallucinations, disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms (anhedonia, flat affect, etc.), and at least one of the symptoms needs to be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech

- Treatment for schizophrenia includes medications that target to decrease dopamine availability, which includes atypical and typical antipsychotics

- Typical antipsychotics are also known as first-generation antipsychotics - these drugs block the D2 receptor

- High potency typical antipsychotics include haloperidol, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine
- Low potency typical antipsychotics include chlorpromazine and thioridazine.

- The atypical antipsychotics have unique characteristics

- Most are D2 antagonists and also affect other receptors, such as the serotonin and histamine receptors; aripiprazole is D2 partial agonist
- Atypical antipsychotics bind more loosely to the dopamine D2 receptor than the typical antipsychotics
