Chronic irritation of the facial nerve nucleus and proximal nerve segment (root) due to several underlying etiological factors is the main pathophysiologic mechanism of hemifacial spasm. Compression of the facial nerve root at the junction of the central (point of exit from brainstem) and peripheral segment (root exit/entry zone) by aberrant/ectatic blood vessels is the most common cause of hemifacial spasm as reported in the literature.

**Nerve Origin Hypothesis/Peripheral Theory**

As proposed in this theory, ephaptic transmission of impulses, or the lateral spread of excitation to adjacent nerve fibers, leads to abnormally excessive firing of the facial nerve. This is due to the demyelination of the facial nerve at the site of compression.

**Nuclear Origin Hypothesis/Central Theory**

Irritation of peripheral afferent facial nerve fibers leads to aberrant signaling to the central facial nerve nucleus leading to the abnormal firing of the nucleus. This facial nucleus hyperexcitability results in involuntary myoclonic contraction of facial muscle on the affected side.
