The intercostal nerves originate from the ventral rami of corresponding spinal nerves (For example, the T1 spinal nerve gives rise to the first intercostal nerve). These nerves innervate the skin of the thoracic wall, the intercostal muscles, the rib periosteum, and the costal parietal pleura. The intercostal nerves as a concept split into typical and atypical subcategories. The term "typical intercostal nerves" include those originating from T2 through T7, and the atypical intercostal nerves consist of T1 and T7 through T11. While the typical intercostal nerves remain restricted within the thoracic wall, the atypical intercostal nerves extend to supply other regions such as part of the brachial plexus (T1) and the majority of the abdominal wall (T7-11).
