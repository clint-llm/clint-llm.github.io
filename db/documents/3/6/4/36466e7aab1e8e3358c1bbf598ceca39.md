The most important aspect of the workup of these patients is to obtain an occupational history of the patient. Smoking, alcoholism, and drug use are standard parts of social history. But how the patient spends the day, either with occupation or avocation, may play a particularly important role in raising the suspicion of the practitioner for the emergency practitioner, occupational physician,  pulmonologist, or other health care provider. The fact that the patient works as a welder in the galvanization process is a common clue for diagnosing metal fume fever. Failure to engage in an occupational and hobby history may result in missing this diagnosis, and the patient may repeatedly expose themselves to unsafe conditions without a mask, adequate ventilation, and prolonged work hours. Chemistry, coagulation parameters, and chest X-ray are all usually normal or unchanged from baseline. There may be a small degree of leukocytosis.

The patient's C-reactive protein is elevated, but it is non-specific.
