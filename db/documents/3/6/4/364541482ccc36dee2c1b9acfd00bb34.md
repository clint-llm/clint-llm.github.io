Given the narrow normal range of serum potassium, careful monitoring is a requirement when utilizing KCl. For hospitalized patients receiving oral KCl, serum potassium checks should occur at least daily to determine treatment effectiveness. Patients treated with intravenous KCl may require more frequent checking, especially if the serum potassium level addressed is below 2.5 mEq/L. The use of continuous cardiac monitoring can aid in correlating symptoms with telling electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (e.g., peaked T waves in hyperkalemia, flattened T waves in hypokalemia, etc.).
