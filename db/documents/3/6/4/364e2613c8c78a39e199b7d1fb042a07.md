Krabbe's disease is a genetic disorder, and its frequency varies widely with the population. It is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that is rapidly progressive and fatal. The incidence in Europe is estimated to be 1 per 100,000 live births. A U.S. estimate of 1 per 250,000 was made after analyzing death certificates, but a more precise estimate can approach the European incidence.

Its rate is as high as 6 per 1000 live births in Israel's Druze community due to consanguineous marriages. Among the four subtypes, 85% to 90% of the cases are of infantile subtype, which is also the most severe and rapidly progressing. The mortality rate is as high as 90% in the first two years of life. The late-onset type has a better prognosis, and life expectancy is 5 to 7 years after the onset of symptoms.
