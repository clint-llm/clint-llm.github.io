The mylohyoid muscle is formed by two units, left and right. It originates from the mylohyoid line located on the mandibular bone's internal surface, and both segments meet in the mylohyoid raphe in the midline. The insertion point of this muscle is located on the body of the hyoid bone. The mylohyoid muscle also separates the submandibular from the sublingual areas. Furthermore, it supports and elevates the mouth's floor and elevates the hyoid bone

The digastric muscles are paired muscles formed by an anterior and a posterior belly linking the temporal bone, mandible, and hyoid bone. The anterior belly originates from the digastric fossa of the mandible and attaches to the hyoid bone, where it meets the posterior belly at the intermediate tendon. The posterior belly originates from the mastoid notch on the medial aspect of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. Then, it runs towards the hyoid bone to meet the anterior belly. The anterior bellies line the lateral sides of the submandibular triangle, open the mouth (by lowering the mandible), and elevate the hyoid bone

The mylohyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, innervates the muscles that bound the submental triangle: the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and the mylohyoid muscle

The submental and facial arteries are responsible for the blood supply of the anterior belly of the digastric muscle mylohyoid artery, a branch of the inferior alveolar artery
