The most commonly reported adverse reactions after sugammadex administration is nausea and vomiting, headache, itching, procedural pain, and dysgeusia.

Bradycardia has been noted after sugammadex administration, with some reports of cardiac arrest.

Though more of a characteristic of rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than a side effect, surgeons have noticed that patients under light anesthesia may start to cough or move when sugammadex is administered. Bronchospasm after the administration of sugammadex has been reportedâ€”the incidence appears to be quite low.
