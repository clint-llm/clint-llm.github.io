Multiple diagnostic modalities can be used to evaluate for cheiralgia paresthetica. They include the following

**Electromyography/Nerve Conduction Study**

- Able to identify slowing nerve conduction velocities as compared to accepted normal values

- Commonly there is no slowing present

- Very helpful if present. May be able to identify the location and nature of nerve injury precisely

**Ultrasound**

- Can help distinguish between the different causes of wrist pain including cheiralgia paresthetica, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and thumb carpometacarpal joint arthritis

- Able to identify areas of nerve entrapment or compression

**Plain Radiographs**

- Able to identify any bony prominences or orthopedic hardware present

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

- T1-weighted images can identify the nerve anatomy including any narrowing or enlargement that may be caused by its entrapment

- Water sensitive sequences including fat-suppressed T2-weighted, fat-suppressed proton density-weighted, and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images can identify changes in the nerve itself including edema and enhancement
