# Continuing Education Activity

Cystic hygromas are the most common subtype of lymphangiomas, presenting at birth and in early infancy. Enlargement of cystic hygromas is common, and they pose an airway obstruction risk in infants. To avoid the high mortality associated with this condition, they must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of cystic hygromas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of cystic hygromas.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of cystic hygromas.
- Describe the management options available for cystic hygromas.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cystic hygromas and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Cystic hygromas are one of the most commonly presenting lymphangiomas.

# Etiology

Cystic hygromas are benign cysts that form due to malformations of the lymphatic system.

# Epidemiology

Cystic hygromas are rare, accounting for 6% of all benign lesions of infancy and early childhood.

# Pathophysiology

Cystic hygromas originate embryologically, typically forming at the point of lymphatic-venous collection.

# Histopathology

Histologically, cystic hygromas are characterized by the proliferation of small lymphatic vessels combined with fibrous tissue.

# History and Physical

The majority of cystic hygromas present in pediatric patients, as adult presentations are considered exceedingly rare. A thorough history from either the patient or a collateral history from the infant’s carer, including a review of systems, is essential to narrowing down the provider’s differential diagnosis.

The patient will commonly present with a large, diffuse, and painless lump. When taking the history, the provider should establish when the lump was first noticed. If the onset was at the time of birth or before the age of 2, this would be in keeping with cystic hygroma. As aforementioned, they can present in adults albeit rare. It is important to enquire about any underlying diseases the individual may have that may predispose the patient to cystic hygromas, such as any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. A thorough review of symptoms should be done to rule out any symptoms of infection, such as fever, rigors, or feeling generally unwell.

Symptoms will depend on the anatomical location of the lump. Depending on their size and site, the patient may present with pain, hoarseness, dysphagia, or shortness of breath. These symptoms can occur following compression of major structures within the neck, such as the larynx, trachea, esophagus, or great vessels.

As mentioned previously, cystic hygromas are most commonly found in the posterior triangle of the neck, although they may occur at any anatomical site. On examination, cystic hygromas are soft, fluctuate, and freely mobile, and they transilluminate well.

They can vary in size, ranging from 1-30cm in diameter.

# Evaluation

Bedside investigations such as basic observations and routine blood tests are likely to be unremarkable in the case of a benign, non-infected cystic hygroma. If the patient has developed an abscess, this may cause a raised white cell count with raised inflammatory markers. Aspiration of the lump in combination with imaging is the gold standard for diagnosing cystic hygromas.

Various imaging modalities like ultrasonography, computerized tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging are used to confirm the diagnosis. Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all and typically shows multicystic lesions with internal septations.

Occasionally karyotyping might be done in case of any doubt of chromosomal disorder.

# Treatment / Management

Cystic hygromas are benign lesions, and if asymptomatic, they do not necessitate treatment. Indications for treatment include infection, hemorrhage, respiratory distress, dysphagia, or disfigurement. The mainstay of management is surgical; however, other options include sclerotherapy, drainage, radio-frequency ablation, or cauterization.

Cystic hygromas that develop into abscesses will require antibiotics, antipyretics, and analgesia, with or without subsequent surgical management. Surgical treatment, if needed, is usually withheld till the next three months after the antibiotic course.

# Differential Diagnosis

Neck lumps are a common presentation in both children and adults, and therefore have a wide range of differential diagnoses.  Lumps that present from birth are more likely to be congenital in origin. Congenital differentials include thyroglossal cysts, branchial cysts, dermoid cysts, or teratomas. Other differentials include infective causes, such as reactive lymphadenopathies, or neoplastic causes, such as lymphoma. The provider should also consider inflammatory causes such as sarcoidosis, traumatic such as hematomas, and vascular causes such as carotid body tumors.

# Prognosis

The prognosis of a patient with a cystic hygroma will largely depend on the anatomical site and whether or not the patient develops any secondary complications. Cystic hygromas that are diagnosed prenatally generally have a poorer prognosis than those diagnosed after birth.

Cystic hygromas that are left without any intervention are likely to continue to enlarge and cause further complications.

# Complications

Complications can arise due to the rapid enlargement of the cystic hygroma, causing infiltration of the neck. This can result in complete or incomplete airway obstruction, dysphagia, and obstructive sleep apnoea. Other complications include hemorrhage within the cystic hygroma leading to infection and later abscess formation.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient education is crucial in order to avoid complications resulting from the delayed presentation. Severe complications such as airway obstruction can rapidly lead to mortality if not promptly treated.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients with cystic hygromas may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms, such as a painless neck lump. The cause may be due to a myriad of diagnoses, including congenital, neoplastic, infective, inflammatory, and vascular etiologies. Although cystic hygroma can be diagnosed clinically, imaging studies are must prior to any further management.

Specialist pediatric surgeons will most likely be involved with the management of pediatric patients presenting with cystic hygromas; however, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a pediatrician, radiologist, and ENT surgeons due to the potential infiltration of surrounding structures.

The nurses are also a vital member of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period for pain and wound infection, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and appropriate antibiotics. The radiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause when it comes to interpreting images. The need for meticulous planning and discussion with other professionals involved in the management of the patient is highly recommended to lower the morbidity and improve outcomes.
