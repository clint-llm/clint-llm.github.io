The structure of the infratemporal fossa is formed by osseous boundaries located inferiorly and medially to the zygomatic arch. The shape of the infratemporal fossa can be loosely described as an inverted square pyramid containing directional boundaries that delineate its area. Anteriorly, the boundary is formed by the posterolateral surface of the maxillary sinus. The ramus of the mandible forms the lateral boundary while the medial pterygoid and tensor veli palatini muscles form the medial border. The medial border of the infratemporal fossa is continuous with the pterygopalatine fossa. The medial pterygoid muscle attachment to the mandible also forms the inferior border. The lateral pterygoid muscle is located anteromedially to the infratemporal fossa. The posterior boundary of the infratemporal fossa is broadly defined but includes the styloid process and the tympanic part of the temporal bone. Since it an anatomical landmark in the head and neck, the infratemporal fossa functions to house and protect a wide variety of nerves and vasculature that course through the space.
