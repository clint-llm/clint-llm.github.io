A history of consuming undercooked or raw pork and beef should raise suspicion of sarcocystosis. Other meat, including meat from domesticated or wild mammals, birds, or reptiles, can potentially cause Sarcocystis infection if eaten undercooked.Sarcocystis infections tend to be asymptomatic in humans.

In symptomatic disease, the infection can present as two distinct syndromes or as a combination of both. Muscular sarcocystosis can present with fever, musculoskeletal pain, rashes, bronchospasms, cardiomyopathy, or subcutaneous swelling.
