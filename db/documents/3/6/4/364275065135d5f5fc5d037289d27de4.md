Burning mouth syndrome is a chronic condition that can remit spontaneously, improve moderately, or even worsen with time. Patients with BMS suffer from chronic burning pain, sometimes accompanied by xerostomia and taste disorders, significantly impairing their quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of the condition is yet to be understood; therefore, treatment is challenging, and no individual approach can fully resolve symptoms, frustrating patients and clinicians.
