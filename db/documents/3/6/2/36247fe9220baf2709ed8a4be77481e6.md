Night eating syndrome is usually confused with sleep-related eating disorders. The main differential criterion between NES and sleep related-eating disorders is the nature and the component of nocturnal eating. While the NES is composed of both hyperphagia and nocturnal eating along with awareness, sleep-related eating disorders are mainly characterized by repeated involuntary eating habits during sleep.

Night eating syndrome can be classified as an insomnia-related disorder as patients are awake, aware, and able to recall their eating habits. Generally, patients with NES do not report underlying sleep disorders. However, some patients might report both syndromes.

Sharing the behavior of evening hyperphagia between NES and binge eating disorder does not necessarily mean they share the same etiology. Unlike binge eating disorder, evening hyperphagia in NES patients is mainly correlated to nocturnal anxiety.
