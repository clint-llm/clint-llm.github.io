Setmelanotide is the first available anorexigenic agent, a melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist for treating obesity caused by a rare genetic disorder.

Setmelanotide allows weight loss in patients with these genetic obesity disorders by restoring appetite control, thereby reducing food intake and weight gain. However, setmelanotide does not treat these hereditary defects which cause obesity.
