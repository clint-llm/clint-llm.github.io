Infection typically occurs with direct contact with the skin from the soil, animals, or the skin of other humans.

In some individual cases, the most common etiologic species is dependent on the method of transmission. Tinea corporis secondary to Trichophyton tonsurans (T. tonsurans) commonly results from direct contact with a patient with tinea capitis. In tinea capitis, T. tonsurans is the most common causative agent in the United States and the United Kingdom.T. tonsurans is also a typical finding in cases of tinea corporis gladiatorum.Microsporum canis.
