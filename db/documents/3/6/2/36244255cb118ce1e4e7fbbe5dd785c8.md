Cataracts are one of the most common causes of reversible blindness worldwide, and cataract surgery is one of the most common ocular surgery performed globally for visual rehabilitation. Vision-related quality of life and visual rehabilitation are essential parameters to determine the success of cataract surgery.

Cataract surgery has evolved over the years, and due to advances in surgical technique, instrumentation, and availability of newer drugs, the surgical procedure involves less risk and excellent outcomes.

The introduction of phacoemulsification by Kelman in 1967 revolutionized the clear corneal self-sealing incisional surgery.

Cataract surgery evolved from ECCE to MSICS and then to phacoemulsification. The most significant advantage of MSICS over ECCE is that it is a sutureless surgery with a self-sealing tunnel.

An average SICS takes approximately 7Â to 10 minutes in expert hands. The surgery steps are detailed below in the activity, along with indications and contraindications.
