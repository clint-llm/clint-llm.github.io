German physician Joseph Friedrich Sobernheim coined the term "myocarditis" in 1837, which translates to "inflammation of the myocardium." However, for a long time, there was no clear consensus on what truly constituted myocarditis. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the term was a catch-all diagnosis for many non-valvular heart diseases, including what we now recognize as hypertensive and ischemic heart diseases.
