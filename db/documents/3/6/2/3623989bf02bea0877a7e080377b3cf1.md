Antibiotics and supportive care are critical in all cases of bacterial meningitis.

Managing the airway, maintaining oxygenation, giving sufficient intravenous fluids while providing fever control are parts of the foundation of meningitis management.

The type of antibiotic is based on the presumed organism causing the infection. The clinician must take into account patient demographics and past medical history in order to provide the best antimicrobial coverage.

**Current Empiric Therapy**

Neonates - Up to 1 month old

- Ampicillin intravenously (IV) and

- Cefotaxime (or equivalent, usually ceftazidime or cefepime) IV or gentamicin IV and

- Acyclovir IV

More than 1 month old

- Ampicillin IV and

- Ceftriaxone IV

Adults (18 to 49 years old)

- Ceftriaxone IV and

- Vancomycin IV

Adults older than 50 years old and the immunocompromised

- Ceftriaxone IV and

- Vancomycin IV and

- Ampicillin IV

Meningitis associated with a foreign body (post-procedure, penetrating trauma)

- Cefepime IV or ceftazidime IV or meropenem IV and

- Vancomycin IV

Meningitis with severe penicillin allergy

- Moxifloxacin IV and

- Vancomycin IV

Fungal (Cryptococcal) meningitis

- Amphotericin B IV and

- Flucytosine by mouth

**Antibiotics**

Ceftriaxone

- Third-generation cephalosporin

- Gram-negative coverage

- Very effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitis

- Better CNS penetration than piperacillin-tazobactam (typically used in gram-negative sepsis coverage)

Vancomycin

- Gram-positive coverage (MRSA)

- Also used for resistant pneumococcus

Ampicillin

- Listeria coverage (gram-positive bacilli)

Cefepime

- Fourth-generation cephalosporin

- Increased activity against pseudomonas

Cefotaxime

- Third-generation cephalosporin

- Equivalent to ceftriaxone

- Safe for neonates

**Steroid Therapy**

There is insufficient evidence to support the widespread use of steroids in bacterial meningitis. Some studies report a reduction in mortality for Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, but not in Haemophilus influenza or Neisseria meningitides meningitis. In children, steroids were associated with a reduction of severe hearing impairment only in cases of Haemophilus influenza meningitis.

**Increased Intracranial Pressure**

If the patient develops clinical signs of increased intracranial pressure (altered mental status, neurologic deficits, non-reactive pupils, bradycardia), interventions to maintain cerebral perfusion include:

- Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees

- Inducing mild hyperventilation in the intubated patient

- Osmotic diuretics such as 25% mannitol or 3% saline

**Chemoprophylaxis**

Chemoprophylaxis is indicated for close contacts of a patient diagnosed with N. meningitides and H. influenzae type B meningitis.

Close contacts include housemates, significant others, those who have shared utensils, and health care providers in proximity to secretions (providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, intubating without a facemask).

Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for N. meningitidis includes rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, and for H. influenzae type B: rifampin.
