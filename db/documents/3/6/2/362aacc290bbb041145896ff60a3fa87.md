Before advanced imaging, the neurogenic shock was thought to be associated with spinal cord injury without radiologic abnormality (SCIWORA). With the advent of advanced imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, spinal cord injury is more accurately identified. The diagnosis of neurogenic shock remains a combination of radiographic imaging, hemodynamic monitoring, and clinical exam.
