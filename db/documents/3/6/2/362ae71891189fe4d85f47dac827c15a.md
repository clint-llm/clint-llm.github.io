When assessing a patient clinically, it is important to know basic anatomical details which will aid the clinician during the physical examination. Assessment of the thorax is a fundamental part of any physical examination as the location of many vital structures are in this region. On the dorsum of the thorax, there exists a relative thinning of the muscles that provide an essential anatomical landmark which aids clinicians during pulmonary auscultation and various thoracic procedures  – the triangle of auscultation.
