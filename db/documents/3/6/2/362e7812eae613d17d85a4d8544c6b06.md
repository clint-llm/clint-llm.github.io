It is essential to ensure that all equipment is available in the operation theatre (OT) and fully functional, as well as informed written parental consent is taken before the procedure. After receiving the patient in the OT, all the standard ASA monitors are attached. The method of induction of anesthesia can be inhalational or intravenous, depending upon anesthetist preference. Orotracheal intubation is done for airway management during tracheostomy. The positioning of the patient is the most important aspect of preparation. The OT table should be adjusted according to the height of the operating surgeon. The patient is positioned supine with sandbag placed between shoulder blades and neck is extended over roll or pillow so that trachea comes close to the skin.
