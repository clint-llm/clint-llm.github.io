Werner syndrome, also known as adult progeria, is a rare autosomal recessive condition that begins in late adolescence or early adulthood and leads to early aging. It presents with characteristic physical and metabolic abnormalities that result in severe complications more commonly seen in the elderly, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients with Werner syndrome and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how to counsel a patient with Werner syndrome.
