Primary caregivers and nurse practitioners should always consider the presence ofÂ a perinephric abscess in a patient with pyelonephritis who fails to improve despite optimal antibiotic therapy. These patients should undergo prompt imaging studies and be referred to an infectious disease specialist and a nephrologist for further management. Any delay in diagnosis or treatment can lead to very high morbidity and mortality. An interprofessional team approach of nurses and clinicians evaluating and treating the abscess will provide the best patient outcome. [Level V]
