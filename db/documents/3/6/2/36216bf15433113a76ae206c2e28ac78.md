Xanthomas are found almost exclusively in the setting of elevated levels of chylomicrons in plasma. There is good evidence to support the fact the lipid found in xanthomas is typically the circulating lipid in highly concentrated amounts. Histopathological diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of form cells within the dermis. These cells are typically the macrophages that engulf lipid and stain positive for the lipid with special stains (Oil-red-O).
