The diagnosis of palatal malignancies is obtained through history, physical exam, imaging, and biopsy.

- **Computerized tomography (CT):**Conventional CT has traditionally been used to evaluate tumor extent, bony erosion, and lymphadenopathy. However, it has lower soft-tissue resolution and precision compared with magnetic resonance imaging. It is also is limited by dental artifacts.

- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**MRI can show the extent of palatal tumors, signs of perineural spread, and cervical lymph node metastasis.

- **Panorex:**A panoramic X-ray of the maxilla and mandible is utilized to determine any bone or tooth involvement.

- **Positron emission tomography (PET):**Although PET has a poor anatomical resolution, it is superior in detecting lymph node metastasis, occult metastases, and post-treatment surveillance.

- **Biopsy:**Punch biopsy, incisional biopsy, or fine need aspiration (FNA) biopsy can be utilized to determine the specific histology of the palatal tumor to help dictate the treatment plan. The sensitivity and specificity of FNA biopsy may vary depending on the technique used and the pathologist's level of experience.
