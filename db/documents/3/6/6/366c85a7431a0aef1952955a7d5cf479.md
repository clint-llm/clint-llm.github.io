Rheumatic heart disease is highly prevalent in developing countries leading to the cause of the most cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in young people. Guidelines provided by the World Health Federation have outlined that the most cost-effective way to prevent rheumatic heart disease is with antibiotic prophylaxis after theÂ diagnosis of rheumatic fever. Patients should be informed of their diagnosis of rheumatic fever as well as the complications associated with poor compliance with antibiotics and follow-up including valvular heart disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
