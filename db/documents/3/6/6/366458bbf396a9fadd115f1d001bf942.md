Platelet transfusion is a lifesaving procedure that is carried out to prevent bleeding or stop ongoing bleeding in patients with low platelet counts or functional platelet disorders. There are minimum thresholds at which platelets are transfused in these patients, as not all low levels of platelet warrants a transfusion. Platelet is a scarce resource as processing, preparing, and transfusing them requires a great deal of precision and effort to maintain a certain quality. This activity highlights the use of platelet transfusion by the interprofessional team.
