The cause of LCH is unknown and continues to be a debate; however, most agree that LCH is either a reactive or neoplastic process.

LGH has multiple cytokines involved, there is good survival in isolated lesions, and it can have spontaneous remissions. These characteristics support a reactive process.

However, LGH also can have organ infiltration. The widespread disease is associated with increased mortality, it typically responds to chemotherapy, and there has been at least one study that demonstrated an association with the BRAF gene mutation. These characteristics support a neoplastic process.
