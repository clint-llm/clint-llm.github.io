The treatment and management of postpartum hemorrhage are focused on resuscitation of the patient while identifying and treating the specific cause.

Maintaining the hemodynamic stability of the patient is important to ensure continued perfusion to vital organs. Ample intravenous (IV) access should be obtained. Careful direct assessment of cumulative blood loss is important, and a focus should be on the early initiation of protocols for the release of blood products and massive transfusion protocols.

Rapid identification of the cause of postpartum hemorrhage and the initiation of treatment should be made simultaneously. Transfer to an operating suite with anesthesia assistance may be indicated for help with a difficult laceration repair, to correct uterine inversion, to help provide analgesia if needed for removal of retained products, or if surgical exploration is indicated.

If the postpartum hemorrhage is due to uterine atony, treatment modalities include medical management with uterotonic agents, uterine tamponade, pelvic artery embolization, and surgical management.

Medical management with uterotonic and pharmacologic agents is typically the first step if uterine atony is identified. While oxytocin is given routinely by most institutions at the time of delivery (see prevention), additional uterotonic medications may be given with bimanual massage in an initial response to hemorrhage. Uterotonic agents include oxytocin, ergot alkaloids, and prostaglandins. Commonly used uterotonics include:

- Oxytocin: A hormone naturally produced by the posterior pituitary works rapidly to cause uterine contraction with no contraindications and minimal side effects.

- Methylergonovine: Semi-synthetic ergot alkaloid. It works rapidly for sustained uterine contraction. It is contraindicated in patients with hypertension.

- Carboprost: Synthetic prostaglandin analog of PGF contraindicated in severe hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular disease, may cause bronchospasm in patients with asthma.

- Misoprostol: Prostaglandin E1 analog. More delayed onset than the above medications.

If bimanual massage and uterotonic medications are not sufficient to control hemorrhage, uterine tamponade may be considered. An intrauterine balloon tamponade system can be used, typically by filling an intrauterine balloon with 250 to 500 mL of normal saline. If there is not an intrauterine balloon readily available, the uterus may be packed with gauze, or multiple large Foley catheters may be placed concurrently. It is important to keep an accurate count of anything placed in the uterus to prevent retained foreign bodies.

Uterine artery embolization may be considered in a stable patient with persistent bleeding. Fluoroscopy is used to identify and occlude bleeding vessels. While the unstable patient is not a candidate for this modality, it has the benefit of uterine conservation and possible future fertility.

Exploratory laparotomy is typically indicated in the setting where less invasive measures for postpartum hemorrhage have failed or if the suspected reason for postpartum hemorrhage such as morbidly adherent placenta, demands it. A midline vertical abdominal incision should be considered to maximize exposure; however, if the patient had a cesarean delivery, the existing incision may be utilized. Vascular ligation sutures may be attempted to decrease pulse pressure at the uterus. Bilateral uterine artery ligation (O’Leary sutures) sutures may be placed as well as bilateral utero-ovarian ligament ligation sutures. Ligation of the internal iliac arteries may also be performed; however, as this entails a retroperitoneal approach, it is rarely used. Uterine compression sutures may also be used as a treatment for atony. The B-Lynch suture technique, the most commonly performed among the compression sutures, physically compresses the uterus looping from the cervix to the fundus. The definitive treatment for postpartum hemorrhage is a hysterectomy. A peripartum hysterectomy is associated not only with permanent sterility but also increased surgical risk with a higher risk of bladder and ureteral injury. Supracervical hysterectomy may be performed alternately as a faster surgery with potentially fewer complicated risks.

If the PPH has a cause other than atony, the treatment modality should be specifically tailored to the cause. Genital tract lacerations should be repaired or pressure/packing used. Retained products of conception should be removed manually or by dilation and curettage procedure. Hematomas can be managed by observation alone or may need fluoroscopy/embolization or surgical intervention if needed. If the uterine inversion is the cause of PPH, steady pressure with the fist is used to replace the uterus in the correct position. Uterine relaxants such as a halogenated anesthetic, terbutaline, magnesium sulfate, or nitroglycerine can be used during uterine repositioning, with oxytocin and other uterotonics given once the uterus is in normal anatomical position. Occasionally surgical correction of inversion must be undertaken via laparotomy. If a coagulation deficit exists, blood factor and product replacement may be used to correct the deficit.
