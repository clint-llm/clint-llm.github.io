In the early 1950s, researchers discovered cytarabine as a nucleoside (containing arabinose sugar) in Cryptotethia crypta, a species of sponges. Cytarabine is an antimetabolite and an antineoplastic agent that belongs to the category of drugs known as anthracyclines.

Cytarabine has both labeled and off-labeled indications.****Labeled indications of cytarabine include the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, remission induction therapy in acute myeloid leukemia in adult and pediatric patients, the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (blast phase), and prophylaxis and treatment of meningeal leukemia. Some of the many off-labeled indications of cytarabine in adults include refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and refractory or relapsed Hodgkin disease. It is also an option for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.
