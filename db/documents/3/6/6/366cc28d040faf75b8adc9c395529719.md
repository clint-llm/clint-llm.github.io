The optic fissure, also termed the choroid fissure, is an embryologic structure essential for the morphogenesis of the eye. Its formation and eventual closure are implicated in the morphogenesis of the iris, ciliary body, retina, choroid, optic nerve, and central retinal artery. It closes in the seventh week of development, and when it fails to close, it results in significant defects, the most prominent of which is coloboma.
