The three primary germ layers form during embryogenesis. They are the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. The mesoderm splits bilaterally into paired blocks known as somites that migrate towards developing limb buds during the fifth week of embryogenesis.

The pectoralis major muscles and latissimus dorsi (superficial portions) form by a mechanism known as the in-out mechanism or cellular migration. The mesenchymal cells or myogenic precursors migrate from the ventrolateral dermomyotome portion towards the area of what will be the upper limbs; a small part of these cells will go back to the axial trunk.

The trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles derive from the lateral plate of the occipital area mesoderm (non-somitic).
