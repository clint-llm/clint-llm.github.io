Although a major cause of gastroenteritis in Japan, V. parahaemolyticus gastroenteritis is less common in the United States with the Center for Disease Control reporting a 2016 incidence of 0.45 cases per 100,000. The incidence in the United States has been steadily increasing. There are typically more cases during the warmer months (May through October), and cases commonly occur as part of an outbreak. Even though V. parahaemolyticus grows best in warmer waters, outbreaks have been reported in colder areas such as Alaska. Despite being found freely in saltwater, it can be found in higher concentrations in shellfish such as mussels, since they filter the water concentrating the bacteria.
