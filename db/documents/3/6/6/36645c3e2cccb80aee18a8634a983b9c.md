Suspected patients with group 3 PH should undergo diagnostic workup to exclude other causes of PH, including valvular heart disease and decompensated left heart disease (group 2), chronic thromboembolism, venous thromboembolism (group 4), and infection. It is essential to distinguish and understand the driving etiology of PH as it changes the management options and prognosis.

Group 3 PH in patients with lung disease can co-exist with group 1 PH, particularly in connective tissue â€“ ILD cases. PH in these patients can be a continuum, contributed by hypoxia and other disease factors. These patients should be referred to a center with PH expertise for individualized management. Patients with group 3 lung disease, particularly ILD patients, can have simultaneous pre-capillary and post-capillary PH due to the prevalence of coronary artery disease.
