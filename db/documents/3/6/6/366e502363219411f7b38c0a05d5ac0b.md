Dronabinol is a synthetic form of tetrahydrocannabinol ('THC'), which obtained FDA approval in 1985 for the treatment of HIV/AIDs-induced anorexia and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting ('CINV') in patients who do not successfully respond to conventional antiemetics. Dronabinol also has off-label use to treat obstructive sleep apnea with mixed and unclear efficacy (only Phase II trials). Therefore, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not support its use until reliable data is available (such as Phase III trials).

As such, the indications for this cannabinoid in adults are HIV/AIDs-induced anorexia and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients who do not successfully respond to conventional antiemetics.
