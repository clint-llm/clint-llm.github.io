Even with prompt diagnosis and treatment, overall mortality rates average about 50%. Rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis carries a much higher mortality rate. Some studies report anywhere from 30% to 80% depending on the underlying condition. Mortality is higher in patients who have hematological disorders or malignancies as their underlying conditions are more difficult to treat. The disseminated form has a mortality of over 90%. Patients who do survive are often left disfigured due to extensive debridement surgeries.
