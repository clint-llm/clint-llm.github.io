Cytochemical techniques are essential for diagnosing thyroid lesions of the thyroid gland pathologies. Direct and indirect immunofluorescence techniques are helpful to localize the thyroid hormones tri-iodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). The techniques manipulate the specificity of antibodies for T3 or T4, which gives enhanced fluorescence for the apical cytoplasm of follicular cells and the colloid pools, indicating thyroglobulin. The technique is specific for the thyroid gland and does not stain the adjacent gland.

Other enzyme-based histochemical reactions utilized to monitor thyroid functions are adenosine triphosphatase, alkaline and acid phosphatases, galectin-3, and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. Papillary and follicular carcinomas, as well as Graves disease, show positive staining for adenosine triphosphatase. The reaction distinguishes between benign and malignant neoplasms of the thyroid epithelium in humans. The benign neoplasms are positive for 5'-nucleotidase, alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, and acid phosphatase and negative for alkaline phosphatase and adenosine triphosphatase. Histochemical assessment of FoxA1 expression in C cells and its absence in follicular cells is a method to detect medullary thyroid carcinomas. FoxA1 expression has also been suggested as a potential oncogene testing in anaplastic thyroid carcinomas.

Normal follicular epithelium of the thyroid gland shows no detectable CK19 expression, while in PTC, it gets overexpressed. Hence, cytokeratin 19 could be a good immunomarkers for diagnosing PTC. Monitoring the upregulation or downregulation of specific cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, fibronectin), cell cycle regulatory proteins (CD44, p27Kip1), and oncogenes (BRAF) through cytochemical staining are helpful techniques to test thyroid cancers.

Many classical cytochemical techniques still hold significance in the analyses of thyroid pathologies. Localization of endogenous thyroperoxidase in thyroid follicles acts as an indicator of iodination during the synthesis of the thyroid hormones. Cytochemical staining of C and oxyphil cells serve as diagnostic markers for tumor, teratoma, and cyst formation in the thyroid gland.
