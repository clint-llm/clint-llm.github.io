Synovial sarcoma is a heterogenous tumor with uncertain origin. SS is divided into two major subtypes- monophasic and biphasic. The monophasic subtype can either be spindle cell type (most common) or epithelial subtype (rarer and underrecognized). The biphasic subtype includes both fibroblast-like spindle-shaped cells and epithelial cells. Rarely, poorly differentiated (round cell), ossifying, and myxoid subtypes have also been described. SS can present with multiple morphologies, making diagnosing difficult and needing the opinion of a pathologist specializing in sarcoma histology.

More than 90% of synovial sarcoma have a focal expression of cytoplasmic cytokeratins (CK) and membranous expression of EMA (epithelial membrane antigen). Although many keratins can be expressed in SS (AE1/AE3, CAM 5.2), CK-7 and CK-19 are restricted to patients with SS and help establish the diagnosis. Other markers include:

- BCL-2 

- Diffuse expression
- Present in 98% of patients

- CD-99

- More commonly cytoplasmic, and some membranous
- Present in 60% of patients

- Calponin

- Although present in multiple tumors, it can help in differentiating poorly differentiated SS from small round tumors which lack calponin

Gene expression studies may also help distinguish SS from other tumors. The following genes are noteworthy.

- TLE1- present ar 9q21.32. It is an excellent marker in distinguishing SS from other soft-tissue malignancies.

- NY-ESO-1- diffusely positive in SS

- Brachyury is consistently negative

- SMARCB1/INI1 protein expression is reduced.
