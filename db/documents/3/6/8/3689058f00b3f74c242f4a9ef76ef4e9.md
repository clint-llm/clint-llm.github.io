A coronary angiogram defines the coronary anatomy and determines the severity of the stenosis of coronary arteries. It would help interventional/invasive cardiologists to plan for appropriate revascularization strategy if indicated. Tools and techniques for coronary angiograms significantly evolved in the last two decades, and complication rates decreased significantly. A coronary angiogram is relatively safe and can be performed in a daycare setting. However, it is not entirely free of complications.
