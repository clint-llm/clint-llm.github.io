Reports on the prevalence of sacroiliac pain vary widely. Some studies report the prevalence as 10% to 25% of those with lower back pain. In those with a confirmed diagnosis, the presentation of pain was ipsilateral buttock (94% cases) and midline lower lumbar area (74%). As mentioned previously the presentation can vary. Up to 50% of cases have radiation to the lower extremity: 6% to the upper lumbar area, 4% percent to the groin, and 2% percent to the lower abdomen.
