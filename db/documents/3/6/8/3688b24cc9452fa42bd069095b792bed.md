Pathologic elevation of conjugated or direct bilirubin (concentration higher than 2 mg/dL or more than 20% of total bilirubin) is termed conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Mononuclear heme oxygenase catalyzes the degradation of heme into biliverdin, which in turn is reduced into bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.

In plasma, unconjugated bilirubin mainly binds to albumin and a lesser extent to high-density lipoprotein.

Bilirubin contains intramolecular hydrogen bonding that buffers its polar hydrophilic groups; the resulting hydrophobic molecule is essentially water-insoluble at physiologic pH.

After the structure alteration following bilirubin conjugation, laboratory tests can distinguish between the unconjugated or indirect bilirubin and conjugated or direct bilirubin.
