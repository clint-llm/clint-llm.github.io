Obtaining an accurate and detailed history is imperative in the diagnosis of narcolepsy. The clinician should perform an investigation of behavioral (i.e., caffeine use, insufficient sleep, poor sleep hygiene, tobacco use, etc.) and alternative diagnoses (i.e., anemia, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, etc.) of excessive daytime sleepiness. It is essential to realize that patients with narcolepsy are well-rested following a brief nap or sufficient nights' sleep; however, the symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness occur within hours of awakening.

The sudden onset of muscle weakness characterizes cataplexy.
