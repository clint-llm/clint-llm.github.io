Heroin's half-life is so short that consumers are usually seen medically in the setting of either overdose or withdrawal. In the overdose setting, there is usually decreased respiratory effort and rate, with sedation and constricted pupils. A severe overdose can progress to apnea with coma, which is followed by minutes by cardiac arrest and death unless immediate rescue measures are taken.

Opiate withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening, like alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Some or all of these symptoms may be seen; the patient does not need all to be diagnosed with heroin withdrawal. In summary, several medications can be used to treat opiate withdrawal symptoms, like methadone (long-acting opioid), buprenorphine (partial mu agonist and kappa antagonist), or alpha-2 adrenergic agents (clonidine and lofexidine).

Intravenous drug use can lead to infectious complications discussed elsewhere (such as cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, endocarditis, septic emboli, and compartment syndrome, for example). Adulterants in heroin can be quite diverse and sometimes unknown to the consumer and can confound the evaluator by giving a potentially very broad spectrum of conflicting physical exam findings. Law enforcement may have knowledge of the current adulterant blend of the heroin that is being locally consumed at the time of the encounter.
