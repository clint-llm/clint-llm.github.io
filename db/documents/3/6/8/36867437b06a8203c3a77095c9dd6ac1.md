Viloxazine was marketed as an antidepressant as an immediate-release formulation in Europe for over two decades before being proposed as a potential treatment for patients with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). In 1971, viloxazine was first endorsed in the United Kingdom before being recognized by numerous other nations as an antidepressant. In April of 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of viloxazine in children and adolescents with ADHD, specifically viloxazine extended-release capsules.
