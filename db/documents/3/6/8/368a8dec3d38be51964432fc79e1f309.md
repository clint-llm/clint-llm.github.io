Double lumen tubes play a crucial role in:

- Airway management during thoracic surgery

- Anatomical lung separation or isolating normal from the diseased lung in situations such as:

- Massive hemorrhage from one lung
- Whole lung lavage in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis
- Avoiding spillage of purulent secretions from one lung to another

- Differential lung protective ventilation in case of lung transplantation patients
