Differential diagnosis of hypotony maculopathy and chorioretinal fold includes:

- Tumors (choroidal melanomas and metastasis)

- Inflammatory (posterior scleritis)

- Neovascularization (age-related macular degeneration)

- Retrobulbar mass (orbital tumor)

- Papilledema (associated with radiating chorioretinal folds).

Other causes of chorioretinal folds include retinal detachment, extraocular materials fixed to the sclera, scleral buckles, and radioactive plaques. Idiopathic chorioretinal folds may also be diagnosed after excluding all other possible causes of such folds. Hypotony keratopathy is characterized by folds in the Descemet membrane and cornea edema.

Examples of disorders in which cornea fold may be seen include keratoconus, post keratorefractive surgery, and Haab striae in primary congenital glaucoma. In some instances, ocular hypotony can be wrongfully diagnosed in the clinical scenario of a thinner than usual central cornea, such as in cases of high myopia.
