Each surgeon has a different postoperative protocol. For non-displaced fractures, immobilization should be for 6 weeks or until evidence of radiographic fracture union for type 1 tibial eminence fractures. Isometric closed chain hamstring and quadricep exercises should be introduced earlyÂ in rehab to prevent atrophy. Fractures treated surgically are at increased risk for stiffness, so early range of motion is important. Early range of motion is determined on a patient to patient basis.
