Triptans are a class of medications used in the treatment of migraine headaches. Triptans act as antimigraine agents by selectively binding to the serotonin receptors 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D. Triptan binding to the vascular 5-HT1B receptors leads to vasoconstriction of the cranial arteries, which painfully dilate during a migraine attack. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for triptans as valuable agents in migraine therapy and also highlights the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for the management team members of patients with migraine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of triptans.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of triptans.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients on triptan therapy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance migraine therapy and improve outcomes.
