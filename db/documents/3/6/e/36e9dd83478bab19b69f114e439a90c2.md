Erythrocyte size, distribution and shape variation can all be clues to clinical disease and pathologic processes. For example, acanthocytes may be a byproduct of eryptosis, or organized erythrocyte breakdown and death. This process of tabulated cell destruction has been seen in anemia and excess calcium.Â Agglutination of red blood cells can be an indication of a hypercoagulable state and microcytosis or small red blood cells can be associated with different forms of microcytic anemia such as iron deficiency and thalassemia.
