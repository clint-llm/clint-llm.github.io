Testing related to the mechanism that Boyle’s law works can be applied to the volume within the lung and equations to describe how much air is moving.

The minute ventilation, calculated as the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate, essentially is how much air is inhaled every minute. These two factors control ventilation, which directly depends on the thoracic cavity volume expanding and the decrease in pressure within the intrapleural space and alveoli, allowing the lungs to fill with air, producing the tidal volume. If there is an adequate tidal volume, a normal respiratory rate will ensure. If the tidal volume is insufficient, there will be a compensatory increase in the respiratory rate in an attempt to maintain normal minute ventilation.

Minute alveolar ventilation is an equation that also depends on Boyle’s law and the inverse relationship of pressure and volume of the thoracic cavity. Alveolar ventilation is the amount of air that reaches the alveoli for gas exchange in each breath; calculated by subtracting the dead space from the tidal volume and then multiplying by the frequency of ventilation.
