The differential diagnosis for turtle headaches is broad due to the "alarm clock" nature and presentation associated with sleep. Some of the other conditions that can potentially mimic turtle or hypnic headaches include migraine or cluster headaches, episodic paroxysmal hemicrania, medication overuse headache, nocturnal seizure with postictal headache, obstructive sleep apnea presenting with headache, nocturnal hypertension, pheochromocytoma, temporal arteritis, or intracranial mass. Exploding head syndrome is a unique but uncommon condition that can be mistaken for hypnic or turtle headaches. These patients have a sensation of an explosive noise in their head that causes them to wake up, but there is no actual pain associated with it. Attacks of this nature tend to occur during transitions from wakefulness to sleep.
