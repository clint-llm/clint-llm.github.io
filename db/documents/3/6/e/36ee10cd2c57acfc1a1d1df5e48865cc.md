Vasodilators can be monitored by checking the blood levels of certain drugs. Microvascular monitoring is another way to detect therapeutic levels in patients who are taking vasodilators.

After initiation of vasodilators, blood pressure (both standing and sitting/supine), heart rate should be monitored. If the patient is on hydralazine and develops lupus-like symptoms, check antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers and anti-histone antibody levels. Clinicians should also check renal function values after 2 to 3 weeks after initiation of ACE Inhibitors and ARBs. Signs/symptoms of pericardial effusion should require monitoring while patients are on minoxidil.
