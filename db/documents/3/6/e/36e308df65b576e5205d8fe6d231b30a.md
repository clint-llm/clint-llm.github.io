The diagnostic evaluation for high-output cardiac failure is important, but determining the underlying etiology is paramount as management changes. The first step in diagnosing heart failure is based on the initial history and physical. Aside from the history and physical exam, initial laboratory testing and imaging should be obtained. The use of natriuretic peptide levels is highly beneficial when the diagnosis of heart failure is not clear, with elevated levels suggesting heart failure. Electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram also should be obtained. Findings of clinical heart failure in the setting of a high output cardiac state give the diagnosis of high-output cardiac failure. In contrast to other forms of heart failure, high-output cardiac failure has the presence of high cardiac output and/or cardiac index.

The final step in evaluation is to determine the cause of high-output cardiac failure. Depending on the initial presentation and physical exam, diagnostic studies will differ. The history and physical will strongly dictate which further testing is necessary.
