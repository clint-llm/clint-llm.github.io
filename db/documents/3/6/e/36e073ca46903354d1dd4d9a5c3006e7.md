Common features of restrictive cardiomyopathies include dyspnea in the presence of normal ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, and biatrial enlargement. Restrictive cardiomyopathies include cardiac sarcoidosis, glycogen storage diseases, and hemochromatosis. The differentials also include other causes of similar echocardiographic appearance, such as hypertensive heart disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
