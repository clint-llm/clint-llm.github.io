Mutagenesis is the driving force behind evolution, and genetic variation is the result of mutations. Any change in genetic information may result in advantageous or disadvantageous phenotypic characteristics that impact an organism's fitness. When a mutation results in a higherÂ fitness, natural selection favors these phenotypes, and these traits are more likely to be passed to offspring.
