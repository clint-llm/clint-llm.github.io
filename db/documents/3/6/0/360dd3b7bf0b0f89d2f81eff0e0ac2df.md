**Lasegue Straight Leg Raising Test for Radicular Pain Due to a Herniated Lumbar Disc**

The patient lies supine. The examiner raises the lower limb with the leg extended at the knee. If there is irritation of a spinal root (due to a herniated lumbar disc), pain is appreciated along the appropriate dermatome. The pain should be felt at less than 60 degrees of elevation.

For disc L4/L5, the spinal root is L5, and the pain is appreciated along the L5 dermatome. The L5 dermatome passes down the lateral leg over the dorsum of the foot to cover the big toe and second and third toes (Foerster dermatome pattern).

For disc L5/S1, the S1 dermatome covers the heel and posterior side of the foot and both anterior and posterior sides of the fourth and fifth toes (Foerster). The S1 nerve root is associated with the Achilles tendon reflex.

**Test for the Severity of Foot Drop**

The condition is usually obvious. The patient scuffs the toes of her foot or shoe when walking and has to lift the foot higher than normal to clear the ground.

To test the severity of foot drop, the patient is seated at the edge of the examination table with the foot hanging off the edge. The examiner grasps the ankle to stabilize it and then uses the other hand to force the foot into plantar flexion (testing dorsiflexion against resistance). The test is then performed on the other side for comparison purposes. This is the same test used for the common fibular and deep fibular nerves since a lesion of either of them will cause a foot drop.

**Test for Femoral Neuropathy (reverse Lasegue test; Femoral nerve Lasegue test)**

The patient lies prone. The leg is flexed at the knee. The examiner holds the patient’s ankle with his left hand and then raises the patient’s thigh with his right hand. This maneuver places tension on the femoral nerve and L2-L4 nerve roots. If this test causes pain in the presence of a foot drop, this result suggests a lumbosacral plexus lesion.

One can test the motor function of the femoral nerve by having the patient lie supine and flex the thigh at the hip against resistance. One can also have the patient lie on the side with the leg flexed. The examiner then holds the patient’s ankle with one hand and the knee with the other. The examiner then has the patient extend the leg at the knee against resistance.

The same test is performed on the other side for comparison purposes. The presence of what appears to be femoral nerve signs in the presence of foot drop indicates that the lesion involves the L2, L3, and L4 nerve roots with a diagnosis of lumbar plexopathy.

**Tests for Obturator Internus Neuropathy**

The patient lies supine with the thigh flexed at the hip and the leg flexed at the knee. The examiner has one hand on the medial side of the knee and the other on the ankle. The patient then adducts the thigh against resistance to determine weakness or pain due to what appears to be an obturator neuropathy. The other side is tested for comparison purposes.

The presence of what appears to be an obturator internus neuropathy in combination with a foot drop indicates that the patient has a lumbosacral plexopathy (L2, L3, and L4) rather than an obturator internus neuropathy. If pain or numbness is present on the anterior and medial thigh and medial leg (L2, L3, and L4 dermatomes – Foerster) in conjunction with a foot drop (resembling a femoral neuropathy), this is consistent with a lumbosacral plexopathy.

By contrast, a lesion of the obturator nerve would produce weakness in adduction of the thigh combined with pain or numbness in the medial thigh in a much smaller pattern. No foot drop would be present.

**Test for lesion of the Common Fibular Nerve**

The patient is seated at the edge of the examination table with the foot hanging off the edge. The examiner grasps the patient’s foot with one hand and the ankle with the other. He then forces the foot into plantar flexion against resistance. The examiner then tests the other foot for comparison purposes. Pain or numbness should be present on the lateral leg, dorsum of the foot, and over the toes, including the space between the big and second toes. Foot drop is present.

**Test for the Deep Fibular Nerve**

The test is the same as for the common fibular nerve. The presence of foot drop with pain or numbness between the big and second toes is consistent with a lesion of the deep fibular nerve.

For radiculopathy, an MRI of the appropriate area of the lumbar spine should provide evidence of a herniated lumbar disc at L4/L5. Absent this finding, one should search for other causes delineated in this paper.

Confirmation of the lesion by electrophysiological analysis is very important in obtaining an accurate diagnosis.
