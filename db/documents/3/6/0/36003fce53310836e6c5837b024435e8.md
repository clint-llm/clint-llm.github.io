The following are the contraindications of lactulose:

1) Patients with galactosemia: Lactulose, as a result of its chemical composition, contains galactose and is contraindicated in patients who require a galactose-free diet.

2) Diabetics: Although only a small fraction of lactulose undergoes systemic absorption, diabetes patients must use it with caution due to a potential to cause hyperglycemia in diabetic individuals as have been documented in a few studies.

3) Elderly population: Studies comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of other osmotic laxatives such as sorbitol against lactulose have concluded that in the elderly, lactulose causes increased nausea as a side effect. Sorbitol is thus a safer and an inexpensive drug to use in this population.

4) Pregnancy: Pregnancy is a stressor of hemodynamic physiology. Theoretically, via its osmotic action, the prolonged use of lactulose may lead to electrolyte imbalances.
