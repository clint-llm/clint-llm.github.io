Nursemaid's elbow, or "radial head subluxation" is a common injury in young children in which the radial head slips under the annular ligament resulting in pain and inability to supinate the forearm. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical exam and history, and reduction can typically be easily performed in the clinical setting.
