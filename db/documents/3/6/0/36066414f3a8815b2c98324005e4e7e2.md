Pulmonary function tests are performed to assess lung function. Spirometry is the most common and widely used lung function test, followed by diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). It is also known as the transfer factor.

In brief, during a ten-second breath-hold, DLCO measures uptake of CO per unit time per mm of driving pressure of CO (cc of CO/sec/mm of Hg).

The respiratory membrane forms the diffusing barrier. It separates air within the alveoli from blood flowing in the pulmonary capillaries. It consists of the following layers:

- Alveolar epithelium

- Interstitium

- Capillary endothelium

According to Fick's equation for the diffusion of gas

Vg=[k*(A)(ΔP)] / T

- V = volume of gas transferred per unit time

- K = diffusion coefficient of the gas

- A = surface area for gas exchange

- ΔP = partial pressure difference of gas

- T = membrane thickness

from this law, factors that influence the movement of gas molecules across the capillary membrane are the surface area of the membrane (A), the thickness of the membrane (T), driving pressure/pressure gradient across the capillary membrane (ΔP).

As a consequence, the diffusion of gas across the alveolar membrane increases with:

- Increased surface area of the membrane (A)

- Increased alveolar pressure gradient(ΔP)

- Increased solubility of the gas

- Decreased membrane thickness (T)

On the other hand, the diffusion of gas across the alveolar membrane decreases with:

- Decreased surface area of the membrane (A)

- Decreased alveolar pressure gradient(ΔP)

- Decreased solubility of the gas

- Increased membrane thickness (T)
