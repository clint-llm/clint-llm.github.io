In 1991, an analysis of 203 incidents of cardiac arrest at one teaching hospital discovered that 14% of patients experienced an iatrogenic complication.

There are three identified types of medical errors: systemic errors, cognitive errors, and no-fault errors. System errors are defined as technical or equipment failures, or alternatively, organizational flaws. Cognitive errors include errors deriving from inadequate knowledge by medical practitioners. No-fault errors are made during the provision of health care that could not be foreseen and would be impossible to prevent even by the most careful practitioner.

Appropriate identification of the type of error will allow regulatory boards and policymakers to develop appropriate policies that can reduce preventable medical errors, improving both the quality of patient care, and reducing the liability of medical institutions.
