All GLP-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug.

There is an increased risk of fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis with the use of any GLP-1 analog. The mechanism of pancreatitis is currently unknown but has been demonstrated with postmarketing surveillance. If a patient has a previous history of pancreatitis or develops pancreatitis with this medication, its use should be discontinued.

Semaglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide extended-release, and liraglutide are contraindicated in patients with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer or patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). Studies have shown that liraglutide causes C cell hyperplasia and increased calcitonin release in rodents. Further investigations on humans are necessary to make a more definitive statement.

Exenatide should not be used in patients with end-stage renal disease or CrCl less than 30 mL/min. There are also reports of drug-induced thrombocytopenia with exenatide, and it should be stopped once confirmed on a complete blood count panel.

GLP-1 receptor agonists should be avoided in patients with gastroparesis or inflammatory bowel disorders. They should also be used cautiously in pregnancy. In embryo-fetal studies done on animals, the use of these medications has shown evidence of pregnancy loss and adverse developmental outcomes when exposed to the maximum human recommended dosage. For other GLP-1 agonists, there is insufficient data to determine a drug-associated risk. Therefore, it should only be used when the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus.

There is new evidence to support the use of high-dose liraglutide in pediatric patients for obesity. However, providers should still be vigilant about monitoring and dosage as more high-quality clinical studies are required to assess safety and tolerability.
