Public health interventions should aim at containing the epidemic and attempt to minimize transmission both in the healthcare setting and the community.  Additionally, to the coordinated local response, the WHO under the Global Outbreak Alert and Response network coordinate a global response.  Outbreak containment has seen success in Uganda due to strong political support with the development of local task forces, public education, effective coordination, prompt utilization of community resources and efficient laboratory systems. Cases of confirmed or suspected filovirus infection should undergo management in isolated facilities within affected communities.

Patients should receive education regarding the risks and high mortality associated with filovirus infection along with routes of spread, including bodily fluids and sexual transmission.  Additionally, the importance of reporting suspected cases should have reinforcement, and home treatment should also be strongly discouraged.
