While it is certainly unnecessary to counsel all patients on the importance of shifting from side to side at night to prevent development of CNH, it is important for primary care providers to be aware of the condition and to have a low threshold for advising patients to avoid pressure on their ears should painful lesions with a central crust appear along the helix or antihelix, because a significant proportion of CNH cases can be remedied with conservative measures over the course of several months. Taking a break from headgear or hearing aids, finding a different way to talk on the telephone, protecting the ears from cold, and sleeping on a different side or on a doughnut-shaped pillow can all play important roles in the resolution of CNH. That said, it is important to have a low threshold for biopsy of these lesions, particularly if they are not painful, because they tend to appear in areas that are prone to developing non-melanomatous skin cancer, especially in males over the age of 40 years with an history of skin damage due to sun exposure.
