Ankyloglossiaoccurs most commonly in males.

The most commonly feared complication among physicians is difficulty with breastfeeding that leads to failure to gain weight.

In the majority ofÂ patients in whom ankyloglossia is an incidental finding, the best management is observation and reassurance.

In cases where medical management is necessary, frenotomy is the treatment of choice, can be done in an outpatient setting, and is a very simple procedure with few side effects.
