It is important for patients to recognize the limitations of the monospot test, particularly its lower rates of sensitivity.  If a patient undergoes monospot testing, particularly early on in the disease course, it is crucial that they continue to follow with their health care provider, especially if symptoms persist.  If IM is under suspicion as the cause of symptoms and monospot test has been negative, then it is important to discuss the utility of EBV specific antibody testing.
