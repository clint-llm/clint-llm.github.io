Verrucous carcinoma histologically is composed of large papillary fronds covered by dense keratin. It has relatively indistinct borders in the deep margins as opposed to the well-demarcated borders of benign condyloma acuminate.

A small percentage of patients with vaginal cancer are diagnosed with sarcoma and melanoma. Primary vaginal melanoma is a rare mucosal neoplasm and is more aggressive than cutaneous melanoma.
