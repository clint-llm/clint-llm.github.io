The inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus muscle. The inferior gluteal nerve provides motor function to gluteus maximus, a major muscle involved in hip extension, as well as external rotation of the hip joint. The nerve does not confer any sensation. Injury to this nerve is most commonly iatrogenic in origin and is the most at risk nerve during total hip arthroplasty via a posterior approach. This activity reviews the anatomy and function of the nerve, and the sequelae observed when the nerve is injured, and how nerve injuries are managed by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of inferior gluteal nerve injuries.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of inferior gluteal nerve injuries.
- Outline the management options available for inferior gluteal nerve injuries.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of inferior gluteal nerve injuries and improve outcomes.
