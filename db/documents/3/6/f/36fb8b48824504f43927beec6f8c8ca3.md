Valproate toxicity may occur when increasing the dose of the medication to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. It can also happen when there is a normal total valproate concentration, but the free/unbound drug becomes elevated, as in the case of elderly individuals, in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, pregnancy, renal dysfunction with GFR<50 mL/min/1.73m2, liver disease, and concomitant use of medications that compete for albumin binding sites.

For patients who have bipolar disease or mood disorder, suicidal attempts are possible with an intentional overdose of valproate. However, it is interesting to note that Valproate does not have increasingly significant toxicity when compared to other mood stabilizers.
