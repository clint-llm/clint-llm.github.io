Acute Aortic Syndrome is made up of three distinct pathologies that can present similarly, with overlapping etiologies and predisposing factors.

**Acute Aortic Dissection**

Acute aortic dissection makes up 70 to 80% of all AAS, is caused by a tear in the innermost layer of the aorta, and is commonly heralded by existing cystic medial necrosis or medial degeneration.

**Intramural Haematoma**

There is an ongoing discussion as to the exact cause of IMH. The most widely accepted theory is the spontaneous rupture of the vasa vasorum, which are blood vessels that supply the outer layers of veins and arteries.

**Penetrating Aortic Ulcer**

PAU involves atherosclerotic plaque formation, which leads to destruction and inflammation of the intima and penetrates outwardly through the layers of the aortic wall. PAU can either remain stable or progress to AAD or IMH. In a worst-case scenario, it can lead to aortic rupture or visceral ischemia.

Common predisposing factors for Acute Aortic Syndrome include:

- Hypertension

- Smoking

- Hyperlipidemia

- Cocaine use

- Connective tissue disorders, e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome

- Hereditary valvular disease such as bicuspid aortic valve or coarctation of the aorta

- Vascular inflammation – autoimmune – GCA, Infection – syphilis

- Trauma – deceleration

- Iatrogenic – catheter insertion, valvular or aortic surgery
