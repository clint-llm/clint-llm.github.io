Hydrocodone is one of the most common pain medications prescribed by clinicians and one of the most abused by patients. It is a relatively potent drug for moderate-to-severe pain control in postoperative patients, patients with trauma, or patients with cancer. The combination of hydrocodone with acetaminophen is much more efficacious in several randomized studies without any significant changes in adverse effects. Moreover, hydrocodone/acetaminophen has common use as an antitussive agent. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of hydrocodone/acetaminophen so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of hydrocodone/acetaminophen.
- Outline the approved uses for initiating hydrocodone/acetaminophen therapy.
- Summarize the adverse event profile and contraindications to using hydrocodone/acetaminophen.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance hydrocodone/acetaminophen therapy, improve outcomes, and minimize adverse events and misuse, especially in light of the ongoing opioid crisis.
