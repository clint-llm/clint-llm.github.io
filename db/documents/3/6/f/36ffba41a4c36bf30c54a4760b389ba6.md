The diagnosis ofÂ allergic contact dermatitis is usually established by a combination of history and physical examination, clinical presentation, and a positive patch test. If further evaluation is required, a skin biopsy of an affected area of skin will typically demonstrate spongiosis. However, this finding is unlikely to facilitate differentiation of ACD from other eczematous dermatologic disorders.
