An interprofessional team of nurses and physicians should be familiarÂ with and educate patients and their families on the option of neuromodulation surgery as a last resort for the treatment of these patients.

There is a significant amount of level II evidence for neuromodulation's safety and efficacy in treating refractory major affective disorders and OCD.
