Prolonged and frequent vocal abuse is a significant risk for developing anatomical lesions of the larynx, such as nodules (also known as "singer's nodes") and hematomas and their sequelae. Functional voice disorders also result from vocal misuse or abuse as well as from behavioral health pathology. FVDs may be more easily recognized than other psychosomatic disorders because the clinician can visualize the laryngeal structure and function using a mirror or a flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, and therefore rule out organic disease. Both organic and functional voice disorders can affect multiple vocal parameters, including quality, pitch, and loudness, which can all be very problematic for patients.

Common causes of functional voice disorders include:

- **Phonotrauma**, which is caused by misuse, abuse, and overuse of the voice (yelling, screaming, excessive throat-clearing, and talking with increased loudness).

- **Psychogenic aphonia and dysphonia**, which are most commonly encountered in patients with underlying behavioral health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and conversion disorder. Associated symptoms may include blindness, paralysis, and other apparent neurological symptoms.
