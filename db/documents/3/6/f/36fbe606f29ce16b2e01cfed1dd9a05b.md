Vitamin K refers to a group of fat-soluble compounds. There are several vitamin K-dependent proteins involved in coagulation, bone development, and cardiovascular health. Vitamin K deficiency can contribute to significant bleeding, poor bone development, osteoporosis, and increased cardiovascular disease. According to the National Academy of Science Food and Nutrition Board, the dietary requirements are based on the intake of healthy adults, and the adequate intake is 120 and 90 ug/day for men and women, respectively.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) in newborns can separate into three categories based on the timing of the presentation. Early VKDB presents within 24 hours after birth, classic VKDB presents within the first week, and late VKDB presents between one to twelve weeks of life.
