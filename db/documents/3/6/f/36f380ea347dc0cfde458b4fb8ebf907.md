Trauma to a limb leads to direct tissue damage and local hypoxia due to edema, resulting in acute traumatic peripheral ischemia. The trauma can vary from mild to irreversible and may involve major blood vessels and nerve injuries. For severe injuries, amputations may be required. Sometimes, vascular repair and reimplantation are viable options. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing hyperbaric oxygen therapy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of acute, traumatic ischemia.
- Review the complications associated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute traumatic ischemia.
- Outline the contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute traumatic ischemia.
- Explain a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy for acute traumatic ischemia.
