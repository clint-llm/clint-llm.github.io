The cerebellum attaches to the brainstem by three groups of nerve fibers called the superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles, through which efferent and afferent fibers pass to connect with the rest of the nervous system. The following tables summarize how the cerebellum connects with the cerebrum (Table 1), the brainstem (Table 2), and the spinal cord (Table 3).
