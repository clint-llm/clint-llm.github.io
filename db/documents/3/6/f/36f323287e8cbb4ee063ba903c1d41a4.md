The incidence of non-traumatic pneumothorax is 7.4 to 18 per 100000 people per year.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax often affects young males, tall and thin built, often smokers. The incidence of recurrence is 20 to 60% in the first 3 years after the first episode.

Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces also occur in patients with underlying lung disease; thus epidemiology variesÂ greatly.

Catamenial pneumothorax affects young women of childbearing age.
