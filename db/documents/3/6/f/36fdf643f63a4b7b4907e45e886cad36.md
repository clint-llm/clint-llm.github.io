Gallstone ileus is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, a gastroenterologist, and a general surgeon. Since most of these patients are frail seniors, a critical care specialist should be involved in their care before and after surgery.

The nurse plays a vital role in educating patients with symptoms of biliary colic and acute pancreatitis. The patient should be educated about the symptoms of gallstone ileus and when to seek medical help. Further, when the patient is admitted with bowel obstruction, the nurse should closely monitor the abdominal girth, urine output, and nasogastric residuals. These patients are elderly and are also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and aspiration pneumonia- hence appropriate precautions should be taken. Finally, since obesity is a risk factor for gallstones, patients should be urged to lose weight, eat a healthy diet, and exercise regularly. [Level 5]

**Outcomes**

Only anecdotal reports and small case series exist on the management of gallstone ileus. If the diagnosis is delayed, it carries a mortality rate of 15%-30%. Further, these patients have a prolonged stay in the hospital and develop a wide range of complications such as a prolonged ileus, recurrent bowel obstruction, aspiration pneumonia, and fistulas.
