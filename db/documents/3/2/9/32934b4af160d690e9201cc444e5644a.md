Drying of the skin occurs due to epidermal water loss; this is common in winter months and cold, dry climates. Medications such as diuretics also can exacerbate the drying of the epidermis.

Other factors that contribute to asteatotic eczema include decreased sebaceous and sweat glands in the elderly, friction, frequent prolong bathing in hot water, and the use of degreasing agents.

Less common causes include radiation, nutritional deficiencies (zinc, essential fatty acids), hypothyroidism, drugs such as diuretics and antiandrogen therapy, and malignancies.
