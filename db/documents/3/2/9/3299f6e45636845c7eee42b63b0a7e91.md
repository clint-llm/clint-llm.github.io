Endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) is characterized by left and right ventricular endocardial fibrosis and resultant restrictive cardiomyopathy. EMF is rare in North America but common in the tropical and subtropical regions of the developing world. In endemic areas of Africa, endomyocardial fibrosis is an important cause of heart failure accounting for up to 20 percent of cases. Currently, the exact etiology and pathogenesis of the disease remain unknown. However, because the pathology resembles that seen in eosinophilic cardiomyopathy and hypereosinophilic syndrome, EMF is sometimes considered as part of a disease process that also includes eosinophilic endomyocardial fibrosis. This activity explains the proper evaluation and management of endomyocardial fibrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of endomyocardial fibrosis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with endomyocardial fibrosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for endomyocardial fibrosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of endomyocardial fibrosis and improve outcomes.
