Fall prevention is crucial to avoiding fractures in general. The combined efforts of a primary care physician and a surgeon should aim to optimize bone health and limit factors that contribute to falls. Keeping up with the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations regarding Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning should be followed. The addition of supplements and/or prescription medication should be implemented as seen fit by the treatment team. Assistive devices should be used by individuals who do not feel stable ambulating alone.
