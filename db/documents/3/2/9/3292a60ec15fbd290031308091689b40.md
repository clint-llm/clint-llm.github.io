The innervation of the larynx is similar to other areas of the body with both sensory and motor components. There is superior and inferior innervation, and these nerves' names reflect as much. The superior laryngeal nerve is a branch from the vagus nerve arising above the carotid bifurcation as it descends down the neck. The superior laryngeal nerve then divides into external and internal branches.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve anatomy differs depending on its lateralityâ€”the right recurrent laryngeal nerve branches from the vagus nerve in proximity to the right subclavian artery. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve lies inferior to the aortic arch distal to the ligamentum arteriosus. Both recurrent laryngeal nerves travel superiorly along the lateral surface of the esophagus and trachea, coursing posterior to the thyroid lobes.
