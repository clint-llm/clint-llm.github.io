Classically, in most cases of presumed congenital trochlear nerve palsy, the exact pathophysiology is not well understood. Studies using high-definition magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been done, and these are suggestive of two different pathogenic mechanisms in patients with congenital palsy of the superior oblique. In a majority of patients, the trochlear nerve was absent, and the superior oblique muscle was atrophied. This entity should be considered as a congenital cranial dysinnervation syndrome. In the second group of patients, the trochlear nerve was found to be normal, but the tendon of the superior oblique was presumed to be abnormal.

Cases of acquired post-traumatic palsy of the trochlear nerve have been seen to be associated with mild to moderate degrees of closed head injury.
