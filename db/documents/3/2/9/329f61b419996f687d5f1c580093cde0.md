Pulmonary ventilation, more commonly referred to as breathing, is the movement of air into and out of the lungs. Inhalation is the act of drawing air into the lungs, while exhalation is the expulsion of that air out of the lungs. Breathing involves Boyle’s law, which states that the pressure of a gas decreases as the volume increases if the temperature is held constant.
