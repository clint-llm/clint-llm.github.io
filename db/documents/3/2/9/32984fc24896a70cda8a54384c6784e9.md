Smokeless tobacco keratosis has a guarded but good prognosis; however, the resolution is highly patient-dependent. More advanced lesions may require biopsy and further monitoring for potential malignant changes.

Erythroplakic lesions have a guarded prognosis, as most present with some form of epithelial dysplasia.

Squamous cell carcinoma has a poor prognosis despite therapeutic advances in treatment.
