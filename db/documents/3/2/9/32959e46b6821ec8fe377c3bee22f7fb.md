****MRI****

MRI with and without contrast is the investigation of choice. It delineates relevant anatomy and allows accurate visualization of the syrinx in both sagittal and axial planes. MRI easily reveals the location, size, and extent of the syrinx cavity, the degree of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia. A ubiquitous feature in patients with associated CM1 is compression of retro-cerebellar CSF spaces. MRI also helps to rule out cystic lesions or spinal tumors. Leptomeningeal enhancement indicates infection. MRI can also reveal any arachnoid scarring. One can also study syrinx progression over months or years to document the natural history of syringomyelia.

**Dynamic MRI or Cardiac Gated CINE-MRI Flow Study**

These can analyze CSF hydrodynamics non-invasively. It can diagnose CSF velocity/flow disturbance at the foramen magnum (esp. in patients with <5mm tonsillar ectopia), visualize spinal cord wall motion, and syrinx fluid motion at rest during the cardiac systole and diastole.

**Myelography with High-Resolution CT Scan**

This scan is indicated where MRI cannot be used (patients with metallic implants in the joints, cardiac pacemaker). Delayed CT scans can visualize dye leached into the syrinx cavity. However, some authors have criticized CT myelography for having a low sensitivity in detecting CSF blockage.

Electromyography has no diagnostic value in syringomyelia, but it helps to rule out peripheral neuropathy causing paresthesias.
