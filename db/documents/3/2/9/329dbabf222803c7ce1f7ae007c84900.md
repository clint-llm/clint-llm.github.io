Of the general population referred for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for all indications, 5.5% have valvular strands, and the number drastically increases to 40% in patients referred for cryptogenic stroke. Lambl excrescences are detected in both adults and children. However, the prevalence is higher in adults than children and increases with age. On an echocardiogram, the prevalence peaks from age 61 to 70 and then falls after that due to aging heart valves getting more and more calcified resulting in underdetection of Lambl excrescences in relation to the calcified valves. Also, the incidence is relatively more common in men than women. Even though Lambl excrescences are reported to grow on all native and prosthetic valves, prevalence is more on the left-sided heart valves, aortic more than mitral. Lambl excrescences when asymptomatic and followed over several years, appear to remain stable and intact without significant morphological changes.
