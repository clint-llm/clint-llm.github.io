Pharmacological stress testing is a highly supervised procedure conducted under expert medical personnel supervision either in clinic or hospital. During the procedure, the patient will have electrodes attached to their chest, and also their vital signs are continuously monitored. The stress agent is injected through a peripheral intravenous line, which will increase blood flow through the coronary vasculature and mimic a response similar to exercise stress testing. Once a peak effect is attained, a small amount of radioactive material is inserted through the peripheral intravenous line. After that, a high-resolution gamma camera takes several pictures of the heart to get a better visualization of your coronary vasculature. During the resting phase, the gamma camera will take additional pictures which can be used as a comparison to the stress-induced perfusion imaging.
