Multiple conditions can present with pancytopenia; hence, when someone shows up with pancytopenia, a complete evaluation is performed to detect the cause of pancytopenia. Bone marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia, myelofibrosis, megaloblastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and Fanconi anemia can present with pancytopenia.

Fanconi anemia is the most common congenital cause of bone marrow failure with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In myelofibrosis, the bone marrow cells are replaced with fibrotic tissue. Malignancies such as lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and hairy cell leukemia can also present with pancytopenia. Non-bone marrow conditions present with pancytopenia include systemic lupus erythematosus and infections (such as parvovirus B19, Epstein Barr virus, HIV, hepatitis, leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, malaria, and histoplasmosis).
