Azithromycin is available for both oral and parenteral (intravenous) administration. The extended-release formulation of azithromycin has been discontinued. The usual dose is 250 mg or 500 mg, given once daily for 3 to 5 days, and in severe infections, a higher dose is used. A single dose is occasionally used at 30 mg/kg for otitis media and at 1 g for adults with Chlamydia.

- Oral formulations include tablets (250 mg, 500 mg), packets (1 gram dissolved in ¼ cup or 60 ml of water), and suspension for reconstitution (100 mg/5 ml, 200 mg/5 ml). Dosing can be administered with or without food.

- Intravenous (IV) azithromycin is available in a 500 mg preservative-free solution for reconstitution. It should be infused over at least 60 minutes, and azithromycin administration should not be via intramuscular injection or IV bolus.

- The ophthalmic solution (1%) is available in a 2.5 ml bottle which is used in bacterial conjunctivitis.

Azithromycin demonstrates excellent tissue penetration and intracellular accumulation. Metabolism is hepatic, and excretion is mainly biliary.

Azithromycin may be administered to patients with renal disease or failure without regard for creatinine clearance. No dose adjustment is usually necessary.
