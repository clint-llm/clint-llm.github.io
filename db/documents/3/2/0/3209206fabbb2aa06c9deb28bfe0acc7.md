Limiting exposure and removing the patient from the exposure area, such as in a house fire or occupational exposure, and maintaining a secure airway are paramount. Airway protection should include considering early and preemptive intubation for patients with inhalation injury.

- Maintain secure airway: Intubation, tracheostomy if necessary

- Obstruction often results in edema, hemorrhage, and mucosal sloughing, and aggressive pulmonary hygiene can help to manage these secretions. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is often used as a mucolytic, and it may have a role in inactivating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nebulized NAC also may irritate airways causing bronchoconstriction; therefore, pretreatment with a bronchodilator should be considered.

- Obstruction may also occur due to airway reactivity, for which bronchodilators should be used. Beta-2-adrenergic agonists, including albuterol and salbutamol, as well as muscarinic receptor antagonists, such as tiotropium, have been shown in animal models to improve pulmonary functioning in smoke inhalation injury as reported by Palmieri et al. and Jankam et al.

- Usage of steroids, in either inhaled or intravenous form, has not been proven beneficial in clinical studies.

- Early/prophylactic antibiotic usage is not recommended. Patients with inhalation lung injury have been studied and found to have greatly increased rates of pneumonia. A study conducted at one institution reported a 4-fold increase in pneumonia for patients with an inhalation injury. Therefore, antibiotics should be started promptly when an empiric diagnosis of pneumonia is made.

- Anticoagulation: Nebulized heparin has shown some promise as a treatment specifically for smoke inhalation injury. The mechanism of action is by reducing inflammatory response and fibrin cast formation, which helps to reduce airway obstruction. Treatment is often with 5000 to 10,000 U nebulized heparin every 4 hours given with alternating doses of bronchodilator and NAC.

Specific treatments may vary depending on other factors, as often inhalation injury may present with systemic toxicities, for example, carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide poisoning in smoke inhalation injury.

- Carbon monoxide treatment includes high oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO) has been shown to increase the clearance rate of CO from blood, but its limited availability restricts its usage. Most health care centers instead use 100% FiO2 oxygen therapy for treatment.

- Hydrogen cyanide poisoning is difficult to determine in many cases. Testing results are not readily available. One antidote, hydroxocobalamin, may be given in patients with high suspicion of cyanide poisoning. It is nontoxic and renally excreted. Side effects do include redding of the skin and urine.

Accurate treatment of possible toxic inhalation injuries is accomplished by identifying the possible compounds inhaled, the duration and relative concentration of exposure, and the water solubility of any toxic inhaled agent.
