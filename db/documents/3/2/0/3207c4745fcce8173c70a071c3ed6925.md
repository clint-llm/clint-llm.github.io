Several causes of anterior interosseous nerve syndrome have been documented. Etiologies can be grouped as either spontaneous or traumatic.

The most common site of AIN entrapment/compression is the tendinous edge of the deep head of the pronator teres muscle.  Other potential sites include:

- The proximal edge of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) arch (the FDS arcade)

- Gantzer's muscle (accessory head of the FPL muscle)

- FDS or FDP accessory muscles

- Arterial thrombosis (radial or ulnar artery have been implicated)

- Lacertus fibrous

AIN syndrome should be clinically differentiating from stenosing tenosynovitis or pathologies limited to local pathology affecting the flexor tendons alone (i.e., flexor tendon adhesions or partial versus complete flexor tendon rupture). The nerve is even normally compressed by the fibrous bands that often originate from the deep head of the brachialis fascia and the pronator teres, and this pressure can increase with minor variations.

Differential diagnosis of the condition consists of a non-compressive neuropathy like brachial neuritis, which might mimic anterior interosseous nerve neuropathy. An FPL tendon rupture is also a possibility among patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. To exclude the differential diagnosis, the wrist must be flexed passively and extended to confirm that the individual has an intact tenodesis effect.
