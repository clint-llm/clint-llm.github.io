In most instances, decubitus ulcers are reported by a patient’s attendant. This is because the lack of sensation at the site of the lesion makes the patient unaware of his injury. There might be staining of the patient’s clothes or bedsheets due to pus or blood discharge. The clinical presentation may vary between different sites of the body as skin, soft tissue, and muscle resist differently to external pressure. The muscle becomes ischemic and necrotic before skin breakdown can occur, which can be deceiving to the clinician’s observation undermining the depth or extent of the ulcer.

The following require examination in a patient with a decubitus ulcer:

- Ulcer history, including etiology, duration, and previous treatment (if any)

- Staging by thoroughly examining the depth of the wound, which this activity will cover in detail under "staging."

- Size (length, width)

- Sinus tracts, undermining, and tunneling

- The presence of drainage

- The presence of necrotic tissue

A detailed discussion of the history and associated conditions follows under "evaluation."
