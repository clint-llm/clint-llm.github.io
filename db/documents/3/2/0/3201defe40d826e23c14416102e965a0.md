Most patients will develop mild to moderate adverse events early in tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and most will resolve spontaneously or be well-controlled.

Adverse events and side effects divide into four grades based on severity.

- Grade 1 would require no change in tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy; however, it may require specific treatment.

- Grade 2 will involve withholding therapy until severity decreases or continuing therapy if symptoms decrease in severity with monitoring. If a Grade 2 side effect is recurrent, dose reduction should be considered.

- Grade 3 should involve withholding therapy until severity decreases and then restarting at a lower dose or withholding till symptoms reach a grade 1 level or less and resume prior dosage. If there is no resolution or Grade 3 side effects are recurrent, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor should be changed.

- Grade 4 events should involve switching tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy when possible.

Vascular System: Ischemic heart disease, ischemic cerebrovascular events, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease have correlations with nilotinib and ponatinib. Higher dosing has been related to higher risks of these events. Cardiovascular risk should undergo evaluation before therapy begins with these agents and should be closely monitored during treatment. Risk assessment and monitoring should include hemoglobin A1C, lipid profile, and serum creatinine. These drugs should be used with caution in patients with a high risk for vascular disease.

Cardiac Function: Ponatinib has an associated incidence of heart failure. The monitoring of cardiac function should be mandatory for patients on ponatinib.

Cardiac Rhythm Alterations: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have the potential to alter the QT interval. Nilotinib has the highest incidence of QT interval prolongation. Ponatinib is associated with QT interval shortening. Electrocardiogram at baseline and periodically in select patients who are on any tyrosine kinase inhibitor and have QT interval prolongation, and for those who are on ponatinib. Nilotinib should be avoided in patients with a high risk for arrhythmias or when other drugs that may alter the QT interval are being administered. Potassium and magnesium levels should be replete before initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in all cases.

Pulmonary System: Pleural effusions can occur with all tyrosine kinase inhibitors but most commonly occurs with dasatinib. Patients with pre-existing lung injuries, chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, and hypertension are at the highest risk of developing pleural effusions. Caution is necessary if patients develop a cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain during therapy, and a chest X-ray must be obtained in such cases. Reports also exist of pulmonary hypertension with dasatinib use. If the development of pulmonary hypertension is suspected, dasatinib should be stopped immediately.

Hepatobiliary System: Hepatotoxicity is common in all tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ponatinib has the highest risk for developing high-grade increases in transaminases. Substances that alter liver metabolism by cytochrome P450 and acetaminophen should be used with caution or avoided entirely—prompt treatment with glucocorticoids in severe cases of hepatotoxicity assists in hepatic recovery.

Hyperglycemia: Nilotinib has been shown to induce hyperglycemia in non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C require monitoring.

Hypercholesterolemia: Nilotinib shows correlations with increases in LDL-cholesterol. Hypertriglyceridemia has been reported with ponatinib. If persistent high-risk hypercholesterolemia develops, appropriate statin initiation may be warranted.

Other Endocrinopathies: Hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia have been reported with imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. Phosphate, calcium, and Vitamin D levels should be tested at baseline and monitored after that. Hypothyroidism may also develop and is treated effectively with hormone replacement.

Myelosuppression: Development is common with all tyrosine kinase inhibitors but is usually limited to the first few weeks to months of therapy. Leukocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets can all be affected; this necessitates close monitoring of blood counts and response to avoid infection and bleeding. Tyrosine kinase interruption, dose reduction, and supportive management with blood products are considerations based on levels of cytopenias, the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and the phase of the disease. Any nutritional deficiencies should be corrected before the initiation of therapy.

Gastrointestinal System: Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting are frequent side effects related to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Diarrhea is especially significant with bosutinib and often requires dose interruption and/or dose reduction. Patients can take their medication with meals to avoid nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, antiemetic and/or antidiarrheal medication can be administered, and close monitoring of hydration status should occur. Gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported with dasatinib. There are reports of increased lipase levels and pancreatitis with nilotinib and ponatinib.

Dermatologic System: Rash development is common with all tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Most cases are dose-related and self-limited. Management can comprise topical therapies, antihistamines, and/or short courses of systemic steroids. In severe cases, prednisone merit consideration with the gradual reintroduction of the offending tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

Kidney Injury: Monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome should be done from the outset of treatment with all tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Otherwise, the development of acute kidney injury may result from imatinib therapy. Dasatinib and bosutinib have also been associated with acute kidney injury but at lower incidence rates. Serum creatinine requires monitoring in these patients, and caution is necessary for patients with renal insufficiency.

Other commonly reported side effects include myalgia, bone pain, ophthalmological changes, and headache.
