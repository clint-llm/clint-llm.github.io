Conditions that can mimic an asthma attack should always be considered in physical examination, particularly if the response to initial resuscitation is not as expected.

Some of these conditions can also be a complication of an actual asthma attack.

- Asymmetric breath sounds and tracheal deviation with hypoxia should prompt evaluation for pneumothorax.

- Mediastinal crunch or crepitus on exam around neck or chest indicate pneumomediastinum.

- Inspiratory stridor should prompt evaluation for tracheal obstruction or angioedema. Evaluation of the oral cavity and neck should consider mass lesions in differentials as well in such a scenario. Prior history of tracheostomy or recurrent intubation should prompt consideration of tracheal stenosis.

- Localized wheezing on auscultation should lead to ruling out of foreign body inhalation, mucous plugging, or focal atelectasis

- Recurrent presentation with status asthmaticus resolved with positive pressure ventilation, particularly in adults, should raise suspicion for excessive dynamic airway collapse (EDAC), confirmed by bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy in a controlled setting.

- The presence of other adventitious sounds like rhonchi or lobar crackles brings pneumonia into the differential.

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- Heart failure

- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

- Vocal cord dysfunction

- Inhalational injury
