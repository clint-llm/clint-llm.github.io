If acute upper airway obstruction goes untreated, it can result in respiratory distress, which causes bradycardia and tiring of the patient, ultimately leading to loss of consciousness and cardiorespiratory arrest.

It is important to recognize the potential complications of the most common cause of upper airway obstruction, which is OSA. Untreated OSA in children can cause cor pulmonale.

The treatment goals are to reduce side effects from OSA, improve sleep quality, and reduce the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). This often takes a multi-disciplinary approach, frequently led by Pulmonology. Once diagnosed, first-line treatment involves weight loss and positive airway pressure use at night.
