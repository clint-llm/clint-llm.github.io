Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) may be of thyroidal or central origin (primary and central CH, respectively). Primary CH can be caused by a defect in thyroid gland development (thyroid dysgenesis) or a defect of thyroid hormone biosynthesis (dyshormonogenesis). The majority of CH is due to thyroid dysgenesis (80%), which encompasses a variety of defects, including agenesis, ectopic, or hypoplastic gland. Thyroid dysgenesis is almost always sporadic or nonhereditary, although, in 2-5% of cases, mutations in genes responsible for thyroid gland development (the TSH receptor or the transcription factors PAX8, NKX2-1, or FOXE1) may be found.

While these defects cause permanent CH, the condition may also be transient, a result of transplacental passage of maternal anti-thyroid medications (methimazole or propylthiouracil), maternal thyroid blocking antibodies (in a mother with autoimmune thyroid disease), or iodine deficiency or excess. Iodine deficiency, still an important cause of CH worldwide, especially in iodine-poor regions. Newborns exposed to excess iodine (such as iodine-containing antiseptics, or radiographic contrast agents) may develop hypothyroidism as the synthesis of thyroid hormone is transiently inhibited via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. Central CH is rare and results from a pituitary or hypothalamic abnormality (secondary/tertiary hypothyroidism).
