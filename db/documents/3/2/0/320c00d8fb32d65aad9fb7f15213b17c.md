The olecranon bursa is a fibrous sac that lies between the point of the elbow, the olecranon, and the skin.

In the normal state, the olecranon bursa does not communicate with the elbow joint cavity.

When patients become symptomatic from irritation of the olecranon bursa, the bursa will react by swelling and increasing the secretion of hyaluronic acidÂ and other substances depending on the cause. Thus, precision in diagnosis is fundamental to proper treatment.
