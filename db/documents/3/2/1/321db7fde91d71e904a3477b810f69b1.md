Drug effects are measurable by anti-Xa activity, free fraction of apixaban or rivaroxaban, and thrombin generation. Anti-Xa activity returns to placebo concentrations about 2 hours after a bolus or infusion, but tissue factor pathway inhibitors persist for about 22 hours after giving the drug.

An increase in tissue-factor-initiated thrombin generation is maintained during the infusion and persists for about 22 hours. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of thrombosis.
