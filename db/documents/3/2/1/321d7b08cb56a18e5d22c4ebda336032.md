APUDomas, currently known as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), are a group of heterogeneous tumors that arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. They occur mainly in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. These tumors typically present with organ-specific features. However, they share unique characteristics irrespective of the site of origin. Despite being relatively uncommon neoplasms, their incidence has been increasing over time.

The diagnostic modalities and treatment options have shown tremendous advances for the last decade due to the development in the molecular biology of the tumors. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for localized tumors, whereas systemic therapies are considered for more advanced NETs.
