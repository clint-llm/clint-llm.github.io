Currently, the etiology of BD is unknown but appears to be due to an interaction of genetic, epigenetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors. Heritability is well established.

Although it is difficult to establish causation between life events and the development of BD, childhood maltreatment, particularly emotional abuse or neglect, has been linked to the later development of the condition. Other stressful life events associated with developing BD include childbirth, divorce, unemployment, disability, and early parental loss.

The etiology of BD is thought to involve imbalances in systems associated with monoaminergic neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine and serotonin, and intracellular signaling systems that regulate mood. However, no singular dysfunction of these neurotransmitter systems has been identified.

In a recent neuroimaging review article, the ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group stated, "Overall, these studies point to a diffuse pattern of brain alterations including smaller subcortical volumes, lower cortical thickness and altered white matter integrity in groups of individuals with bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls."
