AAA by definition is a concurrent dilatation of all three vessel wall layers: tunica intima, media, and adventitia, which resultÂ in a transaortic cross-sectional diameter of at least 3 cm. Although cigarette smoking provides the strongest link to AAA development, the exact mechanism by which it does so is not explicitly defined. The response of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and macrophages to cigarette smoke as well as genomic studies demonstrating a genetic predisposition to AAA development are active areas of investigation.
