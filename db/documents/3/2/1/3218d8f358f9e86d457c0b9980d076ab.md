Osteoporosis affects over 10 million Americans causing over 2 million osteoporosis-related fractures.

Romosozumab’s effectiveness and safety in the treatment of osteoporosis and for increasing bone mass density have been evaluated in numerous studies. A phase two study assessing the safety and efficacy of romosozumab confirmed romosozumab’s safety and association with increased bone formation. It decreased bone resorption while demonstrating a significant increase of 11.3% in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine with the recommended 210 mg monthly dose.

The Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis (FRAME) trial confirmed the ability of romosozumab to prevent vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. At 12 months, 1.8% of patients in the placebo group had a new vertebral fracture versus 0.5% in the romosozumab treatment group.

The trial also revealed a continued reduction in new vertebral fractures at 24 months with the transition to denosumab after completing the 12-month regimen of romosozumab.

The STRUCTURE trial compared the effectiveness of romosozumab versus teriparatide in patients transitioning from ineffective bisphosphonate therapy. This trial revealed greater increases in bone mass density in the romosozumab treatment group than in the teriparatide group.

Several studies show promising results for using romosozumab in men with osteoporosis; however, as of 2022, its use in this population is not FDA-approved.
