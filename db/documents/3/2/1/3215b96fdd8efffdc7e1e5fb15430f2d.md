Neurons fire all-or-nothing electrical impulses termed action potentials as they become stimulated. Signaling of neurons involved with different sensory modalities is not as easy to study; however, the organization of the cortex is such that signal processing occurs at multiple levels in multiple locations. In primates models, the encoding of stimuli works as groups of neurons fire based on specific stimuli; the more specific the detail, the fewer neurons are involved. For example, a smaller number of neurons would respond with the recognition of your grandmother’s face than with any human or animal face.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) was a groundbreaking discovery in the 1960s that defined a molecular basis for the formation and storage of memories. In LTP, when two neurons repetitively and simultaneously become activated, the strength of the connection between these cells is strengthened. This synaptic strengthening is commonly referred to as ‘cells that fire together, wire together.’
