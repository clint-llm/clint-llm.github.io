Gestational age is a key piece of data used by healthcare providers to determine when to perform various screening tests and assessments of the fetus and mother throughout pregnancy. Gestational age may be assessed at any time during pregnancy, and several modes of assessment exist, each requiring diverse equipment or skills and associated with varying degrees of accuracy. Obtaining more accurate estimates of gestational age through better diagnostic approaches may initiate more prompt medical management of a pregnant patient. This activity describes the many modalities used to correctly estimate gestational age and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for pregnant patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to assess gestational age with an ultrasound.
- Describe the non-sonographic methods for estimating gestational age.
- Explain the clinical significance of correctly estimating gestational age using ultrasound.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to optimize the use of ultrasound for estimation of gestational age.
