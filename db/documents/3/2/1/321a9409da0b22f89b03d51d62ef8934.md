The initial investigation of choice for glottic cancer is a CT scan of neck and thorax to accurately assess local invasion, nodal disease, and distant metastasis. However, CT scans are unlikely to be of any diagnostic benefit in early T1 cancers that do not involve the anterior commissure, as both local and nodal disease in these cancers is exceedingly uncommon.

A definitive diagnosis is achieved with direct laryngoscopy and biopsy under general anesthetic. Assessment with 0, 30, and 70-degreeÂ rigid endoscopes can provide the most detailed evaluation of the primary tumor and its extension to other laryngeal subsites.
