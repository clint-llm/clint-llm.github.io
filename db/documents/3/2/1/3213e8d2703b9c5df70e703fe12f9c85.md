# Introduction

The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a unique structure within the pericardium, close to the free wall of the left ventricle. It has unique developmental, structural, and physiological characteristics that separate it from the left atrium proper.

# Structure and Function

The left atrial appendage is often described as a small ear-shaped outpouching of the muscular wall of the left atrium. It lies anteriorly in the atrioventricular sulcus, close to the left circumflex artery, phrenic nerve, and pulmonary veins.

In normal cardiac physiology, the LAA is an essential modulator of intravascular volume. In response to increased myocyte stretch, the LAA releases atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) into the coronary sinus. From here, these peptides enter the general circulation and regulate blood pressure and volume via their diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilatory effects.

# Embryology

The left atrial appendage develops during the fourth week of embryonic development as a remnant of the embryonic left atrium (LA), which forms during the third week of gestation.

# Nerves

The left atrial appendage does not have significant nervous innervation.

# Muscles

The left atrial appendage does not perfuse any muscles.

# Physiologic Variants

There are several well-described left atrial appendage morphologies. The LAA classification system has its basis on the shape, the relationship of the LAA to the left superior pulmonary vein, length from the ostium to apex, number of lobes, angle of the fist bend formed by the primary lobe, and the distance from the first bend to the LAA orifice. Based on these features, Wang et. described four classical structural morphologies accounting for the majority of anatomical variants seen.

The “chicken wing” morphology describes an LAA with an obvious bend in the proximal or middle part of the dominant lobe and is the most common variant found in one study of 932 patients to be present in 40%.

# Surgical Considerations

In open cardiac procedures, such as coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), the left atrial appendage is often isolated or ligated. This process is especially important in patients with a history of AF, as isolation and catheter ablation correlates with a decrease in AF recurrence and a reduction in stroke risk.

Furthermore, the addition of LAA occlusion added no significant extra time to heart bypass during the concomitant procedure being performed. Despite removing the proposed source of embolic stroke from circulation, the authors did not recommend ceasing therapeutic anticoagulation following LAA occlusion, given the lack of evidence comparing LAA occlusion alone versus anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Interestingly, despite a hypothesized increase in heart failure one might observe in patients following LAA occlusion owing to the physiologically impaired ability to excrete sodium and water in volume overload from reduced atrial natriuretic peptide production, there was no statistical difference in the incidence of heart failure between the groups in LAAOS III, either immediately post-operatively or at long-term follow-up.

Although providing solid evidence for the use of LAA in the cardiac surgery setting for patients with atrial fibrillation, there remains a question as to the best way to manage ischaemic stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have cardiac surgery planned. Any surgical intervention carries risk, and randomized control trials are needed to interrogate the relative benefit of continuing anticoagulation alone or undertaking LAA occlusion in patients with atrial fibrillation with no cardiac surgery planned.

# Clinical Significance

The LAA is implicated in the pathogenesis of several conditions, including AF and hypertension.

It is well established that the LAA is the primary site of thrombi formation in patients with nonvalvular AF.

The 2018 LAA HOMEOSTASIS study was one of the first studies which examined the impact of epicardial and endocardial LAA occlusion techniques on neurohormonal modulation in humans. This study, consisting of 77 patients, found that after epicardial LAA closure, ANP and BNP levels decrease significantly immediately post-procedure, began to rise at 24 hours, and normalized at three months. In patients undergoing endocardial LAA device implantations, the ANP/BNP levels significantly increased post-procedure and normalized by three months. Of note, epicardial LAA devices were associated with a down-regulation of the adrenergic system and RAAS, resulting in a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure. No such effect was noted in endocardial device implantations.

LAA morphology has demonstrated a correlation with the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Following large imaging cohorts of patients, four main LAA morphologies have been classified: chicken wing, cactus, windsock, and califlower - the former of these four being the most prevelant found in 48% of patients and the other found in 30%, 19%, and 3%, respectively

There have also been reports of tears in the LAA associated with blunt chest wall trauma from motor vehicle accidents. Despite being a rare complication, these injuries correlate with high morbidity and mortality. Approximately 10% of blunt trauma to the chest involves the LAA, and mortality estimates range between 50% to 80%.
