The brachioradialis is an important structure in the volar approach to the radius (Henry approach), which is an exposure used for distal radius volar plating in the treatment of distal radial fractures.

During superficial surgical dissection in the volar approach to the radius, the surgeon must take care to not damage the superficial radial nerve that runs along the undersurface of the brachioradialis or the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve.

Wartenberg syndrome can be caused by compression of the superficial radial nerve resulting in pain in the dorsoradial wrist and hand.
