A full view of the larynx extending from the anterior commissure (if possible without limitation from the epiglottis) posteriorly to the posterior commissure and arytenoid towers is optimal for assessing the mucosal wave. The patient is instructed to produce an /i/ sound at varying pitches and volumes. Sustained phonation is necessary to synchronize the stroboscopic light source. Once the necessary vocal tasks have been performed, the laryngoscope is removed, and the patient is allowed to rest.

Frequently employed maneuvers include asking the patient to sniff rapidly or for a prolonged period or say /i/ between breaths, to evaluate vocal fold mobility and symmetry; say /i-i-i/; produce an /i/ sound at a comfortable pitch, normally, loudly and quietly; produce an /i/ sound in a falsetto voice, normally, loudly and quietly; produce an /i/ sound at a low pitch, normally, loudly and quietly; produce an /i/ sound gliding from low to high, produce an /i/ sound gliding from high to low, count from 1-10, and repeat other specific phrases, such as the days or the week or the months of the year.

The clinician then reviews the video recording. A Stroboscopy Evaluation Rating Form is commonly used to examine different portions of the vocal apparatus and rate the vocal fold movements.

- Amplitude: the lateral extent of vocal fold displacement during the opening phase

- Mucosal wave: pattern of vocal fold tissue deformation

- Vibratory behavior: the presence of any non-vibrating portions of the vocal fold

- Supraglottic activity: extent of laryngeal compression

- Edge: the rating of smoothness/roughness and straightness/irregularities of the vocal fold edges

- Vertical level: on-plane versus off-plane vocal fold contact during the closing phase

- Phase closure: the rating of open vs. closed phase duration

- Phase symmetry: rating the percentage of time with symmetry between left and right vibratory phases

- Regularity: rating the percentage of time with regular vibration

- Glottal closure: describing the shape of the glottis at closure
