A history of trauma to the left upper quadrant should increase suspicion of splenic injury. The patient may exhibit a Kehr sign, a pain in the left shoulder that worsens with inspiration. Abdominal tenderness and peritoneal signs are common presentations and should warrant further assessment. Abdominal wall contusions, hematoma, and/or splenomegaly may be present. An unremarkable physical exam should not exclude splenic injury in a patient with a positive history or symptoms.
