The abdominal muscles assist in the process of respiration, protect the inner organs, provide postural support, and serve to flex, extend, and rotate the trunk of the body.

The four main abdominal muscle groups, from innermost to outermost, can be remembered by the mnemonic TIRE: Transversus abdominis, internal oblique, rectus abdominis, and external oblique.perpendicular to this.

A midline raphe, the linea alba, is formed from the interweaving of the aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis.

The aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle splits to encapsulate the rectus abdominis muscles above the arcuate line, however, below the arcuate line, both the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis are **anterior**to the rectus abdominis.
