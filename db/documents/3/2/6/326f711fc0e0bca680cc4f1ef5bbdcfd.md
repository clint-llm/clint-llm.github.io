Lifestyle medicine is the evidence-based practice of helping patients adopt and sustain behaviors that promote health and improve quality of life. Lifestyle medicine emphasizes six pillars of healthy habits: nutrition, exercise, relationships, stress, sleep, and substance use. Combined, these habits become a risk or protective factor for each person's physical and mental health and can also be modified to improve quality of life. This activity reviews the relationship between emotional distress and poor health, as well as their connection to modifiable lifestyle choices, to adequately equip healthcare team members to assess and intervene in the primary care setting.
