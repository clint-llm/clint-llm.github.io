The clinical criteria, as proposed by Duymaz et al. favoring a diagnosis of PRS over scleroderma, are:

- Unilateral facial atrophy

- Absent/minimal signs of prior inflammation or induration

- Skin atrophy with thin, soft skin and no sclerosis

The clinical symptoms and features to look out for during history taking and physical examination are:

**Facial**

- **Facial atrophy:**Progressive facial asymmetry due to atrophy of the subcutaneous fat, muscles, and underlying bones - the most common clinical finding

- **Pigmentation:**Hypo- or hyperpigmented lesions over the face and ipsilateral neck

- **Alopecia:**Involving the eyebrow and the eyelashes

**Ophthalmic**

- **Enophthalmos:**Progressive enophthalmos secondary to atrophy of retrobulbar fat and the alterations in orbital anatomy due to bone atrophy

- **Eye-lid alterations:**Pseudoptosis secondary to enophthalmos, lid retraction, lagophthalmos, eyelid atrophy, and late-onset eyelid pseudo-coloboma.

- **Orbital tumors:**Orbital neurinoma - an incidental finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

- **Extraocular muscle (EOM) changes:**Thinning or fibrosis of EOM, sudden onset horizontal or vertical strabismus, nystagmus, and diplopia.

- **Conjunctival pigmentation:**Abnormal pigmentation of the palpebral conjunctiva

- **Scleral finding:**Spontaneous scleral melt

- **Corneal manifestations:**Reduced corneal sensations, reduced stromal nerve fibers on confocal microscopy, exposure to keratopathy with secondary infective keratitis, keratitc precipitates, primary endothelial failure, stromal edema, band-shaped keratopathy, and flour-like deposits in the corneal stroma.

- **Uveal changes:**Acute uveitis with iritis, iridocyclitis, vitritis, panuveitis, iris atrophy, iris crystalline deposits, and Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis.

- **Lens findings:**Cataract and lenticular dislocation

- **Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) alterations:**Rise of IOP with acute trabeculitis or end-stage neovascular glaucoma, and ocular hypotony with iridocyclitis, ciliary body hypotrophy, or atrophy

- **Retinal findings:**Retinal vasculitis, neuroretinitis, telangiectasia, pigment epithelial changes, retinal folds, exudative retinal detachment (RD), Coats disease, central retinal artery occlusion, chorioretinal atrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa like changes

- **Involutional stage:**Multiple vitreoretinal or glaucoma filtration surgeries predispose the globe to involutional changes

**Neuro-ophthalmological**

- **Optic nerve involvement:**Optic neuropathy and papillitis

- **Cranial nerve palsy:**Oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsy, with restrictive strabismus

- **Anisocoria**: Horner syndrome and tonic pupil - due to autonomic disturbances

**Neurologic**

- **Epilepsy:**Focal, generalized seizures or status epilepticus

- **Pain:**Headche, trigeminal neuralgia, and facial pain

- **Cerebro-vascular accidents:**Ischemic stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, microinfarcts, microhemorrhages, and subsequent cerebral atrophy

- **Vascular malformations:**Aneurysms, cavernoma, hypoplastic or stenotic vessels

- **Movement disorders:**Muscle spasms, synkinesia, pyramidal symptoms, dystonia, torticollis, and gait disturbances

- **Speech abnormalities:**Aphasia and dysarthria

- **Limb abnormalities:**Limb weakness, pain, or atrophy in rare cases

- **Neuropsychiatric manifestations:**Cognitive disturbances, hallucinations, and psychiatric disorders

**Maxillofacial**

- **Bony changes:**Hypoplasia of the maxilla, zygomatic bone, mandible, temporal, and rarely frontal bones

- **Oral manifestations:**Unilateral tongue atrophy, gingival atrophy, atrophy of hard palate, and abnormal development of the teeth

**Cardiac**

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and rheumatologic heart disease

**Endocrine**

- Hashimoto thyroiditis and metabolic disorder.
