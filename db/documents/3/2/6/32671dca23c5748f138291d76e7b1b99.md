The use of nalbuphine and other potent opioid medications requires an interprofessional team approach to patient management involving physicians, nurses, and pharmacists to ensure patient safety, beginning with medication ordering, preparation, administration, and patient monitoring following administration of the drug. Although nalbuphine is not classified as a controlled substance under the controlled substances act, it is still a prescription medication, and caution should be undertaken with its use. The responsibility falls on all healthcare professionals on the healthcare team to inform patients of possible increased risk associated with opioid medications in an effort to protect patients from the dangerous adverse effects of this class of medications.
