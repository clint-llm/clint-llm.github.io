Most of the nontoxic goiter patients are asymptomatic. The swelling may be discovered accidentally by the patient or others. Some individuals may have compressive symptoms like dysphagia, dyspnea, and hoarseness of voice due to mechanical compression of laryngeal nerves by the nearby huge goiter. Large thyroids may compress neck veins leading to facial congestion and discomfort. Pain is rare and it may be severe and incremental when there is bleeding in a nodule and it may be associated with sudden changes in the goiter.

On physical examination, there will be a central neck swelling that could be smooth or nodular and the mass moves with swallowing. It may deviate the trachea or extend retrosternally. Any cervical lymphadenopathy should suggest malignancy: a workup is warranted. Vocal cords must be examined in cases of hoarseness or before and surgical intervention.

When the patient is asked to elevate the arms, it lifts the goiter into the thoracic inlet and may cause stridor, dyspnea or enlargement of the neck veins (Pemberton maneuver).
