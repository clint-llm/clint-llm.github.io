- Bupropion toxicity is most frequently associated with seizures; other emergent risks include dysrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.

- Treatment is mainly supportive, with benzodiazepines used first-line for seizures.

- Refractory status epilepticus or hemodynamic instability has successfully been treated with intravenous lipid emulsion therapy.

- ECG should be obtained to evaluate for conduction delays. However, traditional treatmentÂ for QRS widening with boluses of sodium bicarbonate may be ineffective given the mechanism of bupropion-induced conduction delays.

- Adolescents are at increased risk for severe toxicity than other pediatric patients and are more likely to intentionally overdose.
