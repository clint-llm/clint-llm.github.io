TKIs are generally well-tolerated, especially when compared to non-targeted cancer therapy. However, only a few of these drugs are selective for only one target. Due to the ubiquitous physiological role protein kinases play in the body, toxicities affecting various organs can occur. Organs commonly affected include the heart, lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, thyroid, blood, and skin.

The toxicity and efficacy of TKIs are often closely linked; this allows on-target toxic effects to act as biomarkers of effective pharmacological inhibition for certain TKIs. For example, skin rashes can serveÂ as a monitoring mechanism for the effects of some TKIs that target EGFR and hypertension and can generally help monitor the inhibition of VEGFR.

The optimal TKI of choice and dose is a requirement to reduce toxicities and adverse events. While TIKs are mainly administered at a fixed dose, several factors must guide dosing when devising an optimal TKI regimen. These factors include drug-drug/drug-food interactions, genetic polymorphisms of ABC transporters, patient adherence, intestinal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination.
