Traumatic oral injuries account for 5% of all physical injuries in all age groups, and in pre-school children, the proportion increases to 17%.

A global epidemiological study by Petti estimated worldwide TDI prevalence in primary and permanent dentitions. It concluded that more than one billion living people sustained a traumatic dental injury, which would rank fifth if included in the list of the worldâ€™s most frequent acute/chronic diseases and injuries.
