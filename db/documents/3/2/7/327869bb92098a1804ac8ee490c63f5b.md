Cervical spondylotic myelopathy frequently involves compression of the lateral corticospinal tracts resulting in (voluntary skeletal muscle control) and the spinocerebellar tracts (proprioception). Together, these deficits are responsible for the wide-based spastic gait with clumsy upper extremity function that is classic to cervical myelopathy. Additional commonly involved spinal cord regions are the spinothalamic tracts, which are responsible for contralateral pain and temperature sensation, the posterior columns, which are responsible for the ipsilateral position and vibration sense, and the dorsal nerve root, which is responsible for dermatomal sensation.
