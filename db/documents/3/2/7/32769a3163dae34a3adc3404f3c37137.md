The aviation and aerospace industries are often credited for being the first to embrace simulation training. Many healthcare specialties have widely adopted this practice. Medical simulation replicates clinical care allowing health care workers the opportunity to practice and hone their medical skills without exposing patients to undue risks or harm.  The core aim is to educate learners, assess competency, provide an avenue for research, and improve patient safety. Other benefits may include enhanced gratification with training, refinement of interpersonal communication, and enhancement of the patient experience.
