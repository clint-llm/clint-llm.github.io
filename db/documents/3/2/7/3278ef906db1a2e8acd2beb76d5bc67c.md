**Physical Examination**

Rotator cuff muscles can undergo independent evaluation when the patient presents with rotator cuff syndrome.

- **Supraspinatus muscle**: The evaluation of this muscle is with the Jobe's test, commonly known as the "empty can" test. It is done with a 90 degrees abduction and internal rotation (thumb pointing to the floor) of the arm while pressing down on the arm. The test is positive if this is painful or weak.

- **Infraspinatus muscle**: Evaluation of this muscle is via lateral rotation against resistance with the elbow flexed and the arm in a neutral abduction/adduction position.

- ****Teres minor muscle:****This muscle's evaluation is with the hornblower's test, done with the arm at 90 degrees abduction, the elbow flexed (90 degrees), and doing a lateral rotation against resistance. The test is positive if this is painful or weak.

- **Subscapularis muscle**: Evaluating this muscle uses the "lift-off" and the "bear hug" test. In the lift-off test, the patient brings the hands around the back to the lumbar region with the palms facing outward. The test is positive if the patient is unable to lift the hands away from the back. On the Bear hug test, the patient places the ipsilateral palm on the opposite deltoid and tries to resist the examiner pulling it away anteriorly.

**Rotator Cuff Syndrome**

Rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) describes a spectrum of clinical pathology ranging from minor injuries such as acute rotator cuff tendinitis to advanced/chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy and degenerative conditions.

Rotator cuff injuries represent a common cause of shoulder pain. The rotator cuff tendons, particularly the supraspinatus tendon, are uniquely susceptible to the compressive forces of subacromial impingement. Improper athletic technique, poor posture, poor conditioning, and failure of the subacromial bursa to protect the supporting tendons results in a progressive injury from acute inflammation, to calcification, to degenerative thinning, and finally to a tendon tear.

**Rotator cuff (RC) Tendonitis/Tendinosis**

Acute or chronic tendinopathic conditions that result from a vulnerable environment for the RC secondary to repetitive eccentric forces and predisposing anatomical/mechanical risk factors.

**Shoulder Impingement**

A clinical term often used nonspecifically to describe patients experiencing pain/symptoms with overhead activities. It is best to subdivide shoulder impingement into internal and external conditions:

- **Internal impingement**

- 
              
- The term "thrower's shoulder" refers to a common set of anatomic adaptive changes that occur over time in this subset of athletes.
              
              
- These adaptive changes include but are not limited to increased humeral retroversion and posterior capsular tightness. 
              
              
- Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) is a condition resulting from these anatomic adaptations, and GIRD is known to predispose the thrower's shoulder to internal impingement.

- **External impingement**: a term used synonymously with SIS. External impingement (EI) encompasses etiologies of external compressive sources (i.e., the acromion), leading to subacromial bursitis and bursal-sided injuries to the RC

**History and Physical for RCS**

The primary complaint is shoulder pain localized on the lateral aspect. It worsens with overhead activities, and patients often describe a painful arc during flexion and abduction at 60 degrees to 120 degrees and report pain at night due to lying on the same side. The presentation can be acute or chronic in onset. Young patients usually have an acute presentation because of a recent traumatic event or significant overexertion (e.g., lifting a heavy box). The function is often significantly impaired. Older patients or patients with repetitive overhead activities present chronically, and the loss of strength and function occurs gradually. The range of motion is normal, with positive provocative tests like Hawkins (pain on passive forced internal rotation of the shoulder). The drop arm test is confirmatory. If weakness is present on shoulder abduction, a rotator cuff tear should be suspected (MRI is the best test for diagnosis of rotator cuff tear).

**Treatment for RCS**

The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) suggests patients with rotator cuff problems without tears can be treated conservatively with exercise and NSAIDs. The patient must understand to limit overhead activities and to use ice packs or heating pads. Proper physical therapy effectively treats most patients without subacromial decompression. No difference in outcome has been reported for surgery over physical therapy in several trials. Subacromial injection with steroids showed a short-term benefit in some trials and may improve a patient's compliance with physical therapy. Surgical consultation merits consideration if symptoms do not improve three months after conservative management. Arthroscopic acromioplasty may be a topic to discuss with the patient.

**Partial- versus Full-Thickness Rotator Cuff Tears**

Etiologies and underlying causes are known to be multifactorial. Degeneration, impingement, and tension overload due to trauma may all lead to rotator cuff tears. Most often, the tears initially begin as partial tears of the supraspinatus tendon. Eventually, they can progress to full-thickness tears including all four of the rotator cuff muscles.

It primarily presents in middle-aged to older patients. Repetitive overhead activities are commonly the reason for younger athletes.

**History and Physical**

Pain and weakness are the presenting symptoms. Pain is prominent over the lateral deltoid, worsens with overhead activities, and by lying on the side at night. The absence of pain, however, does not exclude the diagnosis because a chunk of patients may also be asymptomatic. In fact, partial thickness tears cause more pain and disability than full-thickness tears. Painful arc test, drop arm test, and weakness in the external rotation is the most common observations on physical examination.

X-rays are usually normal and can help in diagnosing large rotator cuff tears if imaging shows humeral migration over the glenoid, and the patient has a symptomatic shoulder.

MRI can provide key information as to the degree of muscle tear, tendon retraction, and muscle atrophy, which is critical in planning for rotator cuff repair.

**Treatment**

Conservative treatment with NSAIDs, and most importantly, physical therapy, should be the first attempt at therapy. Surgical treatment with arthroscopy is done in cases of both acute or chronic full-thickness tears since delay can result in significant muscle atrophy, tendon retraction, and poorer surgical results.
