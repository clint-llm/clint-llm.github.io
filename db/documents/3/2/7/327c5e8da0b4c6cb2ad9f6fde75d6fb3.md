Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN), also known as alloimmune HDFN or erythroblastosis fetalis, is caused by the destruction of red blood cells (RBCs) of the neonate or fetus by maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The formation of maternal antibodies in response to a fetal antigen is called isoimmunization. These antibodies form when fetal erythrocytes that express certain RBC antigens that are not expressed in the mother cross the placenta and gain access to maternal blood. This antibody response may be sufficient enough to destroy fetal red cells leading to hemolysis, the release of bilirubin, and anemia. The severity of the illness in the fetus depends on various factors, including the amount and strength of antibody produced by the mother, the gestational age of the fetus, and the ability of the fetus to replenish the destroyed RBCs and clear bilirubin.
