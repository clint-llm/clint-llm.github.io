Dialysis catheters are artificial indwelling transcutaneous conduits used to access the intravascular space or intraperitoneal space for renal replacement therapy. Different types of catheters are used for different dialysis modalities: wide-bore central venous lines are used in extracorporeal renal replacement therapy (which hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, and ultrafiltration), while smaller transabdominal lines are used in peritoneal dialysis. This activity reviews the different types of dialysis catheters, their indications and contraindications, and the techniques involved in placing dialysis catheters. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing dialysis catheter placement.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how to place a hemodialysis catheter in the internal jugular vein.
- Summarize absolute and relative contraindications to different types of dialysis catheters.
- Review the complications associated with dialysis catheters.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to extend the life of dialysis catheters and minimize complication rates in the clinical setting.
