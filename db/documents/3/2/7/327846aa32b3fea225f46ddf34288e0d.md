A systemic inflammatory response syndrome score of 2 or more on day 1 of hospitalization is more likely to develop multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), have a more prolonged ICU stay, and have a higher need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, blood and blood products.

The median time interval from SIRS to sepsis in the continuum is inversely related to the number of SIRS criteria met on admission.

Interestingly the mortality rates in Rangel-Fausto et al. study were 7% (SIRS), 16% (sepsis), 20% (severe sepsis), and 46% (septic shock).

Whereas in a similar study on in-hospital mortality, Shapiro et al. reported mortality rates of  1.3% (sepsis), 9.2 % (severe sepsis), and 28% (septic shock).

The difference reflects upon a change in practice patterns over a decade (Rangel – Fausto study was in 1995 while the Shapiro et al. study was published in 2006) with more adherence to early goal-directed therapy and use of proven risk reduction approaches like DVT prophylaxis, blood glucose control, lung-protective tidal volume in mechanical ventilation, daily awakening and early ambulation.

Another interesting observation of the study by Shapiro et al. was that the presence of SIRS criteria alone did not correlate with in-hospital or 1-year mortality. Organ dysfunction did prove to be a better predictor of mortality, thus validating the significance of SOFA and q SOFA scores.
