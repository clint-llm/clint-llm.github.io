Problems with urinary continence are common in patients with myelomeningocele. They are at increased risk of urinary tract infections and, subsequently, renal dysfunction. Intermittent catheterization reduces the risk of renal disease. These patients also have an increased risk of bowel incontinence and issues with bowel motility. A comprehensive bowel management routine, including routine use of laxatives, enemas, and suppositories, should be adopted to avoid complications.
