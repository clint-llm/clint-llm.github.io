The precise role SMN protein plays in neuronal function and development is not fully understood, and its subsequent absence causing such devastating deficits has so far eluded precise pathophysiological descriptions. SMN protein is found in all eukaryotic cells and has shown to play a crucial role in all cells with regards to homeostatic cellular pathways.

Several hypotheses surrounding SMN protein and its role in SMA exist, two main hypotheses relate to SMN protein’s role in 1) The neuronal cytoplasm and 2) the neuronal nucleus. SMN protein in the cytoplasm has demonstrated a vital role in mRNA transport through axons, actin dynamics, and vesicle release in the synapse. In the nucleus, SMN protein forms small nuclear RNA’s (snRNA) and therefore plays a key role in the formation of the spliceosome, which removes introns in pre- mRNA into functional mRNA.

This explanation hypothesizes the damage motor neurons specifically to either neuronal sensitivity to spliceosome malfunction directly or indirectly through incorrectly spliced mRNA creating dysfunctional proteins key to neuronal function.
