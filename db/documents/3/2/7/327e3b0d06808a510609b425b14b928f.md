While there is limited experimental research done to determine the efficacy of FPR in treating pain and somatic dysfunctions, FPR's similarity to SCS would suggest it can be useful for many of the same indications. Research on the use of SCS and FPR for the treatment of piriformis syndrome, iliacus, and psoas dysfunction is also limited; however, it is part of the osteopathic physicians' curriculum and practice. However, like most osteopathic techniques the use of SCS and FPR is contraindicated in individuals whose tender-point is in an area with an inflammatory process that may be caused by problems other than somatic dysfunction (such as infection), a patient is unable to communicate for tenderness feedback, or the patient cannot handle manual therapy.
