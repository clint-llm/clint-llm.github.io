Differential diagnosis of Chilaiditi syndrome include:

- Pneumoperitoneum

- Diaphragmatic hernia

- Subdiaphragmatic abscesses

- Bowel perforation

- Bowel obstruction

- Ogilvie syndrome

- Intussusception

- Volvulus

- Ischemic bowel

- Appendicitis

- Diverticulitis

If normal plicae circulares or haustral markings of the colon under the diaphragm are seen, entities like subphrenic abscess can be ruled out. When using ultrasound, changing the position of the patient would not change the location of the gas, which would not be in the case of a pneumoperitoneum. It is important to make the correct diagnosis as confusing Chilaiditi syndrome with another more serious condition can lead to unnecessary surgical intervention. It is also important to recognize Chilaiditi sign or syndrome in a patient undergoing liver biopsy as the abnormally positioned bowel is at risk for perforation, especially during percutaneous transhepatic procedures.
