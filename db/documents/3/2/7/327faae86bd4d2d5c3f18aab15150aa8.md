Many patients experience significant motor recovery following cord ischemia/infarction although the prognosis is challenging to predict.Â In one series, approximately 42% of patients showed some or marked improvement whereas 36% showed little or no improvement. The series also observed that patients with sparing of knee extension and hip abduction might have a better prognosis.

Patients with ASA syndrome have the worst prognosis relative to other patterns, presumably due to the more considerable extent of cord infarction. Reports indicate that older age at presentation and severity of deficit at nadir are predictive of poor outcomes.

A recent study with long-term follow-up (average over 7 years) compared functional outcomes of patients with cerebral and spinal cord infarction and found that spinal patients had higher rates of employment and lower mortality but higher rates of chronic pain and lowered functional independence (modified Rankin scale).
