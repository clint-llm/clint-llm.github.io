**Pathology**

Given that the integumentary system has direct exposure to external threats such as physical trauma, radiation, extreme temperatures, microorganisms, etc., it can fall susceptible to wounds, infections, burns, cancers, and more. The integumentary system is unique in that pathologic conditions are often directly visible to patients, and at times the system reflects pathologic conditions that may be occurring internally. The following are common conditions that can appear throughout components of the integumentary system:

**Skin:******

**Acne**– Acne is a very common condition that involves inflammation of the pilosebaceous unit caused by the overproduction of keratin within hair follicles, increased sebum production, andCutibacterium acnes mediated inflammation.C. acnes and increasing inflammation.

**Atopic dermatitis**– More commonly referred to as eczema, this is a chronic condition that affects both children and adults. Multiple factors such as defects in epidermal junctions, reduced innate immunity in the skin, and genetics appear to contribute to the development of this condition.

**Psoriasis**– Chronic plaque psoriasis is the most common subtype of psoriasis and involves well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with an overlying silvery scale.

**Cellulitis**– Cellulitis is an infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous fat that presents with areas of erythema, edema, and warmth.Streptococcus pyogenes and less often Staphylococcus aureus due to skin barrier disruption, and patients with non-purulent cellulitis should receive empiric therapy for these organisms.

**Cancer**

Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from epidermal keratinocytes that commonly arise in areas of sun exposure.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common skin cancer and is a locally invasive cancer that arises from the basal layer of the epidermis. Ultraviolet radiation is the most significant risk factor that causes mutations in several tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.

Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer due to its potential to metastasize quickly and can be divided into four subtypes—superficial spreading, nodular, lentigo maligna, and acral lentiginous. They arise as a superficial tumor confined to the epidermis but can undergo a vertical growth phase, resulting in increased tumor thickness. Thickness is measured by Breslow's depth, which is a measurement starting from the granular cell layer of the epidermis and is the most important prognostic factor. Melanomas can be detected clinically using the ABCDE criteria (asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, diameter >6mm, and evolution over time).

**Burns**—Burns result from excessive heat, radiation, or chemical exposure, and grading the severity of the burn is by the depth and area of skin involvement. Burns are treated as emergencies, as severe burns can lead to dehydration, sepsis, and death.

- Superficial: involves only the epidermal layer and does not blister. Lesions are painful, dry, red, and blanch. Injuries generally heal without scarring.

- Partial-thickness: involves the epidermis and dermis partially. This type of burn can further subcategorize into superficial and deep, depending on the extent of dermis involvement. Superficial partial-thickness lesions form blisters, are painful, blanch with pressure, and weep. Deep partial-thickness burns damage hair follicles and glandular tissue. They are painful to pressure only, do not blanch, and have mottled colorization. They can cause hypertrophic scarring and functional impairment with delayed healing.

- Full-thickness: extend through all layers of the dermis and often subcutaneous tissue. The lesions are generally dry without blistering and do not blanch with pressure. Eschar (dead dermis) may be present and can compromise a limb if circumferential.

- Fourth degree: these are the most severe burns that extend beyond the skin into soft tissue and can involve any underlying structures.

**Hair**

**Alopecia areata –**This is an autoimmune condition that involves loss of immune privilege at the hair follicle in addition to T cell-mediated attack on cells of the hair bulb, leading to hair follicles that transition from the growth phase (anagen) to nonproliferative (catagen) and resting (telogen) phases. This situation results in hair shedding in any hair-bearing area, though it most commonly occurs on the scalp. It is a nonscarring condition that can sometimes self-remit with spontaneous hair regrowth, sometimes even without treatment. There are several patterns of hair loss, such as patchy, ophiasis, sisaipho, and diffuse, with patchy alopecia being the most common subtype.

**Folliculitis**– Folliculitis is inflammation of the hair follicle that presents clinically with follicular pustules and erythematous papules. It may have an infectious or noninfectious etiology and can be due to bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic infections. A bacterial infection is the most common etiology, withStaphylococcus aureus being the most common causative bacteria. People will generally experience pruritus over hair-bearing areas and can occasionally have painful pustules and papules. Folliculitis barbae is a subtype of bacterial folliculitis that affects deep portions of the hair follicles in the beard areas.

**Male pattern balding**– This is a condition with a genetic predisposition in which hair loss occurs in an androgen-dependent manner. Hair follicles undergo follicular miniaturization, which is shortening of the growth phase (anagen), and transition from dark terminal hairs to thin vellus hairs. This process initiates when dihydrotestosterone binds to androgen receptors in the hair follicle and progresses as an increasing number of follicles are affected.

**Nails**

**Onychomycosis**– Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the toenails or fingernails and can result from dermatophytes, yeasts, and non-dermatophyte molds. The condition is acquired through direct contact, and a compromised nail barrier increases the chances of infection.

**Pitting**– Nail pitting occurs due to focal abnormal keratinization of the nail matrix that results in irregular, deep pits within the nail plate as it grows beyond the cuticle. It can affect a single nail or multiple, can involve the fingernails and/or toenails. It presents in conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and alopecia areata.

**Koilonychia**– Also called spoon nail, this condition involves the upward curving of the distal nail plate that gives the appearance of a spoon. It has been associated with iron deficiency anemia but can be due to idiopathic changes.

**Clubbing**– Digital clubbing is characterized by increased nail plate curvature and thickness of the distal fingertip. Clinically, there is flattening of the angle between the nail plate and the nail fold on the side view. It is caused by platelet precursors that fail fragmentation and later get trapped in the distal digit vasculature. There they will release platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which results in clubbing. It is the most common manifestation of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and correlates with many systemic conditions.

**Glands**

**Seborrheic dermatitis**- Seborrheic dermatitis is a form of chronic dermatitis with unknown pathogenesis that tends to occur in regions with sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, external ears, and center of the face. It presents clinically with erythematous plaques with a yellowish scale and often appears as dandruff when located on the scalp. The cause and predilection for sebaceous glands are not well understood, though studies have suggested that the fungusMalassezia and its byproducts may play a role in the pathogenesis.

**Hyperhidrosis**– Hyperhidrosis is excessive secretion of sweat from eccrine glands with possible apocrine gland involvement in axillary hyperhidrosis.
