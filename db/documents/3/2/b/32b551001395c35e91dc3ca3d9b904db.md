Croup patients are often seen by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, or in the emergency department. An interprofessional team can also include specialty care nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists. It is important to understand that the disorder is self-limited with supportive care measures in the majority of patients. A small number of patients may benefit from pharmacological therapy. However, a community based randomized trial of children with mild to moderate croup found no difference in symptom scores between three daily doses of prednisolone 2 mg/kg and a single dose of dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg.
