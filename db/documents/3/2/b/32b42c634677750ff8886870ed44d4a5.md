Drug-induced AIN is the most common form of AIN. Many over-the-counter and common prescription medications can cause AIN. The clinicians play a crucial role in selecting medication based on patients' conditions and monitoring adverse reactions. A nephrologist should be consulted to evaluate the cause of renal failure and provide recommendations on medication management, renal biopsy, and devise a treatment plan. A pathologist can confirm the presence of AIN on a renal biopsy specimen. Pharmacists and nurses are vital to educating the patients about the adverse effects of medications. In severe cases of AIN, the patient may be hospitalized. Interprofessional care coordination by clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health professionals is vital to enhancing patient-centered care and improving patient safety and outcomes.
