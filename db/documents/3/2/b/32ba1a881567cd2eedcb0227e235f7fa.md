The embryological development of the carotid bodies is unique in origin. The common carotid arteries and the proximal internal carotid arteries derive from the third pharyngeal arch around the fourth and fifth weeks of gestation. The carotid body itself derives from both mesodermal components of the third branchial arch and neural elements from neural crest ectodermal origin.
