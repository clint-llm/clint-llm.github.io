High-altitude pulmonary edema is a largely preventable condition. Lack of knowledge about the prevention, recognition, and treatment of this disease demonstrates why high-altitude pulmonary edema is the leading cause of death associated with high altitudes. This activity illustrates the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of high-altitude pulmonary edema. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in preventing, recognizing, and managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the underlying pathophysiology of high-altitude pulmonary edema.
- Summarize the clinical presentation of a patient presenting with high-altitude pulmonary edema.
- Explain the management strategies for high-altitude pulmonary edema.
- Outline some interventions that clinicians can use to prevent and treat high-altitude pulmonary edema and improve patient outcomes.
