Peripartum mood disorders can be viewed as occurring on a spectrum of severity, with postpartum “blues” being milder and self-limited and postpartum depression more disabling. By its diagnostic criteria, postpartum blues are transient and self-limited. Therefore, it resolves on its own and requires no treatment other than validation, education, reassurance, and psychosocial support.

While postpartum blues symptoms are mild, transient, and self-limited, patients should still be carefully screened for suicidal ideation, paranoia, or homicidal ideation towards the infant. Moreover, home help should be sought to help the patient in getting enough sleep. If insomnia persists, cognitive therapy and/or pharmacotherapy can be recommended.
