The differential diagnosis of thyroglossal duct cysts includes midline neck masses and cystic neck masses, as well as cystic metastatic lymph nodes, dermoid or epidermoid cysts, and second branchial cleft cysts. Cystic metastatic lymph nodes usually originate from either papillary thyroid carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. Dermoid or epidermoid cysts can also be midline cystic neck masses. The close relationship of thyroglossal duct cysts with the hyoid bone is a key feature for differentiation. However, the final differentiation is often not made until pathologic diagnosis. Second branchial cleft cysts are also anterior neck cystic masses. However, branchial cleft cysts are lateral and not associated with the hyoid bone.
