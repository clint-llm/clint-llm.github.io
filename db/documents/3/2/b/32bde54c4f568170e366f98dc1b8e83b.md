The optic chiasm, or optic chiasma, is the part of the brain where the optic nerves cross and is therefore of primary importance to the visual pathway. It is located at the base of the brain inferior to the hypothalamus, and approximately 10 mm superior to the pituitary gland within the suprasellar cistern. It has important anatomical relationships with the third ventricle, forming part of its anterior floor, and the anterior communicating and anterior cerebral arteries.
