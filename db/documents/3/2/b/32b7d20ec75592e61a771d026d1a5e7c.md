The incidence of exotropia was studied by Govindan et al. in their ten-year retrospective study from Minnesota. They found the annual age and gender-adjusted incidence of 64.1/100,000 patients younger than 19 years. Of these, 86% had an intermittent exotropia or convergence insufficiency.

Hashemi et al., in their meta-analysis of 56 articles, found the pooled prevalence of exotropia as 1.23%. They also reported that the heterogeneity among exotropia patients varied directly with age.
