Differentials to be considered in establishing the cause of cough can be divided into categories such as acute, subacute, and chronic. Besides, there are some very rare causes that should be ruled out once the diagnosis is ambiguous.

**Acute**

- Acute bronchitis

- Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder

- Acute rhinosinusitis

- Acute viral upper respiratory infection

- Allergic rhinitis

- Asthma

- Aspiration syndromes

- Congestive heart failure

- Pertussis

- Pneumonia

- Pulmonary embolism

**Subacute**

- Post-infectious secondary to continued irritation of cough receptors via ongoing or resolving bronchial or sinus inflammation from a preceding viral upper respiratory infection

**Chronic**

- Chronic bronchitis

- Chronic sinusitis

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease

- Interstitial lung diseases

- Intolerance to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication

- Malignancy

- Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis

- Obstructive sleep apnea

- A post-infectious cough

- A psychosomatic cough

- Upper airway cough syndrome

**Very Rare**

- Cerumen impaction- vagal nerve stimulation of the afferent branch to the ear, known as Arnold nerve

- Esophageal achalasia

- Tracheoesophageal fistula

- Oesophageal tracheobronchial reflex

- Ortner syndrome: Intermittent left vocal fold paralysis as a result of cardiac ptosis straining the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve

- Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcus (PANDAS): A pediatric cough where prior Streptococcus infections can trigger motor tics including a chronic cough

- Peritoneal dialysis

- Pneumonitis

- Syngamus laryngeus: A small, roundworm indigenous to the Caribbean, Syngamus laryngeus is acquired by ingesting a contaminated fruit or vegetable. A male and female pair of worms take up residence in the subglottic larynx, and there they remain tenaciously adherent to the mucosa, except when mating. The pair may be coughed up in copula; otherwise, they can be endoscopically removed with a resolution of the host’s chronic cough.

- Tracheobronchial collapse

- Vitamin B12 deficiency

- Zenker or distal esophageal diverticulum
