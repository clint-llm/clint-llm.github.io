The blood supply that is provided by the princeps pollicis artery is directed towards the distal fibers of the median, radial, and ulnar nerve. The muscles that receive blood from the princeps pollicis artery are abductor pollicis brevis muscle, abductor pollicis longus muscle, extensor pollicis brevis muscle, extensor pollicis longus muscle, flexor pollicis longus muscle, flexor pollicis brevis muscle, adductor pollicis muscle,Â  opponens pollicis muscle, and first dorsal interosseus muscle. The skin that overlies the thumb also receives perfusion from the princeps pollicis artery.

The lymphatic drainage of the thumb and the hand will drain towards the cubital fossa. At the cubital fossa, the lymph fluid will drain into the cubital lymph nodes. The lymph fluid will drain towards the axilla. Once at the axilla, the lymph fluid will enter the axillary lymph nodes. The lymph fluid eventually returns into the central circulation via the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. The left thumb will drain towards the thoracic duct. While the right thumb will drain towards the right lymphatic duct.
