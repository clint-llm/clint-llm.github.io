As seen above, the development of POUR is multifactorial, involving pain, ambulation, and medication, among many things. POUR usually resolves after the removal/improvement of these modifiable inciting factors. And while acute retention does damage the detrusor, drainage and bladder rest can reverse these changes.

Two important situations tend to buck this trend: patients whose surgeries involved pelvic nerves vital to micturition and patients with severe, unidentified voiding problems pre-existing the surgery.

The prognosis for the former category depends on the degree of surgical destruction to the pelvic neurovasculature sustained during surgery and requires assessment on a case-by-case basis.

The prognosis for the latter category is more difficult to predict. Some predictors of trial without catheterization failure are age greater than 70 years, severe preexisting voiding symptoms, spinal surgery, hydronephrosis, and bladder volumes greater than 1000 mL at the time of catheter insertion.
