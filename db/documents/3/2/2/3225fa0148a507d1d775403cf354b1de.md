The proinflammatory cytokines released from the adipose tissue are responsible for the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. Specifically, at low levels, adiponectin is associated with the formation of coronary artery disease in addition to causing insulin resistance and inflammation. Metabolic syndrome can also trigger a spectrum of liver damage by causing steatosis that can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Histologically, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis presents as steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, Mallory bodies, and pericellular fibrosis. The exact mechanism of developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is unknown however it has been linked to metabolic syndrome and specifically insulin resistance and a proinflammatory state.
