**Central Nervous System**

The central noradrenergic system is composed of two primary ascending projections that originate from the brainstem: The dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNB), and the ventral noradrenergic bundle (VNB).

The DNB originates from A6 locus coeruleus, located in the dorsal pons, and is composed of primarily noradrenergic neurons. It functions as the predominant site of norepinephrine production in the central nervous system. It sends projections to innervate the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum exclusively and has projections that overlap with projections from the VNB to innervate areas of the amygdala, hypothalamus, and spinal cord.

The VNB originates from nuclei in the pons and medulla and sends projections to innervate the amygdala, hypothalamus, and areas of the midbrain and medulla.

**Peripheral Nervous System**

The sympathetic nervous system and neuroendocrine chromaffin cells (located in the adrenal medulla) are primarily responsible for the synthesis and exocytosis of norepinephrine and other catecholamines into the blood circulation. The hormones act on alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle cells and adipose tissue located throughout the body.
