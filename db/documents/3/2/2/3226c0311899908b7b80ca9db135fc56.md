At birth, there is normal physiologic phimosis due to natural adhesions between the glans and the foreskin. During the first 3 to 4 years of life, debris, such as shed skin cells, accumulates under the foreskin, gradually separating it from the glans. Intermittent penile erectile activity, such as nocturnal erections, also contributes to the increased mobility of the foreskin, ultimately allowing it to become completely retractible.
