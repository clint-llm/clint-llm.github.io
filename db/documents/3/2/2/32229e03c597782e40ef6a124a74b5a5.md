**Nonoperative Management**

- Stretching, lifestyle modification, NSAIDs, plus/minus physical therapy

- 
              
- Indication
              
              
- 
                  
- Kyphosis less than 60 degrees and asymptomatic
                  
                

              
              
- Course
              
              
- 
                  
- The majority of patients fall into this category
                  
                  
- Patients typically do well without significant long-term sequelae

- Extension bracing plus “A”

- 
              
- Indication
              
              
- 
                  
- Kyphosis 60 to 80 degrees plus/minus symptomatic
                  
                

              
              
- Course
              
              
- 
                  
- Bracing is typically required for 12 to 24 months
                  
                  
- Most effective in skeletally immature patients
                  
                  
- Typically, does not improve the curve but rather impedes progression
                  
                

              
              
- Braces 
              
              
- 
                  
- Milwaukee brace
                  
                  
- Kyphologic brace
                  
                  
- Thoracolumbosacral orthosis-style Boston brace

**Operative Management**

- Spinal fusion is typically a combination of anterior release + fusion as well as posterior instrumentation + fusion

- 
              
- Indications
              
              
- 
                  
- Kyphosis greater than 75 degrees causing unacceptable deformity
                  
                  
- Kyphosis greater than 75 degrees with associated pain
                  
                  
- Neurologic deficit/spinal cord compression
                  
                  
- Severe refractory pain
                  
                

              
              
- Course
              
              
- 
                  
- The majority of patients experience symptomatic improvement as well as improved curve deformity toward normal
                  
                  
- Operative/postoperative complications must be considered
