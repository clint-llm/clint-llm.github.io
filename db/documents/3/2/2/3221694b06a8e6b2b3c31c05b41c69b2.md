The liver catabolizes toxic ammonia into urea, as shown in figure 1.  This energy-dependent process occurs only within the liver’s mitochondria and cytoplasm. When this process is not working efficiently, toxic ammonia (NH3) accumulates within the body and may elicit clinical manifestations such as lethargy, slurred speech, cerebral edema, and asterixis. Here, we will review the underlying physiology of the urea cycle.
