With rising rates of tuberculosis, the prescription of isoniazid has also increased. And sometimes, isoniazid toxicity occurs because of multiple or inadvertent dosing. Isoniazid toxicity is usually managed by an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, toxicologist, poison control, neurologist, and an internist. In all cases of isoniazid toxicity, the offending agent must first be discontinued. The treatment is generally supportive with hydration and monitoring. If there is evidence of liver damage, small case studies suggest the use of N-acetyl cysteine and corticosteroids. In rare cases, a liver transplant may be required. Today, peripheral neuropathy is rarely seen because most patients are prescribed pyridoxine at the initiation of isoniazid therapy.
