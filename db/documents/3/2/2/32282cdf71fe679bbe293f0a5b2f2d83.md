As mentioned, diaphragm injuries secondary to blunt or penetrating traumas are frequently undiagnosed acutely. The absence of a hyperechoic, curvilinear line above of the liver or the spleen, detected by a FAST (Focal Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) examination during a trauma workup, may be the very first sign of a large diaphragm injury. More commonly, an upright plain film of the chest is often the best initial study, although it can miss up to 50% of all cases. A chest x-ray will frequently show elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side, and visceral herniation can present as diffuse and loculated gas bubbles. This is often misdiagnosed as a pleural effusion or gas-forming empyema, and insufficient suspicion for diaphragmatic rupture can mislead the practitioner into placing a chest tube on the affected side. In severe cases, there may be herniation of other intraperitoneal structures into the affected side. A nasogastric tube can be placed to assist in making a diagnosis, and coiling of the NG tube into the chest on chest x-ray is diagnostic of a diaphragmatic rupture.  In less apparent cases, computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen has higher sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing diaphragmatic rupture compared to a chest x-ray. Interruption of the diaphragm, herniation of abdominal viscera, constriction of abdominal viscera through the defect (the so-called "collar sign"), or free-floating diaphragmatic flaps are all signs concerning for diaphragm injuries.

In cases where concern remains despite imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed.  Alternatively, thoracoscopy performed for the evacuation of retained hemothorax can also be used to evaluate the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm. A 30 or 45-degree scope should be used to evaluate the entire hemidiaphragm for defects. Of note, the risk of tension pneumothorax during laparoscopy is a very valid concern in patients with a diaphragmatic defect, and the patient's vital signs and respiratory status should be carefully monitored during insufflation.

The defects are then graded on an I to V scale, developed by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in 1994 for the evaluation of thoracic, cardiac, lung, and diaphragm injury. Penetrating injuries tend to be low on the scale, involving mere contusions or lacerations less than 2 cm in length. Blunt trauma involving the diaphragm can often lead to greater defects with significant tissue loss.
