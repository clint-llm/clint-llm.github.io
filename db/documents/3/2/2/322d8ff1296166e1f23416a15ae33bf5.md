Clostridial myonecrosis, also called gas gangrene, can rapidly cause death if not immediately detected and treated. It is caused by the anaerobic spore-forming exotoxin-producing bacteria Clostridium perfringens. Immediate diagnosis and treatment are required when gas gangrene is a differential diagnosis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of clostridial myonecrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of clostridial myonecrosis.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with clostridial myonecrosis. 
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for clostridial myonecrosis. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the early detection and treatment of clostridial myonecrosis and optimize patient outcomes.
