Initial symptoms may be vague, including loss of appetite and weight, bone pain, or symptoms related to renal failure. Laboratory workup may reveal abnormal kidney function or worsening chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypercalcemia, and anemia. About 75% of patients present with anemia. Patients with light chain cast nephropathy have acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening CKD and proteinuria. The proteinuria is predominantly monoclonal immunoglobulin known as Bence Jones protein (FLC in the urine). Patients with AL and MIDD can have systemic symptoms that include purpura, gastrointestinal bleeding, the involvement of the heart resulting in arrhythmias, or symptoms related to heart failure. Cardiac involvement is more common in AL. Typically hypertension is seen in patients with cast nephropathy and MIDD due to renal failure. Patients with AL can have hypotension due to the autonomic nervous system and/or cardiac system.
