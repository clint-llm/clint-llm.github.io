Like most medications, beta-blockers are metabolized predominately in the liver( both the active and inactive compounds). Approximately a quarter of the ingested drug reaches systemic circulation due to the first-pass metabolism in the hepatic circulation.

The active metabolite of propranolol is 4-hydroxypropranolol, which is formed through hydroxylation using the CYP2D6 enzyme.

Furthermore, like most ingested medications, propranolol is predominantly cleared by the renal system, with a half-life of about 3Â to 6 hours in patients with healthy renal systems.

Propranolol administration can be either oral or intravenous. With intravenous administration, there should also be continuous electrocardiogram monitoring with a slow infusion. This route of administration primarily occurs in an inpatient setting.

The doses of propranolol vary, being primarily dependent on what condition the medication is treating.
