Pulse oximetry relies on light absorption through a tissue bed with pulsating blood. Therefore factors that interfere with those parameters can interfere with the reading of pulse oximeters. One of the common examples of interfering factors is nail polish and artificial fingernails

Patients with dark skin may have their oxygen saturation overestimated by ~2%. This varies by which device is used. Pulse oximeters can be less accurate at cold temperatures. Warm site temperature (about 33°C) should be maintained for reliable readings.

Intravenous dyes such as methylene blue or indocyanine green that are sometimes used for surgical or diagnostic procedures will color the serum in the blood and may interfere with the light absorption spectrum and give low readings

Dyshemoglobinemias, such as carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and others, will change the color and absorption spectrum of blood and give false readings. In that case, a confirmation with a Co-oximeter should be obtained. Some newer pulse oximeters using multiple wavelengths can display some methemoglobinemias.

Light pollution into the sensor part of the probe can be another interfering factor to an accurate reading, such as certain ambient light or other probes emitting light in a similar spectrum in the vicinity of the pulse oximeter probe. It should be avoided by covering the site or the probe.

Pulsating blood is another prerequisite for an accurate reading. The pulse amplitude in tissue beds is very small and accounts for about only 5% of the pulse oximeter signals to be available for analysis. Any further decrement in pulse wave amplitude such as severe hypotension, cold extremities, Raynaud disease, or other factors such as excessive motion may interfere with an accurate reading. Hospital-grade pulse oximeters usually can read through perfusing cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and premature atrial or ventricular contractions. Most pulse oximeters display the plethysmographic waveform in addition to the saturation number to give the clinician another parameter to interpret the saturation number.

Pulse oximeter manufacturers are trying to mitigate these factors by different strategies with hardware sensor and software algorithm improvements. Therefore, publications reporting limitations of certain pulse oximeters may be specific to that manufacturer or make and model.
