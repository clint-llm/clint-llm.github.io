While the full breadth of arterial pathologiesÂ diagnosable by angiography is beyond the scope of this article, commonly encountered pathologies such as embolism, dissection, aneurysm, extravasation, and arteriovenous malformation will be reviewed.

**Embolism**

Arterial embolism is most commonly thrombotic, although gas, amniotic, tumor, foreign body, and septic embolism may also occur. Pulmonary embolism and thromboembolic stroke occur as thrombotic material is carried distally downstream from its original location. On angiography, embolism may be diagnosed when a partial luminal filling defect or an abrupt cut-off of an artery is visualized.

**Dissection**

On angiography, vessel wall irregularity or a linear non-filling defect within the lumen is diagnostic for dissection. Dissection may occur as a consequence of arterial access, thus, an initial angiogram after percutaneous access should always be taken.

**Aneurysm**

Arterial aneurysms may be true or false. All three layers of the vessel, including the intima, media, and adventitia are involved in a true aneurysm. False aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms are bounded by the tunica adventitia. The risk of arterial rupture within a pseudoaneurysm is higher than that of true aneurysms. Aneurysms may be saccular, involving only a portion of the vessel wall, or fusiform, involving the entire vessel wall.

**Bleeding**

Active contrast extravasation is diagnostic of bleeding. Angiography is routinely used to detect pelvic, gastrointestinal, and traumatic hemorrhages. When used for gastrointestinal hemorrhage, angiography can detect bleeding as small as 0.5 mL/minute.

**Arteriovenous Malformation**

On angiography, arteriovenous malformations will appear as a collection of enlarged and irregular feeding arteries supplying a central nidus. The draining veins may be dilated and will show opacification in the early arterial phase. Cerebral angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of brain arteriovenous malformations. This should be performed using a bi-plane with a high acquisition rate due to rapid shunting.
