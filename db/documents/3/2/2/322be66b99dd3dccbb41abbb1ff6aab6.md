Management of secondary hypertension comprises adequate control of blood pressure with a healthy lifestyle and appropriate antihypertensive drugs and addressing the secondary causes mentioned above. It is recommended to refer these patients to clinicians with expertise, in order to treat the underlying cause of hypertension.

**Renal Parenchymal Disease**

The most common renal parenchymal diseases leading to secondary hypertension include diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and all these disorders result in chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Currently, there is no cure for chronic kidney disease and the main focus of the management is to treat the reversible causes responsible for the progression to advanced kidney disease.

**Renovascular Hypertension**

Management of renovascular hypertension (renal artery stenosis) is divided into medical therapy and revascularization. Medical therapy involves the use of anti-hypertensive drugs to control blood pressure and in the case of atherosclerotic disease, the use of antiplatelets, statins, diet, and lifestyle changes.

In the following patients, revascularization may be more beneficial than medical therapy alone:

- Patients with recurrent flash pulmonary edema

- Failure or intolerance to optimal medical treatment

- Refractory hypertension

- Unexplained, progressive, a decline in renal function,

- Recent initiation of dialysis in a patient with suspected renal artery stenosis

- An acute increase in creatinine after medical therapy and in patients with a renal resistive index of less than 80 mmHg on Doppler

**Endocrine Hypertension**

Unilateral primary aldosteronism (e.g., unilateral adrenal hyperplasia or aldosterone-producing adenoma) gets treated with unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. If the patient is not a surgical candidate or a patient has the bilateral adrenal disease, then medical management with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is recommended and spironolactone is the drug of choice for primary aldosteronism.

The definite treatment of pheochromocytoma is surgical resection of the hormone-producing lesion, however preoperative alpha and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are an essential part of pheochromocytoma management. It is recommended to start alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs first and then add beta blockers for the treatment of tachyarrhythmias.

**Vascular Hypertension**

Coarctation of the aorta is the major cause of vascular hypertension in the younger population. The choice of antihypertensive drugs for this population depends on the other co-existing conditions, however, the definite treatment is the percutaneous or surgical correction of the coarctation. Correction of coarctation at an early age provides better long-term outcomes, but one-third of the patients remain hypertensive even after surgical correction of the coarctation of the aorta.

Vasculitides of the large vessels (e.g Takayasu Arteritis) may also lead to hypertension due to a significant rise in systemic vascular resistance. Corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant agents along with antihypertensive drugs are recommended for the treatment of secondary hypertension due to vasculitides.

**Obstructive Sleep Apnea**

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the mainstay of treatment for OSA. To note, however, lifestyle modifications like weight loss, along with the usage of CPAP have a synergistic effect on lowering blood pressure and are better than either intervention alone.

**Pregnancy-Related Hypertension**

Interventions for hypertension in pregnancy are lifestyle modifications and anti-hypertensives. The anti-hypertensives commonly used in pregnancy are labetalol, nifedipine, and methyldopa. If an acute decrease in blood pressure is required, intravenous labetalol or intravenous hydralazine are options.
