Like many other behavioral health disorders, the etiology of imposter syndrome is likely multifactorial. Despite numerous case reports, and scientific and non-scientific studies in psychology, psychiatry, and sociology, there is no formal consensus on the etiology of IS.

Better delineation of the etiology will require more formal definitions, the study of the prevalence and etiology of the syndrome, and investigation into the spectrum of behavioral health co-morbidities. Currently, the proposed etiologies can be broken down into the following:

- As a standalone syndrome, imposter syndrome may result from any of the previously mentioned six factors, which all relate to broken meta-cognitive processes. Imposter syndrome is increasingly reported and recognized in high-pressure academic and workplace settings. Academic settings, including undergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, and professional education, create social constructs with multiple levels of internal and external attributions. While IS can occur in any person, a disproportionate amount of high-functioning individuals in healthcare are burdened with IS.

- As a manifestation of other comorbid mental health disorders, imposter syndrome may, in part, be a complex presentation of various mood and personality disorders.
