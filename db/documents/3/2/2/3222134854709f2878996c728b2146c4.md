The 2009 European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC II study) determined that gram-negative bacterial infections far exceed other etiologies as the most common cause of sepsis syndromes with a frequency of 62%, followed by gram-positive infections at 47%. An increase in the prevalence of the latter may be attributable to the performance of more invasive procedures and increased incidence of nosocomial infections.Staphylococcus aureus (20%), Pseudomonas (20%), and Escherichia coli (16%).

The influence of bacterial strain and site of infection on mortality was illustrated in a large meta-analysis.Acinetobacter or pneumonia with Staphylococcus carried a 40% mortality with Pseudomonal pneumonia carrying the highest mortality at 70%.

Sepsis syndromes caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistantÂ enterococci (VRE)) are on the rise with a current incidence of up to 25%; viruses and parasites cause far fewer cases and are identified in 2% to 4% of cases.

Risk factors that predispose to sepsis include:

- Diabetes

- Malignancy

- Chronic kidney and liver disease

- Use of corticosteroids

- Immunosuppressed state

- Burns

- Major surgery

- Trauma

- Presence of indwelling catheters

- Prolonged hospitalization

- Hemodialysis

- Extremes of age
