All patients with a corneal foreign body require close follow-up with an ophthalmologist.

Patients with peripherally located corneal foreign bodies, without retained foreign material, can follow up as an outpatient in 2-3 days.

Centrally located corneal foreign bodies or retained rust rings should be seen immediately (ideally), although within 24 hours of the event is reasonable.

Retained inert foreign bodies should be followed up with regularly, with exact timing determined on a case by case basis, which is also the case with an intraocular foreign body.

Once the patient is back to their baseline, a yearly ophthalmologic follow-up is recommended unless otherwise specified.
