Hypercholesterolemia causes atherosclerotic vascular disease leading to the development of coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia is a familial condition where there is an elevation in serum cholesterol levels due to mutation in several small LDL raising alleles. The mutation is detected using 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) score. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia is asymptomatic and is detected during routine screening. Primary care physicians and cardiologists play an important role in evaluating and treating patients to reduce complications of the disease. The activity describes the evaluation and treatment of polygenic hypercholesterolemia by primary care physicians (PCPs) and cardiologists.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of polygenic hypercholesterolemia.
- Review the signs and symptoms of polygenic hypercholesterolemia.
- Summarize the treatment for polygenic hypercholesterolemia.
- Outline the importance of consulting with an inter-professional team of specialists in the care of patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia.
