Patients can receive training for different gait patterns depending on their current injury and coordination level.

One crutch gait: This pattern utilizes only one crutch.  Crutch positioning is on the side of the uninjured lower extremity.  The crutch and the injured leg are advanced forward.  Then the uninjured leg proceeds while the crutch supports the user's weight.

Two-point gait: The left crutch and right leg move forward followed by the right crutch and left leg.

Three-point gait:  This is the most used technique.  The left and right crutch along with the injured leg are both advanced while the uninjured leg supports the body weight.  Next, the uninjured leg is advanced.

Four-point gait: This technique provides the most support.  The left crutch is advanced followed by the right leg, right crutch and at last the left leg.

Swing-to gait: The left and right crutch are advanced.  Then the left and right legs are advanced.
