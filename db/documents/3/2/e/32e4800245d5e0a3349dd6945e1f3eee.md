Teprotumumab is a novel targeted treatment for thyroid eye disease that has shown encouraging results in decreasing the inflammatory process, reversing disease endpoints such as diplopia and proptosis, and reducing the need for surgical intervention.

The use of teprotumumab requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, which may include:

- An endocrinologist to render the patient euthyroid and manage patients who may develop secondary hyperglycemia

- An ophthalmologist to adequately examine the eye, ascertain which patients may be good candidates for teprotumumab, and monitor the progression

- A rheumatologist for medical workups, drug prescription, and managing drug infusion reactions in a day center

- A pharmacist to assist with dosing

- A radiologist to assess treatment response (e.g., possible reduction of muscle or fat volume, improvement of apex crowding)

- A gastroenterologist to manage patients who may develop IBD

- Psychosocial support

Teprotumumab has shown great promise to change the landscape of managing thyroid eye disease, and working in an interprofessional team will better patient outcomes.
