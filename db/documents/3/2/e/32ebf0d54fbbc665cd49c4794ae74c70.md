The prevalence rates are different in various parts of the world. It is highest in the “pterygium belt” described by Cameron, which lies between 37° north and south of the equator. The prevalence of pterygium was stated to vary widely from 0.3 to 29 percent in the world. In India, the prevalence ranges from 9.5 to 13%.

The predominance of pterygia on the nasal side in the interpalpebral zone is speculated to result from the following mechanisms:

- Light passes through the cornea medially, concentrating on the nasal limbus region, while the nose shadow decreases the strength of light transmitted to the temporal limbus.

- Longer temporal upper lid eyelashes and outer two-third bowing of these lashes filtering light falling on temporal conjunctiva and cornea.

- The natural flow of tears is from the temporal to the nasal side towards the punctum, and any amount of dust that reaches the conjunctival sac irritates the nasal conjunctive further.

- Since there are two anterior ciliary arteries on the nasal side while there is only one on the temporal side, any irritant may result in increased nasal hyperemia.

Males work outdoors much longer than females, so it has been shown that pterygium is found more often in males compared to females.
