A trigger for RCVS is identified in approximately 25% to 60% of cases. However, RCVS can occur spontaneously, as well. Some identified triggers include vasoactive drugs, such as over the counter sympathomimetic drugs and migraine abortive medications. The most significant contributor, accounting for approximately 50% to 60% of cases in most published series, is the postpartum state.

Other potential triggers of RCVS include interferon treatment, diet pills, NSAIDs, alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy, and nicotine. There are also reports of blood transfusions, erythropoietin, intravenous immunoglobulin, migraines, certain tumors such as pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, trauma, head and neck surgery, carotid dissection, and other medical conditions such as HELLP syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can be potential triggers of RCVS.

Other ubiquitous triggers have included coughing, laughing, and so forth. However, possibly, these associations may be coincidental. The onset of RCVS after exposure to triggers can be anywhere between a few days to several months.
