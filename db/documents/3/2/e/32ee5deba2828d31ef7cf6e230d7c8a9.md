Acute stroke is preventable and treatable. Prevention can be achieved through awareness and knowledge of risk factors and warning signs. Public education programs for diverse populations regarding recognizing signs and symptoms early and seeking prompt emergency care have been shown to decrease the time to diagnosis and treatment.

Modifiable risk factors include physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, diet and nutrition, hypertension (most important and well-documented), obesity, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, and atrial fibrillation (AF). Therefore,Â modifications in diet and exercise, smoking cessation, pharmacotherapy for hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and at-risk individuals with AF are essential to acute stroke prevention.

Stroke is a major complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), particularly in early childhood. Most SCD-related strokes occur in patients with homozygous SCD; therefore, this should be a primary target population for prevention.

After an acute stroke, patients should be provided with information, counseling, and the opportunity to discuss the impact on their lives.
