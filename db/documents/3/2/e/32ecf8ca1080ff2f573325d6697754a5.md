Initial radiographs include anteroposterior and lateral wrist views. The overlapping of the hook of the hamate and its body is known as the "ring sign," a normal finding in the anteroposterior view. In some hook fractures, the so-called "ring sign" may be disrupted. Other signs that are visible in the anteroposterior view are loss of cortical density at the base of the hook and even absence of the hook.

Nevertheless, standard radiographs possess a high rate of false negatives, with a 70% sensitivity.

If a surgical procedure is required, routine blood work should be performedÂ based on the patient's history and physical exam. The complexity of the surgical procedure is also a required element for which the surgeon must account.
