Chalazia are inflammatory lesions that form when lipid breakdown products leak into surrounding tissue and incite a granulomatous inflammatory response. For this reason, a chalazion is also called a conjunctival granuloma. Meibomian glands are embedded in the tarsal plate of the eyelids; therefore, edema dueÂ blockage of these glands is ordinarily contained to the conjunctival portion of the lid. On occasion, a chalazion may enlarge and break through the tarsal plate to the external portion of the lid. Chalazia due to blockage of Zeis glands are usually located along the lid margin.
