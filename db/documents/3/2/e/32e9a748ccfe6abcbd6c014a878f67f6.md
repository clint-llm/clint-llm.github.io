Complications of untreated malocclusion include tooth decay and increased caries, as crowding can trap food and make it harder for the patient to clean interproximally. Additionally, gingivitis may develop due to plaque buildup. Malocclusion can also cause loss of teeth, impacted teeth, jaw problems, and damage to adjacent and opposing teeth.
