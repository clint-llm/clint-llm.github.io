Given the inflammatory process, corticosteroids are the main treatment for neural sarcoidosis. For facial nerve palsy or aseptic meningitis, prednisone is given every day for 2 weeks usually. In cases of meningeal, parenchymal mass lesion, or myopathy or neuropathy, prednisone should be given for at least 4 weeks. For deteriorating patients, intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone is given for 3 days followed by prednisone for 2 to 4 weeks. The steroid dose should be tapered over several months with follow-up by a neurologist every 3 to 6 months.

Immunosuppressants may also be considered, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide.

Low dose radiation is often given to patients in who steroids fail to work. Other treatments include:

Hormone replacement if there is hypopituitarism

Antipsychotics for behavior control and psychosis

Support for dementia

Recently tumor necrosis factor antagonists have been tried with partial improvement.
