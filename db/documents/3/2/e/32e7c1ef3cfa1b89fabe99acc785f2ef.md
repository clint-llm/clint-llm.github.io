Coma represents brain failure. It may be caused by neuronal dysfunction from many causes including structural or nonstructural processes affecting the central nervous system.

Metabolic or infectious etiologies may diffusely affect the brain and lead to a coma. Common toxic or metabolic causes of coma include hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, excessive alcohol intake, and medication overdose or illicit drug use. Of all the nonstructural causes of coma, hypoglycemia and systemic infections likely account for the majority of patients presenting with coma.Â  Other less common metabolic causes include hepatic encephalopathy, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, endocrine abnormalities, and many others. Primary central nervous system infections such as meningitis or encephalitis may lead to coma but are relatively uncommon though vitally important to detect.

Structural brain diseases such as subdural or epidural traumatic hematomas, spontaneous intracranial hemorrhages, venous thrombosis, tumors, acute hydrocephalus, raised intracranial pressure, anoxic brain injury, or brainstem strokes may all cause altered mental status or coma.

Generalized status epilepticus may evolve to a subtle or nonconvulsive form, sometimes called transformed or end-stage status epileptics, where unresponsiveness predominates the clinical picture and there is only minor or even no associated motor activity. Additionally, with the increasing use of electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring in intensive care units, patients are now being identified with highly abnormal electroencephalographic findings suggesting nonconvulsive status epilepticus in patients who are clinically without generalized seizures.
