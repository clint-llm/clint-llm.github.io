Felbamate use is limited by severe, life-threatening, and idiosyncratic reactions (aplastic anemia and hepatic failure). Both reactions can carry a mortality rate above 30%. These reactions are usually seen during the first 6 to 12 months of therapy but can occur later. Aplastic anemia can lead to symptoms of bleeding, bruising, and pale skin color. The first symptoms of hepatic dysfunction include lethargy, nausea, and vomiting. If hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT) increase two or more times, the upper limit of normal felbamate should be discontinued.

Aplastic anemia: There were 34 reported cases of felbamate-related aplastic anemia in the first six years of FDA approval.

Hepatic Failure: In the first six years after FDA approval, there were 18 cases of hepatic failure in patients taking felbamate.
