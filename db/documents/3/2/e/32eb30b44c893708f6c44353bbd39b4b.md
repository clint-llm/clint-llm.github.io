Lightning does not occur in a uniform pattern, globally. Areas with higher occurrences of thunderstorms will have a higher incidence of lightning strikes. Geography also plays a role in some areas with mountainous terrain will often experience more lightning strikes than surrounding lower elevation areas. Though likely underestimated, in the United States there are approximately 400 lighting injuries and 40 deaths annually. Greater than 80% of victims are males with most deaths occurring in individuals 20 to 45 years old. Most deaths occur within one hour of injury and are due to fatal arrhythmia or respiratory failure. Up to 74% of survivors may have some form of permanent disability. In the United States, most incidents occur between May through September with nearly 70% of incidents occurring in the afternoon or early evening. The greatest number of deaths due to lightning occur in Texas and Florida, but the highest incidence of lightning incidents occurs in Arizona, Arkansas, Mississippi and New Mexico. In the United States, a person has an estimated 1:10,000-lifetime risk of being struck by lightning.
