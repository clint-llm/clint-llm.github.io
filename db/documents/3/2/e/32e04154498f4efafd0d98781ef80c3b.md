Research has revealed a variable morphology of the radial and ulnar peaks of Lister’s tubercle. In the most common variant, the radial peak is larger than the ulnar peak. The second most common variant has radial and ulnar peaks that are similar heights. The least common variant has an ulnar peak larger than the radial peak. In the least common variance, or type 3 variance, the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus courses on the radial aspect of the tubercle.

The vascular supply of the lunate is a physiologic variant of concern due to the lunate's association with avascular necrosis, known as Kienböck disease. The arterial vessels of the volar surface are the main vascular supply of the lunate. Commonly, there are two to four vessels that traverse the volar carpal ligaments that nourish the lunate. However, there can uncommonly be only one vessel that supplies the volar surface of the lunate.
