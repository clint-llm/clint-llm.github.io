**Type A**

It is almost always fatal, and affected children are unlikely to live beyond 4 years of age.

**Type B**

These children have a slightly better prognosis than type A and may live till late childhood or early adulthood. But they develop many complications from the disease, so the life quality is not so good.

**Type C**

The prognosis depends on the time of the initial presentation. If it affects in infancy, the chances are very poor for survival beyond 5 years of age. If it affects after 5 years, then patients may live to the age of 20 years. But each patient has a slightly different outlook depending on the severity and presentation of the disease.
