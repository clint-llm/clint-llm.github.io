Amiodarone is primarily a class III antiarrhythmic. Like other antiarrhythmic drugs of this class, amiodarone works primarily by blocking potassium rectifier currents responsible for the repolarization of the heart during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential. This potassium channel-blocking effect results in increased action potential duration and a prolonged effective refractory period in cardiac myocytes. Myocyte excitability is decreased, preventing reentry mechanisms and ectopic foci from perpetuating tachyarrhythmias. Electrocardiographic evidence of these effects is evident as prolongation of the QRS duration and QTc interval.

Unlike other class III agents, amiodarone also blocks beta-adrenergic receptors (e.g., beta-1), calcium channels, and sodium channels. Further electrophysiological manifestations of this drug effect include decreased SA (sinoatrial) node automaticity and AV node conduction velocity and inhibited ectopic pacemaker automaticity. In some instances, these additional mechanisms of action can result in unwanted side effects, including bradycardia, hypotension, and Torsades de pointes (TdP).

Amiodarone has a very long half-life (t1/2 of several weeks), and it may take 6 weeks for full clinical effects with oral therapy. Also, upon discontinuation of amiodarone therapy, pharmacologic effects could continue for 1Â to 3 months.
