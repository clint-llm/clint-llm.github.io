**Immediate Complications**

Postoperative bleeding: reported on an average of 1.5%. The likely source of bleeding is from sphenopalatine artery branches and is controllable with nasal packing or cautery.

**Long Term Complications**

- Dry eye: This is the most commonly reported complication in nearly 50% of cases, ranging between 35 to 72%. Xerophthalmia is significantly more likely to occur after transsphenoidal/intrasphenoidal approaches. Most studies reported the resolution of dry eyes in 1 to 5 months of surgery.

- Palatal/Gingival/Cheek numbness (6.27%) - Incidence is more likely after the pterygopalatine approach.

- Nasal crusting/dryness (3.7%)
