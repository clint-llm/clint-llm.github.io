The management of lightning strikes is with an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, surgeon, internist, burn specialist, intensivist, cardiologist and a neurologist. Nurses in the ICU are responsible for monitoring the patient. In all cases, lightning patients are treated according to the Trauma protocol. If multiple lightning victims are present, initial triage and treatment should follow a “reverse triage” system. This is of critical importance, as failure to do so may result in unnecessary and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Those who survive the initial strike rarely die prior to or after hospital arrival, and initial treatment and resuscitation should be concentrated on those who appear to be in cardiac arrest. Sudden death is most often due to a simultaneous sudden cardiac and respiratory arrest. Often there will be a return of cardiac automaticity in the form of sinus bradycardia with a concurrent return of spontaneous circulation that precedes the recovery of the respiratory system and spontaneous respiration.  Given that ROSC precedes the resolution of respiratory arrest, patient ventilation should be supported as soon as possible. This will help reduce the incidence of a secondary cardiovascular collapse. During this time, care should be taken to palpate a central pulse, and if not appreciated, CPR may be initiated. The outcomes depend on the severity of the injury, mental status, number of organs involved, presence of cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.

Trauma injuries incurred due to lightning strikes should be treated appropriately as deemed fit by the provider. Those with neurological symptoms will need repeat evaluation, and if symptoms persist, they will need evaluation and treatment by a neurologist. Burns should be treated appropriately per standard guidelines.

Most lightning survivors who appear well without abnormal vital signs or injury requiring hospitalization can safely be discharged if they also do not have high-risk findings/history including suspected direct strike, loss of consciousness, focal neurological complaint, chest pain, dyspnea, major trauma, cranial or significant burns. Appropriate consultation/referral should be obtained for those with an ophthalmic, audio-vestibular system, or other injuries as seemingly fit.
