The primary function of the small intestine is to break down food, absorb nutrients, extract water, and move food along the gastrointestinal tract. The specific functions of each part of the small intestine are detailed below.

**Duodenum -chemical digestion**

The pylorus of the stomach connects to the first part of the small intestine, the duodenum, which receives food from the stomach through the pylorus. Descending and short (10 inches long), the duodenum curves around the pancreas in a "C" shape and receives digestive juices from the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder via ducts connecting these organs to the duodenum. In the presence of food, hormone glands in the lining of the duodenum signal these organs to release their chemicals.

The duodenum is innervated by the celiac plexus, with the sympathetic innervation being the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves and the parasympathetic innervation being the vagus nerve.

Anatomically, the duodenum begins at the duodenal bulb and ends at the Ligament of Treitz, often referred to as the duodenojejunal (DJ) flexure. The duodenum is the site of iron and some folate absorption.

The duodenum is divided into four distinct parts:

- Superior

- Most common site of duodenal ulcers
- A posterior duodenal ulcer in the superior segment of the duodenum may damage the gastroduodenal artery.

- Descending

- Contains the ampulla of Vater and sphincter of Oddi

- Horizontal

- The portion of the duodenum where superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome occurs
- Anteriorly: superior mesenteric vessels
- Posteriorly aorta

- Ascending

**Jejunum -mechanical digestion**

The second part of the small intestine, the jejunum, is located mainly in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the abdomen and is the site of folate (B9) absorption. The jejunum has many blood vessels, giving it a deep red color on examination. The myenteric plexus triggers the intestinal walls of the jejunum to undergo segmentation, churning food back and forth and mixing it with digestive juices. Peristalsis, the moving of food down the digestive tract, also occurs here.

The mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum is thick with many folds and projections, making its surface area 100x greater than that of the skin. This physiology allows 95% of carbohydrates and proteins to be absorbed in the small intestine, as well as 90% of the water it receives during digestion, with the rest being absorbed in the large intestine.

**Ileum**

The ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine. Located mainly in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen, the ileum is the longest section of the small intestine. The ileum is thinner, with more narrow walls and fewer blood vessels. Food spends most of the time in the ileum. Within the ileum, segmentation slows, and peristalsis takes over. The ileocecal valve separates the ileum from the large intestine (colon). Hormones and nerves signal the valve to open and close, allowing food to pass while keeping bacteria out. Special immune cells, Paneth cells, line the ileum to protect against bacteria.

Both the jejunum and ileum are innervated by the superior mesenteric plexus, a continuation of the lower portion of the celiac plexus, with the sympathetic innervation being the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves, while the parasympathetic innervation is the vagus nerve.
