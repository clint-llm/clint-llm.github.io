Although asthma is not curable, it is controllable with proper management. Asthma will commonly start before school age in children. Early childhood asthma and severe asthma increased the risk of chronic obstructive symptoms. While many patients require long-term medical follow up and medications, asthma remains a treatable disease, and some patients do experience significant improvement or resolution of symptoms with age.
