**Adverse Effects**

- Most adverse effects caused by colestipol therapy are related to the gastrointestinal system. Colestipol can cause a wide range of adverse effects, including constipation, bloating, dyspepsia, and nausea.

- Constipation is the most common side effect and ranges in severity from mild cases to severe cases. It is often a cause of poor compliance and discontinuation of therapy.

- Constipation may be ameliorated with increased fluid and fiber intake, as well as the use of stool softeners.

- Colestipol may aggravate pre-existing hemorrhoids.

- The usage of colestipol in powdered suspension form may cause decreased palatability. Flavored suspensions of colestipol are used to improve palatability.

- Non-gastrointestinal side effects are infrequently reported. These include infrequent occurrences of cardiovascular symptoms such as angina, musculoskeletal symptoms such as joint pains and arthritis, and neurologic symptoms such as migraine headaches.

- Colestipol may cause transient elevations in alkaline phosphatase levels, although the clinical significance of this is unknown.

- Colestipol therapy has been reported to cause asymptomatic hepatotoxicity with elevated serum transaminases. However, the mechanism by which colestipol causes hepatotoxicity is unknown.

- Colestipol may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

**Drug Interactions**

- Colestipol may induce malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K). Patients with pre-existing deficiencies of these vitamins should consult their healthcare provider before commencing therapy with colestipol. These vitamins should be taken 4 hours after taking colestipol.

- Colestipol may reduce the absorption of many drugs if they are given concomitantly with colestipol. Anionic drugs such as warfarin, thiazide diuretics, propanolol, levothyroxine, and digitalis should be given 1 hour before or 4 hours after taking colestipol.

**Special Populations**

- **Pregnant patients:**colestipol is safe to use in pregnancy as it is not systemically absorbed. However, colestipol may induce the malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), which may be hazardous to the mother and child. Therefore, the benefits of drug therapy should be weighed against the risks before the initiation of therapy.

- **Breastfeeding patients:**as colestipol is not absorbed by the systemic circulation; it is not present in breast milk. Therefore, it is safe for use during breastfeeding.

- **Patients under the age of 18**: the adverse event profile of colestipol in patients below the age of 18 has not been established. However, colestipol has been used safely in patients under age 18 with familial hypercholesterolemia.

- **Patients over the age of 60**: the gastrointestinal side effects of colestipol, such as constipation, may be more pronounced in patients over the age of 60.
