Plain film XR of the AC joint is typically sufficient to evaluate for distal clavicular osteolysis. Imaging of DCO often demonstrates microcysts, loss of subchondral bone detail, and osteolysis of the distal clavicle.

Early, mild, or unclear radiograph findings warrant consideration of other imaging modalities such as MRI, bone scan, or ultrasound. Diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound is an emerging option for diagnosing DCO. Ultrasound may be performed during evaluation by a trained clinician and is significantly less expensive than MRI and bone scan. It may also be more sensitive than plain film X-ray.

Selection of imaging modality warrants consideration of the differential diagnosis or concomitant pain generators. For example, high suspicion of SLAP lesion in addition to SCO requires magnetic resonance to evaluate adequately. There are no laboratory tests necessary for the diagnosis but should be considered based on other medical causes in the differential.
