The distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) is responsible for the integrity of the articulation between the distal radius and distal ulna; this is important in both supination and pronation of the forearm, as well as anteroposterior translational stability. The distal radioulnar joint is a critical stabilizing structure of the ring stabilizing the radius and ulna, and pathologies afflicting the distal radioulnar joint can impact not only the hand and wrist but the elbow as well. Clinically, the distal radioulnar joint carries critical importance as it can undergo an acute injury or chronic degeneration as a result of long-term sequelae from previous injuries. This spectrum of pathology leads to significant wrist pain, dysfunction, degeneration, and subtle to gross instability. The goal of this article is to provide an anatomic review, as well as the basics of clinical importance for the education of current and future healthcare providers.
