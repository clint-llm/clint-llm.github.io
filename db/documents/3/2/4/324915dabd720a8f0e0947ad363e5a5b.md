Clinicians and other healthcare professionals (clinicians, specialists, nurses, physical therapists) who work with hip arthroplasty patients need to understand pre and postoperative hip precautions. These are designed to prevent exacerbation of symptoms and optimize healing and function following various arthroplastyÂ procedures. Interprofessional understanding and communication can improve patient outcomes through coordinated effort and optimal patient counseling.
