Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) affects about 1 person in every 1 million individuals per year worldwide. Rapidly progressive dementia can occur due to neurodegenerative, toxic-metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic etiologies, and extensive workup for reversible and treatable causes is needed. CJD and other prion diseases should be considered in the differential during the workup of rapidly progressive ataxia or hemiparesis with cognitive deficit within weeks to months.
