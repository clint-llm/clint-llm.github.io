Porcelain aorta is an asymptomatic condition that usually appears as an incidental finding in patients evaluated for cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases.

Different diagnostic tools have been suggested to diagnose porcelain aorta and evaluate its extent and exact location before any cardiac intervention. The most accurate modality is a multislice computed tomography (MSCT). It is used to accurately diagnose porcelain aorta and give valuable information about the exact level and site of aortic calcification, thereby distinguishing PA (circumferential calcification) from a less extensive aortic calcification. Furthermore, a 3-dimensional (3D), volume-rendered reconstructions of MSCT images can be done to allow 3D mapping of the aortic wall, thus providing us with useful information about the three-dimensional distribution of the calcification.

Other modalities include:

- A chest X-ray may occasionally reveal a calcification in the thoracic aorta, but it is not accurate in defining PA.

- Fluoroscopy during coronary angiography is somehow sensitive in detecting an aortic calcification that suggests PA; however, it lacks the precision in assessing the distribution and localization of this calcification.

On the other hand, PA is recognizable during the cardiac surgery by performing an epiaortic echocardiographic scanning of the aorta in conjunction with manual palpation after sternotomy and exposure of the aorta. Such testing confirms the presence of PA, as well as its extent and exact location.

Pre-operative identification of porcelain aorta is important because the procedural plan often changes if PA is discovered. When porcelain aorta is suspected based on incidental findings on other imaging modalities, pre-procedural computed tomography can evaluate PA.
