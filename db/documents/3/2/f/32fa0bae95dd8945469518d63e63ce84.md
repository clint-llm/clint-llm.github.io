Most drugs undergo chemical alteration by various bodily systems to create compounds that are more easily excreted from the body. These chemical alterations occur primarily in the liver and are known as biotransformations. Becoming knowledgeable about these alterations in chemical activity is crucial in utilizing the optimal pharmacological intervention for any patient and is thus of interest to any provider who routinely treats patients with medication. This activity covers drug metabolism, biotransformations, and polypharmacy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients on multiple medications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of drug biotransformation in the body.
- Describe the issues associated with drug induction.
- Review the phases of drug metabolism.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance drug safety and improve outcomes.
