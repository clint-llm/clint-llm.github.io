Acute or subacute loss of visual acuity caused by circulating antibodies formed against the retinal proteins in the presence of systemic cancer is called cancer-associated retinopathy or carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR).

Sawyer and colleagues first described visual loss along with retinal degeneration in patients suffering from lung carcinoma in 1976.

CAR is a rare type of retinal paraneoplastic retinopathy. Paraneoplastic syndrome is defined as 'rare clinical syndromes due to the systemic effects of tumors; they are unrelated to tumor size, invasiveness or metastases.'

It has been reported that the diagnosis of CAR (confirmed by the presence of anti-retinal antibodies in the sera) precedes the diagnosis of cancer in up to 50% of the patients.
