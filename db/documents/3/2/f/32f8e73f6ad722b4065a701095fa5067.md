Skin biopsy is not necessary to diagnose asteatotic eczema. However, a microscopic examination will reveal spongiotic dermatitis with intracellular edema that is common among other forms of eczema and dermatitis. There can be varying degrees of inflammatory infiltrate, but most commonly a mild subacute spongiotic dermatitis. Acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and lymphocytic infiltrate are present. The stratum corneum isÂ irregular and compact.
