Peripheral vascular resistance (systemic vascular resistance, SVR) is the resistance in the circulatory system that is used to create blood pressure, the flow of blood and is also a component of cardiac function. When blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) this leads to an increase in SVR. When blood vessels dilate (vasodilation), this leads to a decrease in SVR.Â If referring to resistance within the pulmonary vasculature, this is called pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).
