Certain conditions have been associated with NAFLD and NASH. Obesity has a strong association with NAFLD. Metabolic syndrome (which comprises of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus or hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) is strongly associated with NAFLD. About three-quarter of patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus have fatty liver disease with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis. Other metabolic and genetic conditions that are associated with NAFLD are polycystic ovary disease, lipodystrophies, mitochondrial diseases, Weber-Christian disease and Wilson disease.Â  Both nutritional overload states such as total parenteral nutrition and malnutrition (as in Kwashiorkor and celiac disease) are associated with NAFLD.

People of African American origins have lower rates of NAFLD compared to Hispanic Americans despite having higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Their genetic variation can explain this. Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) also known as adiponutrin is a protein that mediates the break down of fat and can increase hepatic fat levels based on its expression. Polymorphisms in the gene coding this protein have been linked to the ethnic variation of NAFLD as Hispanic Americans were found to have higher levels of this protein.
