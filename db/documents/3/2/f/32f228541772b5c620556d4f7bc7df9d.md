The nuclear renal scan, also known as renal scintigraphy, is an imaging method that uses radiopharmaceuticals/radiotracers to evaluate renal anatomy, physiology, and pathology. The various injected radiotracers are extracted from the blood by the kidneys and emit radiation, particularly gamma radiation, that is detected by gamma cameras. These studies are easy to perform and typically do not require sedation.

The use of nuclear scintigraphy has evolved over the last decades. Use has been affected by

- Improvement in ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging

- Development and availability of various radionuclides

- Current standard and preferred methods for the workup of various conditions
