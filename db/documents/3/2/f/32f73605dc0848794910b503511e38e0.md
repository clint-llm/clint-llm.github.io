Harrison groove is a harmless deformity and causes no debilitation or any relevant restriction in the lung or diaphragmatic function. Therefore,Â there are currently no surgical indications for correction, except for cosmesis, especially with the unilateral groove. There is only one reported attempt on a 20-month-old girl with a unilateral groove.
