When one of the twins or multiple embryos dies in utero, disappear or get resorbed partially or entirely, with an outcome of a spontaneous reduction of a multi-fetus pregnancy to a singleton pregnancy, portraying the image of a vanishing twin. This phenomenon occurs in about half of pregnancies with three or more gestational sacs, 36% twin pregnancies, and 20 to 30% of pregnancies achieved with assisted reproductive techniques. Care coordination between health care team members, i.e., an obstetrician/gynecologist, nurse, and clinical staff before and during the pregnancy, is essential, as detecting a vanishing twin during early pregnancy via ultrasonographic examination has many benefits. If the loss of twins is identified during the second or third trimester, the health care provider needs to monitor more carefully the health of the mother and the remaining fetus and watch closely for any signs of complications. This activity covers the interprofessional approach to health care of the patient necessary to prevent errors and improve health care outcomes through communication, staying up-to-date on the patientâ€™s current health status, and physical and diagnostic evaluation of the patient.
