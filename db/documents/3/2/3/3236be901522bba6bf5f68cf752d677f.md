Patient education is critical for the management of macular edema. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends patients with type 1 diabetes should get an ophthalmic screening within five years of initial diagnosis, while patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened at the time of the initial diagnosis. Similarly, patients with DME should be advised to maintain strict metabolic control. Patient education and appropriate behavior can help prevent, delay, and limit the ocular and systemic effects of diabetes. Patients have to be explained that diabetes can affect multiple organ systems.
