Tuberous sclerosis affects multiple systems and may manifest in various tissues within a lifetime. Renal manifestations are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Approximately 55% to 75% of patients will present renal angiomyolipomas. Other common renal lesions include polycystic kidney disease, renal cysts, and renal cell carcinomas (RCC). The latter has a similar lifetime risk to the general population; however, they usually present at a younger age.

Lymphangiomyomatosis may present in patients with tuberous sclerosis and is characterized by extensive proliferation of smooth muscle cells and cystic changes within the lung parenchyma. This is commonly diagnosed during early childhood, presenting as dyspnea or spontaneous pneumothorax.

Central nervous system manifestations are common. Patients with tuberous sclerosis complex may present subependymal nodules, cortical or subcortical tubers, and SEGA which may manifest in 90% of patients.

Seizures are common in tuberous sclerosis and often refractory to medical treatment; for this reason, they may need to be treated surgically.
