**Macroscopic gross external examination:**

Grossly, osteochondroma is a lobulated sessile or pedunculated lesion arising from the surface of the bone with a somewhat cauliflower-like appearance.  The cartilage cap has a shiny glistening bluish to grey appearance. There is a thin fibrous capsule or perichondrium which shows continuity with the periosteum of the underlying bone. The thickness of the cartilage cap of 1 to 3 cm is considered normal in children due to the ongoing growth process. The cartilage cap is either absent or only a few millimeters in thickness in the fully mature skeleton. Cap thickness exceeding 2 cm in an adult should raise suspicion for malignancy. Varying degrees of mineralization may be present within the cartilage cap.

**Macroscopic cross-sectional examination:**

The perichondrium, cortex, and the medulla of the osteochondroma are all continuous with the underlying bone.

**Microscopic examination:**

Starting from the periphery, the cartilage cap that covers the tumor has a similar histological feature to the growth plate. At the junction of the cartilaginous cap and the underlying bone, evidence of endochondral ossification is visible. The medullary part is usually formed by yellow marrow rather than hematopoietic marrow through the process of endochondral ossification.
