The development of head and neck structures centers on the branchial and pharyngeal apparatus. At 4 to 7 weeks gestation, the head and neck consist of 5 or 6 pairs of branchial arches. The division of branchial arches is by external indentations called branchial clefts, which are lined by ectoderm. The corresponding inward groove is a pharyngeal pouch that is lined by endoderm. The pharyngeal pouch is the primitive pharynx. Branchial arches are composed of mesoderm. Within the branchial arch mesoderm, connective tissue (i.e., cartilage and fascia) will form.
