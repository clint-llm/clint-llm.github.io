There are numerous pathological mechanisms in which superoxides play a pivotal role. Oxidative stress has been shown to be one of the major driving factors in cancer and angiogenesis.

The reversal of malignant phenotypes is achievable by reducing cellular levels of superoxide; this occurs by the expression of superoxide dismutases that have shown efficacy in reducing tumor growth, metastasis, and other malignant features.

ROS has also been implicated in disrupting the blood-brain barrier, resulting in the entry of toxic substances into the central nervous system and disruption of neuronal homeostasis.
