Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection, with over 14 million cases occurring in the United States annually. This activity educates the learner on the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and treatment of cellulitis. It provides the latest updates on how to accurately diagnose, effectively treat, and manage patients with bacterial cellulitis. Upon completing the activity, the learner should be able to differentiate cellulitis from other mimickers correctly. The learner will know how to discern when cellulitis treatment is appropriate in the outpatient setting with oral antibiotics versus when a patient should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics, and how the interprofessional team can best manage patients with cellulitis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cellulitis.
- Review the evaluation process for cellulitis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for cellulitis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management and proper treatment of cellulitis.
