The anteroinferior portion of the Eustachian tube, which includes the protympanum, mesotympanum, and hypotympanum, is covered by a pseudostratified epithelial layer with numerous mucous and ciliated cells that aid in the mucociliary clearance of pathogens. The connective tissue in this portion of the ET is thick and dense.

The posterosuperior portion of the Eustachian tube contains loose connective tissue and is covered by richly vascularized cuboidal epithelium devoted primarily to gas exchange. There are no ciliated or mucous cells in this portion of the ET.
