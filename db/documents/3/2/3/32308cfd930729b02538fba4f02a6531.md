Any patient with suspected retinal detachment should undergo a dilated fundoscopic examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Other modalities to assist in the diagnosis of a retinal detachment include ultrasound,

If a patient has a retinal detachment that is likely rhegmatogenous, Linkoff's rules, as outlined below, should be followed to find the retinal break.

- In detachments located superior temporally or superior nasally, the main break is located within 1.5 clock-hours of the highest border 98% of the time.

- In total or superior detachments that fall across the 12:00 meridian, there are two likely possibilities. The first is that the main break is located at 12:00. The second is that the break is a triangle, with the apex of the triangle at the ora serrata, and the sides extend one half clock hours to either side of 12:00. One of these options occurs 93% of the time.

- For inferior detachments, 95% of the time, the higher side of the attachment indicates which side of the optic nerve at the inferior break lies. For example, if the detachment is higher nasally, then the break is likely nasal, as well.

- Detachments that form inferior bullae originate from a break superiorly.
