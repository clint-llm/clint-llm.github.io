Alopecia totalis is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. Alopecia areata may initially be encountered by the primary care provider. General practitioners need to recognize this condition and refer the patient to a dermatologist for consideration of treatment options. This is particularly imperative in alopecia totalis, which portends a worse prognosis, with a lower likelihood for spontaneous recovery. A referral to a therapist or psychiatrist may also be appropriate due to the high rates of psychological distress secondary to extensive hair loss. Lastly, the provider should be familiar with resources to provide the affected individual and family, as there are numerous associations and support groups that patients may find valuable.
