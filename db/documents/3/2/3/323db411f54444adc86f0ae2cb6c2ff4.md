Pacemaker mediated tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia that happens in patients with dual-chamber pacemakers due to reentry. Patients who develop this arrhythmia can develop palpitations, dizziness, or even syncope. The cornerstone of management involves reprogramming of the pacemaker to increase the atrial refractory period. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of pacemaker mediated tachycardia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of pacemaker mediated tachycardia.
- Describe the pathophysiology of pacemaker mediated tachycardia.
- Outline the typical management options for patients with pacemaker mediated tachycardia.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to promptly diagnose and manage patients with pacemaker mediated tachycardia.
