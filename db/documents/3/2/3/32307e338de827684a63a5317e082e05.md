When performed by a skilled physician, provocative discography is a safe, if not uncomfortable, adjunctive diagnostic procedure that may be of use in the evaluation and workup of axial spine pain with and without radiculopathy. A post discogram CT scanning may provide reasonable alternative imaging in MRI-incompatible patients and, in some cases, is the gold standard over MRI in diagnosis posterior annular tears.

It is imperative to note that discography is diagnostic, not therapeutic.Â  The role of provocative discography role is unclear in "endplate-driven" degeneration. Unnecessary surgery, especially unnecessary fusion fixation of vertebral segments, may potentially be avoided.
