Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma of the salivary gland. Patients with MALT lymphoma are commonly treated with rituximab, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, fludarabine, and chlorambucil-cyclophosphamide.

The benefit of chemotherapy is limited for other salivary gland malignancies. Combining chemotherapeutic agents (such as with carboplatin, paclitaxel, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea) with adjuvant radiation has shown moderate benefit with 5-year locoregional control rates of 90% to 95% reported in some studies. However, there was no overall survival benefit compared with non-responding patients.

Targeted therapies against C-Kit (Imatinib), HER2 (Trastuzumab), EGFR (Cetuximab), and mTOR (Temsirolimus) have gained popularity due to the expression of biological receptors in several malignant salivary tumors. However, response rates have not been superior. This is thought to be likely due to a discrepancy between protein overexpression and gene mutation, as well as loss of tumor suppressor PTEN that interferes with target therapy responsiveness.
