Early diagnosis of MCAD deficiency has been shown to reduce nearly half of medical care costs.

Management of children with MCAD deficiency who require anesthesia can pose additional risks. Patients who require a surgical procedure will need to be fasting and would benefit from overnight admission prior to the procedure to administer glucose-containing maintenance fluids. Providing intravenous fluids with glucose and close perioperative monitoring of blood glucose levels reduces the risk of metabolic crisis typically seen with fasting periods in this population.
