There are many options to prevent pregnancy; abstinence, withdrawal method, condoms, spermicidal solutions, diaphragms, cervical cups, intrauterine devices, oral contraceptive pills, long-acting hormonal implants, depo injections, lactation amenorrhea method, emergency contraception techniques, vasectomy, and tubal ligation. This activity is an overview of vasectomy, its technique and its role in the prevention of pregnancy. Vasectomy is the only form of permanent male sterilization, a procedure where the vas deferens are transected, ligated, and separated in fascial planes. Urologists perform about 75% of vasectomies while the remainder are performed by general surgeons and family medicine physicians.
