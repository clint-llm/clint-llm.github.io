The pathogenesis of bone marrow edema syndrome remains unknown. Vascular anomalies, decreased fibrinolysis (especially in pregnant women), and thromboembolism have all been proposed as possible etiologies, but a definitive cause remains elusive. Ultimately, the pain is likely caused by the aggravation of neurovascular bundles within the bone marrow due to increased intraosseous pressure caused by the increased fluids in the bone marrow interstices.
