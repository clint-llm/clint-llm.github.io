Performing an ABI assessment does take time; the estimated time is 15 minutes. As such, it will often fall on the duty of the nurse or ultrasound technician to perform theÂ test to assist in clinical flow.

**Wound Care Providers**

Guidelines exist for monitoring wound care application

- Avoid compression dressing with ABI 0.5 and refer to the specialist/supervising provider

- Values 0.5 to 0.8 apply low compression only

- Greater than 0.8 may apply high compression
