Duane retraction syndrome (DRS), previously known as Stilling-Turk-Duane syndrome, is caused by the absence or partial development of the abducent nucleus and nerve. As a result, there is aberrant innervation of the lateral rectus (LR) by the oculomotor nerve. Similar developmental anomalies of one or more cranial nerves have come to be grouped under congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDD). These anomalies may be termed primary due to the absence of normal innervation or secondary following aberrant innervations from other cranial nerves.

The evaluation and management of DRS can be very challenging, and a judicious approach is essential.
