The goal of treatment is to decrease abdominal pain and improve malabsorption. Pain is secondary to inflammation, neuropathic mechanisms, and blocked ducts. Eating small, frequent low-fat meals is generally recommended along with replacement of fat-soluble vitamins and pancreatic enzymes. In cases where pain relief is not achieved with enzyme replacement treatment and dietary modification, non-opioid regimens should be utilized (TCA, NSAIDs, pregabalin) initially before starting a trial of opioids. Studies regarding the benefit of antioxidants are unconfirmed. New studies show someÂ benefit of using medium-chain triglycerides. Surgery should be considered in patients who fail medical therapy and continue to have pain.

The patient's behavior has to be modified to prevent exacerbation of the disorder. Patients must cease alcohol and discontinue smoking.

Inpatient care is often required for patients with chronic pain and anorexia. These patients often require narcotics and nutritional supplementation.

Pancreatic enzymes are usually taken with a meal and help lower the pain. However, the benefits of pancreatic enzymes still remain questionable.

Surgery is required for:

- Pancreatic abscess, fistula or pseudocyst

- Pancreatic ascites

- Mechanical obstruction of the common bile duct

- Stenosis of the duodenum leading to gastric outlet obstruction

- Variceal bleeding due to splenic vein thrombosis

Surgery to resect the pancreas can produce good results in the hands of experienced surgeons, but the operative mortality can exceed 10% and the quality of life is impaired without a functioning pancreas.

Today, interventional radiology can be used to manage most complications including drainage and stent placement.

Celiac ganglion blockade can be performed to decrease pain but this is an invasive procedure with a risk of paralysis due to transverse myelopathy. Endoscopic methods of celiac nerve blocks have not been beneficial.

Endoscopy is often used to relieve obstruction in the pancreatic duct but only works in 60% of patients.
