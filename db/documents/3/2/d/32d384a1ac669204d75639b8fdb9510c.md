Treatment of mild cardiomegaly centers upon the treatment of the underlying condition. Standard heart failure (HF) treatment guidelines also apply in moderate to severe cardiomegaly associated with heart failure.

- Patients at risk of cardiomyopathy benefit from risk factor modification such as smoking cessation, limiting alcohol intake, weight loss, exercise, and consuming a healthy diet. Recommendations include treating underlying risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Other underlying conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea, arrhythmias, anemia, and thyroid disorders, also require treatment.

- Patients with early onset cardiomyopathy who are asymptomatic are managed with risk factor modification and the addition of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or ARB (if intolerant to ACE) and beta-blocker if there is a history of MI or reduced ejection fraction (EF).

- Patients with cardiomyopathy and symptoms of heart failure are managed with diuretics and salt restriction in addition to the above therapies.

- Patients with refractory heart failure should receive optimal medical management. Also, eligible patients can be considered for cardiac transplantation and bridge therapy, such as ventricle assist devices.

Of special consideration, no pharmacologic agent has shown benefit in HFpEF. The mainstay of treatment isÂ controlling underlying conditions such as hypertension, heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation, ischemia with medication and/or coronary intervention, and diuretics for fluid overload. Patients with asymptomatic HOCM (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) can be safely monitored. Patients with symptoms of HF and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction may benefit from negative inotropes such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or dipyridamole. Vasodilators and diuretics should be avoided in such patients.

Some novel treatment strategies are being studied through recent evidence favoring the supplementation of endogenous antioxidants for managing diabetic cardiomyopathy. These strategies include gene therapy targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway and miRNA dysregulation. A future strategy could be to target redox stress and protective protein signaling pathways for combating the ever-rising incidence of heart failure in patients with diabetes.
