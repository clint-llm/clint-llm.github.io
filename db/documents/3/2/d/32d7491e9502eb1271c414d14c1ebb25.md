Along with other OAB drugs, tolterodine is contraindicated in patients at risk for or currently have gastric retention or uncontrolled angle-closure glaucoma. It is also not for use in patients with myasthenia gravis, severe constipation, intestinal atony, ulcerative colitis, or bladder outflow obstructions.

Because of its tertiary property, tolterodine should be monitored and used with caution if the patient has a neurological disorder or neurodegenerative disease. Additionally, if a patient is about to perform a potentially dangerous task, this medication should not be administered, as it can cause drowsiness and blurred vision.
