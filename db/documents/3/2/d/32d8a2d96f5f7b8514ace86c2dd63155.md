Hypophosphatemia is diagnosed with a simple serum measurement.  Etiology is typically evident from history. However, if unknown, it is essential to determine renal phosphate excretion. Renal phosphate excretion can be measured either from a 24-hour urine collection or by calculation of the fractional excretion of filtered phosphate (FEPO4) from a random urine specimen. EPO4 is calculated as follows where U is urine values, and P is plasma values of phosphate (PO4) and creatinine (Cr):

-  FEPO4 = (UPO4 x PCr x 100) / (PPO4 x UCr)

A 24-hour urine phosphate excretion of less than 100 mg or FEPO4 less than 5% shows decreased phosphate excretion, indicating hypophosphatemia is from a redistribution within the body or decreased intestinal absorption. A 24-hour urine phosphate excretion greater than 100 mg or FEPO4 greater than 5% indicates renal phosphate wasting. Hypophosphatemia in this scenario is likely due to hyperparathyroidism or vitamin D deficiency.
