External auditory exostosis is usually an asymptomatic disease.

On physical exam, the practitioner should be able to visualize multi-nodular masses at the tympanic ring with an otoscope. In general, the size of the masses is proportional to the degree of symptoms. The masses are firm, multiple, and often seen in the external auditory canal bilaterally. If the exostoses are large enough, they may obscure the sight of the tympanic membrane. It is not uncommon for cerumen to become impacted on the tympanic membrane as a result of entrapment behind or within the exostoses. If this is the case, carefully perform an ear lavage to better visualize the ear structures. Once removable debris or obstructions are resolved, consider assessing for hearing loss. If hearing loss is present, performing a Rhine and Weber test will demonstrate a conductive hearing loss as opposed to a sensorineural hearing loss.
