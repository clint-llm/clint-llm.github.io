To ensure better clinical outcomes and to prioritize patient safety by minimizing complications, there need to be mandatory patient safety checklists to be implemented by the interprofessional team involved in the process.

- Valid treatment order sheet which has to be signed and dated by the surgeon

- All reportable limits clearly specified by the clinician

- Nurses need to be educated in the management of patients with a ventriculostomy and understand the tracing waveform to report abnormalities to the team.

- EVD drainage point at a prescribed level with theÂ transducer leveled to the tragus of the ear

- The EVD column is oscillating

- Monitoring for normal ICP waveform

- ICP waveform is pulsatile on the monitor

- No soakage in the wound site or any junctions within the monitor set

- Judicious assessment of drained CSF volume

- Stringent evaluation of the neurological status of the patient

- Strict maintenance of an aseptic environment.

Monitoring intracranial pressure requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, and specialty-trained nurses, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Surgically-trained nurses will play a significant role in the procedure, assisting and monitoring the surgeon performing the procedure. Deviation from these standards can result in life-threatening complications. Open communication between the interprofessional team is necessary so that the procedure achieves optimal outcomes safely.
