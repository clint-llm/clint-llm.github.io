Disorders of platelet function or quality are clinically significant conditions with dangerous ramifications. Immune thrombocytopenia represents a condition in which antibodies are formed against the GPIIb/IIIa receptor of the platelets, resulting in the destruction of platelets. As expected, the ability of the body to effectively clot in response to vascular damage becomes significantly reduced. Intrinsic deficiencies, such as GPIb receptor deficiency, as seen in Bernard-Soulier syndrome, acts to decrease the adhesion of platelets to the endothelial surface, leading to a similar result.

The complex cascade involved in platelet activation allows for inhibition at several steps to avoid or decrease the risk of thrombosis. The most well-known of these inhibitors is aspirin, which acts as an irreversible inhibitor of COX, thus inhibiting the formation of TXA. As a result, platelets are unable to aggregate as effectively, thus decreasing the likelihood of clot formation or propagation.

More recently, P2Y receptor blockers and drugs that interfere with the fibrinogen-GPIIb/IIIa binding process have emerged as powerful tools in thrombosis prevention. P2Y receptor blockers, such as clopidogrel, act to decrease the risk of thrombosis by preventing ADP from binding to its receptors on platelet surfaces. These drugs are frequently used in combination with aspirin to reduce thrombosis further. Additionally, Abciximab, a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb/IIIa receptor, and other GPIIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (such as tirofiban) also function to decrease thrombosis by inhibiting platelet cross-linking directly.
