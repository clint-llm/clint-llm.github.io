There are variations in approach to the formation of an ileal conduit; however, the main principles of the operation are described here. It can be performed open via a laparotomy, laparoscopically or robotically assisted:

The first stage is isolating the ileal loop; approximately a 15 cm ileal segment is identified 15 cm from the ileocaecal junction.**.**In obese patients, the length of ileum will need to be longer to avoid tension on the stoma. The mesentery to the selected ileal segment must be divided with care to preserve the blood supply to both the conduit and the ileo-ileal anastomosis; a Kelly clamp and ties can be used, or an energy device.  When dividing the bowel, it is important to mark the distal end that will form the stoma. A GIA stapler or non-crushing clamps and scalpel can be used to divide the bowel. The remaining two ends of the ileum are anastomosed using a stapled or hand-sewn technique to restore bowel continuity, and the mesenteric window is closed with vicryl sutures. Upon completing the anastomosis, the ileal segment for the conduit should be below that of the ileal anastomosis.

The second stage involves mobilizing the ureters. This should be performed from the lateral side of the ureters as much as possible to preserve their blood supply. The distal ends of the ureters should be handled as little as possible to avoid traumatizing the tissue that is required for the anastomosis. The left ureter is moved to the right side of the abdomen through a window created in the mesentery behind the sigmoid colon. It is important that the blood supply to the sigmoid colon is not compromised and that the window is wide enough to avoid any constriction or tension on the left ureter. The distal ends of the ureters can be cut and sent for analysis to see if there is an extension of cancer, and that would

The third stage is the ureteroenteric anastomosis; this can be an end to side anastomosis (Bricker technique) where the two ureters are anastomosed to the proximal end of the conduit at slightly different locations to avoid any compromise in blood supply. A full-thickness enterotomy is created on the side of the conduit; the ureter is spatulated and then anastomosed to the conduit taking interrupted full-thickness bites of both the ureter and bowel using 4.0 or 5.0 PDS.

The Wallace technique is another popular ureteroenteric anastomosis that requires the proximal end of the conduit to be left open initially and then closed with the two ureters anastomosed over the end. The ureters are spatulated and laid adjacent to each other to be stitched together using PDS, both apexes are aligned together, and the distal ends of the ureters are combined. The free edges of the ureters are then anastomosed to the open end of the conduit sealing it off.

One potential downside to the Wallace technique is that a recurrence in one ureter may compromise the other ureter. No matter which technique is used, several surgical principles apply to both techniques, including maintenance of an adequate distal ureteral blood supply, a tension-free anastomosis, and avoidance of ureteral kinking or twisting.

The fourth stage is creating the stoma via a trephine incision where a circular piece of skin is removed at the pre-marked stoma site, followed by dissection down to the anterior rectus sheath where a cruciate incision is made. Below the anterior sheath, the rectus muscles are split, and then entry into the peritoneal cavity is gained.  The gap in the fascia should be able to admit two fingers.  Once this has occurred, the distal end of the conduit is delivered through to the skin using a Babcock, ensuring there is no twist in the conduit. The stoma is then matured and spouted to prevent excoriation of the skin around the stoma site.
