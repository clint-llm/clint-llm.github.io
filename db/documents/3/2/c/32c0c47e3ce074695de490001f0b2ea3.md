Coronary artery anomalies (CAAs) are a complex condition that remains a top cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes. Evaluation and management guidelines are limited and controversial. Management of this condition requires a multidisciplinary approach with close patient follow-up.Â The primary care provider (PCP) is the first point of medical contact for most patients experiencing symptoms. The PCP should take a detailed history and be careful not to dismiss young fit patients with the aforementioned symptoms easily and, if appropriate, refer the patient to a specialist. For those with diagnosed CAAs, an interprofessional team of interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and congenital heart defect specialists should be established to determine the course of treatment and enhance and improve outcomes. For those who have undergone surgical correction, post-op nursing care is extremely important for the prevention of surgical site infections. Cardiac rehabilitation has proven to be extremely effective in regaining function after surgery, so a physical and occupational therapist should be involved early on in the postoperative period.
