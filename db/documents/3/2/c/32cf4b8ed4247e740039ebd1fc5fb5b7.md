Immediate workup of a patient with suspected gas gangrene includes: CBC, CMP, urinalysis, PT, APTT, blood and wound cultures. Additional blood tests such as ABG, lactic acid, and pre-calcitonin can be helpful in the evaluation of sepsis which is often present in gas gangrene.  Common imaging studies include x-rays, CT scan of the infected body part, and ultrasound. These can be helpful in identifying the extent of the infection, abscess, and gas in the tissues.  Extensive lab and imaging should not delay definitive surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue. A deep-wound aerobic and anaerobic culture at the time of the initial surgical debridement can help determine the causative organism and direct antibiotic therapy.
