The formation of blood vessels initiates with the development of blood islands or islets of Wolff in the mesenchyme of the splanchnic mesoderm, before the yolk sac and later of the allantois. The intra-embryonic vessels originate from the blood islands, in front of the protocordal disk, where a horseshoe-shaped plexiform network forms that surrounds the cephalic portion of the embryo. At the same time two groups of angioblastic cells, in a dorsal paramedian position, form two parallel vessels, the dorsal aortas, which cephalically connect to the plexiform network. The further development of the vascular system consists of the formation of ducts of greater caliber from the primitive plexiform network. The most voluminous of these are the right and left primitive aorta, from which the fetal arterial tree originates which develops parallel to the cardiac tube and its subsequent evolution.

The formation of anastomoses between the intra- and extra-embryonic vessels complete the circulatory system.

The vasculature that supplies the gastrointestinal system originates from the anterior ventral segmental arteries of the primitive aorta between two layers of dorsal mesogastrium. The tenth segmental artery is the source of the foregut artery (celiac artery). This artery supplies blood to all foregut structures, migrates caudally and rotates in concert with the stomach during embryonic development. The celiac artery gives rise to both the hepatic artery and the splenic artery. The hepatic artery further branches into the gastroduodenal artery, giving rise to the RGEA. The splenic artery then gives rise to the LGEA.Â The RGEA and LGEA, along with other local structures elongate with the development of the greater curvature of the stomach and lesser sac.
