A patient diagnosed with generalized tonic-clonic seizures will have a significant impact on their independence, job, driving ability, and self-esteem. Psychosocial issues must be addressed, along with the management of seizures. Patients are educated by the clinician to avoid common seizure triggers, including sleep deprivation, alcohol, certain medications, and vigilance during systemic illness. Patients are advised to avoid activities such as swimming alone, working at heights, and operating heavy machinery to prevent drowning or injury in case seizures recur during these activities. Driving restrictions and notifications to the Department of Motor Vehicles varies among the states; however, most require some degree of abstinence from driving after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
