Individuals in health care, including clinicians, nurses, and dentists and those who work with chemicals or in labs, wear gloves more frequently than the general public. Many medical items contain latex besides gloves and include:

- Stethoscopes

- Catheters

- IV tubing

- Tourniquets

- Electrode pads

- Syringes

- Respirators

- Dental dams

- Drainage tubes

- Condoms

This increased exposure to latex puts them at risk for sensitization initially and ultimately, a latex allergy if sensitization continues. Direct exposure to the allergen through the use of gloves, condoms, or catheters is the most common cause of latex allergy with a direct correlation of sensitization to the amount of exposure.

Airborne particles are another source of allergen exposure as latex can be inhaled into the lungs. Cornstarch particles in latex gloves and tire dust are the most common sources of inhaled particles resulting in latex reactions.
