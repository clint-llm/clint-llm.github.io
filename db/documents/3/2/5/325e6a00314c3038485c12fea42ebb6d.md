Education plays an important role in the successful treatment of major depressive disorder. This would include the education of the family and the patient. Lack of accurate information and misperceptions of the illness as a personal weakness or failings leads to painful stigmatization and avoidance of the diagnosis by many of those affected. Patients should know the rationale behind the choice of treatment, potential adverse effects, and expected results.

The involvement of the pharmacist in the treatment plan can enhance medication compliance and referral for psychotherapy. Engaging family members can be a critical component of a treatment plan. Family members are helpful informants, can ensure medication compliance, be a big source of social support and can encourage patients to change behaviors that perpetuate depression (e.g., inactivity).

**Health Teaching and Health Promotion**

An important role of the nurse is teaching the patient about depression, its symptoms, treatments, and how to promote overall health and wellbeing. The following are points to include in the teaching of a depressed person:

Teach the patient the signs and symptoms of depression.

Emphasize that depression is a medical illness with treatments that are effective so that the patient does not feel stigmatized by the diagnosis.

Reinforce the rationales for the medications and therapies.

Describe the negative triad regarding self, the world, and the future as symptoms of depressive thinking.

Reinforce mindfulness and challenging negative thoughts as strategies to decrease negative rumination

Provide information on support groups, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), that may have local chapters as well as online information. Support groups provide an opportunity to discuss how to live with depression with others who may have gone through similar experiences.

Explain that it may take two to four weeks to reach a good response from the medications and that it is important to work with the prescriber regarding effects and side effects. It may take more than one trial of a medication to reach a good response.

Explain that healthy life choices and behaviors can influence mood. Good sleep hygiene, healthy eating, and regular exercise are important to continue even when feeling depressed and not motivated.

Inform patient to tell all prescribers all medications used, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, because medications can interact with each other.

Remind patient that alcohol and other mood-altering drugs, whether legal or illegal, can impact mood. Many, such as alcohol and opioids, are central nervous system depressants and can worsen depression.
