Complications of Mattox maneuver are potentially serious. The severity and acuity of the underlying conditions, the pace of the procedure in the unstable trauma patients, and the multiple organs with their blood vessels handled in the procedure contribute to the occasional complications. The maneuver is considered life-saving in severe abdominal aortic traumatic injury to provide control on the bleeding. Therefore, complications are an acceptable cost for such an important step in serious injuries.

Complications can be due to the procedure and inadvertentÂ injuries or an extension of the main trauma. Some of the known complications are:

- Splenic injury is the most common iatrogenic complication.

- Avulsion of the descending lumbar vein from the left renal vein.

- Pancreatitis

- GI ischemia related to retraction and congestion of arterial supply.
