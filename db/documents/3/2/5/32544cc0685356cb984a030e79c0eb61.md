**Pharyngeal Arches**

The pharyngeal arches are vital structures that lead to the formation of many important features in the fetus. They first appear at the end of the fourth week and develop through into the fifth week. Although there are five arches, they are numbered one to four as the fifth arch is underdeveloped.

The following table describes the nerve, artery, muscles, and bone/cartilage associated with each arch:

**Arch**

**Nerve**

**Artery**

**Muscle**

**Bone/Cartilage**

1

Trigeminal nerve (CN V)

1st aortic arch- maxillary artery

Muscles of mastication, mylohyoid, anterior belly of digastric, tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani



Maxilla, zygomatic bone, squamous temporal bone, palatine bone, vomer, mandible, incus, malleus

2

Facial nerve (CN VII)

2nd aortic arch- stapedial artery

Muscles of facial expression, posterior belly of digastric, stylohyoid muscle, stapedius

**Pharyngeal Clefts**

Pharyngeal clefts are recesses that lie in between the pharyngeal arches outside the developing pharynx and are lined in ectoderm. There are four clefts, with cleft one lying in between arches one and two, and so on. The first cleft forms the external auditory meatus. The second to fourth clefts are overlapped by an expanding second pharyngeal arch, and the resulting cavity (the cervical sinus) usually disappears as development continues.

**Pharyngeal Pouches**

There are four pharyngeal pouches which are infoldings lined with endoderm between the pharyngeal pouches on the inside of the pharynx. The first pouch is destined to become the future auditory (or Eustachian) tube, corresponding with the first cleft. The membrane between the two forms the tympanic membrane.

The second pouch develops into palatine tonsillar crypts (although lymphatic tissue from the thymus and bone marrow enters much later in development). The third pouch bifurcates with the ventral wing becoming the thymus and the dorsal wing becoming the inferior parathyroid gland. The fourth pouch also bifurcates, the dorsal wing becoming the superior parathyroid gland and the ventral wing developing in the ultimobranchial body (this form the parafollicular cells of the thyroid). During development, rearrangement of these structures occurs, with the thymus descending down the neck towards the thorax and the inferior parathyroid gland moving below the superior one.

**Face**

Facial formation in the fetus occurs between the 5th and 10th week and relies on the fusion of five mesenchymal swellings: the frontonasal prominence, two mandibular processes, and two maxillary processes. Development of the face relies on the growth and fusion of these prominences, and failure can result in various facial abnormalities, some of which I will discuss in the clinical significance section. The maxillary and mandibular processes arise from the first pharyngeal arch (which explains why the sensation of the face is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, which is the first arch’s associated nerve). Neural crest mesenchyme gives rise to the frontonasal prominence.

In the fifth week, ring-like bilateral thickening develops on the frontonasal prominence, called nasal placodes. The edge of the placode enlarges, whereas the middle becomes pitted to form nasal pits. The lateral nasal prominence forms from the lateral edge of the placode, and the medial nasal prominence from the medial edge. Over the next two weeks, the maxillary processes grow medially to the lateral nasal prominence until they fuse. The deep groove between the maxillary processes and the lateral nasal prominence deepens and forms a tube - the nasolacrimal duct. This growth continues compressing the medial nasal prominences towards the midline until they touch and fuse, forming the middle of the nose and the philtrum of the lip. The mandibular processes fuse in the midline.

**Palate**

The palate and roof of the mouth form from the primary and secondary palate. The primary palate forms from the fusion of the medial nasal prominences. The secondary palate forms from bilateral outgrowths from the maxillary prominences and are called palatine shelves. These grow inferiorly from the primary palate until the end of the sixth week, when they elevate and fuse along the midline to form the complete secondary palate - this is the hard palate or roof of the mouth. The nasal septum grows inferiorly from the primary palate to fuse with the secondary palate, dividing the nasal space into two.

**Skull**

The bones of the face (the viscerocranium) are derived primarily from neural crest mesenchyme. These bones are formed either by intramembranous ossification (transformation of mesenchymal connective tissue) or endochondral ossification (ossification of cartilage).

The neurocranium, which includes the bones of both the cranial vault and cranial base, is derived from paraxial mesoderm and neural crest cells. Whereas the cranial vault is mainly developed by intramembranous ossification, the cranial base is mainly formed by endochondral ossification.

Following birth, the neurocranium will increase in size by about 50%. The viscerocranium grows to more than twice its size.****Sutures lie at the meeting point of intramembranous formed bones. Displacement growth can continue at these craniofacial suture lines. When cranial growth eventually ceases, these sutures mostly ossify. The bones of the skull do not fuse before birth and allow crowning of the head during vaginal delivery.
