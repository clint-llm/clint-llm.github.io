The provider obtains informed consent in accordance with hospital policy. Importantly, a motor and sensory exam should take place, and any pre-existing neurological damage documented.

Before the start of the procedure, the following American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) standard monitors should be placed on the patient: pulse oximetry, continuous electrocardiography, and blood pressure (intermittent every 3 to 5 minutes or continuous monitoring). Reliable intravenous access and intravenous fluids should be confirmed. There should be immediate availability of oxygen, resuscitation equipment, and medications. A 20% lipid emulsion should be readily accessible in case of local anesthetic toxicity.

The patient should be in the proper position before femoral nerve placement. The patient should be supine. The correct lower limb should be straightened, slightly abducted, and externally rotated.

The pannus may require additional retraction to better expose the groin area.

Lastly, a Time Out is strongly recommended prior to the start of the procedure for final confirmation. Light sedation may be administered at the direction of the proceduralist based on institutional policy.
