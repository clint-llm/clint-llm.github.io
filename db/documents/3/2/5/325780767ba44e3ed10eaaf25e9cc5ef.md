Laryngeal papillomatosis (LP), also known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP), is the most common benign mesenchymal neoplasm of the larynx in children. RRP is characterized by an over-proliferation of benign squamous papillomas in the aerodigestive tract. The condition has a childhood-onset type and an adult-onset type. It is one of the most difficult benign histologic conditions to treat due to its high tendency to recur and spread to the adjacent respiratory tract. This chapter will briefly discuss the etiology, clinical findings, diagnostic modalities, and the different surgical and nonsurgical management options, as well as recent preventive measures.
