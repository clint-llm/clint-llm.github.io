Many different pathologic processes can exist within the femoral triangle. Femoral hernias can emerge below the inguinal ligament and bulge directly into the femoral triangle. Peripheral arterial disease can develop within the femoral artery as it passes through the triangle. Deep venous thrombosis can develop in the femoral vein. Hematomas or arterio-venous fistulas can develop in the femoral triangle after vascular intervention. Whether primary or metastatic, cancer within the superficial or deep inguinal lymph nodesÂ can lead to lymphadenopathy.
