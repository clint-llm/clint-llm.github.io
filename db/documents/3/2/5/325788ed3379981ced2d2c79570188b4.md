There are no contraindications listed in the product label provided by FDA/manufacturers labeling. However, patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or excipients listed on the product label should avoid using cenegermin.

Many eye drops contain corticosteroids or preservatives (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide). According to FDA/manufacturer product labeling, eye drops containing these substances could slow down or interfere with corneal healing, avoiding their use during treatment with cenegermin. Treatment of active ocular infection is necessary before the use of cenegermin. If there is an ocular infection during the treatment period, avoid using cenegermin until the resolution of the infection.
