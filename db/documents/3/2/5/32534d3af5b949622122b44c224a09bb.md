Two physiological processes regulate the sleep-wake cycle. A homeostatic process, also called process S, builds a homeostatic pressure to sleep with the amount of time spent awake and diminishes that pressure with the amount of time spent in sleep. The second process is a biological circadian rhythm, also known as process C, and involves the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus. Process C responds to temporal cues such as sunlight, also known as zeitgebers, which synchronize the internal circadian rhythm with external time.

Studies on sleep deprivation demonstrate an impact on neurocognition, such as mood, executive function, and cognitive performance. Experiments on chronic partial sleep deprivation, in particular, show that these neurocognitive impairments accumulate over time. Similar neurocognitive deficits occur when sleep deprivation is associated with sleep fragmentation due to an underlying condition.

While not completely understood, evidence also suggests that sleep deprivation is linked with changes to the epigenome. These alterations involve DNA methylation, histone protein modification, and non-coding RNA.
