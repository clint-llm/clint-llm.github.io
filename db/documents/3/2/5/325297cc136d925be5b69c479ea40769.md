The prevalence of congenital causes of selective HA is low, and that of PHA AD type I is less than 1:80000. Some causes of genetically inherited PHA I may be found in higher frequencies in certain ethnic populations.

Acquired causes are more frequent and commoner in hospitalized patients, children with type1 diabetes or sickle cell disease, adults with type 1 and 2 diabetes, and older adults on multiple medications known to affect the RAA axis. The incidence of contralateral adrenal suppression after adrenalectomy for Conn syndrome is estimated at around 5 percent.

Hyperkalemia occurs with increased frequency in recipients of solid organ transplantation and subsequent use of calcineurin inhibitors and is estimated between 40 and 70 percent.
