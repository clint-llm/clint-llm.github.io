The treatment for iron overload is reduction therapy. This is most commonly achieved through therapeutic phlebotomy. In patients with an acceptable hemoglobin level, phlebotomy can initially be prescribed every 1 to 2 weeks until serum ferritin is brought within acceptable levels. Then a schedule of periodic phlebotomy can be maintained, generally every 2 to 3 months, according to achieved serum ferritin levels. When serum ferritin remains above 1000 ng/ml, the risk of liver damage and life expectancy decreases dramatically. Often, patients with mildly elevated serum ferritin levels are advised to donate blood on a regular basis. Donating more frequently than every 8 weeks usually necessitates physician approval.

In patients with hemoglobin levels that do not tolerate therapeutic phlebotomy, iron chelation therapy becomes an option. Deferoxamine is an iron chelation therapy currentlyÂ in use. A conundrum occurs in patients who must receive regular blood donations, such as the patient with thalassemia.
