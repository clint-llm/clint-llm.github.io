Visual impairment and blindness are reversible, with the majority of ocular pathology seen in preeclampsia. In postpartum studies, the majority of patients who experiencedÂ visual symptoms of preeclampsia recovered completely. However, longitudinal studies of patients with preeclampsia have shown permanent changes to retinal microvasculature and cerebral white matter. Long-term studies have also demonstrated an increased risk for retinal structural and vascular disease. Patients with preeclampsia have 5.3 times the risk of tractional retinal detachments, an 8.5-fold increase in non-diabetic and diabetic retinopathy, and 3.7 times the risk of retinal breaks later in life.

Patients with preeclampsia have exhibited an increased incidence of white matter lesions and cerebral pathology postpartum. The distribution of lesions in one small study showed statistically significant differences in the location of white matter lesions when comparing patients with and without preeclampsia and eclampsia. Patients with preeclampsia who had white matter lesions had a 100% incidence of frontal lesions and the highest rate of temporal white matter lesions. Patients with eclampsia most represented the presence of parietal white matter lesions.

Patients with a history of eclampsia have reported significant visual morbidity due to these white matter lesions. Visual field testing in patients after preeclampsia and eclampsia has shown intact visual fields.
