Worldwide, about 470 million people have hookworm infections. Infection predominates within developing countries and leads to huge losses of economic productivity due to anemia worsening the already existing poverty and disease.

Necator americanus is the major cause of hookworm infections worldwide, while Ancylostoma duodenale tends to be endemicÂ to the Mediterranean region and northern India and China.

Risk factors for developing hookworm infections include low socioeconomic background, exposure to infected soil, barefoot walking, poor sanitation, and personal hygiene. Children and pregnant women are at the highest risk. Transmission is affected by multiple factors such as warm and moist climate, contaminated water supply, and poor sanitation.
