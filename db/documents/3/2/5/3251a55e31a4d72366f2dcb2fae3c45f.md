In the differential diagnoses, other verrucous lesions like tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, verruca vulgaris, blastomycosis, leishmaniasis, syphilis, yaws verrucous hemangioma, hypertrophic lichen planus, and lupus vulgaris merit consideration. In the sporotrichoid type in which linear lesions occur, sporotrichosis is a very close differential diagnosis. The presence of black dots on the surface, which are due to the transepidermal elimination of fungal elements, is the most important differentiating feature from other conditions. The black dots can be scraped preferentially from the surface and viewed under the microscope after adding 10% KOH.
