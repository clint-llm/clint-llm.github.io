The cardinal ligament is one of the pedicles the surgeon must secure during a hysterectomy. Due to the absence of basic neurovascular structure, the first pedicle of transvaginal hysterectomy involves a distal section of cardinal ligament along with the uterosacral ligament (CUSC). The presence of ureter and other neural and vascular structures make the intermediate section unsuitable for surgical use.
