Individuals with pseudocholinesterase deficiency are often only diagnosed after experiencing prolonged neuromuscular paralysis following standard doses of succinylcholine and mivacurium.

Management for those previously diagnosed with pseudocholinesterase deficiency includes the avoidance of depolarizing the neuromuscular blocker succinylcholine and the non-depolarizing muscular blocker mivacurium. Â Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers such as atracurium, rocuronium, and vecuronium safe for use in future anesthetics.
