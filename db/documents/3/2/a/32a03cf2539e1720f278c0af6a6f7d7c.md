Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and non-invasive treatment technique used to treat various psychiatric and neurological disorders. It involves the stimulation of specific deep brain regions by the production of high and low-intensity magnetic fields which modulates the cortical excitability. This activity reviews the use of rTMS for treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, OCD, Tourette syndrome, and various other movement disorders. It also illustrates the importance of an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the indications for the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.
- Describes the most common adverse effects associated with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.
- Explains the equipment and the technique to use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.
- Summarize how interprofessional team coordination can improve results when utilizing repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a treatment option.
