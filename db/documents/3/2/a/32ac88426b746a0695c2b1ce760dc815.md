Fever, sore throat, fatigue, and tender lymph nodes are classic findings on history-taking in infected individuals with mononucleosis. The incubation period for mononucleosis is long averaging 3-6 weeks and most patients do not recall the exposure.

The classical triad is fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. Additional complaints include a headache, general malaise, and poor oral intake.  Unfortunately for some, fatigue can be persistent for months in select individuals. Lymphadenopathy is more common in the posterior cervical region. The pharyngitis is often heralded with tonsillar exudates. Petechial lesions on the palate occur infrequently. Also, splenomegaly is a key finding on physical in up to half of patients with active clinical mononucleosis. Identification is important in patients prone to future injury, e.g., active sports participants. Skin examination in some patients may infrequently reveal a nonspecific, generalized maculopapular rash. This is separate from the antibiotic-induced rash discussed below.
