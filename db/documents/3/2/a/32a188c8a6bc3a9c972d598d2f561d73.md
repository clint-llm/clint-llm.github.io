The obstruction of the outward flow of urine leads to an increase in the hydrostatic pressure of the collecting system. This causes an increase in intraglomerular pressure, which will ultimately affect the glomerular filtration rate. The duration and severity of obstruction determine the extent of loss of kidney function. If the obstruction is not relieved, it can lead to kidney scarring and permanent kidney damage with the compromise of glomerular and tubular function. Hence hydronephrosis can be considered acute if kidney function recovers completely when an obstruction is relieved.

In contrast, the kidney function does not recover in chronic hydronephrosis even after the obstruction is relieved. The prolonged obstruction causes a dilated collecting system, compression of papillae, and thinning of parenchyma leading ultimately to cortical atrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Impairment of sodium reabsorption, disruption of urinary acidification leading to metabolic acidosis, and urinary concentrating ability are some of the physiologic effects.
