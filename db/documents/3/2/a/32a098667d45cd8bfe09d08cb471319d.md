MRI is the primary imaging modality in the diagnosis of anterior cord syndrome. T2 hyperintensities within the region of the anterior horns are the hallmark finding. These hyperintensities on the sagittal view appear as thin “pencil-like” lesions extending vertically across several spinal levels. On the axial view, these hyperintensities appear as two bright dots, one within each anterior horn, resembling “owl’s eyes” in appearance. If imaging is obtained in the early stages of development, edema will be present and can cause the spinal cord to appear expanded in the region of infarction. Sometimes, signs of vertebral body infarction can be identified near the area of question, increasing the specificity of imaging for cord infarction.

Patients with history and clinical findings consistent with anterior cord syndrome with positive MRI findings likely do not need further testing. However, other testing can rule out alternative diagnoses, as well as determine the underlying etiology that has caused their cord infarction. Additional imaging tests can rule out aortic or vertebral artery dissection, multiple sclerosis, or look for sources of embolism. Lumbar puncture and CSF testing can help to look for infection or inflammatory disease. Blood and urine tests can rule out infectious, hypercoagulable, atherosclerotic, inflammatory/rheumatic, or drug-related etiologies.
