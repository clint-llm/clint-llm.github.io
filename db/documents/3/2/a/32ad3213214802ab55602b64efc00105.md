A deficiency in STS (Xp22.3) is responsible for the abnormal cutaneous scaling seen in X-linked ichthyosis. Most X-linked ichthyosis patients have extensive deletions (complete or partial) of the STS gene; however, point mutations may result in complete STS deficiency. Female carriers of STS gene do not exhibit any manifestations because the gene is localized to a region of the X-chromosome that does not undergo X-inactivation. De novo
STS mutation also occurs.
