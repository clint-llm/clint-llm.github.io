The fluid can be collected after puncturing or deroofing the blister. Fluid is then examined for gram-stain smear and bacterial culture and sensitivity for confirmation of the diagnosis and for starting appropriate antibiotics.

A histopathological examination has not been done in published case reports, but Weedon writes that the blistering results from massive subepidermal edema. The presence of erosions in some cases suggests that the split in the epidermis is superficial.
