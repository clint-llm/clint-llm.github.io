Primitive reflexes are innate, automatic motor patterns and reactions emerging during fetal life until after birth crucial for an infant's survival. These reflexes are being integrated and replaced gradually in term infants into higher-level righting, support, and protective postural reactions. This dynamic transition is part of the neuropsychomotor organization and development, physiological maturation, fine-tuning of the nervous system, which includes motor centers in the brainstem to the cerebral cortex - occurring in response to increasing environmental influences and demands. The involved reflex integration allows a change in the quality of movements, from clumsy to more natural, spontaneous, and efficient sensory processing, internal postural control, and acquired, goal-directed, precise, and well-coordinated voluntary motor skills and movements against gravity, which in effect, affect learning and behavior of a child in his later stages of life.

Some studies also mentioned primitive reflexes' unconscious influence and their use in response to both stressful and nonstressful conditions in healthy older children and neurologically intact adults. This "reflex recruitment" allows the production of the desired movement with greater efficiency despite motor stress and is demonstrated in athletic postures, including asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR) in the volley in tennis and the lunge position in fencing to increase upper-arm strength during resisted movement. Additionally, primitive reflexes could have synergistic and antagonistic effects, such as the case of interaction between the tonic labyrinth and neck proprioceptors. The antagonistic actions of the labyrinth reflex for the head tilt or rotation are opposed by the neck reflexes causing upright trunk posture and stabilizing action to extremities (no net movement) acting as a single system.

ATNR is a primitive reflex that appears 18 weeks in utero, most prominent between 1 and 4 months of age, and disappears by 3 to 9 months after birth. This reflex is produced by rotating the head to one side, causing the ipsilateral extension of the extremities towards which the face is turned and contralateral flexion of extremities. This reflex is essential for postural tone and stability, gross and fine movements, eye tracking, and midline crossing crucial for reading, telling the time, left-right discrimination, etc. On the other hand, symmetrical tonic neck reflex (STNR) appears 6 to 9 months after birth until 9 to 11 months of age. This reflex is elicited by moving the head up and down passively with subsequent upper extremity flexion and lower extremity extension with neck flexion while neck extension produces upper extremity extension and lower extremity flexion. This reflex is significant for posture, eye-hand coordination, and focus required in activities like sitting, swimming, playing with a ball, etc. This postural tone is influenced by cortical and subcortical structures, including somatic descending brain stem pathways, descending fiber tracts of monoaminergic systems pathways, and limbic system.
