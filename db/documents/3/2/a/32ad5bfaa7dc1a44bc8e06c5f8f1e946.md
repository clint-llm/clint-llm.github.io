The nose is a highly vascular structure with multiple anastomoses and redundancy of blood supply. The external nose receives vascular supply via the dorsal nasal artery from the ophthalmic artery, which supplies the superior superficial aspect of the nose. The angular and superior labial arteries come from the facial artery and supply the lateral nose, ala, and the columella.

The superior septum is supplied by the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries and the sphenopalatine artery. Terminal branches of the superior labial artery supply the anterior septum and the nasal floor. The anterior septum gets its blood supply by the superior labial, anterior ethmoidal, greater palatine and sphenopalatine arteries in a confluence called Kiesselbach’s plexus.

The venous drainage of the nose occurs via the anterior facial vein, the sphenopalatine vein, and the ethmoid veins. The lymphatic drainage of the nose occurs anteriorly via the upper lip lymphatics and posteriorly via the deep cervical and retropharyngeal lymph nodes.
