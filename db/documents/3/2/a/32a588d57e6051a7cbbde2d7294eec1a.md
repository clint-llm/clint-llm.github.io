Primary tracheal tumors are uncommon but usually malignant in adults, accounting for about 0.2 % of all malignant tumors. The estimated incidence of tracheal cancers is about 0.1 per 100,000 people per year. The largest report of primary tracheal tumors is based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database study of 578 cases. In this analysis, 55% were men, and the major histological type was squamous cell carcinoma, accounting for 45% of the cases. Other histologic types include adenoid cystic carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, sarcoma, adenocarcinoma, and carcinoma not otherwise specified or undifferentiated type. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of tracheal cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tracheal cancer.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with tracheal cancer.
- Outline the management options available for tracheal cancer.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by tracheal cancer.
