The pathogenesis of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia is not known at this time. However, given its clinical presentation and biochemical similarities to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a prothrombotic and potentially life-threatening condition, a similar immune-mediated response induced by these adenoviral vector vaccines has been postulated as immune complexes with a mixture of antibody specificities similar to HIT was noted in the serum of patients who developed this syndrome.

Based on a report by the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research (GTH), it has been hypothesized that postvaccination antibodies are formed against platelet antigens as a part of the immune stimulation process. These antibodies trigger massive platelet activation against PF4, resulting in immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.
