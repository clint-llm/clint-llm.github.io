Retinoblastoma occurs as a result of a mutation in the RB1 tumor suppressor gene located at the long arm of chromosome 13 at locus 14 (13q14).

**Heritable**

In this type of retinoblastoma, there is a mutation in one of the alleles of the RB1 gene in all body cells. When the second allele has a mutation as a result of some mutagenic event, it leads to the malignant transformation of cells. Due to the presence of the mutation in all cells, a large number of these children develop bilateral and multifocal retinoblastoma. Heritable disease patients are at significant risk of nonocular cancers such as pineoblastoma, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas, and melanomas: these malignancies usually occur in a particular age group.

**Non-heritable**

Non-heritable retinoblastomas are unilateral and are not transmitted. There is no risk of non-ocular cancers in these patients. In the case of unilateral retinoblastoma with no positive family history, it is non-heritable retinoblastoma, and the corresponding risk in each sibling and patient's offspring is 1%. Almost 90% of unilateral retinoblastomas cases are of the nonhereditary form.
