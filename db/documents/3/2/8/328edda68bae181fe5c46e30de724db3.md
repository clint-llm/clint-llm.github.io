Physiologic variants of the upper extremity may manifest within and around the intrinsic hand muscles. Anomalous muscles and neurovasculature may create compressive neuropathies of the hand or distorted anatomical landmarks. Although they exist as a minority, it is important to distinguish normal anatomy from clinically relevant and asymptomatic variants to avoid misdiagnoses or overdiagnoses.

Variants of the lumbrical muscles have been the subject of much study.

Studies have also shown variants of neurovasculature within the hand.
