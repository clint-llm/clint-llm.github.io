A pilomatrixoma, or calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, is a benign tumor of the hair follicle matrix that exclusively occurs in heat-bearing areas. These tumor cells can differentiate into hair matrix, hair cortex, follicular infundibulum, outer root sheath, and hair bulge. They commonly occur in pediatric patients over the head and neck but can also involve the extremities and trunk. On the head, the preauricular region is most commonly involved. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of pilomatrixoma and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe when pilomatrixoma should be included in a differential diagnosis.
- Outline the pathophysiology of pilomatrixoma.
- Identify when a specialist referral should be sought for a patient with a pilomatrixoma. 
- Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care and outcomes for patients with pilomatrixomas.
