The exact epidemiology of Retinal traction detachment has not been reported in large scale studies, mainly because of its multifactorial etiology. However, one study by Poulsen et al. reported the incidence of primary RTD in southern Denmark to be 1.25 per 100 000 inhabitants per year.

Out of all diabetic vitrectomies, RTDs are reported to be 20% in early series and 46% in more recent studies.
