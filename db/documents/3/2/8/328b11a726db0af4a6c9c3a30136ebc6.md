Most of the CAPs are recognized at the time of perforation during coronary angiography. However, subtle CAPs can go unrecognized. Acute onset of shortness of breath, hypotension, unexplained new-onset tachycardia, recurrent or persistent chest pain can develop in these later situations. CAP needs to be in the differential in these situations. As little as an accumulation of 100 ml of blood in pericardial space in the acute setting is sufficient to cause hemodynamic instability.
