Clinicians often use urine drug screens for initial assessment, monitoring compliance, and documenting unusual drug behaviors when prescribing opioids. Another important tool is the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which measures and monitors pain levels. However, VAS has some reported issues, including whether it is a ratio or ordinal level of pain measurement. Providers who treat patients with chronic opioid therapy should incorporate prescription drug monitoring program data into the treatment protocol.

The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) is a useful tool to evaluate individuals experiencing opioid withdrawal. Clinicians score withdrawal symptoms, including yawning, rhinorrhea, restlessness, and physiological measures, such as pulse rate, pupil size, and blood pressure to assess a patient’s level of withdrawal and infer their level of dependence on opioids.
