Paget disease is usually seen in individuals older than 50 years. It is common in Caucasians of northern European descent. Paget disease is equally common in males and females. In the US, it is said to affect 1-3 million people but most are asymptomatic. The disorder is slightly more common in white males. The disorder usually presents in the 4-5 decade of life but the diagnosis is often made a decade later.
