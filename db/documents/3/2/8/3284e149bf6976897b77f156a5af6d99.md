CKTR is, by definition, immune-mediated and generally divides into chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (CAAMR) and chronic active T cell-mediated rejection (CATMR).

Cell-mediated injury can involve both the renal tubulointerstitial or arterial components. Antigen-presenting cells (APC) present donor antigens to T cells, which then cross the microcirculation of the donor's kidney and enter the interstitium. Several cytokines are then produced, including interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), triggering a cascade of inflammation leading to tubulitis, the hallmark feature of CATMR.
