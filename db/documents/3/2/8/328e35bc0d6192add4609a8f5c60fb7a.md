History and physical exam are typically normal in patients with empty sella syndrome because the endocrine function is usually intact. The most common symptom associated with ESS is a headache. There is a lack of evidence to support ESS as the cause of the headache. Many experts believe that the association exists because the headache of any unrelated cause prompted imaging of the head, leading to the incidental discovery of the empty sella. Other authors consider the possibility that increased intracranial pressure and possible herniation cause headaches; however, no confirmation of this theory exists either.

Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea is possible, as is visual field impairment; however, both of these presentations are rare.

Endocrine abnormalities are present in less than 20% of cases of empty sella. If the pituitary function is compromised, history and physical exam can be consistent with any or all pituitary hormone deficiencies.

In recent case reports, there have been rare patient presentations with unusual symptoms and signs, like hyponatremia, acromegaly, and mental problems like dementia.
