An interprofessional approach to colorectal cancer is crucial for achieving good patient outcomes. Rectal microsurgery is an emerging technique. Knowledge of patient selection and procedural steps are essential for good postoperative care and early identification of potential complications utilizing clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, and NPs), nursing staff, and in some cases, pharmacists. Teamwork and open communication are necessary to establish effective communication and advancement of clinical knowledge aimed at optimizing care for patients and reducing unnecessary hospital stays.
