Traumatic lumbar spondylolisthesis, also known as traumatic lumbar locked facet syndrome, is an acute anterior shift of a lumbar vertebral body (L1 and L5) over another. This rare injury arises from complex trauma and high-energy mechanisms resulting in pathoanatomical changes at the intervertebral articulations. Usually, lumbar spondylolisthesis is encountered in degenerative diseases. Moreover, reported cases of traumatic lumbar spine injuries commonly involve either the thoracolumbar or lumbosacral region. This activity reviews the anatomy of the lumbar vertebrae emphasizing the intervertebral joints and the mechanisms of injury as well as management options. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of lumbar spondylolisthesis. 
- Outline the presentation of a patient with a lumbar spondylolisthesis. 
- Summarize the treatment options for lumbar spondylolisthesis. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis.
