A detailed literature review reveals a lot of controversies and changing consensus over the inclusion and exclusion criteria for CBS.

Another essential thing to be kept in mind is that the majority of information on CBS is detailed in psychiatric literature than ophthalmic literature. If the patients present with hallucinations, they are labeled as mentally unstable and referred to a psychiatrist.

To an ophthalmologist, these patients present with visual impairment, as most suffer from defective vision. Even the first described patients, Lullin and Bonnet, presented with ocular pathology, and the ophthalmologists rarely encountered these patients with visual hallucinations.

CB-type visual hallucinations without a visual loss should be labeled as separate entities. Cognitive decline is another contributory factor but is rarely the primary etiological factor. The most widely accepted definition of CBS is sensory deprivation-deafferentation- of the cerebral cortex and release phenomenon of hallucinations. CBS may mimic Alzheimer and Parkinsonism as cognition is impaired in all these conditions.
