The dermatomal area of the skin overlying frontal bone the by the ophthalmic branch of CN V.  This makes sense as the frontal bone has two supraorbital foramina where this branch can exit the cranium and supply the skin superficial to the frontal bone.

CN VII is significant for the frontal bone region due to its innervation of the muscles in the area that are involved in facial expression.  Mainly this includes the frontalis, procerus, and orbicularis oculi.
