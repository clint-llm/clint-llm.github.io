The differential diagnosis for patients with hereditary spherocytosis is broad and includes other red blood cell disorders including elliptocytosis and its variants, hereditary stomatocytosis, pyropoikilocytosis, and ovalocytosis. Additionally, red blood cell enzymes disorders should also be considered, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or pyruvate kinase deficiency.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a common cause of hemolysis, and it commonly presents in adult patients. Unlike elliptocytosis, however, patients with AIHA commonly test positive for Coombs, and this disease does not commonly correlate with a positive family history.
