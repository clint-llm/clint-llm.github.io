Every disaster or large-scale event differs from the next and responders must be prepared to shift priority and assignments. While many disasters are relatively straightforward and can be managed with local resources, situations that affect larger populations or groups of medically fragile patients, require more assets, support, and resources. Responders, both locally and at the state levels, must consider the recovery efforts for any event and begin acquiring resources that will be needed as quickly as possible.  Critical Incident Stress Management is often overlooked and allows responders to focus on their mental health and wellbeing after an incident has occurred. With continued, multi-level coordination of efforts to support practice and patient care, local Incident Commanders will have access to needed state and federal assets. All disasters should include an After Action review process to identify opportunities for improving response to future events and all participants should be offered stress management counseling.
