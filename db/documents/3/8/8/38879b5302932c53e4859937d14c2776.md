United States Boxed Warning: Lamotrigine can cause serious rashes requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of this medication. Rash severity varies but includes a risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The incidence of Stevens-Johnson syndrome in the pediatric population is 0.3% to 0.8% and 0.03% to 0.08% in adult populations. The number of cases associated with toxic epidermal necrolysis is too low to report an estimated incidence. Nearly all cases of a rash occur 2 to 8 weeks after the initiation of lamotrigine. It should also bear mentioning that the discontinuation of lamotrigine may not prevent a rash from becoming life-threatening. Patient education should include continuous monitoring of the rash for improvement after discontinuing the medication.

Other serious adverse effects include multi-organ sensitivity, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, blood dyscrasias, suicidal behavior/ideations, aseptic meningitis, status epilepticus, and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.
