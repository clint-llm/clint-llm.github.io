Plain radiographs must be evaluated for fractures of the cervical spine, transverse processes, clavicle, first rib, and scapula. Findings on initial examination are supplemented with advanced imaging and electrophysiological evaluation to determine the prognosis of neurologic recovery further. MRI and CT myelogram allow for identification of pseudomeningocele associated with root avulsions.

Recording of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) in response to distal stimulation of the peripheral nerves helps to differentiate pre- and postganglionic lesions. If the patient exhibits a loss of sensation in a specific dermatomal distribution, a preserved SNAP is indicative of preganglionic injury due to the intact sensory cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion.
