The nursing staff has a special skill in patient education.Â  It is useful to have nursing staff educate the patient about the proposed procedure and counsel on test results and therapies.

Nursing staff should also prepare a sterile tray: topical antiseptic, 18-gauge needle, 5 to 10 cc syringe for aspiration, 1 to 3 cc syringe if an injectable anesthetic is chosen. Clean dressing materials and compression dressing such as Coban

Anesthetic options: ethyl chloride spray or lignocaine 2.5% and prilocaine 2.5% cream for skin anesthesia; injectable lidocaine (with or without epinephrine) may be used if desired by the patient.
