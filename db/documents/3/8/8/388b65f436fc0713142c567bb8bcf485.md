Tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis is a complication of certain antineoplastic medications that target many pathways. The inhibition of the EGFR pathway disrupts the differentiation of many tissues, affecting the cornea by causing decreased corneal healing and proliferation. The inhibition of these two key processes leads to TKI keratitis.

Management in most cases of TKI keratitis consists of hydrating the cornea but can require more aggressive treatment. Prognosis is good in most patients.

Many types of keratitis should be kept in the differential when working-up a patient with ocular disturbances and taking a TKI. The ophthalmologist should be able to discern one type of keratitis from another based on the clinical presentation and laboratory exams.
