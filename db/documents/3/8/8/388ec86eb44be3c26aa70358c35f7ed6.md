A mass casualty incident (MCI) is defined as “an event that overwhelms the local healthcare system, where the number of casualties vastly exceeds the local resources and capabilities in a short period of time.” Any MCI can rapidly exhaust available resources for not only the MCI but the normal day-to-day tasks of the hospital. Each hospital should institute a surge plan in preparation for anticipated, progressive, insidious ("notice" events), and sudden-onset ("no-notice" events) disasters occurring within the community.

First and foremost in responding to an MCI is identifying the type of MCI present. Categories include:

- Planned (sporting event)

- Conventional, which usually have some level of recurring frequency (transportation incidents, burn, and severe weather events)

- Chemical, biological, radiological

- Nuclear agents from an unintentional or accidental release or act of terrorism

- Catastrophic health events (nuclear detonation, major explosion, a major hurricane, pandemic influenza, or others).

The keys in successfully managing the chaos of a fast-paced, moving MCI can be delineated with the organization of the 5 “S's”: “scene safety assessment, scene size-up, send information, scene set-up, and START.”
