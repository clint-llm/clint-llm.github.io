Milrinone is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components. It is relatively contraindicated in patients with severe heart failure or severe pulmonary hypertension. In severe pulmonary hypertension, generalized vasodilation of pulmonary vasculature may worsen V/Q mismatch and lead to worsened hypoxemia. When considering the use of milrinone in these populations, it is advisable to consult a specialist for expert guidance.

Milrinone is generally contraindicated in patients with acute kidney injury and end-stage renal disease, as it primarily undergoes renal excretion. Hence, Clinicians should reduce the infusion rate in patients suffering from renal impairment.

**Warning:**According to the manufacturer's labeling, milrinone is not safe when given for the longer (greater than 48 hours) treatment of patients with heart failure. Long-term oral treatment with milrinone is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and death in patients with Class III and IV heart failure. Patients with NYHA Class IV symptoms appeared to be at higher risk. Milrinone is associated with ventricular arrhythmias, including NSVT(nonsustained ventricular tachycardia). In addition, long-term oral use is associated with an increased risk of sudden death.
