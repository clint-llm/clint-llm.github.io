The role of cavum veli interpositi in brain pathology is still uncertain, although several pieces of evidence have accumulated.

The existence of a syndrome characterized by moderate ventricular dilation without intracranial hypertension, progressive increase in head size has been hypothesized in association with the presence and CVI.

Tubbs and coll. (J Pediatr Neurol. 2004; 2: 107-110) studied a couple of identical twins with midline cerebral cysts, increased head size, and mild ventricular enlargement. They suggested that the midline cysts can lead to microcephaly and mild ventricular enlargement through recurrent episodes of raised intracranial pressure. The intermittency of symptoms was explained by a ball-valve mechanism between the cisterna CVI and the cisterna venae magnae Galeni.
