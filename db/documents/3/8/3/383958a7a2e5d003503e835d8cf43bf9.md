In addition to complications from chemotherapy and radiotherapy that are discussed above, the disease process itself has complications like recurrence. GBM is usually associated with pseudoprogression, which is a sub-acute worsening of MRI findings that occur within three months after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. It is a treatment-related effect. It is important to distinguish between pseudoprogression and the true progression of the disease to avoid abrupt discontinuation of treatment. The key feature to distinguish is that pseudoprogression is usually asymptomatic. Treatment should be continued if pseudoprogression is suspected unless the patient is symptomatic or worsening of clinical features occur.
