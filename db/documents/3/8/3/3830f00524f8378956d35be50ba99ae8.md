Mucinous cystadenoma (MCN) is an epithelial neoplasm producing mucin and forming cysts arising from the pancreas. They account for nearly half of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas, with the others being serous cystadenomaÂ (SCN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). MCNs and IPMN have features in common like cyst formation, mucin production, and progressing to invasive carcinoma. Most often, MCNs are located in the body and tail region of the pancreas, and they are often found incidentally.
