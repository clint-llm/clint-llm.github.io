The greater splanchnic nerve (GSN) is the largest of 3 paired sympathetic nerves supplying the abdominal viscera. Preganglionic fibers follow a unique course through the sympathetic chain and feed into the GSN. After descending through the thorax and piercing the diaphragm, these fibers terminate in the superior-most preaortic ganglia, commonly known as the celiac ganglia. The GSN broadcasts its postganglionic fibers to foregut organs by way of the celiac plexus. Clinically, the GSN is responsible for some cases of chronic upper abdominal pain. Surgical interventions exist for patients whose pain does not respond to traditional pharmacologic therapy.
