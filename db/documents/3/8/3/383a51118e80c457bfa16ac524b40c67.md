The most common symptoms are plantar pain between metatarsal heads that are aggravated by walking and wearing tight-fitting, high-heeled shoes and relieved by resting and removing shoes. Patients describe the pain as burning, stabbing, or tingling with electric sensations. Some patients describe the sensation as walking on a stone or marble. Numbness between the toes is present in less than half of the patients. With prolonged walking, the pain can radiate to the hindfoot or leg, causing cramps.
