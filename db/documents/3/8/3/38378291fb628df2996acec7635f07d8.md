Patients and their families should be educated about borderline personality disorder and be provided with the necessary literature to learn about the condition. The families should be advised that the patients may get angry and suicidal and told to seek help immediately. In addition, patients should be encouraged to seek and continue psychotherapy until they experience sustained benefits.
