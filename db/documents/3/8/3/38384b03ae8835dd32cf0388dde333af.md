Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis was primarily thought to be caused by Malassezia furfur. Still, studies have been inconsistent with the detection of the yeast in patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis. The current infectious theory is that confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is caused by bacteria, Dietzia papillomatosis, anaerobic gram-positive coccus/rod actinomycete. There are noninfectious causes of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, including diabetes, obesity, ultraviolet light, amyloidosis, and K16 mutation. There is an association between confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, diabetes mellitus, and obesity because hyperinsulinemia has mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects. Increased levels of insulin activate insulin-like growth factor 1, tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor and induce epidermal proliferation. Changes in confluent and reticulated papillomatosis with changing weight and diabetes control support this theory. UV light can induce confluent and reticulated papillomatosis because it has an effect on melanogenesis and can cause transient epidermal hyperplasia. Amyloid deposits have been found in some patients with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis, suggesting amyloidosis as a cause. Familial cases of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis could be due to overexpression of keratin-16.
