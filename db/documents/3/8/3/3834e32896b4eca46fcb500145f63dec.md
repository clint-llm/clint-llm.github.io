Refractive errors are an important common cause of visual disturbance worldwide.

Further, myopia was more prevalent in females (39.9%) than males (32.6%). Sethu et al. found the prevalence of refractive error of at least 0.50 diopter (D) spherical, equivalent to 53.1%. Myopia and hypermetropia were found to be the most common refractive errors accounting for 27.7% and 22.9%, respectively.

Symptoms related to refractive errors are quite disturbing and may even disrupt the normal lifestyle of individuals. Refractive error patients form the majority of outpatient patients visiting an optometrist or ophthalmology clinic. A study by Schiefer et al. found refractive errors accounted for 21.1% of the patients presenting to an ophthalmologist.

The evaluation of these patients can be occasionally aided by topical agents called cycloplegic drugs.

Noncycloplegic refraction is performed without any drug administration. It doesn't affect the accommodation and pupil dilatation.
