Detailed history regarding maternal and paternal Rh blood grouping, prior blood transfusions, previous pregnancies especially with the history of Rh-hemolytic disease, trauma or invasive obstetric procedures, spontaneous or induced abortions, and administration of Rh IgG should be obtained carefully. Physical examination depends on the severity of the disease.

Neonates with mild Rh-hemolytic disease exhibit only mild jaundice during the first few days of postnatal life. They recover without any subsequent damage. Moderately affected infants may have anemia and jaundice both at the same time. Severely affected newborns develop kernicterus several days after delivery due to the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin in tissues of the central nervous system. Kernicterus is characterized by loss of early neurological reflexes e.g., Moro reflex, posturing reflex, bulging fontanelle, arching of head and heels back like a bow, floppy body, a high pitched cry, poor feeding, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Premature infants are more prone to develop neurological damage in Rh-incompatibility.

Severe Rh-hemolytic disease can also cause a life-threatening condition in infants called erythroblastosis fetalis characterized by jaundice and severe hemolytic anemia. Hydrops fetalis is the most severe form of erythroblastosis fetalis, which develops in infants with extreme pallor having a hematocrit less than 5 and is associated with more than a 50% mortality rate.
