The incidence of cardiogenic shock is in decline, which can be attributed to increased rates of use of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute MI. However, approximately 5% to 8% of STEMI and 2% to 3% of NON-STEMI cases can result in cardiogenic shock. This can translate to 40,000 to 50,000 cases per year in the United States.

Cardiogenic shock has a higher incidence in the following classes of patients:

- Elderly population

- Patient population with diabetes

- Prior history of left ventricular injury

- Female gender
