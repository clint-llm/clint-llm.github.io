The pathogenesis of toxic megacolon is not entirely known. Nevertheless, one of the possible mechanisms proposed suggests that mucosal inflammation initiates the process. It releases inflammatory mediators, bacterial products and increases the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase, which in turn increases nitric oxide, and thus causes dilation of the colon. A study showed that patients withÂ toxic megacolon have significantly high levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the muscularis propria, which could support this proposed mechanism.
