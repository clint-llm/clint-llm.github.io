Certain hallmarks for CHF include jugular venous distention (JVD), dyspnea/tachypnea, tachycardia, crackles in the lungs, and pitting pedal edema. JVD is due to decreased venous return to the heart via the right atrium. As blood continues to back up in the system circuit, the superficial vessels of the neck may become swollen with blood. Dyspnea arises from the decreased gas exchange at alveoli flooded with fluid. Tachypnea is a compensatory mechanism by which the body attempts to exhale excess carbon dioxide, and tachycardia acts to return blood to the lungs as quickly as possible to accomplish gas exchange. As plasma is filtered into the alveoli, crackles begin to be heard bilaterally. These crackles often are first noticed in the lower lung fields, as filtered plasma is affected by gravity.
