The human heart has four different anatomical valves that play a role in the regulation of blood flow into and out of the myocardium. The two semilunar valves include the pulmonic and aortic valves, and the two atrioventricular valves include the mitral and tricuspid valves.

Except for the mitral valve, all the cardiac valves are tri-leaflet. Each of the heart valves is surrounded by a complete or partial fibrous ring (annulus), which helps supports the valves. The aortic valve is located between the ascending aorta and the left ventricular outflow tract. It is a very important valve and closely approximates other myocardial structures like the mitral valve posterolaterally, the pulmonic valve anteriorly, and the tricuspid valve posteromedially.
