Hair and scalp dermoscopic examination (trichoscopy) of areas containing tuft hair folliculitis exhibits tufts of hair emerging from a unique follicle. The hair follicles are surrounded by scaling, and by a white coloration in a "starburst pattern" predictive of fibrosis process. Blood vessels may be observed and are located between the hair follicles.

A scalp biopsy may be helpful to determine the cause of the tufted hair folliculitis. If the patient has an active primary scarring hair alopecia, such as lichen planus, the typical pathologic changes associated with that condition will be present. Scalp biopsy can also indicate the extent of scarring and the degree of active inflammation, which can have a prognostic information about the condition. Bacterial cultures often yield Staphylococcus, but this organism is not seen in all cases. Nor does treating the Staphylococcus lead to resolution of the condition. A fungal culture is commonly negative.
