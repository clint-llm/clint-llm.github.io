Targeted temperature management aims to reduce mortality and improve neurological outcomes in unresponsive patients who achieve ROSC after cardiac arrest. This activity reviews the indications, practical aspects, and complications of targeted temperature management and highlights the interprofessional team's role in using this adjunctive resuscitation treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for targeted temperature management in patients with cardiac arrest.
- Describe the phases of therapeutic hypothermia.
- Outline the various complications that may occur in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance targeted temperature management and improve outcomes after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.
