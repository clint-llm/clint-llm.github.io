Because of their similarity of end-organ affinity, pharmacological action, and target patients, beta-blockers are the most common confounders. Compared to CCBs, beta-blockers are less likely to cause hyperglycemia in adult patients.

However, an initial presentation with bradycardia and hypotension should prompt consideration of a wide array of pharmacological agents, including:

- Beta-blocker toxicity

- Tricyclic antidepressant toxicity

- Digoxin toxicity

- Clonidine overdose

- Sedative-hypnotic toxicity

- Opiate overdose

- Organophosphate poisoning
