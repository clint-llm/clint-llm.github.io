Profound anesthesia is a prerequisite for most dental treatments as it allows the patient to be comfortable and the clinician to deliver treatment.

The selection of local anesthetic agents and delivery techniques can influence the efficacy of anesthesia.

Although local anesthesia is rarely associated with serious adverse effects, clinicians must additionally understand the potential complications to ensure patient safety. This must also extend to understanding how best to manage or prevent these complications.

Furthermore, understanding the nerve supply to the dentition and surrounding tissues is essential to ensure that the anesthetic solution is deposited near the nerves supplying the area of interest. In addition, an awareness of possible anatomical variations allows the clinician to understand why anesthesia might fail and what methods can be utilized to overcome failure.

Failure to achieve anesthesia can delay treatment and cause the patient to lose confidence in the clinician and dentistry. Clinicians must understand why anesthesia can fail and be able to utilize alternative techniques where conventional methods have failed.
