Pudendal neuralgia caused by pudendal nerve entrapment is chronic, severely disabling, neuropathic pain in the distribution of the pudendal nerve in both males and females. Pudendal neuralgia can arise from mechanical or non-mechanical injuries. It is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed and inappropriately treated, initially causing a significant delay in proper management and severely negatively impacting the quality of life. This activity highlights the evaluation and management of pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome and interprofessional teams' role in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome.
- Review the evaluation of pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care for patients affected by pudendal nerve entrapment syndrome and improve outcomes.
