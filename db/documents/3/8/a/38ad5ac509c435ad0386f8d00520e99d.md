A proposed mechanism of uremic encephalopathy is an accumulation of neurotoxins.

No common pathway has been identified, but three processes may contribute overall. These include an imbalance in the inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, neuronal degeneration, and vascular inflammation.

According to one hypothesis, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of glycine increase, and glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) decrease. The accumulation of guanidino compounds (the result of L-arginine metabolism) leads to the activation of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and further inhibition of inhibitory GABA receptors.

Recently a link between vascular endothelial dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction has been recognized and may be contributing to the clinical syndrome of UE.

The blood pressure regulatory neurons are located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The RVLM contains the pre-sympathetic neurons. When exposed to high uric acid concentrations, indoxyl sulfate, and methyl guanidine, RVLM neuronal activity increases. Subsequent use of antioxidant drugs results in cessation of the RVLM activity, which suggests that the reactive oxidant species have a central role in developing the clinical syndrome of UE. While urea is the surrogate for neurotoxins, which are lowered with dialysis, there is no credible evidence linking urea to encephalopathy. Recent studies have shown that indoxyl sulfate can cause vascular inflammation and neurological symptoms.

Oxidative stress can alter mitochondrial function. Dysfunctional mitochondria produce more uremic toxins developing into a self-perpetuating cycle.
