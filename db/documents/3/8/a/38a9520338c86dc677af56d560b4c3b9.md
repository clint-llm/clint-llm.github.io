Due to the increased risk of infection in patients prescribed brodalumab, all patients require screening for tuberculosis (TB) before initiation of the medication. If a patient has an active TB infection, the clinician should not administer the drug. For patients with latent TB or a history of latent or active TB with unconfirmed treatment, therapy for TB infection should start before the initiation of brodalumab, as there is a risk for latent TB reactivation.

Patients should be informed of the increased risk of neutropenia, and they will need monitoring for any new or non-resolving infections. Additionally, live vaccines should be avoided in patients while they are taking brodalumab.
