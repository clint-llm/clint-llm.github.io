Common adverse effects of leflunomide include:

- Diarrhea

- Elevation in liver enzymes

- Hypertension

- Rash

- Nausea

- Abdominal pain

- Back pain

- Alopecia

Less common effects are hematological disorders, such as pancytopenia, and pulmonary disorders such as interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis.

Leflunomide can also cause reversible inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B receptors but is only slightly effective as an MAO inhibitor. Researchers studied it for the treatment of Parkinson disease.
