Vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPoma) are neuroendocrine tumors secreting vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in an unregulated manner. The VIPoma syndrome is also known as Verner-Morrison syndrome, watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria (WDHA) syndrome, and pancreatic cholera syndrome. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of VIPomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the symptoms of VIPomas in adults and children. 
- Review the importance of laboratory tests and imaging studies in diagnosing VIPomas.
- Explain the need for follow-up in patients with VIPomas.
- Summarize the significance of an integrated interprofessional approach to the medical and surgical management of VIPomas.
