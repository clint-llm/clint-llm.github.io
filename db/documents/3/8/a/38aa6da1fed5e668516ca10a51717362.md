The cause of OHs is poorly understood, although genetic mutations, embolic phenomenon, and hormones may play a prominent role in development. One hypothesis suggests that OHs are due to embolic placental endothelial cells, which enter the fetal circulation following trauma or some other cellular stressor and serve as stem cells. This explanation is consistent with studies that demonstrate that chorionic villus sampling increases the risk of hemangiomas. Another theory is that spontaneous, or inherited, loss-of-function mutations on chromosome 5q lead to the constitutive activation of angiogenesis, resulting in hemangioma formation. A third hypothesis is that hemangiomas develop due to the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) production by nearby cells in response to hypoxic stressors. However, none of these hypotheses address the female predominance of hemangiomas or the predilection of these vascular tumors for the head and neck.
