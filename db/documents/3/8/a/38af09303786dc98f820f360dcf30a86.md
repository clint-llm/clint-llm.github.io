Patients withÂ Plummer-Vinson syndrome have an excellent outcome, with most symptomatic patients requiring only one esophagogastroduodenoscopy with dilatation for complete relief of symptoms in conjunction with iron replacement therapy.

Patients are at an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx or upper esophagus, which may be related to chronic iron deficiency. This is believed to cause irreversible mucosal changes leading to malignant degeneration.
