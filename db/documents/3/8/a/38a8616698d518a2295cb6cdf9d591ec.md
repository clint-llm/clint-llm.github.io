Conductive hearing loss is common in younger patients due to conditions such as otitis media with effusion. A study on primary school children found the prevalence of hearing loss to be 15%, with 88.9% of those being conductive.

In low-middle income countries, hearing loss secondary to otitis media can be as high as 26%.
