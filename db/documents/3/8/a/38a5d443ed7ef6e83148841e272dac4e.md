The prognosis of benign eyelid lesions is generally good. In those cases where the lesion is responsible for another disease such as glaucoma, amblyopia, or exposure keratopathy, steps must be taken to adequately manage these diseases for good outcomes. In those cases where the benign eyelid lesion increases the suspicion of systemic diseases such as hypercholesteremia, neurofibromatosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, or tuberous sclerosis, appropriate testing, referrals, and communication will improve outcomes as well.
