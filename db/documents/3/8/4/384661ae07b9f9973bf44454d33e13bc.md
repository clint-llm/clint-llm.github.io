All medical personnel can implement negative pressure wound therapy, including physicians, podiatrists, wound care specialists, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. However, specific training and a sufficient level of expertise must be obtained before the independent application of any NPWT dressings. This is due to the complex nature of the wounds, which may be refractory to other methods of wound management and therefore prone to further complications if the procedure is performed incorrectly.

Closed wounds are usually dressed either on a hospital floor or clinic by trained healthcare personnel. If the closed wound results from a surgically closed incision or a skin graft, the initial NPWT should be applied in the operating room (OR) by the operating surgeon or surgical scrub nurse. On the other hand, open wounds warrant surgical management at the first stage in the OR. Accordingly, one to two surgeons and an experienced surgical scrub nurse will be necessary throughout the procedure. Once the initial management in the OR has been completed, subsequent NPWT dressing changes can be performed on the ward or in a clinic-based environment by appropriately trained healthcare personnel.

In complex polytrauma cases, an intensive care facility may be considered.
