Cockayne syndrome belongs, like xeroderma pigmentosum and trichothiodystrophy, to the group of diseases that affect DNA repair by nucleotide excision (NER). The cells reveal a specific alteration of the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway, a subtype of NER involved in the repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage in actively transcribed genes. Other alterations in basal transcription or oxidative repair have also been suggested to explain the non-cutaneous symptoms ofÂ Cockayne syndrome.
