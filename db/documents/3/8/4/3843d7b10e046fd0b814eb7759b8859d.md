There are several described complications with osteochondral autografting.

- The donor cartilage can be damaged in the insertion process, leading to degeneration and graft failure.

- The graft can not fit the recipient joint surface topography and can sit proud, leading to excessive forces on the edges of the graft, infection, and graft loosening.

- Donor site morbidity remains a concern for osteochondral transplantation, which includes excessive postoperative bleeding and donor site pain.
