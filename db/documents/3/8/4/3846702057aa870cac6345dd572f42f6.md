SBDS gene codes for the SBDS protein. The protein is found predominantly in the nucleolus and is implicated in the normal functioning of ribosomes, amplification of the centrosomes, and in leukemogenesis. However, the true function of the SBDS protein is still unknown. In the pancreas, there is the fatty replacement of the acinar cells, which results in an exocrine deficiency. Cytopenias result in stress hematopoiesis in the bone marrow, which accounts for the elevated levels of hemoglobin F. The exact mechanism behind malignant transformation into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is unknown.  The abnormalities in the hematological system may be absent on initial presentation but can manifest later as part of an evolving process.
