The feeding jejunostomy tube is a method of delivering feeds through jejunal access in the small bowel. It is used when there is a contraindication to the placement of a gastrostomy tube. Although it is a relatively simple procedure, it can be associated with complications like bowel obstruction and metabolic abnormalities. Minimally invasive techniques are preferred in the placement of these tubes. This activity reviews the salient features of the feeding jejunostomy tube and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for placing feeding jejunotomies.
- Describe the equipment, preparation, and techniques when placing feeding jejunostomy tubes.
- Outline the potential complications arising from the placement of jejunostomy tubes with the appropriate management of these complications.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance feeding jejunostomies and improve outcomes.
