Tactile mechanoreceptors enable touch, an essential sense for the survival and development of humans. Contact with objects provides information to the CNS that allows exploration of the environment

- Meissner corpuscles are involved in skin movement and object handling detection, and their primary stimulation is through dynamic deformation.

- Ruffini corpuscles primarily sense skin stretching, movement, and finger position.

- Pacinian corpuscles sense vibrations and detect fine textures.

Afferent signals from baroreceptors contribute to a negative feedback loop within the medulla responsible for mean arterial pressure (MAP) maintenance. A rise in MAP causes activation of the baroreceptor, resulting in a reduction of sympathetic signals to vessels and the heart. This signal modification reestablishes MAP to appropriate levels. Reduction in MAP consequently leads to a reduction in stimulation of baroreceptors, causing an increase in sympathetic stimulation, increased cardiac output, and vasoconstriction. This interaction is the baroreceptor reflex.
