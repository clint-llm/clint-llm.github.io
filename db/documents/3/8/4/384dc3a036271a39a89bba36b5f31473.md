Most patients are asymptomatic and identified through a blood test. Pallor is the most important clinical sign, but it is not usually visible unless hemoglobin falls to 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL. A thorough history may reveal fatigue, a decreased ability to work, shortness of breath, or worsening congestive heart failure. Children may have cognitive impairment and developmental delays. Patients should be questioned regarding their diet as well as asked about any bleeding from menorrhagia or gastrointestinal sources. The physical exam may reveal pale skin and conjunctiva, resting tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and guaiac-positive stool.
