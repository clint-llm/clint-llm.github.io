As the histopathologic diagnosis of CTE is made posthumously, clinical features of CTE have been garnered from retrospective case studies and interviews with family members of those diagnosed with the disease. Behavioral disturbances include aggression, explosivity, and impulsivity. Mood disturbances include anxiety, apathy, depression, lability, mania, and suicidality. Cognitive impairments include poor attention and concentration, dementia, executive impairment, and memory deficits. Motor deficits can include ataxia, gait disturbance, and parkinsonism.
