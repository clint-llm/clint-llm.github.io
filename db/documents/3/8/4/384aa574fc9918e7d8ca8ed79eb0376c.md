Bacteria from the lower genital tract ascend to create an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary, and potentially other adjacent pelvic organs. Tubo-ovarian abscesses are often polymicrobial and typically contain a predominance of anaerobic bacteria. Although associated with sexually transmitted infections, the most commonly recovered bacteria from a TOA include Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus, Peptococcus, and aerobic streptococci. Interestingly, neither Neisseria gonorrhea nor Chlamydia trachomatis is typically isolated from a TOA.
