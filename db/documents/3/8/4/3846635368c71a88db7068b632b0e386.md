Deleterious effects of fever include an increase in cardiac output, an increase in oxygen consumption, and an increase in carbon dioxide production.

A drop in GCS commonly occurs in patients with traumatic brain injury or stroke whenever a new onset fever sets in. Maternal fever is associated with fetal malformations & spontaneous abortion.

Persistent high fevers also cause rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury, necessitating renal replacement therapy. Fever could have significant indirect impacts too. Apart from the cost implication of any fever evaluation and treatment, unexplained fevers often prompt misuse or overuse of antibiotics (empiric use even in non-infectious causes), which could result in economic burden and promote the development of multidrug resistance.
