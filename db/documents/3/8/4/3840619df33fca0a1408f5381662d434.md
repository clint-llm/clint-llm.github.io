There are no absolute contraindications to PET/CT. However, suboptimal preparation can result in rescheduling on the day of the study. For example, hyperglycemic states decrease optimal FDG uptake in the targeted regions, hence glucose levels > 200 m/dl will limit the accuracy of the test, and the study will need to be postponed until the patient can achieve glycemic control.
