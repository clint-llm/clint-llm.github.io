Laryngeal papilloma is a condition that has been studied thoroughly but is stillÂ being constantly researched since no cure has yet been found. The pathophysiology behind LP is thought to be an infection of the stem cells within the basal layer of the aerodigestive tract squamous mucosa that may lead to either activation expression or latent expression of the genes. HPV has also been associated with activating the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor pathway.
