Enterocyte DMT1 and Dcytb levels are upregulated in cases of iron deficiency anemia, and mutations in DMT1 have been shown to give rise to microcytic anemias and liver iron overload.

Conditions that degrade the mucosa of the duodenum will decrease absorption of iron and include:

- Celiac disease

- Tropical sprue

- Crohnâ€™s disease

- Duodenal cancer

- Duodenal ulcers

- Familial adenomatous polyposis

Anemia of chronic disease is a normochromic, normocytic anemia that shows characteristically elevated ferritin stores but lower total body iron. Inflammatory states increase cytokine release (IL-6), which stimulates hepcidin expression in the liver. Hepcidin causes decreased iron absorption through ferroportin degradation and decreases the release of iron from macrophages. The iron that accumulates in cells in anemia of chronic disease is stored as ferritin.

Iron-deficiency anemia is a hypochromic, microcytic anemia caused by hemorrhage (most commonly through trauma or gastrointestinal lesions), decreased dietary iron, or decreased iron absorption. Menstruating women of reproductive age require twice the amount of iron as similarly-aged men. Pregnancy and breastfeeding also significantly increase the iron requirements of women, helping to make iron deficiency the most common dietary deficiency in the world.
