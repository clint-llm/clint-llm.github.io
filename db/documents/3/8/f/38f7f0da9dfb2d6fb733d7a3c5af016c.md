Developmental disorders of the esophagus are relatively common, occurring in approximately 1 in 3000 live births. Because of the shared embryologic origins of the esophagus and respiratory system, esophageal defects commonly correlate with concurrent defects in the lungs and trachea. These defects include several combinations of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. The defects, understandably, can lead to difficulties with feeding and, in some cases maintaining oxygenation, requiring urgent attention in the perinatal period. In utero, defects of the esophagus can lead to difficult birth conditions stemming from the decreased ability to swallow and resultant polyhydramnios. While the process of organogenesis is immensely complex and the cellular mediators are still being worked out, a basic understanding of the current knowledge on esophageal embryology is important for understanding the link between congenital esophageal and tracheal malformations.
