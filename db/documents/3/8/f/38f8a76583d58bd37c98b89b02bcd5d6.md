Syncope, a sudden, transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, is a phenomenon estimated to affect 30% to 40% of the population, and those numbers are likely underestimated given the high prevalence of patients who do not present to a hospital or urgent care setting. While most syncopal events are innocuous, cardiac syncope is often indicative of a potentially fatal, underlying disease process, carrying a one-year mortality rate of 30%. Distinguishing cardiac syncope from the myriad of other syncopal etiologies can be challenging. For this reason, it is imperative for all interprofessional team members to have a general knowledge of cardiac syncope and how to recognize it. This activity reviews a patient's workup with cardiac syncope and describes the interprofessional team's role in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cardiac syncope.
- Describe the pathophysiology of cardiac syncope.
- Summarize the treatment of cardiac syncope.
- Outline the workup of a patient with cardiac syncope and describe the role of the interprofessional team to manage this condition.
