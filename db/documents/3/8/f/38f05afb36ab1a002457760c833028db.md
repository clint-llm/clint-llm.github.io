The hypothalamus is located in the ventral brain above the pituitary gland and below the third ventricle. The afferent pathways to the hypothalamic nuclei, the majority of which are located in the anterior hypothalamus, arise from the brainstem, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and olfactory areas.

One of the major efferent pathways from the hypothalamus is the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial tract, which connects the para-ventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus to the nerve terminals in the median eminence, towards the anterior pituitary gland, and the posterior pituitary gland. The para-ventricular nucleus releases mostly oxytocin and some ADH, and the supraoptic nucleus releases mostly ADH and some oxytocin directly into the bloodstream. The pituitary gland is comprised of the adenohypophysis, also known as the anterior pituitary, and the neurohypophysis, also known as the posterior pituitary.
