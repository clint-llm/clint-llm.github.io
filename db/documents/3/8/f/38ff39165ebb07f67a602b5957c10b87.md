Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes has a high prevalence in the CF population. The incidence increases with age. It is present in 2% of children, 19% of adolescents, and up to 50% of individuals 30 years of age and older. The prevalence rate may appear to be lower at centers that do not perform universal oral glucose tolerance screening testing.
