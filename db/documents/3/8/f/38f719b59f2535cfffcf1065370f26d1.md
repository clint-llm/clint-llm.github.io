Exenatide is available as an immediate-release solution and extended-release suspension for subcutaneous administration. The administration of these injections should be in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm. Additionally, patients should receive instruction to use a different injection site for each dose to prevent infection.

**Immediate-Release**

The immediate-release formulation of exenatide is available in prefilled pens containing 250 mcg/mL in two different package sizes: 1.2 mL prefilled pen with a 5 mcg/dose and 2.4 mL prefilled pen containing 10 mcg/dose. Doses should be initiated at 5 mcg twice daily within 60 minutes of morning and evening meals. If the response is inadequate after one month of therapy, the dose may be increased to 10 mcg twice daily with the two most substantial meals of the day. Doses should be administered at least 6 hours apart and not after meals.

**Extended-Release**

The extended-release formulation is available in both prefilled pens and single-use vials containing 2 mg of the drug. Both formulations require reconstitution before administration. Patients should visually inspect the solution for particulates before injecting.
