Spatial neglect syndrome, a behavioral disorder, also known as unilateral or hemineglect syndrome, is a disabling condition that often presents with diagnostic difficulties even for specialists familiar with this condition.

Neglect is a heterogeneous syndrome due to variations in the location and extent of brain damage. This interhemispheric imbalance causes the left hemisphere to become more active after the right hemisphere lesion, which results in attention diversion and eye movements towards the right side. The presence of spatial neglect indicates a severe prognosis in terms of the long-term independent functioning of the patient.

Clinicians can estimate the severity of this unilateral neglect using the Kessler Foundation Neglect Assessment Process (KF-NAP) or Conley Scale scores.
