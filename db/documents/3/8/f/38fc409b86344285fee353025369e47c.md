Ideally, charting the daily basal body temperature will show a noticeable increase of approximately 0.5 to 1 degrees F shortly after ovulation. This increase then sustains until the start of menstruation in which BBT then decreases back to baseline.

Additionally, it is essential to understand the risks associated with using basal body temperature charting as a method of contraception. BBT measurements help aid women who are trying to conceive by tracking a cycle, but the mechanism does not protect an individual from sexually transmitted infections or unwanted pregnancy. Because of the many environmental factors that can alter BBT, it offers limited protection from pregnancy. Those who are uninterested in conceiving should stick to other hormonal contraception methods such as oral contraceptive pills, patches, injections, or implants. Condoms are also options for barrier protection.
