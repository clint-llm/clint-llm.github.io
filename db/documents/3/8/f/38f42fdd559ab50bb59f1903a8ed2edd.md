The exact pathophysiology of the development of these tumors is not fully understood. Although rare, thymic NETs have been associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes. Up to one-third present concomitantly with paraneoplastic conditions. The most common being Cushing’s syndrome presenting in 30% to 35% cases in which thymic NETs may secrete ectopic adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH).

Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to the secretion of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP) can be present in up to 30% of patients.
