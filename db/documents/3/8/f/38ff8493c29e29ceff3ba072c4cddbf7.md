Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a central disorder of hypersomnolence, with the primary complaint being the irresistible need to sleep and waking up non-refreshed despite the prolonged duration of sleep. The subtypes and diagnostic criteria for the diseases have been debated in the past. Current subtypes are based on the length of total sleep time- Idiopathic Hypersomnia with long sleep time and idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time. Although IH is a diagnosis of exclusion, electrophysiological testing, including polysomnography and mean sleep latency test remain crucial to establish the diagnosis. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with idiopathic hypersomnia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe signs and symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia.
- Outline differential diagnoses of hypersomnolence.
- Summarize the diagnostic criteria.
- Review treatment options for idiopathic hypersomnia.
