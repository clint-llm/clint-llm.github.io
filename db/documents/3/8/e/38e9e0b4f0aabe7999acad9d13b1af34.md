The most common complications associated with ECV are fetal heart rate abnormalities, occurring at a rate of 4.7%, but these usually are transient and improve upon completion or abandonment of the procedure. More severe complications of ECV occur at a rate of less than 1% and include emergency cesarean section, premature rupture of membranes, cord prolapse, vaginal bleeding, placental abruption, fetomaternal hemorrhage, and stillbirth. Although complications are rare, ECV should be attempted in locations where an emergency cesarean section can be performed. For this reason, some practitioners chose to perform ECV in the operating room, although this is not necessary.
