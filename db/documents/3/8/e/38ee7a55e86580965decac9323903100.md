Radial keratotomy correction for refractive error was a commonly performed surgical procedure in the latter part of the 20th century. This type of corneal surgery involves multiple linear incisions in the anterior cornea that cause central cornea flattening and thereby reducing its focusing power. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment with radial keratotomy correction, including the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for radial keratotomy.
- Describe the preparation and technique in regard to radial keratotomy.
- Review the potential complications associated with radial keratotomy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance radial keratotomy and improve outcomes.
