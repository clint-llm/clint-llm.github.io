The management of patients with branchial cleft cysts is interprofessional. The surgery is usually performed by an otolaryngologist or, rarely, by a pediatric surgeon. However, the follow-up may be required by a nurse practitioner, pediatrician, or primary care provider. Surgery is the only treatment for branchial cleft cysts. Two well-known complications are recurrence and infection. Specialty trained nurses in the fields of otolaryngology are involved in family education, patient monitoring, and patient feedback. In rare cases, injury to the facial nerves may also occur, requiring further surgery. The outcomes after branchial cleft cysts are excellent, with a recurrence rate of about 3% to 7% (Level V).
