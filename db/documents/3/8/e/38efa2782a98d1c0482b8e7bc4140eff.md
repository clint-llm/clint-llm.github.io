May-Thurner syndrome is best diagnosed with the use of imaging. Various modalities for imaging are discussed here

1. Ultrasound (US) Doppler: This is the most common technique used in the emergency department to diagnose a DVT. However, technical difficulties in assessing the inferior vena cava (IVC) and iliac vein may limit their utility. In addition to this, it is very challenging to diagnose iliac vein compression on a US Doppler. The high velocity of blood in the common iliac vein may indicate iliac vein compression; however, this exam depends on technical expertise.

2. CT venography: It has a higher sensitivity and specificity to detect iliac vein compression nearing 95%. It is also useful in ruling out other causes of iliac vein compression, like lymphadenopathy, hematoma, and cellulitis.

3. Magnetic Resonance venography (MRV): MRI/MRV has been proposed as an alternative to diagnose MTS. However, a single MRV may not be sufficient to diagnose MTS due to variability of LCI compression over time and may also be limited by cost.

4. Venography with intravascular US (IVUS): This is the gold standard to diagnose MTS.Â IVUS provides a real-time evaluation of the vessel lumen, the accurate size of the luminal diameter, and provides information regarding the structural changes in the vessel wall.
