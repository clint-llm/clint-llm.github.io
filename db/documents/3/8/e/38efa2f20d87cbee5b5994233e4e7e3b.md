The urorectal septum partitions the endodermal cloaca at the end of the hindgut into urogenital sinus and rectum. The urogenital sinus is continuous above with the allantois, which drains the embryonic bladder to the umbilical cord. The allantois will regress and become urachus later in the developmental process. The urogenital sinus divides into an anterior vesicourethral canal, which develops into the urinary bladder and a posterior vesicourethral canal that gives rise to the urethra. The mesonephric ducts and the ureters attached to them get absorbed into the posterior wall of the urinary bladder, which will become the trigone located between the ureteric openings and internal urethral orifice.
