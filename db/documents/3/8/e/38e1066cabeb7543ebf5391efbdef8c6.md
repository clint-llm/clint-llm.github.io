Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are those activities that allow an individual to live independently in a community. Although not necessary for functional living, the ability to perform IADLs can significantly improve the quality of life. The major domains of IADLs include cooking, cleaning, transportation, laundry, and managing finances. Occupational therapists commonly assess IADLs in the setting of rehab to determine the level of an individualâ€™s need for assistance and cognitive function.

IADLs are commonly confused with basic activities of daily living (ADLs). The major domains of ADLs are feeding, dressing, bathing, and walking. In contrast with IADLs, ADLs are necessary for basic functional living. Deficits in performing ADLs may indicate the need for home healthcare or placement in a skilled nursing facility.
