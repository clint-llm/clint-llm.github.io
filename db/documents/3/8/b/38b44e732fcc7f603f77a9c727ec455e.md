**Low-risk Disease**

Most of the patients (about 95%) diagnosed with a hydatidiform mole who develop neoplasia have a low risk of resistance. For most of these patients, mono-chemotherapy with methotrexate or dactinomycin is the treatment of choice.

If the first-line therapy fails—usually because of resistance— it can be easily replaced with second-line or occasionally third-line chemotherapy, making the overall survival rate almost 100%.

**High-risk Disease**

The majority of high-risk patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia present with many metastases months or years following the causative pregnancy of any type. Signs and symptoms differ according to the disease's location. For example, patients with brain metastases can present with headaches, seizures, or hemiparesis. On the other hand, patients with lung metastasis can present with shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or pleuritic chest pain. Since menstrual irregularity is not universal, unfortunately, the diagnosis can be missed. The included imaging studies should be body CT, brain, and pelvic MRI along with Doppler ultrasonography. If the brain scan was normal, a lumbar puncture should be done to assess the ratio of cerebrospinal fluid to serum hCG.
