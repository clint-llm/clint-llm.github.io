According to product labeling following are the adverse effects of atenolol.

- Boxed Warning: Atenolol should not be stopped abruptly - doing so may exacerbate angina, acute myocardial infarction, or ventricular arrhythmias. Gradual tapering of the dose is recommended.

- Common side effects include bradycardia, diarrhea, dizziness, constipation, confusion, dyspnea, headache, heart failure, erectile dysfunction, nausea, fatigue, paraesthesia, peripheral coldness, rash, sleep disorders, syncope, visual impairment, and bronchospasm.

- Rare side effects include alopecia, dry mouth, postural hypotension, psychosis, psoriasis, thrombocytopenia, depression, mild transaminitis, and depression.

- The BRASH syndrome is characterized by severe bradycardia, renal failure, atrioventricular blockade, shock, and hyperkalemia. Discontinue atenolol if BRASH syndrome is suspected.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Concomitant use of rivastigmine with beta blockers like atenolol requires caution, particularly when patients have sick sinus syndrome or cardiovascular comorbidities due to the risk of syncope and bradycardia.

- Administering atenolol concurrently with amiodarone, digoxin, or verapamil may cause heart block, bradycardia, and left ventricular dysfunction.

- Antipsychotics and beta blockers have the potential for interactions. Case report of risperidone and atenolol-induced bradycardia has been reported.

- Amifostine can lead to a rapid drop in blood pressure; avoid using blood pressure-lowering agents such as atenolol with amifostine.

- Beta-blockers like atenolol should be tapered and stopped several days before clonidine discontinuation to decrease the risk of rebound hypertension, according to the AAFP guidelines.
