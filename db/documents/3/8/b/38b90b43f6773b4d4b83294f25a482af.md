Approved as a therapeutic modality for actinic keratosis and some non-melanoma skin cancers, photodynamic therapy provides for a non-invasive, relatively lesser painful therapeutic modality with the advantage of excellent cosmesis and preservation of normal tissue. Photodynamic therapy is increasingly being applied to non-oncological indications in dermatology. Recent advances have provided for improved delivery systems for the photosensitizers. Also, there is ongoing research in the development of newer photosensitizers.

After exposure to light of appropriate wavelength (470-700 nm), the photosensitizing agent undergoes biochemical changesÂ leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which then results in selective cytotoxic damage.

The topically applied agents are prodrugs, which, over time, are converted into protoporphyrin 9, which acts as the photosensitizer.

Protoporphyrin 9 generated from the photosensitizers is metabolized fully into heme within a period of 24 to 48 hours, and hence this largely reduces prolonged cutaneous phototoxicity.

The advantage of topical photosensitizers is that there is a minimal risk of generalized photosensitivity.
