The differential diagnosis primarily includes SLL/CLL and DLBCL. Both SLL/CLL and mantle cell lymphoma are CD5 positive, mature B-cell lymphomas and may be difficult to distinguish by flow cytometry alone. When there is positivity for CD200 and CD23, the diagnosis is most likely SLL/CLL. Mantle cell lymphoma is typically negative for CD23; it is positive for FMC7. Confirmation of MCL is typically performed by either FISH for t(11;14) or immunohistochemistry for cyclin D1 and/or SOX11. In tissue, uniform positive immunohistochemicalÂ expression of B-cells by Cyclin D1 and SOX 11 supports MCL. Focal positivity for Cyclin D1 may be seen in the proliferation centers of SLL/CLL and should not prompt a diagnosis of MCL.

When the architecture of a lymph node is intact and only shows focal involvement by atypical cyclin D1 positive cells, mantle cell neoplasia in situ may be a diagnostic consideration.
