GCA is a systemic disease of variableÂ presentation and duration. In some patients, it has a course of a few years, while in others, the course is more chronic. The majority of the patients are able to taper and discontinue the corticosteroids after a few years of the disease onset, but some may require long-term use of low-dose corticosteroids. However, GCA does not affect the overall survival rate of an individual except for those patients with aortitis and aortic dissection involvement.
