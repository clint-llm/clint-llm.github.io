The following are some important differentials which should be taken into consideration while making the diagnosis of linitis plastica:

- Atrophic gastritis (as this could present with dyspepsia and decreased distensibility along with malnutrition due to destruction of the mucosa and loss of mucosal folds)

- Hypertrophic H.pylori chronic gastritis (this may resemble the hypertrophy in mucosal folds that occurs in LP due to submucosal infiltration, but here distensibility will remain intact)

- Corrosive gastritis (it will be accompanied by corrosive esophagitis with identification from the history)

- Other types of diffuse infiltration as lymphoma, GIST, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, Bormann type 3 and 4 (histopathological differentiation will resolve the issue)

- Watermelon stomach with portal hypertension and loss of distensibility from the congestion (accompanied by liver decompensation and signs of portal hypertension)

- Post partial gastrectomy loss of gastric volume and distensibility (history of the previous operation is identified)
