Renal leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare and aggressive mesenchymal tumor. The tumor usually arises from the smooth muscle cells of the intrarenal blood vessels or the renal pelvis. It has a high tendency for local recurrence and frequently metastasizes to distant organs. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of renal leiomyosarcoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical characteristics of renal leiomyosarcoma.
- Review the importance of image-guided percutaneous needle biopsy in establishing the diagnosis.
- Outline the entities that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal leiomyosarcoma.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with renal leiomyosarcoma.
