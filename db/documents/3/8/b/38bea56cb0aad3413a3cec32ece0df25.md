**Contact Specular Microscope**

In this microscope, a contact lens with a coupling fluid is used. This has a similar index of refraction to that cornea, which eliminates the corneal specular reflection. In this method, the corneal thickness also includes the contact lens thickness.

The reflection from the contact lens surface replaces that of the corneal surface. The contact apparatus provides good resolution as well as magnification. Due to the contact procedure, there is a risk of infection if sterile precautions are not taken, and the majority time, the patient feels uncomfortable. Manipulation with this technique can induce artifacts and especially in diseased corneas.

**Non-Contact Specular Microscope**

In a non-contact specular microscope, the reflections from the anterior surface are eliminated by increasing the angle of incidence. By modifying the angle of incidence, the anterior review is moved to the side, and there is less specular reflection. This technique being non-contact is more tolerated and accepted by the patient, and there is minor infection. Hence a broader view is obtained.

**Wide Field Specular Microscope**

This is a modification of the previous version with the addition of a scanning mirror. A field of 800 um is obtained with no loss of contrast.
