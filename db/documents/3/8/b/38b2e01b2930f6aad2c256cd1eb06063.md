Patients with congenital heart disease, including coarctation of the aorta, have better outcomes when a multidisciplinary collaborative approach is undertaken. This collaborative effort must target the cardiac sequelae that can possibly manifest in the course of treatment of coarctation. This enlists the required support of the following:

- Advanced cardiac imaging services to interpret anatomy pre and post-procedure

- Interventional cardiologists to plan and execute an intervention

- Cardiac anesthesiologists to titrate appropriate anesthetic and monitor hemodynamics intraoperative

- Pediatric or general adult cardiologists with expertise in congenital heart disease

An effort to refine care for congenital heart disease including coarctation of the aorta has led to the American Board of Medical Specialties to approve Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) as a subspecialty that encompasses adult cardiology and pediatric cardiology. Additionally, there exist ACHD specialists who are not board-certified but have gained a considerable amount of experience and expertise prior to the inception of board certification bodies in this field.

In general, patients with complex congenital heart disease and those undergoing invasive management have better outcomes, including survival when they are managed at specialized centers.
