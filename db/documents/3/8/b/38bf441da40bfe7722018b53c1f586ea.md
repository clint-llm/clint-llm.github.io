Proper use of CDC and OSHA-recommended PPE within a healthcare setting prevents the spread of infectious pathogens between patients and providers. However, more expansive studies are needed to review current practices and policies.

PPE also serves to help healthcare workers avoid harmful outcomes in the setting of exposure to CBRN agents. Adherence to PPE standards is multifaceted, with several components factoring into healthcare workers' ability and desire to follow PPE guidelines. Areas of concern include workplace culture, availability of PPE, training, trust in PPE, and communication of hospital guidelines.

Administrative teams are often responsible for ensuring the availability of PPE resources. Infection prevention teams that monitor and track hospital personal standard precaution use may increase compliance.

PPE has been shown to offer protection against respiratory infections, especially COVID-19.
