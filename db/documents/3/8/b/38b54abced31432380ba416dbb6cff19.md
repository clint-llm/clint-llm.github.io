In about two-thirds of cases, there is a family history of hemophilia. Any patient with a known family history of hemophilia and bleeding that is out of proportion after a traumatic injury or abnormal blood levels during routine tests will require a test for coagulation factors defects. Patients with hemophilia B will present with decreased factor IX level.

The patient could also present with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which indicated an intrinsic pathway disruption, but a normal aPTT does not exclude hemophilia and a normal Pt (prothrombin time). Complete blood count could show normal or low hemoglobin levels with normal platelet levels. After blood tests suggest hemophilia, then a coagulation factor VIII and IX should be the next step.

Factor IX is present in plasma in a concentration of 4-5 µg/mL. Thus the disease is categorized according to the scarcity of factor IX. Mild hemophilia: If 5% to 50% of factor IX is present. Moderate hemophilia: If only 1% to 5% of the factor IX activity of normal is present. And severe hemophilia: if less than 1% of factor IX is present.
