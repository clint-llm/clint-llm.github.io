Euthyroid sick syndrome is also known as nonthyroidal illness syndrome and refers to changes in thyroid function tests that were administered in the inpatient or intensive care setting during critical illness. It is not a true syndrome, and transient alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are present in about 75 percent of hospitalized patients. This condition is often seen in patients with severe critical illness, deprivation of calories, and following major surgeries. The most common hormone pattern in euthyroid sick syndrome is a low total T3 and free T3 levels with low or normal T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This activity reviews when to consider euthyroid sick syndrome and how to evaluate and manage the condition while emphasizing the critical role of the interprofessional care team in caring for patients with euthyroid sick syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of euthyroid syndrome.
- Explain how to distinguish euthyroid sick syndrome from true pathology affecting the thyroid.
- Identify when euthyroid sick syndrome should receive further evaluation. 
- Outline the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with euthyroid sick syndrome.
