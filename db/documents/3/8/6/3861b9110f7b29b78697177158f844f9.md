Untreated or inadequately treated GCBL has an invariably fatal course due to its locally destructive nature. It extends into and erodes pelvic organs and skeletal structures. Even with adequate treatment, the mortality rate is 21%, and the recurrence rate is approximately 68%.

Up to 56% of GCBL lesions exhibit malignant transformations.
