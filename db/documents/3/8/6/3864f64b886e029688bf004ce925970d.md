A CSF leak can be congenital or traumatic due to dural defects. These defects are usually present in the form of fistulas or tears, which result in CSF leaks. Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is actually due to a decrease in volume of the CSF instead of the old notion that SIH is due to a barometric drop in CSF pressure.
