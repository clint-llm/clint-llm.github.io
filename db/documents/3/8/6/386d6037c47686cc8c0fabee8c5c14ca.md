Esthesioneuroblastoma, or olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare malignant neoplasm of the sinonasal tract originating from the olfactory neuroepithelium with neuroblastic differentiation. It most often presents in the superior nasal cavity. It is a locally aggressive neoplasm and metastasizes via both hematogenous and lymphatic routes. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of esthesioneuroblastoma and the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the typical presentation of esthesioneuroblastoma.
- Review the evaluation of esthesioneuroblastoma.
- Explain how to manage esthesioneuroblastoma.
- Describe an optimally functioning interprofessional team approach to coordinate care and enhance outcomes for patients with esthesioneuroblastoma.
