Bladder exstrophy, one of the most serious congenital malformations, is characterized by a spectrum of anomalies involving the ventral body wall, urinary tract, genitalia, bony pelvis, spine, anus, etc.

After more than 100 years of the initial surgical management by Trendelenberg, bladder exstrophy continues to be the most difficult challenge for a pediatric surgeon. The prevalence of classical bladder exstrophy is approximately 3.3 per 1,00,000 live births, and it has gender predominance in males.

Two reconstructive approaches, the modern staged repair of exstrophy (MSRE) and the complete primary repair of exstrophy (CPRE), are commonly adopted by surgeons across the world. The aims of the surgical treatment are to provide a competent receptacle (bladder) for storage, to prevent upper tract damage, and to provide cosmetically acceptable genitalia providing good functional outcomes in terms of continence and sexual function.
