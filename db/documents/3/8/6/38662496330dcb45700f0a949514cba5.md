In conclusion, to develop a better understanding of the treatment of cultural issues, four principles should be considered.

- The importance of avoiding stereotypes about individuals and groups

- Learning how to ask the right questions-that is, improving the clinician’s skills for active listening and eliciting culturally relevant information

- Improving cultural competence in a way that is coextensive with the trainee’s emerging clinical skills in other areas

- Improving the clinician’s insight and acceptance of cultural competence as integral to the assessment and clinical care of every patient

Cultural sensitivity remains vital in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients from different backgrounds and ethnicities. The treatment of Hwa-Byung, for example, shows the finesse needed by the diligent physician to ensure proper management of this condition. Cultural influences carry links with healthcare disparities and the providers’ attitudes in the clinical encounter. The entire health care team must learn the importance of appropriate response to a patient’s concerns that involve cultural differences. Studying one’s implicit assumptions regarding reactions towards a patient’s culture can help eliminate bias and improve the deliverance of healthcare. Delicately eliciting cultural information is also necessary to help enhance rapport with the patient and family.
