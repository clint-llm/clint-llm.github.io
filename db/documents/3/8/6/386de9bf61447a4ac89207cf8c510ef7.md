Nerve blocks are useful for providing anesthesia to a specific area of the body. Regional nerve blocks offer many advantages over local tissue infiltration. They are useful when local infiltration may not be possible or could result in tissue damage or distortion. This is especially important for areas, such as the face, where cosmetic results are extremely important. Nerve blocks generally require less anesthetic medication than local infiltration to produce the desired effect. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and methodology involved in performing an infraorbital nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique involved in performing an infraorbital nerve block.
- Describe the indications for an infraorbital nerve block.
- Describe the complications of an infraorbital nerve block.
- Explore interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to ensure safe performance of infraorbital nerve blocks and improve clinical outcomes.
