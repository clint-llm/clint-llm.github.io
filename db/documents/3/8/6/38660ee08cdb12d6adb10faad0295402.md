With the advent of systemic approaches targeting the tumor and advances in radiotherapy techniques, patients' careful selection has assumed greater importance. The use of disease-specific prognostication systems with molecular parameters has put the focus squarely on prognostication. Although it is important to avoid treating those with limited prognosis, it is equally important to provide up to date management to deserving patients. While SRS becomes the standard of care, prevention of neurocognitive decline with HA-WBRT and neuroprotective agents' use holds the promise of improved HRQoL. An interdisciplinary approach that includes a disease management group consultation to provide patient-centered care remains the need of the hour.

The demarcation between tumor recurrence and radiotherapy related changes remains a subject of further research and demands closer integration of radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists within the multidisciplinary team. Autosegmentation for precise contouring, model-based automated target delineation, automatic generation of treatment plans, and use of omics driven radiation therapy (incorporating omics derived information for treatment planning) are recommended treatment approaches for the future.
