The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology (ACOG) recommends performing serial fundal height during every prenatal visit.

The guidelines also stress the need for early detection of high-risk pregnancies, such as those with a prior history of FGR, substance abuse (tobacco, alcohol, others), advanced maternal age, preeclampsia, or previous pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia among others. Serial ultrasonography is strongly indicated if risk factors are identified. If FGR is detected, amniotic fluid volume estimations and umbilical arterial Doppler blood flow velocimetry (UADV) studies should be performed. Routine screening with third-trimester ultrasound in low-risk pregnancy is not recommended.
