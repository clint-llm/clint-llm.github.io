Once a patient has a single episode of variceal bleeding, there is a 70% chance of a rebleed. At least 30% of rebleeding episodes are fatal. Most deaths occur within the first few days after the bleed.Â  Mortality rates are highest in the presence of surgical intervention and for acute variceal bleeding.
