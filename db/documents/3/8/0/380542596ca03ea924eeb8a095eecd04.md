Flecainide acetate is an oral class Ic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) which blocks cardiac Na+ channels and received FDA approval in 1984. Flecainide is used in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVTs), including atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT), AV re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT), and atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in patients who do not have structural heart disease. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, evidenced-based usage, and toxicity. Flecainide is predominantly used for atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of flecainide.
- Review the in-depth use of flecainide in various tachyarrhythmias.
- Summarize the cardiac toxicity of flecainide therapy.
- Outline the importance of patient selection and recognition of adverse events due to flecainide among the interprofessional health care providers to drive optimal case outcomes.
