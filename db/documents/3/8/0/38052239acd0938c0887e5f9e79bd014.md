Hepatic hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors of infancy involving the liver, with two distinct types, including infantile hepatic hemangioma (IHH) and congenital hemangioma (CH). Diagnosis of types is generally based on their clinical course, but it is important to note that both the lesions are expected to resolve over time. Both lesions require close monitoring with serial ultrasounds and generally do not require specific intervention, and only needing supportive treatment focussing on the complications. These lesions should be closely followed by an interprofessional team consisting of a pediatrician or nurse practitioner, with a pediatric hematologist/oncologist, with serial imaging and close monitoring for complications.
