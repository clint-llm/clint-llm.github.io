COVID-19 disease mostly affects middle-aged and elderly patients. Children seem to be asymptomatic or get a mild form of the disease. The mean incubation period is about 5 days from exposure but ranges between 2 to 14 days. A higher risk of infection has been noticed in older patients, male sex, patients with medical comorbidities, patients with chronic pulmonary or chronic cardiac or chronic kidney disease, and patients with diabetes.
