Macular hole (MH) is a vitreoretinal interface disease characterized by a partial or full-thickness neurosensory retinal defect in the center of the macula. Macular hole, per se, has not been studied a lot up to the early nineties. The diagnosis and treatment plan has been dramatically changed in the last two decades. A new classification system based on morphology and vitreoretinal interface pathology has convincingly revealed the pathways related to the formation of a macular hole.
