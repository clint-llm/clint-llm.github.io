Any lesion affecting the central vestibular apparatus will present with vertigo as the main presenting symptom. Very often, the central oculomotor neuro-integrators (medial vestibular nucleus and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi) are involved resulting in impairment of visual fixation and the clinical sign of nystagmus.

The vertebrobasilar arterial (VBA) system supplies blood to the brainstem, cerebellum, and peripheral labyrinths. Occlusion of the system, therefore, can result in either central or peripheral vertigo, depending on the specific artery affected. Occlusion can occur as a result of atherothrombosis or an embolism (e.g., cardioembolism or plaque from the vertebral arteries).

Vertigo may occur in the setting of multiple sclerosis, generally with a waxing and waning course as a result of demyelination in the brainstem.

Central vertigo is also commonly seen in the setting of trauma, particularly as a result of shearing forces in the brain stem and resultant petechial hemorrhages in the vestibular nuclei.****
