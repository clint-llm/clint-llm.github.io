The Ranson criteria have been used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis for several decades. There continues to be an argument about its sensitivity and specificity. However, it is vital that patients with acute pancreatitis be assessed by an interprofessional team that includes a gastroenterologist, surgeon, endocrinologist, and radiologist. Patients with moderate to severe acute pancreatitis are best monitored by ICU nurses. There are other scoring criteria that can also be used to assess the severity of the condition. One should not place reliance on Ranson criteria but also use clinical acumen.
