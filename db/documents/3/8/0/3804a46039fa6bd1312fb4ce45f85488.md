Researchers have recently observed that tongue pressure technique not only improves the strength of the muscles of the tongue but also to a greater extent, the enhancement of the functions of the suprahyoid muscles.

Chin-tuck Against Resistance exercise, Shakers exercise, Expiratory Muscle Strength Training, and Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation have shown to improve the strength of suprahyoid muscles in the laryngeal elevation, and in turn help in better airway protection during swallowing.

Suprahyoid muscles are manually treated by osteopathic approaches to improve the functioning of the tongue and the movement of the hyoid bone. The therapeutic approach to this muscle area is through fascial techniques.
