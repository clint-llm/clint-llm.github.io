The word stoma or ostomy is derived from the Latin word ostium, which means opening or mouth. An intestinal stoma is one of the most common surgical procedures. The exteriorization of either the small bowel (ileostomy) or large bowel (colostomy) through the anterior abdominal wall is performed. The first recorded intestinal stoma was created by the German surgeon Baum in 1879 to divert an obstructing colon carcinoma.

At present, the intestinal stoma is considered one of the most usual life-saving emergency procedures done worldwide.
