Imaging studies help rule out other possible sources of pain. Plain radiographs will identify pathology in the hip and also changes in the sacroiliac joint.

The changes in ankylosing spondylitis are

- Subchondral bony erosion

- Subchondral sclerosis and

- The fusion of the sacroiliac joints

CT scans provide more detailed anatomy of the bony architecture. Radionuclide imaging is not a useful tool for identifying sacroiliac joint dysfunction. MRI scans have a 90% sensitivity in identifying spondyloarthritis but not valuable for non-inflammatory conditions

Image-guided injections are the gold standard to identify sacroiliac joint dysfunctionâ€”document both the provocation of symptoms when inflated and relief following local anesthetic infiltration. Image modalities in decreasing order of efficacy are CT guided, Fluoroscopy guided, and ultrasound-guided. When performing injections, direct the needle towards the inferior portion of the joint. Inflate the joint only with 1-2 ml of injectate
