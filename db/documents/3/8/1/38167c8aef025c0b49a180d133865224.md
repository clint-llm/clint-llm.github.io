Over the past two decades, many novel antipsychotic agents have undergone development, but so far, there is little solid evidence to suggest that one is better than the other. The decision to choose one atypical antipsychotic over another requires clinical judgment, patient's prior response, tolerability, affordability, and personal preferences. Plus, the adverse effects of these drugs merit consideration, as some are more likely than others to cause weight gain, dyskinesias, or sedation. The latest atypical antipsychotics are reputed to cause fewer adverse effects compared to the first generation of atypical antipsychotics, but as yet, there are no long-term data on these novel agents. All patients who receive atypical antipsychotics need to understand their adverse effects, including weight gain, prolonged QTc interval, diabetes mellitus, sedation, and the risk of dyskinesias. Patients also need to comprehend that to treat their symptoms, they must remain adherent to their drug therapy. Unfortunately, frequently, those individuals prescribed antipsychotics are also present with more complex management challenges. Many have other comorbidities like smoking, the use of illicitÂ drugs, alcohol misuse, and personality disorders, all of which interfere with pharmacotherapy adherence. Most patients drop out of follow-up as soon as their symptoms improve and only return to therapy when forced by the family or the legal system.

Given the above, it is evident that prescribing and managing therapy with atypical antipsychotics requires an interprofessional team effort; the more eyes on patients who require these medications, the better chance for therapeutic success. While the clinician will initially prescribe one of these agents, they would do well to consult with a psychiatric specialty pharmacist, who can go over the patient's medication record, assist in agent selection, and verify appropriate dosing. Nurses, as well as the clinician and the pharmacist, can offer counsel, monitor adherence (which is often a challenge with these patients, as already covered above), and assess for potential adverse effects from the drugs. Any mental health providers involved should also be included in the team approach, and the lines of communication between all disciplines must be open so that everyone on the interprofessional healthcare team has the same information and can offer assistance or evaluate the patient as the case progresses, leading to better patient outcomes.
