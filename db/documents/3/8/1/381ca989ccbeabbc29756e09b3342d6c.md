DISH in the spine most commonly occurs on the right side of the thoracic region.  The literature supports the original theory of the protective effect and mechanical barrier preventing DISH formation on the contralateral (i.e., left) side of the thoracic spine secondary to the pulsatile descending aorta.

For example, a 2017 study reported that newly formed bone in the cervical spine occurred mainly anterior to the vertebral bodies, which is in contrast to the anterolateral bone deposition pattern seen in DISH of the thoracic spine.

DISH can result in pain from nerve impingement or boney growths. this can lead to acute monoarticular synovitis, limited spinal range of motion, dysphagia, polyarticular pain, spinal or extremity pain, and an increased risk of unstable spine fractures.
