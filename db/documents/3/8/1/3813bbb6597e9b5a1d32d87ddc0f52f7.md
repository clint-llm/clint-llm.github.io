Lissencephaly is a relatively rare disorder of the brain and the incidence of which is not known. A study of lissencephaly in the Netherlands estimated the prevalence of around 1.2/100,000 births.

Genetic studies of 17 genes associated with lissencephaly revealed that LIS1 mutation or deletion accounts for 40% of the patients, and 23% was associated with DCX mutation, followed by TUBA1A (5%), and DYNC1H1 (3%).
