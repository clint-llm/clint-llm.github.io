The visual prognosis depends upon:

- **Type of RAM**- Quiescent retinal macroaneurysm has the best visual prognosis. Hemorrhagic macroaneurysm with intact macular integrity has a better visual prognosis than exudative forms,****as they usually resolve spontaneously and do not require treatment.

- **Presence of exudates/edema**- Permanent visual loss occurs due to the collection of long-standing hard exudates and chronic macular edema resulting from vascular leakage directly from the aneurysm or the damaged vessels surrounding the aneurysm.

- **Severity**- A hemorrhagic macroaneurysm more extensive than any other exudate is responsible for visual loss. Cases with hemorrhagic macroaneurysm combined with an exudative macroaneurysm or even a single extensive exudative macroaneurysm have a poorer visual prognosis.

- **Duration**- Long-standing edema/ exudates have the least chances to improve.

- **Position**- Pre retinal and vitreous hemorrhage have good visual outcomes upon clearing of hemorrhage. Subretinal hemorrhage predisposes to poorer prognosis due to damage to the outer photoreceptor layer caused by prevention of metabolic diffusion between outer retina and choriocapillaris, iron toxicity, and damage to the retina by fibrin. Submacular hemorrhage has the poorest visual outcome.
