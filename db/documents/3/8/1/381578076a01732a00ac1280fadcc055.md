Rheumatic heart disease results from either a single or repeated attacks of rheumatic fever that results in rigidity and deformity of valve cusps, the fusion of the commissures, or shortening and fusion of the chordae tendineae. Over 2 to 3 decades, valvular stenosis and/or regurgitation results. In chronic rheumatic heart disease, the mitral valve alone is the most commonly affected valve in an estimated 50% to 60% of cases. Combined lesions of both the aortic and mitral valves occur in 20% of cases. InvolvementÂ of the tricuspid valve occurs in about 10% of cases but only in association with mitral or aortic disease. Tricuspid valve cases are thought to be more common when recurrent infections have occurred. The pulmonary valve is rarely affected.
