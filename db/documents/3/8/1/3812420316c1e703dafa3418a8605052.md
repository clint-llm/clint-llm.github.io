Methacholine is a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist that acts directly on airway smooth muscle receptors to induce bronchoconstriction. However, methacholine has also been linked to indirect mechanisms of airway response as well, including stimulation of mucous cell secretion. The mechanism of action of derivative methacholine is longer than acetylcholine, thus it is useful in bronchial challenge testing to allow time for assessment of reactivity.
