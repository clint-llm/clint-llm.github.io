Loop diuretics administered intravenously remain the first-line therapy for hospitalized ADHF patients. Loop diuretics inhibit Na+/2Cl-/K+ cotransporter in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which causes decreased sodium and chloride reabsorption and results in natriuresis and diuresis. Loop diuretics also increase the synthesis of prostaglandins, which cause renal and pulmonary vasodilation. This leads to a reduction in pulmonary wedge pressure.

Recent studies have suggested that the lack of adequate decongestion achieved by loop diuretics is more common than previously known

There are several strategies to overcome this diuretic resistance, one of them including ultrafiltration. Studies suggest that peripheral venovenous ultrafiltration is one of the most promising approaches in managing ADHF patients.
