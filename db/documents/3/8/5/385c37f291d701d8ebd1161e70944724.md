The saphenous nerve, the largest cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve, is derived from L3 and L4 of the lumbar plexus. This nerve has two major divisions known as the sartorial and infrapatellar nerves. These nerves together provide the sensory innervation to the medial, anteromedial, and posteromedial aspects of the distal thigh to the medial malleolus of the ankle joint. The saphenous nerve begins in the proximal thigh as a posterior division of the femoral nerve which lies laterally to the femoral artery. The saphenous nerve then tracks through the adductor canal where at this point, the saphenous nerve is now medial to the femoral artery. Upon exiting the adductor canal, the nerve divides into the sartorial and infrapatellar nerve branches at the level of the medial femoral condyle of the femur. The infrapatellar branch immediately travels anteriorly and innervates the anteroinferior and medial aspect of the knee.

The sartorial branch continues to travel down the medial knee and behind the sartorius muscle. The sartorial branch then tracks more superficially as it penetrates through the fascia between the gracilis tendon and the sartorius tendon. At this point, the sartorial branch continues with the long saphenous vein to provide sensory innervation to the medial leg and ankle.
