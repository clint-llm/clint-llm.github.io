The time from symptom onset to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (after recanalization using rtPA) was observed to be around 12.9 hours.

The hyperintense acute reperfusion marker (HARM) is a hyperintense radiologic signal within the CSF spaces visualized on postcontrast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. This radiologic finding is associated with permeability changes to the blood-brain barrier in acute stroke. SPECT imaging with 99mTc-duramycin has proved useful in detecting apoptotic neuronal cell death in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion injury.

No-Reflow: Leukocyte recruitment, platelet activation, increased viscosity of the blood due to movement of water from the plasma to the perivascular spaceÂ in the ischemic tissue will clog the microvasculature of the downstream tissue more. Reperfusion just severely exacerbates this phenomenon, termed as NO-reflow.
