Patients should be educated about the adverse reactions and toxicities of medications and over-the-counter supplements. The importance of periodic evaluations and blood work must be explained to a patient if started on drugs such as methotrexate or linezolid. In addition, patients with underlying hematologic malignancies (such as multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, lymphoma, or acute leukemias) should be cautioned about the possibility of pancytopenia.

If a patient is found with pancytopenia, the patient should be counseled on the complications of pancytopenia and the increased risk for infections, bleeding, and manifestations of anemia. These patients should also be advised against other medications that may worsen pancytopenia.
