Myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (MPS) is an important, cost-effective, and widely used non-invasive imaging modality. With the advancement in imaging techniques and for early detection of coronary artery disease, it is estimated that 9.1 million tests are performed annually in the United States.

Myocardial perfusion scan plays a crucial role in diagnosing ischemic coronary artery disease, predicting prognosis, assessing myocardial viability and effectiveness of medical therapy.

During a myocardial perfusion scan,  a gamma camera detects radiotracer which is injected intravenously to measure the distribution of coronary blood flow in the myocardium. By rotating the gamma camera at the regular angular interval in a 180-degree arc, multiple planar projections are collected. Myocardial uptake of tracer for scan dependent on two things.First transportation of radiotracer to the cell surface which is flow-mediated. Second, it requires the intact cell membrane to extract radiotracer. The extraction of radiotracer is directly dependent on blood flow.

The same phenomena which cause a reduction in oxygen delivery and ischemic ECG changes on a treadmill can be assessed by perfusion defect on MPS. However, reduced uptake of tracer to specific region help to diagnose culprit artery responsible for patient symptoms. The difference in radiotracer uptake both at rest and stress, help to differentiate fixed and reversible defect.
