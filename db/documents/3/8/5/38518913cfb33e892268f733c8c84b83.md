Anifrolumab is a humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody that binds to subunit 1 of the type 1 IFN receptor (IFNAR1). It inhibits the formation of an IFN/IFNAR complex and subsequent gene transcription.

IFN alpha is the predominant type 1 IFN implicated in SLE pathogenesis. As a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, IFN alpha is responsible for monocyte maturation, neutrophilic NETosis, and polyclonal B-cell expansion and differentiation.

Anifrolumab has been shown to correct defects of the innate and adaptive immune system. SLE patients, especially those with high type 1 IFN gene signature status, had altered protein expression, the reversal of cytopenias, and normalization of immune cell populations when treated with anifrolumab.
