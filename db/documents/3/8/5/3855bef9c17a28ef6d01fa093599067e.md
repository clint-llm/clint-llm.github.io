Usually, squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) affects sun-exposed areas on the skin of the head and neck, and there are also cases of it arising on the trunk. In the early stages of Bowen disease, virus lesions appear on the skin in the form of red, scaly patches, and as it progresses, it develops into nodules or plagues which are prone to ulceration.
