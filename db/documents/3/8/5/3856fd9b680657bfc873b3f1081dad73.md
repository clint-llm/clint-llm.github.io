On microscopic examination, pineal and suprasellar germinoma are morphologically identical to testicular seminoma and ovarian dysgerminoma. Tumor cells are arranged in sheets separated by bands of connective tissue admixed with small lymphocytes. Individual neoplastic cells are large, round to polygonal with pale to clear cytoplasm, large vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. In some cases, syncytiotrophoblast giant cells are present and may explain elevated human chorionic gonadotrophin in some patients.
