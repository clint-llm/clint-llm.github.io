**Frequency of Condition**

Due to its close association with the PLC, PCL, and ACL, the LCL is rarely ever injured in isolation. Studies show that isolated LCL injuries in high school athletes are second to last in incidence at 7.9%. PCL injuries are the least common, at 2.4%.

**Risk Factors**

Although there have been few studies completed on isolated LCL injuries, reports show that the female gender, high contact sports, and sports that require high velocity pivoting and jumping increase the likelihood of injury. These same studies show that while soccer has the highest likelihood of overall knee injury, tennis and gymnastics are most specific for isolated LCL injuries. A United States military study has shown that prior knee, ankle, or hip injury predisposes soldiers to increased rates of lateral knee injuries.
