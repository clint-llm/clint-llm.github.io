Because the bundle of His is found deep within fibrous tissue, its precise function has been difficult to study. It is hypothesized that the “longitudinal partitioning of strands of the His bundle” and the abundant nexuses within the bundle of His aid the rapid conduction of the electrical signal from the AV node. Also, the encompassing collagen may potentially prevent the lateral spread of the propagated impulse.
