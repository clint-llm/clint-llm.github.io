The prevalence of non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) ranges from 1 in 1500 to 1 in 4000 births. There is a wide variation in the reported prevalence due to differences in definitions, populations, thoroughness of evaluation, and whether late pregnancy terminations were included. The widespread use of anti-D immunoglobulin dramatically decreased the prevalence of RhD alloimmunization and associated hydrops after 1968 when the drug became available. As a result, NIHF now accounts for almost 90 percent of hydrops fetalis cases.
