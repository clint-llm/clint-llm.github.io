Due to the similarity between blepharoconjunctivitis and blepharitis, it is difficult to separate epidemiological data for the two. Additionally, there is a scarcity of reliable data on the prevalence of blepharitis in the general population. This is largely due to the majority of studies focusing on the population of eye clinics. A US study of ophthalmologists and optometrists found 37% to 47% of patients in their eye clinics exhibited signs of blepharitis.
