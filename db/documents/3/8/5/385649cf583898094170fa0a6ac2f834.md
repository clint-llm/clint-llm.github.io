PCP is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pulmonologist, infectious disease expert, pharmacist, intensivist, nurse, respiratory therapist, and dietitian. Once the diagnosis of PCP is made, the patient should be urged to discontinue smoking, as nicotine worsens the symptoms and complicates therapy. Since most patients with PCP are frail, a dietary consult should be sought to increase calorie intake. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance. Patients receiving corticosteroids should be followed closely to monitor the side effects, which both nursing and pharmacy can do, reporting any concerns to the prescriber. Finally, these patients need lifelong follow-up by monitoring CD 4 counts, viral load, and disease progression.

**Outcomes**

In the past, PCP carried high mortality, but over the past two decades, the mortality rates have dropped because of earlier diagnosis and treatment. Currently, at least 10 to 20% of patients with PCP will die. PCP carries an even worse prognosis in patients without HIV infection, with mortality rates over 50%. In general, the mortality rates are much higher when there is an underlying lung disorder and in patients who require mechanical ventilation.
