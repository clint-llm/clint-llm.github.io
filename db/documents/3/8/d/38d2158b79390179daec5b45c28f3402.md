Pressure support provides a set amount of pressure during inspiration to support the spontaneously breathing patient. Pressure support eases a patient's ability to overcome the resistance of the endotracheal tube and is often used during weaning because it decreases the effort of breathing. Pressure support has been deemed valuable for the weaning patient population. The importance of selecting the correct mode of ventilation based on the patient’s condition and ability is paramount to overall patient outcomes.
