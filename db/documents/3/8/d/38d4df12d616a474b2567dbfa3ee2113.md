Argyria is a rare dermatologic skin condition that poses a diagnostic dilemma. Patients often present with the insidious onset of generalized or localized skin discoloration without associated symptoms. Due to the infrequency of this condition, clinicians may not be versed in detecting the disease, potentially leading to a lack of a diagnosis or a misdiagnosis.

While it is imperative for the clinician to obtain a detailed history, including all medications and supplements, as well as to perform a complete physical exam, it is also important to consult with an interprofessional team, including a dermatologist and pathologist. As other conditions must be ruled out with laboratory work prior to diagnosis, nurses are also vital to the interprofessional team, as they will collect blood specimens and assist with the education of the patient and family.
