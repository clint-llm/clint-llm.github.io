Upon first prescribing levothyroxine, medication adjustment should occur every 6 to 8 weeks until the patient reaches a steady state. Clinicians should also evaluate the response to levothyroxine by using a validated questionnaire, such as thyroid-related quality of life (ThyPRO) and the underactive thyroid treatment satisfaction questionnaire (ThySRQ).

In an acute overdose of levothyroxine, emergency department physician and triage nurses stabilize the patient, focusing on maintaining a patent airway, breathing, and circulation. Critical care physicians play an essential role in managing thyroid storms. In the case of extreme overdose where hemoperfusion or hemodialysis is planned, a nephrologist referral is required.
