Bacterial sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection injures its tissues and organs. Sepsis is caused by conditions that threaten the functional integrity of the host, such as microbial invasion. This activity illustrates the management of sepsis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of bacterial sepsis.
- Describe the typical lab findings in bacterial sepsis.
- Summarize the components of the acute sepsis bundle and the components of the sepsis management bundle used in the evaluation and treatment of patients with sepsis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by sepsis.
