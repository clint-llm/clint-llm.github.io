Ashman phenomenon has most widely been associated with atrial fibrillation; wherein, it has been noted to occur secondary to the chaotic impulses from the atrium. These chaotic impulses cause variability in the RR cycle length leading to the opportunity for aberrant conduction.

Ashman's beat is caused by R-R interval length inconsistency. Longer R-R intervals, such as those seen in bradycardia, have a longer refractory period, whereas shorter R-R intervals, such as those seen in tachycardia, have a shorter refractory period.

In Ashman phenomenon, an elongated R-R internal followed by a successive shorter R-R interval is seen, and during this time, the cardiac myocytes are still in the refractory period. The cardiac myocytes are still in the refractory period during this time due to the initial extended/prolonged R-R interval. This electrical abnormality often causes a block to be noted on EKG, often a right bundle branch block pattern is noted, but left bundle branch block patterns can also be seen as discussed above.
