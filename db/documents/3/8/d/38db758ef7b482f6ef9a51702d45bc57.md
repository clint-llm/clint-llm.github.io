The incubation period ranges between 4 days to 2 weeks.

Symptoms start with fever, headache, dizziness, vomiting. This is followed by rapidly progressive encephalitis resulting in drowsiness, disorientation, confusion, and coma. Among CNS symptoms, decreased level of consciousness, brainstem dysfunction, myoclonus, areflexia, hypotonia, cerebellar signs are commonly observed. In fulminant illness, multiorgan dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure are seen. 69% of patients had respiratory difficulty in outbreaks in Bangladesh, and some cases led to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Patients also have long-term neurologic effects from encephalitis, including fatigue, encephalopathy, ocular motor palsies, cervical dystonia, focal weakness, and facial paralysis.Â In a small proportion of patients, the onset of the illness may be delayed, and there may be relapses after recovery from the acute infection.
