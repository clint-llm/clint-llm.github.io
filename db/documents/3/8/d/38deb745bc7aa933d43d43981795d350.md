Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease characterized by persistent and lifelong widening of the bronchial airways and weakening of the function mucociliary transport mechanism owing to repeated infection contributing to bacterial invasion and mucus pooling throughout the bronchial tree. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of bronchiectasis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bronchiectasis.
- Summarize the role of airway obstruction, infection, and peribronchial fibrosis in the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis.
- Outline the evaluation of bronchiectasis.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with this condition.
