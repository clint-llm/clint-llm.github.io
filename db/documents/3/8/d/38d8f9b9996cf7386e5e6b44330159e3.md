Although rare, procedural complications are a known risk of treating CN. Risks of more involved procedures, including RFA, PNS, and surgical decompression, are theoretically greater than for nerve blocks. One study assessing the safety and efficacy of PNS in the treatment and management of patients with chronic pain of likely peripheral nerve origin found no device-related severe adverse events were reported in 94 participants followed for up to one year.

Pharmacologic intervention with common neuropathic pain agents such as gabapentin and pregabalin can lead to drug-associated adverse events. The most common adverse effects of these medications include dizziness, drowsiness, and nausea.
