Early identification of at-risk situations and de-escalation is crucial to prevent and manage aggression. Multiple screening tools are available to facilitate an interprofessional team-based approach to WPV among physicians, nurses, auxiliary staff, and security. Resources such as aggression management teams, environmental interventions, and policy implementation should be used judiciously to prevent further escalation of aggression. Documentation of violent incidents should be met with action and impunity. Appropriate interventions may improve patient outcomes and enhance team performance.
