**Timing of Immunization:**For most individuals requiring only one dose of influenza vaccine for the season, the vaccine should be administered during September or October. However, vaccination should continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating. Vaccination during July and August is not suggested for most individuals. However, an individualized case evaluation is necessary.

- For adults (age ≥65 years) and pregnant women in the first or second trimester, vaccination during July and August is not recommended unless there is concern that subsequent vaccination might not be feasible.

- Administration in July and August can be considered in the third trimester of pregnancy.

- Children 6 months through 8 years requiring two doses should be administered the first dose as soon as possible.

- Immunization during July and August can be considered for children of any age requiring only one dose.

Influenza vaccine administration can vary with both the dose form and the patient's age.

**Dosage Forms:**Flu shots are available in several forms.

- Intramuscular vaccine

- High-dose vaccine (> 65 years)

- Intradermal vaccine (18 to 64years)

- Egg-free vaccine (>4 years)

- Nasal spray (2 to 49 years)

- A needle-free vaccine as a jet injector (18 to 64 years)

**Dosage:**Approved ages and dose volume for IM influenza vaccines (IIV4s and RIV4): Determine the number of doses needed for a child based on the age, the time of the first dose of the 2022–23 influenza vaccine, and the number of doses of influenza vaccine received in prior seasons.

- Age 6 months to 3 years: 0.25 - 0.5 ml, depending on the vaccine

- Not previously vaccinated/ influenza vaccination history unknown: 2 doses, four weeks apart.
- Vaccinated the previous season with two doses four weeks or more apart before July 1, 2022: one dose needed

- Age 3 to 8 years: 0.5 ml

- Not previously vaccinated/influenza vaccination history unknown: 2 doses, four weeks apart.
- Vaccinated the previous season with two doses four weeks or more apart before July 1, 2022: one dose needed

- Age 8 years: 0.5 ml; For a child aged eight years who needs two doses, both doses should be given even if the recipient turns age nine years between dose one and dose two.

- Age 9 years and above

- Age 65 and above Sinle-dose; 0.5 ml - 0.7 ml depending on the vaccine. ACIP recommends that the recipient preferentially receive one of the higher doses (quadrivalent HD-IIV4 or quadrivalent RIV4) or adjuvanted influenza vaccine (quadrivalent aIIV4). If none of these three options are available at an opportunity for vaccination, then any other age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used.

When a dose less than the necessary volume is administered in error, follow below ACIP/CDC recommendations.

- When an error is found immediately (before the recipient has left the vaccination setting), inject the remaining additional volume needed.

- If the error is discovered after the recipient has left the vaccination setting or it isn't easy to measure the remaining needed volume, inject a repeat of the full dose. A healthy, non-pregnant individual aged 2 to 49 years may alternatively be given 0.2 mL of LAIV4, 0.1 mL in each nostril, using the supplied intranasal sprayer.

**IIVs/RIV4:**These vaccines are administered intramuscularly (IM). For adults/older children, the deltoid muscle, and for infants/younger children, the anterolateral thigh is the preferred site for injection.

**LAIV4:**It is administered intranasally using a single-use sprayer attached to the supplied prefilled containing 0.2 mL of vaccine. The recipient must be upright, and half of the total sprayer contents must be sprayed into the first nostril. Then attached divider clip is removed, and the second half of the dose is administered into the other nostril.

- Recipient sneezing immediately after administration does not warrant dose repetition.

- If a patient has nasal congestion that may interfere with the complete delivery of the content to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral should be considered, or another-appropriate vaccine should be administered.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Quadrivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccines (IIV4) or quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV4) may be administered in any trimester. Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV4) should not be used during pregnancy but can be used postpartum.

**Persons with Chronic Medical Conditions:**LAIV4 vaccine is not recommended for individuals with some chronic medical conditions.

**Immunocompromised Persons:**Age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 is recommended for these individuals. LAIV4 should not be administered in these patients. Immune response might be decreased or minimal in individuals on certain medications, chemotherapy, or transplant regimens. Timing of flu vaccine is relative to a specified period before or after an intervention that compromises immunity may be appropriate. Guidance is published by The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) regarding the timing of vaccination in such cases.

**Care Givers and High-Risk Contacts:**Any age-appropriate IIV4 or RIV4 is recommended for caregivers and contacts (including those of immunosuppressed persons). LAIV4 may be administered to caregivers/contacts of individuals who are not severely immunocompromised (i.e., who don't require a protected environment). Healthcare personnel/hospital visitors who received LAIV4 should avoid contact with/caring for a severely immunosuppressed individual who requires a protected environment for seven days after vaccination.

**Vaccination for Travelers**

- Travelers who intend to decrease the risk for influenza should consider vaccination≥2 weeks before departure.

- Individuals at higher risk for complications of influenza who were not vaccinated during the prior fall or winter should be considered for influenza vaccination administration before departure if planning to travel to the tropics, on cruise ships, organized tourist groups, or to the Southern Hemisphere during April-September.

- It is important to note that Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines may differ in viral composition from northern Hemisphere vaccine formulations.

- Immunization with the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine before Southern Hemisphere travel might be acceptable; however, these vaccine formulations are usually unavailable in the U.S.
