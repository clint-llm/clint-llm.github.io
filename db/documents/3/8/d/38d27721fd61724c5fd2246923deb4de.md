Timely management of intussusception is critical to avoid complications, including perforation, bowel necrosis, and rarely short bowel syndrome. On the other hand, postoperative intussusception (POI) might occur as a rare complication following different surgeries. Some surgical procedures that might be complicated with post-operative intussusception include retroperitoneal tumor resection, Ladd procedure, diaphragmatic surgeries, and pancreatectomy. The risk of POI is up to 0.25Â % in the pediatric population following laparotomy.
