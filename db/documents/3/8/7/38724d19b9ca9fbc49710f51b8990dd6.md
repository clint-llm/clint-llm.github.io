The differential diagnosis of serum sickness and serum sickness-like reaction is broad and requires a thorough evaluation to narrow the lens of focus. In general, the differential should include viral illnesses with exanthems (i.e. Chikungunya, Dengue fever), acute rheumatic fever, Scarlet fever, Kawasaki disease, meningococcemia, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Lyme disease, hypersensitivity vasculitis (i.e. IgA vasculitis, Sweet syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and other types of drug reactions (i.e. drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, or DRESS). Specific disease characteristics and laboratory evaluation can help to distinguish between these entities.
