Although the quality of life of patients affected by osteosarcoma has significantly improved over the last few decades, its etiology remains obscure. Studies aiming to determine the causes of osteosarcoma have classically focused on multiple factors, including genetics, epidemiology, and the environment.

The highly complex karyotypes typical of osteosarcoma tumor cytology have created challenges regarding the thorough characterization of recurrent chromosomal mutations.

- **Hereditary Retinoblastoma:**An autosomal dominant condition caused by germline mutations in the RB1 gene, causes bilateral retinoblastoma at an average presenting age of one year. Retinoblastoma characteristically presents as an absence of the "red reflex" in the eye or eyes of the affected child. This disorder imparts an increased risk of osteosarcoma later in life.

- **Li-Fraumeni Syndrome:**An autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, has been found in up to 3% of children with osteosarcoma. Patients with this disorder are also at a high risk of developing several additional types of cancer at a very early age.

- **Rothmund-Thompson Syndrome:**An autosomal recessive syndrome due to a mutation in the RECQL4 gene, conveys a predisposition to osteosarcoma as well as a characteristic infantile rash, dysplastic osseous structures, alopecia, premature cataracts, and chronic gastrointestinal distress.

- **Bloom Syndrome:**An autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the BLM gene, a gene responsible for maintaining DNA stability during replication. In addition to a predisposition to osteosarcoma and other cancers, these patients may also present with UV-induced rashes, short stature, and sparse subcutaneous fat.

- **Werner Syndrome:**An autosomal recessive disorder, also known as adult progeria, is characterized by premature aging, bilateral cataracts, osteoporosis, short stature, scleroderma-like skin changes, and a predilection for osteosarcoma. A faulty WRN gene is responsible.

Research has identified associations with secondary osteosarcoma in patients with Paget disease, electrical burns, trauma, exposure to beryllium, exposure to alkylating agents, FBJ virus, osteochondromatosis, enchondromatosis, fibrous dysplasia, orthopedic prosthetics as well as bone infarction and infection. Additionally, osteosarcoma reportedly correlates with exposure to ionizing radiation, radium, and archaic contrast agents such as thorotrast.
