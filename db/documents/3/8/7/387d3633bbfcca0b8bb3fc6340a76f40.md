Since successful pleurodesis requires physical contact between the visceral and parietal pleura, any disease process that would interfere with complete lung expansion (e.g., trapped lung, insufficient drainage) would lead to failure of pleurodesis.

Other risk factors for unsuccessful pleurodesis include previous thoracic irradiation and a chest tube duration of more than ten days, while risk factors for death included a Karnofsky index <50 percent, a body mass index <25 kg/meter square, malignancy, and male gender.

Other contraindications include a lack of consent from the patient, more than 150 ml of fluid output through chest drain, and pleural infection.
