Succinylcholine is often used by the anesthesia nurse, emergency department physician, anesthesiologist, and intensivist. The drug is most frequently used for endotracheal intubation and sometimes as an adjunct therapy in patients undergoing electroconvulsive shock therapy (ETC) to control muscle contractions induced due to the electrical impulses delivered during the procedure. However, this is an off-label use that is not currentlyÂ approved by the FDA. While the drug is safe, all users need to be aware that it has shown associations with hyperkalemia. Thus, in patients at risk for hyperkalemia, the drug's use requires great caution.
