Damage to retroperitoneal structures following abdominal trauma is common. Authors have reported some 20% to 33% of patients with penetrating trauma, and 44% to 80% of those with blunt trauma experience retroperitoneal injury with an overall associated mortality rate of 18% to 60%.

Spontaneous hemorrhage is a considerably more rare phenomenon. Clinical trials of anticoagulation-induced hemorrhage of the retroperitoneum have documented a rate of 0.6% to 6.6%, with mortality occurring in 20%. In one study, following a percutaneous coronary intervention, iatrogenic retroperitoneal bleeding was noted in 0.57% of patients with an associated mortality rate of 10.4%.
