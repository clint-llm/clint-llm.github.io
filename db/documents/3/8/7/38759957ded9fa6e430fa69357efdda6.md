Parkinson-plus syndromes are characterized by the primary features of Parkinson disease, including bradykinesia, ataxia, resting tremor, and rigidity but also include additional features such as dementia, cognitive deficits, and cranial nerve impairment. These chronic, debilitating neurodegenerative conditions result in severe impairment and are typically idiopathic. Differential diagnosis can lead to improved symptom management, but definitive diagnosis requires the identification of alpha-synuclein or tau inclusions in the brain post-mortem. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Parkinson-plus syndromes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of the various Parkinson-plus syndromes.
- Outline the unique clinical presentation of each Parkinson-plus condition.
- Review the differential diagnostic methods incorporated in the medical workup of Parkinson-plus syndromes.
- Summarize the treatment options available and their potential effects.
