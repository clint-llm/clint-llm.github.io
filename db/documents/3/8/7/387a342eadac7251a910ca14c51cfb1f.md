Idioventricular rhythm can be seen in and potentiated by various etiologies.

It commonly presents in atrioventricular (AV) dissociation due to an advanced or complete heart block or when the AV junction fails to produce 'escape' rhythm after a sinus arrest or sinoatrial nodal block.

Idioventricular rhythm can also be seen during the reperfusion phase of myocardial infarction, especially in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy.

Electrolyte abnormalities can increase the chances of idioventricular rhythm.

Various medications such as digoxin at toxic levels, beta-adrenoreceptor agonists like isoprenaline, adrenaline, anesthetic agents including desflurane, halothane, and illicit drugs like cocaine have reported being etiological factors in patients with AIVR.

Idioventricular rhythm can also infrequently occur in infants with congenital heart diseases and cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.

Accelerated Idioventricular rhythm is also be rarely seen in patients without any evidence of cardiac disease. The mechanism involves a decrease in the sympathetic but an increase in vagal tone. It can also present in athletes.
