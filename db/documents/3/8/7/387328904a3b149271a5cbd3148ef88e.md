Treatment of Lown-Ganong-Levine currently is centered around the use of antiarrhythmic medications and, when refractory, radiofrequency catheter ablation. Emergency treatment is not typically necessary as the LGL pattern itself has no established correlations with hemodynamic compromise. Instead, treatment focuses on the prevention of tachyarrhythmias via the accessory pathway. Medications utilized previously include digitalis, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCB), and either class I or III antiarrhythmics. Digitalis, beta-blockers, and CCB are thought to aid in controlling LGL by slowing AV nodal conduction and prolonging the refractory period. At this time, minimal randomized control trials have taken place, and the data regarding the management of LGL in reported cases has been controversial.

In cases refractory to medical therapy, as with other supraventricular tachycardias or accessory pathways, radiofrequency catheter ablation has become a preferred treatment. Patients who display reentrant tachycardia with short PR intervals may benefit from an accessory pathway or partial AV nodal ablation. In a patient with atrial flutter or fibrillation and rapid ventricular response suspected to be secondary to LGL, complete heart block is inducible via RFA followed by implantation of a pacemaker.
