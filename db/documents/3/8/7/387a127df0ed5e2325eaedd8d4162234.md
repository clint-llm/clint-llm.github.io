The main differential diagnosis for macroglossia includes conditions that cause pseudomacroglossia. Conditions that displace the tongue and force it to sit in an abnormal position and making it appear enlarged, such as low palate, enlarged tonsils, tumors of the oral cavity, abnormalities of mandible and maxilla arches, and hypotonia cause pseudomacroglossia. Various tumors and vascular malformations could result in macroglossia and may need imaging to characterize. Endocrine abnormalities and congenital syndromes where macroglossia is one of the manifestations should be considered based on clinical findings and laboratory analysis. Deposition diseases such as amyloidosis will have to be diagnosed by clinical, laboratory, and pathology analysis. Acute conditions that can cause temporary tongue swelling such as trauma, allergies, and infections are other differential diagnoses.
