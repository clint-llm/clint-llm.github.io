Smith fractures divide into three types:

- Type I - most common type, accounting for about 85% of cases, is an extraarticular fracture through the distal radius

- Type II - less common, accounting for approximately 13%, is an intraarticular oblique fracture, also referred to as a reverse Barton fracture

- Type III - uncommon, less than 2%, is a juxta-articular oblique fracture
