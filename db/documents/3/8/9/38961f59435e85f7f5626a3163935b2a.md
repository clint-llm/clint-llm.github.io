Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is the second most prevalent hematological abnormality in pregnancy. Less than 1% of pregnant women with thrombocytopenia during pregnancy would have a platelet count of less than 100 x 10^9/L. Gestational thrombocytopenia is the most frequent cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy and requires vigilant monitoring in the clinic and reassurance to the patient. There is a need for communication between the obstetrics team, hematologists, pediatricians, and nurses involved in the management of pregnant women with thrombocytopenia. Most evidence in the management of patients with gestational thrombocytopenia and ITP comes from retrospective observational studies or Cohort-Control studies (Level III).

Pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia requires an interprofessional approach to care. Clinician involvement was discussed above, but they do not operate alone. Specialty-trained nursing staff (maternal-newborn and neonatal) will be on hand to assist with delivery, medication administration, and monitoring of the mother and baby before and throughout the delivery process. The various medications used in thrombocytopenia require input from the pharmacists, who will verify dosing, check for interactions, and suggest therapeutic alternatives when necessary.Â  The clinicians may be running the show, but they need their supporting actors on the interprofessional healthcare team to effectively bring both the mother and newborn to a successful outcome.
