Ultrasound is an imaging modality that has been in clinical use for approximately 50 years, though its utility and efficacy have dramatically improved since it was first introduced. Ultrasound is portable, cost-effective and does not require radiation or contrast. This activity reviews the use of ultrasound in the detection of many abdominal pathologies, with a particular focus on indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing a transabdominal ultrasound. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an abdominal ultrasound.
- Describe the technique involved in performing an abdominal ultrasound.
- Outline the limitations of an abdominal ultrasound. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the utilization of abdominal ultrasound and improve patient outcomes.
