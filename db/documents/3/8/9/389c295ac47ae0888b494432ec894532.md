Phosphate deficiency is a non-nutritional cause of rickets. It occurs due to renal phosphate wasting, the cause of which can be any of the following:

- Renal tubular disorder i.e., Fanconi syndrome or dent disease

- X- linked hypophosphatemic rickets: it results from a mutation in the phosphate regulating endopeptidase homolog (PHEX gene)  that leads to unregulated FGF23 production.

- Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets.

- Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria: **Clinical features**: In children, it presents with delayed closure of fontanelle, craniotabes (soft skull bones), rachitic rosary (enlargement of the costochondral junction), leg bowing, growth delay, and tooth decay. In adults, it presents as osteomalacia.**Diagnosis**: Clinical features and radiographic imaging indicative of rickets in the presence of normal serum calcium and PTH levels and decreased serum phosphate levels suggest phosphopenic rickets. The different causes of phosphopenic rickets can be differentiated by checking urinary levels of calcium, glucose, bicarbonate, and amino acids.

Phosphate clearance (CPi) / creatinine clearance ) x 100

The formula for CPi calculation is as following

urine phosphate( mg/dL) x Volume (mL/ min ) / Plasma phosphate( mg/dL)

Normal TRP is greater than 90%. A TRP of 60% is diagnostic for X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets.
