The optimal management for trench fever, as well as other infections caused by Bartonella quintana, is sparse due to the limited published data. The recommended treatment depends on the patient's presentation and underlying comorbidities. For acute or chronic infections without endocarditis, oral doxycycline is recommended at a dose of either 100 mg or 200 mg once a day for four weeks in combination with gentamicin 3 mg/kg intravenously once daily for the first 14 days. If gentamicin is not an option due to availability, allergies, or other contraindications, rifampin 300 mg twice daily for the first 14 days can be used. This treatment was thoroughly detailed in the randomized, open-label trial conducted by Foucault et al., where complete eradication was noted per-protocol analysis in seven out of seven patients treated with combination therapy compared to two out of nine patients who received no treatment with P = 0.003.

Gentamicin levels, especially in patients with renal impairment, should be monitored closely. Patients with chronic trench fever should be evaluated with an echocardiogram in order to evaluate for possible endocarditis, as this would lead to a prolonged course of antibiotic therapy.
