The histopathological hallmark is an excessive proliferation of fibrous tissue within the alveolar sacs and alveolar ducts with extension into the bronchioles. Organized plugs of intraluminal granulation tissue are known as Masson bodies. The granulation tissue buds extend into the bronchiole and may obstruct the lumen, hence the previous term bronchiolitis obliterans. The granulation tissue has a uniform appearance within the alveolar spaces with preservation of lung parenchymal architecture. Mild mononuclear cell interstitial inflammation and foamy macrophages can be seen in the lung immediately surrounding the lesion. Significant inflammatory cell infiltration diffusely in the lung should raise concern for alternative diagnoses such as Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Disruption of the normal lung architecture should also lead to consideration of an alternative diagnosis like Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) as seen in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).
