The treatment of common medical conditions during pregnancy frequently becomes complicated due to the potential effects that medications can have on fetal growth and development. While the use of many medications during pregnancy has drastically declined in recent years as new information about their risks surfaces, the use of others has increased as recent research has reassured their safety. While the utilization of drugs continues to evolve as more knowledge is gained regarding their safety and efficacy, information regarding the risks of medication use during pregnancy and lactation remains relatively limited due to barriers to clinical research. This activity reviews the evaluation medications used during pregnancy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in making appropriate medication selection.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the issues of concern in regards to the ethical and legal implications of medication use in pregnancy.
- Describe the issues of concern in regards to medication use in unplanned pregnancies.
- Outline the clinical significance of use of drugs with risk categories of A, B, C, D, and X.
- Summarize the evaluation of medications used during pregnancy and outline the role of the interprofessional team in making appropriate medication selection.
