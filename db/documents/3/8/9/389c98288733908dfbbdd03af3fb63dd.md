Management of a patient with Pierre Robin sequence requires an interprofessional team including maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialists, family planning specialists, neonatologists, plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, anesthesiologists, oral maxillofacial surgeons, dentists, dieticians, speech pathologists, and geneticists.

Prenatal diagnosis is important in coordinating interprofessional team planning even before delivery. Prenatal diagnosis is typically made by ultrasound findings diagnosed by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist. Diagnostic genetic testing will be conducted with MFM as well. After diagnosis, referral to a geneticist may be made for further counseling. It is important to educate parents on expectations and management options in the prenatal period. One way to enhance this coordination between teams is to hold prenatal care conferences with representatives from each department to share their concerns and plans with the rest of the care team, as well as the parents. Neonatologists can discuss the immediate assessment and care of the newborn in the first weeks to months of life, including airway management and typical feeding/growth difficulties. Otolaryngologists, plastic surgeons, and/or oral maxillofacial surgeons can discuss potential surgical options and complications.

Dieticians are an important member of the care team, as many children with PRS have feeding difficulties and suffer from failure to thrive. Speech pathologists may later assist with speech and swallowing training. Nursing will be instrumental from delivery through postnatal hospitalizations.
