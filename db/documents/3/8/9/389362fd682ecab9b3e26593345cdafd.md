The etiology of beta-blocker overdose is closely related to the epidemiology of depression and the presence of coexisting medical conditions that are treated with beta-blockers. In one study, patients who overdosed on beta-blockers were more likely to be women (3:1) with a mean age of 30 years. Two-thirds of these patients overdosed on someone else’s medication or were using beta-blockers for noncardiac indications (e.g., migraine, tremor, thyrotoxicosis).
