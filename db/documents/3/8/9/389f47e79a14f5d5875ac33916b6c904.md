Hand hygiene should be performed with soap and water instead of alcohol-based products when caring for a patient with C. difficile infection because of the increased efficacy of spore removal with soap and water.

To prevent C. difficile infections use infection control recommendations and more prudent antibiotic use. It is recommended to continue contact precautions for at least 2 days after diarrhea has resolved and continue contact precautions until discharge if infection rates remain high despite using standard infection control measures.
