# Continuing Education Activity

Global life expectancy has been increasing, and so has the population of older patients. Due to multiple comorbidities, the geriatric population has special needs. This activity describes the evaluation of various domains of geriatric assessment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of older patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the common presentation of geriatric patients.
- Identify the unique features in the care of geriatric patients.
- Summarize the management consideration of the older patients.
- Outline how an interprofessional team can coordinate geriatric patients' coordinated evaluation and care to obtain the best outcomes.

# Introduction

The elderly population (age >65 years) is increasing throughout the world, leading to increased hospitalization. There was a 16.7% increase in elderly hospitalization from 2003-2009 in the United States. This rising hospitalization has impacted healthcare services delivery.

Due to multiple comorbidities and frailty, the elderly are at increased risk of adverse outcomes with each clinical insult.

Geriatric assessment, thus, includes a coordinated approach for the physical, functional, and psychosocial assessment of the elderly and formulate an integrated plan of care.

# Issues of Concern

Issues of concern in geriatric assessment can be broadly divided into the following 4 classes:

- Functional Status

- Physical Health

- Vision impairment
- Hearing loss
- Nutrition status
- Fall prevention
- Urinary Incontinence
- Osteoporosis and arthritis

- Polypharmacy and Medication Reconciliation

- Cognitive Assessment

- Dementia
- Sleep and insomnia
- Mood disorder

**1. Functional Status**

Evaluation of one's ability to perform activities required to live independently comprises functional status assessment. It can be broadly divided into 2 levels - basic activities of daily living (BADL), which includes activities of self-care such as feeding, dressing, bathing, toileting, grooming, controlling bladder and bowel movements, etc. and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) which includes activities to live independently such as taking medications, shopping, preparing meals, driving/using public transport, handling finances, doing household works, using telephone, etc. Commonly used indices to assess such activities are the Katz index for BADL and the Lawton scale for IADL. Information about functional status can also be achieved by asking open-ended questions about their daily activities. Functional status is directly affected by physical health, so any change in functional status should prompt further evaluation. There are various validated tools to measure functional ability, such as the Vulnerable Elders Scale-13 or Clinical Frailty Scale.

**2. Physical Health**

Geriatric assessment should include detailed medical history and physical examination, with particular focus on problems specific to the elderly such as vision, hearing, nutrition, fall prevention, urinary incontinence, osteoporosis, and preventative health.

**Preventative Health**

Preventative health includes screening for diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, etc. Early identification and treatment may be beneficial in diabetes, hypertension as well as in certain malignancies. However, the American Geriatric Society recommended that such screenings be based on patient's preferences, life expectancy, and co-morbid conditions rather than solely on age-based criteria. Older patients may have many co-morbid conditions that can shorten their life, hence the potential benefits of such screening tests and patient's preference for further evaluation and invasive procedure if screened positive should be taken into account before the screening. For the same reason, screening should be focused on treatable conditions which can provide immediate benefit to their quality of life rather than on asymptomatic diseases.

**Vision**

Visual impairment affects older patients' functional status, especially functions such as driving, preparing meals, managing money, etc. are significantly affected. It is also associated with falls, cognitive decline, and depression in the elderly.

**Hearing**

Hearing loss is, in fact, the third most common condition in older patients. Like visual impairment, hearing loss is associated with functional decline, poor cognition, and dementia, social isolation, and depression.

**Nutrition**

Up to 15% of the community-dwelling elderly population is affected by malnutrition, which is associated with a decline in physical health, such as poor wound healing, anemia, immune dysfunction, etc. Poor cognition, functional decline, and an overall increase in mortality.

**Falls**

About 28% of older adults report falling at least once in the last year, as per a recent cross-sectional study in the United States.

A systematic review of 18 studies reported fall to be multifactorial with the following risk factors - history of falls, gait or balance impairment, orthostatic hypotension, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, impairment in activities of daily living, and medications such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, diuretics, etc. Of these, the two most predictive risk factors were history of falls and gait or balance impairment. When adjusted for other variables, age was not as important as the aforementioned two risk factors in predicting falls. Hence, a simple approach could be to ask for a history of falls and any abnormality in gait and balance. The patient will be at high risk if he/she answers "yes" to any one of these questions.

**Urinary Incontinence**

Most studies show the prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) in the range of 25-45% and rise further with aging.

Initial evaluation of incontinence should comprise a non-invasive approach, including detailed medical history, fluid intake assessment, self-voiding diary, etc.; however, complicated cases may necessitate urodynamic studies. A simple and reproducible validated tool to differentiate stress and urge incontinence is 3 Incontinence Questions which comprises questions about urinary leaks.

**Osteoporosis and Arthritis**

Osteoporosis and osteopenia are common in the elderly and can lead to fractures even with mild trauma. Increased bone loss due to aging and menopause in women puts older patients and post-menopausal women at high risk of osteoporosis.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability and pain in older patients. About 50% of people will have OA changes in knees by age 65, and almost everyone will have at least 1 joint affected with OA by age 75. Evaluation should include ruling out infectious process, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic, gout, and pseudogout. A careful history, physical examination, arthrocentesis, laboratory tests, and radiographic imaging may be necessary to come to a diagnosis. Medication such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen are used primarily to manage symptoms as no pharmacological cure is available for OA. Despite early enthusiasm, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate have not shown to decrease pain in a recent clinical trial. Joint replacement surgery for carefully selected older patients may provide maximum benefit in improving the quality of life.

**3. Polypharmacy**

Patients older than 65 use more than 30% of all prescribed medication in the U.S.

Taking multiple medications can cause serious adverse effects due to the drug itself, drug-drug interaction, and drug-disease interaction.

**4. Cognitive Assessment**

Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia increases with age. The prevalence of dementia is around 5% to 7%, and that of MCI is about 4 times that of dementia.

**Sleep**

Insomnia is one of the common presenting problems of older patients. Poor sleep is associated with increased fatigue, falls, nursing home placement, poor quality of life, and overall mortality. Quality of sleep decreases with aging. Sleep disorders could be primary such as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, or secondary to comorbid medical, psychiatric, behavioral, environmental, or medication side effects. Assessment of sleep disorder should include evaluation for secondary causes if any. Due to increased side-effects of hypnotics used in the treatment of insomnia, non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, education about sleep hygiene and expected changes with aging, stimulus control, decreased daytime sleep and dietary modifications are the first line of treatment for insomnia.

**Depression**

Almost half of the cases of depression have their onset at 60 or older. Depression is associated with decreased cognition, physical and social functioning, self-care, and independence. Older patients with depression die at a higher rate; a portion of that death rate results from the highest suicide rate among older adults.

# Clinical Significance

Due to the aging process, even a well-functioning older patient can deteriorate rapidly due to any 1 or a combination of issues. The development of any new signs or symptoms in the elderly can be due to the adverse effects of medication. Hence, medication reconciliation and avoidance of polypharmacy are important in every visit or each transition of care.

Sensory issues such as vision and hearing impairment can also lead to functional decline and masquerade as mood changes and cognitive impairment. So, patients with suspicion of such symptoms should be assessed for vision and hearing impairment. Urinary incontinence (UI), osteoporosis, and arthritis can all lead to functional decline by limiting older patients' mobility. It is important to get detailed history to diagnose the type of UI and provide appropriate treatment based on UI type. Appropriate nutrition and preventative health, use of safe medication, and surgical options like knee replacement can significantly improve the health of patients who have osteoporosis and arthritis. Early recognition of cognitive decline, including dementia, insomnia, and mood disorder, could provide an opportunity to begin behavioral and medical therapy early in the course of the disease with the possibility to reverse or at least arrest the disease progression.

Older patients make the largest share of health care consumers at present. However, due to multiple issues, it can be overwhelming for providers to address all of these. The use of various standardized tools can help alleviate confusion and discrepancy in assessing older patients. It is important to address such issues on a rollover basis during each clinic visit to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.

# Other Issues

**Some of the Other Issues of Concern Include**

Safety assessment

- Home safety

- Driving safety

- Elder mistreatment

Goals of care and advanced directives

**Safety Assessment**

**Home safety**: About 57,000 adults above age 65 died of unintentional injuries in 2018 as per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than half of which is estimated to be due to falls. Decline in overall health at old age along with isolation leads to a higher risk of accidents at home. Clinicians should discuss common ways to prevent falls at home, such as lights, handrails, and walking assistance devices. CDC has published a checklist for home fall prevention for older adults, which can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/check_for_safety_brochure-a.pdf

**Driving**: Driving is a complex task and is affected by the decline in visual, motor, and cognitive ability in old age. However, it is also one of the important IADLs that help older patients maintain mobility and engage socially. Therefore, the prospect of "retiring from driving" is highly stressful for the elderly, and such recommendations should be made based on individualized assessment. Besides testing for visual acuity, neck mobility, and reaction time, a multidisciplinary approach including an ophthalmologist, a psychiatrist, a pharmacist, a physical therapist, and an occupational therapist can help assess and improve driving function. If the risk of driving is high, options for alternative forms of transportation and mobility should be discussed with patients and caregivers.

**Mistreatment**: Elder mistreatment includes abuse and neglect. Various studies show the prevalence of elder mistreatment ranging from 2 to 36%. In the U.S., the prevalence is around 9.5%. Still, the reported prevalence is low as elder abuse tends to be underreported.

**Goals of Care and Advanced Directives**

Clinicians should discuss goals of care and advance directives primarily in ambulatory settings, well in advance of facing health crises. Effective communication allows the patient to cope with the serious illness and empowers them to direct their treatment. Goals of care discussion should be individualized as different patients would have different short or long-term goals. Similarly, advanced directives discussion allows the providers to know about the patient's wishes, prevents confusion at the end of life, and minimizes healthcare costs by deferring unwanted medical procedures. Such discussions do not increase depression, anxiety, or hopelessness in patients rather improve their quality of life and even survival by up to 25%. It also decreases stress, anxiety, and depression among family members and improves family satisfaction.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Life expectancy has improved over the last few decades due to advancements in medical science. Due to this, the population of older patients has also increased significantly. United States Census Bureau estimates around 49 million people in the US are 65 years or over in 2016. Impairment in multiple domains in the aging population inversely affects health outcomes and quality of life. Hence, a comprehensive assessment in this population is imperative for early diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of issues in the older population.

Due to the multitude of comorbidities, geriatric assessment and care require coordination between all members of the interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians of different specialties like primary care, hospitalist, geriatrician, psychiatrist, podiatrist, dentist, to name a few, as well as nurse, social worker, and other allied health care workers such as a physical therapist, occupational therapist, nutritionist, pharmacist, psychologist, audiologist and optician. A systematic review of 29 randomized controlled trials has shown that hospitalized older patients who receive this kind of assessment have more chances of surviving and living at home than in nursing homes.
