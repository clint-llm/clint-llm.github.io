Patients usually complain of unilateral pain without a side shift. It is ordinarily predominant in females. Pain topography usually stems from the neck, spreading to the oculofrontotemporal area with episodes of carrying duration or fluctuating continuous pain increased by head movement. Pain is of variable duration and moderate to severe intensity, but not excruciating or throbbing.

Pain can mimic primary headache syndromes such as tension headache or migraine headache, although the patient will be less likely to complain of sensitivity to light and noise as in migraine headaches. It may be associated with a reduced range of motion of the neck and ipsilateral neck, shoulder, or arm pain. Patients will complain that the pain is not resolving with a triptan, ergotamine, or indomethacin. Autonomic symptoms such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are not as common.
