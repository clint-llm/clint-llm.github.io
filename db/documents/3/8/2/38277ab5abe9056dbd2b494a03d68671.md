Although rather nonspecific, common presenting symptoms of patients with pylephlebitis include fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss. Important physical examination findings though not always present, include abdominal tenderness, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, ascites, and jaundice, usually seen with disseminated hepatic involvement.
