Close monitoring is essential in patients with diarrhea associated with ulcerative colitis as this medication increases the risk of toxic megacolon. Any symptom suggestive of toxic megacolon like abdominal distension/decreased bowel sounds should prompt withdrawal of the drug. This drug is withheld in patients with diarrhea associated with electrolyte imbalance until it's corrected as it can precipitate dehydration. The initial and maximum dosage administered in 24 hours is 20 mg, i.e., eight tablets.
