Clinicians often consider joint injection as a therapeutic modality after attempting other interventions. Initial measures primarily include physical therapy and NSAIDs. The primary indications for glenohumeral joint injection include osteoarthritis and adhesive capsulitis. Fluoroscopic assisted injection of contrast material into the glenohumeral articulationÂ is also useful for CT or MR arthrography. Similarly, the primary indications for therapeutic acromioclavicular joint injection include osteoarthritis and post-traumatic osteolysis of the distal clavicle.
