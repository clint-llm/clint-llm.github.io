Glaucoma leads to irreversible damage to the optic nerve, thus vision, which can adversely impact a person's life personally and socially. Hence, an interprofessional approach should be adopted to identify, treat and delay the progression of glaucoma. The clinician should carefully examine to uncover early signs of glaucoma. If found, appropriate steps should be adopted. A physician in the periphery should refer the patient to a higher center for management.

Patient counseling plays an important role. A combined effort by the treating doctor, nurses, and pharmacist should explain the necessity of seeking early treatment. The importance of medication compliance should also be presented. Family members of a patient diagnosed with glaucoma should be encouraged to get themselves screened. Patients undergoing laser procedures should understand the importance of the procedure and any potential complications. Any misconception regarding the laser procedure should be clarified, and the patient should receive an explanation regarding the safety and efficacy of the procedure.

An interprofessional approach is key to addressing the global burden of glaucoma. There should be cooperation among each level to prevent the attack by glaucoma. [Level 5]
