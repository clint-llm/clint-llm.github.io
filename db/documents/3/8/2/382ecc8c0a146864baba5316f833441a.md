Ubiquitination (also known as ubiquitylation) is a form of post-translation modification (PTM) in which ubiquitin is attached to a target protein. Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid protein that exists in the free form or can be conjugated to a protein as a single ubiquitin (i.e., monoubiquitination)Â  or as a multiple ubiquitin (i.e., polyubiquitination). Ubiquitination plays versatile roles in protein functions ranging from protein degradation to subcellular localization and kinase activation. Three enzymes are involved in the ubiquitination pathway: Ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Ubiquitination is highly relevant to the pathobiology of many human diseases. This review will explore the fundamentals of ubiquitination, its function, pathophysiology, and clinical significance of ubiquitination.
