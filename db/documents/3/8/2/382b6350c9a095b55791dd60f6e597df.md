The branching pattern of the facial artery in the area of the nasofacial junction is variable. In the majority of individuals, the lateral nasal artery arises at the bifurcation of the facial artery that also gives off the superior labial artery, just superior to the oral commissure. In some cases, however, the lateral nasal artery may branch directly from the superior labial artery instead of the facial artery. If the lateral nasal artery is a branch of the superior labial artery, it will ascend the face until it reaches the ala. At the ala, the lateral nasal artery will then ascend the nose and turn medially towards the tip and give off the angular artery to continue its ascent along the nasofacial junction.
