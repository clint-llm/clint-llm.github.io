An electroencephalogram (EEG) is essential to define an epileptic syndrome, especially a focal epileptic seizure. It also aids in both localizing and characterizing the seizure, and aid in the selection of the drug for treatment. Electrodes, amplifiers, and plotting devices are used to record an EEG. These are set to various montages, that create numerous channels for region-specific electrical activity monitoring. Focal seizures are associated with specific EEG patterns, that aid in detecting and discerning the focus and subsequently the treatment for the specific epileptic syndrome. This activity reviews the application, technique used, and common EEG findings in localizing epilepsies. It also highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anticipated EEG findings associated with localization-related epilepsies.
- Explain the equipment and technique used in recording EEG in localization-related epilepsies.
- Summarize the clinical significance, indications, contraindication, and potential complications with EEG in localization-related epilepsies.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by localization-related epilepsies.
