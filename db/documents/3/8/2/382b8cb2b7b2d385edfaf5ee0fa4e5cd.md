The prognosis of depressive cognitive disorders is controversial, with surveys documenting transformation to irreversible neurodegenerative dementia and additional reviews documenting no transformation. In the past, it came to be more obvious that depression correlated with cognitive deficits can be the prodromal phase of dementia. In this respect, current data reports depression to be related to a twofold heightened risk of transforming to irreversible dementia. Researchers have found that over an interval of 4 to 5 years, more than 70% of cases originally diagnosed with depression with cognitive impairment transformed into dementia, and 18% of these cases were originally found to have no changes in cognition.
