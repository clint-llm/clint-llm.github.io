Alternate subtypes of glaucomas are the most common considerations in the differential diagnosis and may present with normal IOP. These include:

- Angle-closure glaucoma

- Hypertensive uveitis

- Pigmentary glaucoma

- Pseudoexfoliative glaucoma

- POAG with thin central corneas, underestimating the true IOP.

Previous episodes of raised IOP, including a history of ocular trauma, hyphema, steroid use, or vitrectomy.

Previous vascular insults or compromise can cause a non-progressive picture similar to NTG. These include retinal vascular occlusions, arteritic or non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, and severe systemic hypotension (e.g., after surgery, trauma, or sepsis).

Non-progressive disc abnormalities that may be misdiagnosed as NTG include physiological disc cupping, tilted discs, myopic fundus, disc drusen, optic disc pit, or congenital anomalies such as optic disc coloboma or superior segmental optic nerve hypoplasia.

Other optic neuropathies may be considered, including optic neuritis and hereditary, toxic, traumatic, and inflammatory optic neuropathies.

Intraorbital or intracranial tumors, including pituitary adenomas, are an important differential. Red flags include young age without a family history, rapid progression, unilateral disease, proptosis, associated neurological symptoms or signs, atypical disc findings, such as disc pallor without cupping, or field defects that respect the vertical midline. In the presence of these red flags, contrast-enhanced MRI of the anterior visual pathway is indicated to exclude compressive lesions.
