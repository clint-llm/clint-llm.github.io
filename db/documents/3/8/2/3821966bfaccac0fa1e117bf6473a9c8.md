**Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**

- Acute onset of dyspnea with bilateral chest X-ray non-cardiogenic infiltrates and PaO2/FiO2 less than 300

- Difficult to delineate ARDS from Hantavirus

- Must look for inciting factors

- Management is similar

**Mycobacterial Pneumonia**

- If the patient requires mechanical ventilation and bronchoalveolar lavage obtained, other presenting pathogens may guide antibiotic therapy.

- Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment not shown to change outcomes of HantavirusÂ for better or worse

**Influenza Pneumonia**

- Influenza PCR helpful for ruling-in influenza pneumonia instead of Hantavirus

**Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers**

- Specific PCRs necessary to diagnose a single etiology

- Treatment still supportive care in the ICU
