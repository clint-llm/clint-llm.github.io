Blood pressure mediation is by a balance of the cardiac output and the peripheral vascular resistance. In idiopathic hypertension, most patients will have a near normal cardiac output, but their peripheral resistance is elevated. As mentioned earlier, mediation of this resistance is at the level of the arteriole. As with other tissues in the body, if there is prolonged constriction of the smooth muscle within the arterioles, this will lead to hypertrophy and thickening of the vessel. There are several mechanisms by which the systemic vascular resistance may be altered.

The renin-angiotensin system is mediated by the renal system. Renin is a molecule released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus in response to under perfusion; renin may also be released via activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which subsequently converts into angiotensin II which acts as a vasoconstrictor on blood vessels, thus causing a rise in blood pressure.

The autonomic nervous system causes both vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Alpha-1 receptor activation causes vasoconstriction, and beta-2 receptor activation causes vasodilation.

The endothelium, itself, can modulate blood pressure. The endothelium may release nitrous oxide (vasodilation) or endothelin (vasoconstrictor).

Several molecules have been found to place a role in blood pressure but have an unclear significance on the control of hypertension. Examples of these molecules are bradykinin, thromboxane, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).
