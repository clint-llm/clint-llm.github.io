Medical students and residents are expected to manage several critical events following training, but they are often ill-equipped to do so because of limited clinical experiences in the diagnosis and management of many such conditions. Simulation-based training can be utilized across multiple medical specialties and is essential to every didactic curriculum to model critical events. One of the tenets of healthcare education is to develop teaching and evaluation techniques that allow instructors to gauge a traineeâ€™s performance in settings that reflect clinical practice. Standardized patients (SPs) have often been utilized to assess the history and physical examination skills for medical students and graduate physicians.
