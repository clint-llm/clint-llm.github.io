Tinea manuum is caused by dermatophytes, and the most common agent worldwide is Trichophyton rubrum. However, different etiologic organisms have been reported in various geographical locations.

Other involved dermatophytes are Trichophyton mentagrophytes,Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton verrucosum, Trichophyton interdigitale, Microsporum canis.

Microsporum gypseum, Trichophyton eriotrephon, and Arhroderma benhamiae have also been described, but more rarely.

Risk factors and predispositions for Tinea infections and onychomycosis include:

- Male gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atherosclerosis, immunosuppression

- Humid environment, e.g., excess sweating (hyperhidrosis) and maceration, prolonged use of occlusive footwear, and communal bathing/public sports facilities.

- Excoriation of the soles of the feet or picking toenails infected with tinea.

- Farmworkers and pet owners (exotic pets: guinea pigs, hedgehogs).

- Recurrent trauma to the hands, usually work-related; e.g., car mechanics, machine operators, individuals who work with chemicals.
