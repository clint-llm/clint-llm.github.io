# Continuing Education Activity

Bisacodyl is a medication used in the management and treatment of chronic or functional constipation. This activity outlines the indications, actions, and contraindications for bisacodyl as a valuable agent in the treatment of constipation. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and contraindication of bisacodyl to treat patients with constipation and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of bisacodyl.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of bisacodyl.
- Review the potential for toxicity and its manifestations with bisacodyl.
- Explain how interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication can advance bisacodyl use and improve outcomes.

# Indications

Bisacodyl [4,4’-diacetoxy-diphenyl-(pyridyl-2)-methane], a diphenylmethane derivative stimulant laxative, has been available as a laxative since 1952.

Bisacodyl appears superior to the other drugs for changing the number of bowel movements per week.

# Mechanism of Action

Bisacodyl’s target of action is the gastrointestinal tract.

BPHM has a dual activity in the colon, including an anti-absorptive-secretory effect and a direct prokinetic effect by stimulating parasympathetic nerve endings in the colonic mucosa.

Ratnaike et al. demonstrated that bisacodyl impairs fluid absorption by activating adenylate cyclase in the small intestinal enterocytes, which increases the amount of cyclic AMP, and causes the active secretion of Cl- and HCO3-, passive efflux of Na+, K+ and water, and inhibition of Na+ and Cl- absorption into the enterocyte.

Bassotti et al. investigated the effect of a 10 mg bisacodyl solution. They found that about 90% of patients with slow transit constipation showed motor response characterized by one or more high amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs).

# Administration

Bisacodyl administration can be via oral or rectal routes.

In children from 3 to 10 years old, bisacodyl oral or rectal is given in doses of 5 mg per day in one dose at night. Children over ten years old or older can be given up to 10 mg per day in one dose a day at night.

Continued use of bisacodyl may decrease its efficacy, which occurs because bisacodyl increases the production of PGE2, which decreases the expression of AQP3. The effectiveness of compounds that decrease AQP3 expression in the colon can be reduced by continued use.

# Adverse Effects

The most common adverse effects, seen in more than 5 percent of patients taking bisacodyl, are diarrhea, abdominal pain (mainly in the upper abdomen), and headache.

Myenteric plexus or smooth muscle damage due to stimulant laxatives is rare, and it is unclear if this is due to constipation or laxative use.

Rectal administration of bisacodyl may cause rectal mucosa irritation and a sensation of burning and mild proctitis. Bisacodyl has some interactions with other drugs such as digoxin, antacids, and H2-receptor antagonist. Wang et al. conclude that bisacodyl interferes with digoxin absorption, with a resultant reduction of the serum digoxin concentration.

# Contraindications

Bisacodyl's primary indicated use is for adults or children with constipation, especially chronic constipation. Bisacodyl is contraindicated in patients with acute gastrointestinal diseases such as appendicitis or diarrhea, with ileus or suspected bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, colitis, toxic megacolon, having severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance (i.e., hypokalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis or acidosis), or are allergic or hypersensitive to bisacodyl.

# Monitoring

Bisacodyl becomes deacetylated in the colon to its active metabolite. Its metabolite conjugates to the mono-glucuronide in the wall of the intestine or liver.

Monitoring bisacodyl's metabolite is possible in human urine, serum, and stool within 24 hours after ingestion.

# Toxicity

Overdosing of bisacodyl can induce diarrhea, leading to electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, or alkalosis, which may also produce vomiting and muscle weakness. Short-term use (3 days) of the recommended dose does not show any effect on serum electrolytes.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Constipation is a common disease that affects children and adults, especially the elderly. Unmanaged constipation can progress to fecal impaction, which further impairs patients' quality of life and increases healthcare costs. Constipation is one of the most prevalent outpatient diagnoses among gastrointestinal disorders.

It can be challenging for the healthcare team because there are no accepted guidelines for choosing the best agent. The clinician should discuss all problems with the patient and coordinate with nurses or the caregiver to maximize the quality of service, thus increasing the patient's quality of life. The provider should consider all risks and benefits of using a laxative, especially a bisacodyl, in the management of constipation to minimalize the adverse effect. Besides using bisacodyl as a stimulant laxative, it is also essential to focus on individual therapy based on the symptoms and pathophysiology of the patient's disease to make a better follow-up to improve the outcome of this disorder. Pharmacists need to be engaged with both the patient, nursing staff, and the clinician. These products are available OTC, and the burden of counseling and making recommendations may fall 100% to the pharmacist. The pharmacist should contact the patient's physician if there are any concerns over the patient's use of bisacodyl. Nurses should also understand the ramifications and potential adverse effects of these agents, and take a thorough medication history, including OTC agents, so the treating clinician has a clearer picture of the patient's case. This approach represents the type of collaborative interprofessional team approach necessary to drive an optimal outcome for the patient. [Level 5]

Despite being used for symptomatic relief, laxatives are also misused by individuals who present with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa or bulimia, individuals who engaged in certain types of athletic training, including sports with set weight limits, and surreptitious laxative abusers who use the drugs to cause factitious diarrhea and may have a medical disorder. The first step in treating laxative misuse is to determine what may be promoting the behavior. The individual who misuses the laxative has to stop the stimulant laxatives and replace them with osmotic supplements to establish regular bowel movements. Education and further treatment are required to maintain a healthy bowel program. Referral for psychiatric treatment is essential in the case of eating disorders such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa to lessen the reliance on laxatives as a method to alter perceived weight and shape.
