The femur is the long bone of the thigh and the largest and strongest bone in the human anatomy. The proximal femur has large muscle attachments and a joint at the pelvis forming the hip. The distal femur also has large muscle-group attachments and forms the knee joint with the proximal tibia. The sites of fractures are often named in relation to the anatomy where the fracture occurs.

The femur has many common names and medical names which describe different portions of the bone. The femoral shaft is the diaphysis and is commonly fractured in trauma. The head of the femur is the proximal-most portion of the bone which directly joins to the pelvis forming the hip joint. The femoral neck is the region of bone joining the head to the femoral shaft. The greater and lesser trochanter are protuberances of bone on the proximal end of the femur, and each aid in defining the location of fractures. The distal femur has structures involved in the knee joint called condyles and epicondyles for muscle attachment.

Examining the anatomy of the injured limb should include all systems involved, including circulation, peripheral nerves, and motor function. Injuries often affect these non-boney structures due to the force causing the fracture or dislocation of the femur, also injuring surrounding anatomy. Absent or decreases in the circulation or sensation of the lower limb could direct care and should be carefully monitored before and after immobilization.
