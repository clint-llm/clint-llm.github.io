Its etiology is considered to be multifactorial, including post-traumatic arthritis, heterotopic ossification, non-union or malunion with soft tissues around the elbow contracture. Regan and Reilly recognized three factors that may contribute to elbow contracture: 1) its complex anatomy, 2) the anterior brachial muscle that covers the anterior capsule leading to ossification and 3) sustained immobilization due to difficulties in achieving a stable osteosynthesis, especially in complex fractures.

Elbow stiffness is mainly determined by the degree of the joint injury. However, it is also influenced by periosteum loss and immobilization time. These causes may explain why major contractures are observed, despite obtaining adequate reduction and stability, or even in fractures without displacement. Other non-traumatic causes of stiffness are hemophilia, sequelae of infections, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Among congenital causes, the arthrogryposis and congenital dislocation of the radial head are distinguished.

**Stiffness due to Heterotopic Ossification**

These formations of mature bone in non-bony locations frequently present in the elbow. Its cause remains unknown. Amorphous calcium deposits that affect the capsule and the collateral ligaments may consolidate in periarticular calcifications. Distinguishing this phenomenon from the heterotopic ossification is important.

Heterotopic ossification presents after direct elbow trauma. Post dislocation incidence rises 3% according to literature reports, and up to 20% is associated with fractures and complex dislocations. They occur in 5% to 10% in patients with isolated encephalic trauma, more frequently on the hemiplegic side. When encephalic trauma occurs together with elbow trauma, the percentage reaches to 75% to 90%. They have also been associated with specific surgical approaches. Available medical treatment is not completely effective; therefore prevention is a key element. The utility of NSAIDs was demonstrated during the first 3 to 5 days of its development. Indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin have proved to be the most effective.

**Elbow Stiffness Secondary to Malunion and Nonunions**

The particular etiology will determine the treatment of these entities. It can originate as a sequel of articular fractures and malunions. These conditions disrupt the elbow biomechanics. No union of the distal humerus produces limitation due to pain and instability.  In these cases, in addition to the treatment of nonunion, procedures, such as arthrolysis, should be added. It is important to evaluate the complete affected limb and identify any associated injuries, such as burns, infections, and neurovascular lesions, among others.
