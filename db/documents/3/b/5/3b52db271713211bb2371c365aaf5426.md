The differential diagnosis includes:

- Ischial tuberosity disease

- Hamstring enthesopathy

- Referred pain from the sacroiliac joints, lumbar spine,Â  pubic symphysis, gluteal muscles

- Sciatica

- Stress fractures of the pelvis or the fibular neck

Clinicians should be mindful that not all posterior thigh pain derives from the biceps femoris tendon injury. Besides, the biceps femoris tendon injury often occurs with an injury of the entire hamstring complex.
