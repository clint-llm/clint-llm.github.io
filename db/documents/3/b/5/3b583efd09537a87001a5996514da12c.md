CT imaging of the neck can offer help with confirming and localizing the presence of a deep neck infection. However, patients are often either too unstable for CT imaging or unable to lie flat on the CT table to have the CT performed. There may be situations where only a portable lateral soft tissue neck x-ray can be obtained, and this can help support the diagnosis of neck abscess without much help in localization.

In cases where an early neck abscess is suspected, an otolaryngologist may be called upon to perform direct laryngoscopy to ascertain the presence of swelling.

If a dental source is suspected, then a panorex view is necessary.

Blood work including electrolytes, clotting profile, blood cultures, and abscess cultures should be obtained.
