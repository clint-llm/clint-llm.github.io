Bowel necrosis is a late stage finding of several different disease processes characterized by cellular death due to reduced blood flow to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This serious and often fatal condition can be secondary to vascular occlusion, bowel inflammation, obstruction, or infection. In infants, it is known as necrotizing enterocolitis and is thought to be due to bacterial overgrowth in the setting of an underdeveloped immune system. In adults, the most common cause of bowel necrosis is an acute mesenteric occlusion, and less commonly, perforations, chronic ischemia, inflammatory disease, and other mechanical obstructions. Bowel necrosis is a late stage finding of decreased blood flow to the GI tract and is frequently accompanied by septic shock. The prognosis is poor, and the reduction in mortality relies on early identification and intervention.
