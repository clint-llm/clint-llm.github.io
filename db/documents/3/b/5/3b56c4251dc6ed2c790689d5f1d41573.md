Photographic views should be obtained using a 5-view head series with the patient in a seated and upright position with no facial animation. There should be documentation with close-up views of the eyes (closed/open/upward gaze/lateral gaze).

The infraorbital fat pads, tear trough, and site of the infraorbital nerve are marked. If a performing a concomitant skin pinch, this can be marked out with a conservative (2 to 3 mm) skin pinch along the subciliary margin.

Although the transconjunctival blepharoplasty may be performed entirely under local anesthesia, nevertheless general anesthesia or intravenous (IV) techniques are advisable to ensure patient comfort.

A single dose of intravenous antibiotics should be administered before the start of the procedure.

Local anesthesia should infiltrate along the inferior orbital rim, tear trough, and conjunctiva.

Eye shields can are an option per surgeon preference.
