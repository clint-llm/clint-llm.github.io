In presbyopia, we note that the near point of accommodation (NPA) recedes beyond the usual reading distance. Using the Royal Air Force (RAF) rule, the NPA is calculated and hence the amplitude of accommodation. The amplitude of accommodation decreases with an increase in age.

Evaluation is subjective. Patients are asked to keep the near reading target at the usual reading distance, and lenses are added. The minimum value of the plus lens, which makes vision clear enough to read the last line of the reading chart at the usual reading distance, is considered to be the dioptric power that has to be prescribed.
