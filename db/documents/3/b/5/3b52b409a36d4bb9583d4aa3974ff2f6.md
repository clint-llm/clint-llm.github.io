Peroneal tendon injuries vary in their severity and are managed by an interprofessional team to achieve the best outcomes. Patients with mild injury may present to the nurse practitioner or primary care provider. However, if the injury is severe, the patient should be referred to a specialist. Clinicians who manage these injuries should be aware that lateral ankle pain can have a multitude of isolated injuries or a combination of injuries.

Adequate interprofessional communication between athletic trainers, sports medicine physicians, nurse practitioner, podiatrists, and foot and ankle surgeons is paramount for diagnosing peroneal tendon injuries. The orthopedic surgeon should see patients and athletes who do not respond well to conservative management. Communication among these physician specialties is crucial. Additionally, a pharmacist may be necessary to verify medication reconciliation if the decision is made to institute NSAID or other pain management pharmacotherapy. Nurses will often be the point of initial contact at each visit, and their input on whether therapy is progressing should merit consideration. In both surgical and non-operative cases, a physical therapist will almost certainly be involved, and they will report to the healthcare team on the progress or lack thereof in the rehabilitative process. All members of the interprofessional healthcare team, therefore, must communicate and collaborate to drive patient outcomes to their best possible result. [Level V]

Most patients will require some type of rehabilitation to regain muscle function and strength. However, return to sporting activity should not be rushed, and the orthopedic surgeon should see the patient for clearance.

If promptly diagnosed, and surgical treatment of peroneal tendon injuries are required, athletic patients may return to sport by three months with successful outcomes.
