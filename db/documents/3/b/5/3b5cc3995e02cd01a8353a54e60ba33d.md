Loose anagen hair syndrome is an inherited disease diagnosed clinically. Poorly adherent anagen hairs result in easy shedding and non-scarring alopecia. It is important to understand the benign, self-limited nature and good prognosis as the disease typically resolves with age. Distinguishing it from other causes of non-scarring alopecia is paramount, and a dermatologist can facilitate this differentiation. Foundations of treatment revolve around minimizing hair trauma and patient reassurance.
