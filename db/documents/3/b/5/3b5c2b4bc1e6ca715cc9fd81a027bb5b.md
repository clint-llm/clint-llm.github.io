As previously stated, patients with perioral dermatitis should be made aware of the role of topical steroids in their disease process. In addition to the discontinuation of topical steroids or other triggering agents, patients should also be instructed to stop using all topical products except for their prescribed medication regimen. It is also important to impress upon the patient the time frame for treatment to remission, which could be weeks to months. The likelihood of chronic symptoms should also be discussed in detail.
