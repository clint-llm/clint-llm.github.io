Acute gallbladder disease, gallstones, polyps, and occasionally, gallbladder sludge, can be diagnosed with a CT scan. The scan is most often done when the patient is undergoing an initial workup in the emergency department, and the specific diagnosis is unclear. Pericholic fluid and a thickened gallbladder wall may be seen in cases of acute cholecystitis. Chronic cholecystitis may have nonspecific findings of a thickened gallbladder wall. Gallstones and gallbladder sludge may also be identified with a CT scan.

The CT scan is probably the most useful test when doing a workup for suspected gallbladder cancer. This test is noninvasive and can evaluate the size of the tumor, areas or metastasis, and whether or not there is a gross direct extension into the liver.
