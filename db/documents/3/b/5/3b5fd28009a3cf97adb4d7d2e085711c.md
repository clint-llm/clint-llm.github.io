Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia should be considered in all cases of abnormal lipid profiles. Phenotypic presentation is not always present. A high degree of suspicion is needed. Prompt evaluation with genetic testing will help guide therapy. The goals of therapy for familial dysbetalipoproteinemia patients are reducing non-HDL-C. Prognosis can be improved with dietary therapy and/or treatment with statin and fibrate combination. An interprofessional management approach includes the family clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners (PA/NP), nursing staff, and pharmacists, all collaborating to achieve improved patient outcomes.
