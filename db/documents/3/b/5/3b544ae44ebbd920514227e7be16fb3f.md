Late complications of the disease include intractable seizures, subdural hematoma, blindness, and recurrent infections. In classical Menkes disease, death occurs by three years of age, usually secondary to vascular complications or respiratory infections. Renal complications may also occur secondary to copper sequestration in the proximal renal tubule.Â Growth failure becomes apparent shortly after the beginning of neurodegeneration.

Ocular pathologies have been observed, such as retinal hypopigmentation, partial optic nerve atrophy, macular dystrophy, congenital cataracts, and microcysts in the iris.
