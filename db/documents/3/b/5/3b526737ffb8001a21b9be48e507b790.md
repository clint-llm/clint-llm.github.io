Enflurane is rarely the anesthetic of choice any longer due to newer agents with faster induction and emergence times and fewer adverse events. Enflurane administration should only be done by trained anesthesiologists or healthcare professionals certified in anesthesia to maintain patient safety. It is essential to encourage anyone involved in the patient's direct care to speak up about any concerns they have about the patient's safety. Having an interprofessional team meeting with the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and all patient care personnel involved directly with the specific patient will help improve surgical outcomes. This can be included in the pre-surgical "time out," where everyone on the surgical and anesthesia team ensures complete agreement on what will happen in the upcoming procedure.

Communication between surgeons and anesthesiologists is required to determine the timing of emergence from the anesthesia.
