When anosognosia is due to structural brain damage, neuroradiological findings typically show damage to the right parietal or right temporoparietal region. Less common are lesions in the thalamus, basal ganglia, or left parietal region.Â Neuroimaging in dementia typically shows more global brain atrophy. Neuroimaging in psychiatric disorders usually shows non-specific findings.

There are publications on an anosognosia rating scale, which rates the level of unawareness of patients with dementia suffering from this condition:

- Patients easily admit memory loss.

- Patients admit, sometimes inconsistently, to a small amount of memory loss.

- Patients are not aware of any impairment in memory.

- Patients angrily insist that no memory problem exists.
