**Contraindications**

- Failure to pass a naloxone challenge test or positive urine screen for opioids

- Opioid dependence or current use of opioid analgesics, including partial agonists

- Acute opioid withdrawal

- Hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis to naltrexone or any components of the formulation

- History of seizures: the naltrexone/bupropion fixed dose combination is contraindicated.

**Precautions**

- Monitor patients presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia, as a few cases of eosinophilic pneumonia have been reported in the literature.

- The clinician should discontinue therapy if signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis develop.

- Patients undergoing surgery while being treated for opioid use disorder should stop oral naltrexone at least 72 hours before the scheduled surgery. In addition, the IM naltrexone therapy should be suspended for at least 30 days before surgery.

**Switching from Buprenorphine, Buprenorphine/Naloxone, or Methadone to Naltrexone**

Patients transitioning from opioid agonists (buprenorphine or methadone) might be at increased risk of precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for approximately 14 days. Therefore, clinicians should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptoms with nonopioid medications.
