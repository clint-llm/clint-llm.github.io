Patients with cardiac cirrhosis are usually asymptomatic. This condition is usually suggested from abnormal liver function tests. Common symptoms are due to heart failure like shortness of breath, leg swelling, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea. Patients who present with jaundice may be mistaken for biliary obstruction. When symptoms are present, these are gradual but may present abruptly in acute right ventricular decompensation, constrictive pericarditis, or acute decompensation of valve disease. Jugular venous distention is also present. Symptomatic patients due to liver dysfunction typically present with abdominal pain that can be localized in the right upper quadrant (secondary to hepatic capsule dilation), nausea and vomiting, jaundice, hepatomegaly, abdominal distention, and ascites. These findings are easily confused with biliary disease. Jaundice is not commonly reported. Liver injury can present in the setting of heart failure exacerbation with liver enzymes that are massively elevated after 24 to 72 hours after the cardiac decompensation. This can be as severe as hepatic encephalopathy and can clearly related to that. The term "acute cardiogenic liver injury" has been used when ischemic hepatitis occurs in the setting of congestive hepatopathy.

Physical examination findings pertinent to congestive hepatopathy include an enlarged liver on abdominal palpation and enlarged liver span on ultrasound exam.  The liver edge is typically smooth, firm, and tender.  Splenomegaly is unusual.

- Ascites with shifting dullness or fluid thrill.

- Hepatojugular reflux is usually present and can help in differentiating hepatic congestion from Budd-Chiari syndrome.

- A pulsatile liver can be seen with severe tricuspid regurgitation or pericardial disease-causing congestive hepatopathy.

- Loss of pulsatility suggests longstanding liver disease or progression to cardiac cirrhosis.

In constrictive pericarditis causing congestive hepatopathy, hepatomegaly with a pulsatile liver and are seen Kussmaul's sign (a rise in the jugular venous pressure on inspiration), a pericardial knock, and pericardial calcification on the chest are seen. Scleral icterus might be absent in these patients.
