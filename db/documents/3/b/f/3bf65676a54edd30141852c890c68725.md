The differential diagnosis includes all conditions that can present as peripheral corneal thinning and/or opacification, which are described in table 2. In marginal keratitis, there is often a clear cornea visible between the limbus and the infiltrates. Peripheral corneal degenerations are non-inflammatory, have intact epithelium, and do not have infiltrates.
