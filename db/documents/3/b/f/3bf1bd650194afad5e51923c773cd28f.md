Patients with bronchopleural fistula (BPF) can present with symptoms that range from acute symptoms of tension pneumothorax to subacute symptoms of empyema. Most patients present in the first two weeks following lung resection. BPF should be suspected in the postoperative lung resection patient who presents with sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain, hemodynamic instability, and subcutaneous emphysema. Symptoms may be less abrupt in those in whom the chest tube is still in place, and a large persistent or new air leak through the chest tube drainage system may be the only sign present.

Patients who present in the late postoperative period (more than 14 days), or patients with BPF from other causes including infection or malignancy, present with symptoms and signs of empyema. These include fever, malaise, muscle wasting, cough with purulent sputum, reduced air entry, and dullness to percussion on the affected side. When the BPF is associated with empyema that is not adequately drained, the infection can erode through the chest wall, and a pleurocutaneous opening with drainage of mucopurulent material may be seen; it is known as empyema necessitans.
