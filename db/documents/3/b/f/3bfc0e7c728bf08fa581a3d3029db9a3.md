Complications of urinary retention include but are not limited to acute kidney injury, bladder injury, and urinary tract infections. There are also complications with catheterization, both suprapubic and urethral, such as urinary tract infections, urethral erosion, bladder spasms, bladder stones, reflux nephropathy, cellulitis at the cystostomy site, nephrolithiasis, renal parenchyma damage, renal deterioration, etc.

Another important complication seen in clinical practice is post-obstructive diuresis. This phenomenon is characterized by the excretion of large amounts of salt and water immediately after the urinary is relieved by a catheter. It may be a normal physiological response to the obstruction, but physicians should keep a close eye on patients as some continue to excrete large amounts of urine and are at risk for dehydration and metabolic abnormalities.

Transurethral resection or incisions have demonstrated some efficacy, but there is a considerable risk of permanent urinary incontinence. Botulinum toxin urethral injections are a promising treatment method, but there is no standardized methodology or dosage at this point and only limited data on efficacy. Sacran neuromodulation has proven efficacy but requires surgical implantation and routine follow-up and has a high re-operation and explanation rate.
