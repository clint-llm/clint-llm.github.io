Cardiac catheterization is usually done by an interprofessional cardiac care team that includes an interventional cardiologist with assistance from nurses and radiologic technologists. During the procedure, a nurse is dedicated to the monitoring of the vital signs. After the procedure, the nurse is also responsible for ensuring that the access site is not bleeding and the distal extremity pulses are intact. In addition, the nurse will monitor the urine output to ensure that there has been no adverse reaction of the dye to the kidney. Interprofessional collaboration and open communication will provide significant benefits when performing cardiac catheterization. [Level 5]

There is increasing evidence that the transradial approach for cardiac catheterization reduces associated complications and improves patient comfort compared to the transfemoral approach. Using ultrasound/fluoroscopy for access, small-sized catheters coupled with increasing operator experience will decrease the complications further. The technology associated with cardiac catheterization procedures is changing rapidly, and interventionalists should embrace new advances and work toward making these procedures as safe as possible for the patients.
