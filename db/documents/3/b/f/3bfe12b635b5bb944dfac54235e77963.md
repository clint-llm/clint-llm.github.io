Since its development almost 60 years ago, lasers have made a huge impact on the medical field. The laser came about after the attempts by Charles Towns and Arthur Schawlow to produce a maser (microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) that had higher frequency coherent radiation at wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

Laser is an acronym that stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Electrons will emit a photon when they drop from higher energy to a lower energy level. Some of these higher energy states can be metastable, meaning they can maintain that high energy state for some time.

When a photon of a specific frequency passes by this metastable electron, it may stimulate the electron to drop to the lower energy state and radiate a photon identical to the photon that stimulated the electron.

Lasers can be defined by their medium, which can be gas (including argon and argon fluoride), liquid (including dye), solid (including neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet), or semiconductor (diode).
