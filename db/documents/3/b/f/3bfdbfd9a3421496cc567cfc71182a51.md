Chronic hypertension is a common pathological process related to the cardiovascular system. This condition is significant because, with hypertension, there is an increase in afterload. A long-term increase in afterload leads to concentric hypertrophy of the heart and eventual left-sided diastolic heart failure. Also, an S4 heart sound will be audible at the apex of the heart. Another type of heart disease is alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which occurs in alcoholics and causes dilated cardiomyopathy, which means the ventricles become dilated, leading to systolic failure. It can be reversible if the patient stops drinking alcohol.

Heart failure or cardiac tamponade can cause cardiogenic shock. In cardiogenic shock, there is an increase in PCWP because there is a backup of blood; the heart is not able to pump blood forward because it is not able to overcome the afterload. Subsequently, there is a decrease in CO. In response to low CO, the SVR increases.

In hemorrhagic shock, there is a loss of blood, thus a loss in total volume. Because there is a loss of volume, there is a decrease in pressure and, therefore, a decrease in PCWP. Also, there is an increase in cardiac output because there is a need for more blood in the periphery. While there is an increase in CO, there is also an increase in SVR to maintain MAP.
