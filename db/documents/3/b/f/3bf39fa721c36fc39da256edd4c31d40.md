Despite the advancements in therapeutic options of SLE and a better understanding of the disease process, SLE patients suffer from significant morbidity and carry a high mortality. Survival rates are 85 to 90% during the first ten years. Leading causes of mortality include cardiovascular disease, infections, and renal disease.Â Early diagnosis with therapy to prevent organ damage, monitoring and screening patients for cardiovascular disease and infections with early intervention may improve these outcomes.

Poor prognostic factors in SLE include African American ethnicity, renal disease (especially diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis), male sex, young age, older age at presentation, hypertension, low socioeconomic status, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and high overall disease activity.
