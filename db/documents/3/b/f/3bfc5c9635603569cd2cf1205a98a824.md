The common differentials of primary hepatic lymphoma are the other space-occupying lesions of the liver:

- Hepatocellular carcinoma

- Metastatic liver disease

- Hepatic adenoma

- Hemangioma

- Liver abscess

- Hydatic cyst

However, in the majority of the cases, imaging followed by a targeted biopsy of the lesion helps to confirm the diagnosis.
