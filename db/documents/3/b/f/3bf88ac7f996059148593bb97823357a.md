The examination of the nerve innervation of the hand is possible with the movements of the thumb. If the examiner instructs the patient to move the thumb and touch the tips of the other digits, this can determine if there an intact median nerve or a damaged median nerve. While thumb adduction (moving the thumb closer to the hand) can evaluate the functionality of the ulnar nerve. Finally, the radial nerve can undergo assessment by asking the patient to perform thumb extension.
