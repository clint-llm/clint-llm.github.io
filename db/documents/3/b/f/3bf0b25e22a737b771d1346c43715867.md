Effectively assessing and addressing a patientâ€™s family dynamic and its role in health and disease requires an interprofessional team of health professionals, including nurses, physicians, social workers, and therapists. Nurses are in a unique position to observe interaction patterns, assess family relationships, and attend to family concerns in the clinical setting since they are in frequent contact with family members.

Collaboration among the interprofessional team advances family-centered care practices and provides patients and families with the necessary resources to develop and maintain healthy family dynamics. Numerous studies demonstrate family dynamics and the quality of family relationships have significant implications for the health of individuals.
