The CO2 response curve is a graphical depiction of the nearly linear relationship between PaCO2 and alveolar ventilation. Though the curve is nearly linear, at the extreme levels of PaCO2 (below 45 mmHg and above 80 mmHg), the linear relationship plateaus. Within the range of 45-80 mmHg for PaCO2, minute ventilation typically increases by 2-5L/min for every 1 mmHg of CO2 increase; though this may vary immensely between individuals. These ventilatory responses can be altered by transient or prolonged external insults including toxins and medications as well as physiologic conditions including age. One major cause of the shift of the CO2 response curve is caused by changes in oxygen saturations. In the setting of hypoxemia, or decreased oxygen levels, the curve shifts to the left, meaning that the alveolar ventilation or minute ventilation in these patients is the same at lower levels of PaCO2. The curve also shifts to the left with metabolic acidemia and central etiologies. Right shifts of the curve, or the same minute ventilation in response to higher levels of PaCO2, are caused by opioids. Benzodiazepines and propofol tend to decrease the slope of the CO2 response curve, and inhaled anesthetics decrease the slope and cause a right shift of the curve. Other changes to the curve can occur with increases in age, as age tends to decrease the ventilatory response to CO2 and an increased level of fitness also tends to decrease hypercapnic respiratory drive.
