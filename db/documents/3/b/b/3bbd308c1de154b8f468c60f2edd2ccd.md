The cingulate cortex is a fascinating area of the human brain that has been the subject of neuroanatomical and therapeutic investigation owing to its role in various functions and pathologies. It is a paired structure that resides within the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere and is perhaps most well-known as part of the limbic system. It is involved in many vital neural circuits, which include other structures such as reward centers, amygdala, lateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, motor areas, spinal cord, hippocampus, and limbic regions.
