Breast calcifications tend to be an effect of a patient's chief complaint or an incidental finding. However, in the case of benign calcifications large enough to palpate, a patient may present with the complaint of a palpable breast lesion. The type of calcification, in this case, is most likely to be dystrophic, rim, or suture calcification.

If rim, dystrophic, and/or suture calcifications are seen on mammography, it is appropriate to inquire about a history of trauma, infection, surgery, or radiation.
