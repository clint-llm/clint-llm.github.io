Vasa nervorum are thin, tortuous arteries that provide blood supply to peripheral nerves, especially to the inner parts of nerves and their coverings. They are an irregular source of nutrients that supplies each peripheral nerve from the neighboring blood vessels. The medial brachial cutaneous nerve gets its blood supply from the vasa nervorum arising from the axillary vein and basilic veins, respectively, along its path.
