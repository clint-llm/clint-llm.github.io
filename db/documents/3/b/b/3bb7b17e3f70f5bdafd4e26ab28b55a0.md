The etiology of turtle headache is unknown but is suspected to be due toÂ gray matter volume changes in the posterior hypothalamus, which is the biological clock of the human body. There have been some studies about the volume of the hypothalamus as a diagnostic biomarker of chronic migraine. While not specific to turtle or hypnic headaches, this can play an important role in solidifying the etiology of these headaches. A recent study examined this relationship and found evidence of functional connectivity and structural plasticity within the hypothalamus in concordance with the pathogenesis of migraines.
