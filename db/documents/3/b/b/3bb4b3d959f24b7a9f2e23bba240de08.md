With progressive disease, patients can develop macroalbuminuria, diabetic kidney disease, and proteinuria.

Other complications of proteinuria are:

- Pulmonary edema, which is attributable to fluid overload

- Acute kidney injury secondary to intravascular depletion and progression of kidney disease

- Increased risk of cardiovascular diseases

- Increased risk of vascular thromboses, such as renal vein thrombosis

- Increased risk of bacterial infections
