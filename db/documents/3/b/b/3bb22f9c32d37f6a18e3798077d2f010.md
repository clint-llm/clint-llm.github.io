Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease with an insidious onset. Progressive musculoskeletal, and often extraskeletal, signs and symptoms are characteristic of the disease. The rate of progression can vary from one patient to the next. The primary pathology of spondyloarthropathies is enthesitis with chronic inflammation, including CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes and macrophages. Cytokines, particularly tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), are also important in the inflammatory process by leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and ossification at sites of enthesitis.
