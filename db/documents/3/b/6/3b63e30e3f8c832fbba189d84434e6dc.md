Japanese encephalitis is the most common preventable cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis in Asia, Australia, and the western Pacific. The Culex species of mosquitoes transmit the virus with their bite. Transmission occurs most commonly in agricultural areas such as farms and rice paddies but may occur in urban areas under certain conditions. While the vast majority of infections are asymptomatic, those who do develop symptoms of encephalitis suffer significant morbidity and mortality. This activity describes the clinical evaluation of Japanese encephalitis and explains the role of the health professional team in coordinating the care of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review how Japanese encephalitis is acquired. 
- Describe the history and physical exam of a patient with japanese encephalitis.
- Summarize the treatment of japanese encephalitis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Japanese encephalitis.
