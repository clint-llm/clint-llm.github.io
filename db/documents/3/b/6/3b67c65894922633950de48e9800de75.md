The prevalence rate of mucoceles is 2.4 cases per 1000 persons, with the highest percentage (70%) occurring in those ranging from 3-20 years old.

Ranulas, on the other hand, have a frequency of 0.2 cases per 1000 persons. Like mucoceles, these lesions also have a predilection for teenagers and young adults.

The inner aspect of the lower lip, often subjected to trauma such as lip biting, is a common site for the development of mucoceles. However, they can develop anywhere in the oral cavity. Other common sites for mucoceles development involve the soft palate, retromolar region, and the dorsum of the tongue. For ranulas, the floor of the mouth is the most common site to develop. Although sublingual glands give rise to most of the ranulas (90%), they may arise from the submandibular gland in rare cases.

No racial or sexual predilection has been reported for these lesions.
