The problem of multiresistant GNB infections has been rising since the beginning of the 21st century. However, there is difficulty in eradicating drug-resistant organisms because of the lack of effective antibiotics. Thus, simple measures such as regular hand hygiene, adequate sterilization of medical equipment, and isolation of patients suspected or diagnosed with MDR microorganisms, especially those submitted to invasive procedures, with the staff using caution regarding the entry of external persons. All individuals should abide by infectious disease preventive rules established in the healthcare setting. Another significant action is the laboratory worker who isolates MDR pathogens to immediately inform the epidemiological surveillance staff of the health establishment so that prevention and control measures are enacted promptly.

In summary, the results at present are still not good, especially in elderly patients with a history of multiresistant GNB infection; however, the measures above, although simple, could save lives as well as avoid the spread of these MDR bacterial strains, which pose a high risk to society for the reduced spectrum of drugs that address these infections, which, in addition to being often inefficient, also present high levels of toxicity.

Given the problems of multi-drug resistant bacteria, fighting Gram-negative infections requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach. This can include family clinicians, infectious disease specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, some of whom will also be board-certified in infectious disease. All team members must keep accurate records of their interactions and interventions with these patients, so everyone on the interprofessional team can access the same updated patient data and make the appropriate decisions. Open communication lines between all members are also crucial so that each member can contact anyone from other disciplines to ensure the patient gets the best possible care. [Level 5]
