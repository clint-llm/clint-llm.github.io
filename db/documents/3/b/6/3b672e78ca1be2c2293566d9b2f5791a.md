The NOTCH3 gene mutation causes a vasculopathy predominantly affecting small cerebral vessels. The most common manifestations are migraines, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and lacunar infarcts, vascular dementia, and psychiatric diseases such as depression and apathy. The pathophysiology accounts for the clinical findings of lacunar infarcts, vascular dementia, and psychiatric disease. It is not clear how CADASIL accounts for migraine headaches.
