Dermoscopic findings show a homogeneous pale gray or bluish pattern, whitish cotton wool-like structures, linear vessels, and nonconstant focal brownish orange areas. The grayish color is probably due to the presence of sialomucin which induces an effect of diffraction as seen in Kaposi sarcoma. The whitish structures are due to a reflection of the connective tissue, and the brownish orange structures could be explicated by the presence of clear cells containing important amounts of glycogen. The dermoscopic sign of the peripheral linear vessels corresponds to the dilated vessels of the papillary dermis. The main interest in dermoscopy is to make sure the absence of dermoscopic features of a malignant tumor that may have a similar clinical presentation (mainly amelanotic melanoma and basal cell carcinoma).

While apocrine hidrocystomas can be suspected clinically, they can only be diagnosed histologically, with a tissue sample examined under a microscope.
