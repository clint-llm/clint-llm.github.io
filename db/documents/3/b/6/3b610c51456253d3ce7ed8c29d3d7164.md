Vancomycin was discovered in 1952 in soil obtained from the jungles of Borneo. Initial preparations of the antibiotic lacked purification and were brown. Therefore, many referred to vancomycin as "Mississippi mud." Clinicians initially thought VFS, otic, and renal toxicity were secondary to impurities in vancomycin. However, even after vancomycin was purified, VFS continued to be observed. Animal and several human studies indicate vancomycin activates the degranulation of mast cells and basophils increasing histamine release. The amount of histamine release has been correlated with the dose and the rate of vancomycin infusion. However, not all studies correlate elevated histamine levels with severe cases of VFS and suggest histamine metabolism may also be delayed due to inhibition of histamine N-methyltransferase and diamine oxidase enzymes.
