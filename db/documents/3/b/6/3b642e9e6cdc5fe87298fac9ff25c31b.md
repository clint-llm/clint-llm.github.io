The main goal of ankle splinting is to immobilize the ankle joint. There are a variety of reasons as to when ankle splinting would be appropriate; however, these also include the injuries to the entire distal leg and foot. In general, the ankle should be immobilized for fractures and dislocations. Ankle fractures include lateral malleolus, medial malleolus, posterior malleolus, any combination of malleoli fractures, and talus fractures. Dislocation of the tibiotalar joint is common with malleoli fractures, as the malleoli serve as bony restraints to keep the talus centered within the ankle mortise. In the setting of tibiotalar dislocation or subluxation following reduction, the splint serves to keep the tibiotalar joint reduced and prevent re-dislocation or persistent subluxation until definitive treatment.

**Indications for Ankle Splinting**

- Lateral malleolus fracture

- Medial malleolus fracture

- Posterior malleolus fracture

- Bimalleolar fracture

- Trimalleolar fracture

- Tibiotalar dislocation or subluxation

- Ankle fracture-dislocation
