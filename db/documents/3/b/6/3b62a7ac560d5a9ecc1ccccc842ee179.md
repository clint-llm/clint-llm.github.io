Fascia may appear passive structurally but are, in fact, active. They can provide support for surrounding tissues, help reduce friction, and play a supportive role for the tissues and organs. Fascia can transmit mechanical tension generated by muscular activity or external forces. The biomechanical regulatory system of the fascia is currently being studied further.

In a healthy state, fascia is a relaxed and wavy connective tissue that can lose its malleability when damaged via local trauma or inflammation. This can then cause fascial layers to tighten and restrict the movement of underlying tissues leading to pain, hindered range of motion, or decreased blood flow.

The distinct feature of fascia is that it possesses strength because itÂ is tightly packed with bundles of collagen and wrapped tightly. The fibers are usually oriented in one direction so that the structure does not become loose or lax. Fascia is quite flexible and able to resist tension. The function of the fascia depends on its location.
