The third cranial nerve is also known as oculomotor nerve and has two major components, the outer parasympathetic fibers that supply the ciliary muscles and the sphincter pupillae
Inner somatic fibers that supply the levator palpebrae superioris in the eyelid (which retracts the upper eyelid) and the four extraocular muscles (superior, middle, inferior recti, and inferior oblique). Third nerve palsy has a variety of etiologies and can be a harbinger of serious pathology. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of CN III palsy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various etiologies that can manifest with CN III palsy.
- Describe the examination and evaluation procedure for a patient that presents with third cranial nerve palsy.
- Summarize the treatment and management option for CN III palsy based on specific etiology.
- Explain strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cranial nerve III palsy.
