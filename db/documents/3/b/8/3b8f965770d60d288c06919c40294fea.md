**Death**

Rattlesnake envenomations resulted in 0 to 4 deaths from 1000 to 1300 exposures per year between 2000 to 2007.

**Prolonged Disability**

Patients suffering pit viper envenomation can have symptoms that persist for multiple weeks after their initial treatment. Symptom duration will vary by patient and by the severity of envenomation. Generally, patients can expect symptoms to last for at least 2 to 3 weeks. Pain, decreased function of an affected extremity, persistent edema, and lost time from work can last 2 to 4 weeks. Recurrent edema and pain may occur for 1 to 2 months after envenomation.

**Recurrent Symptoms**

Up to 5% of patients who are evaluated and treated for envenomations end up readmitted after discharge. Patients are typically readmitted due to worsening symptoms, including edema/erythema or signs of coagulopathy. Recurrent coagulopathy with bleeding affects less than 1% of victims. Even fewer victims, about 0.5%, develop medically significant late bleeding.
