The immune system responds variedly to different microorganisms often determined by the features of the microorganism. These are some different ways in which the immune system acts

**Immune Response to Bacteria**

Response often depends on the pathogenicity of the bacteria

- Neutralizing antibodies are synthesized if the bacterial pathogenicity is due to a toxin

- Opsonizing antibodies - produced as they are essential in destroying extracellular bacteria

- The complement system is activated especially by gram-negative bacterial lipid layers

- Phagocytes kill most bacteria utilizing positive chemotaxis, attachment, uptake and finally engulfing the bacteria

-  CD8+ T cells can kill cells infected by bacteria

**Immune Response to Fungi**

- The innate immunity to fungi includes defensins and phagocytes

-  CD4+ T helper cells are responsible for the adaptive immune response against fungi

- Dendritic cells secrete IL-12 after ingesting fungi, and IL-12 activates the synthesis of gamma interferon which activates the cell-mediated immunity

**Immune Response to Viruses**

- Interferon, NK cells, and phagocytes prevent the spread of viruses in the early stage

- Specific antibodies and complement proteins participate in viral neutralization and can limit spread and reinfection

- The adaptive immunity is of foremost importance in the protection against viruses - these include CD8+ T cells that kill them and CD4+ T cells as the dominant effector cell population in response to many virus infections

**Immune response to parasites**

- Parasitic infection stimulates various mechanisms of immunity due to their complex life cycle

- Both CD4+ and CD8+ Cells protect against parasites

- Macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and platelets can kill protozoa and worms by releasing reactive oxygen radicals and nitric oxide

- Increased eosinophil number and the stimulation of IgE by Th-2 CD4+ T cells are necessary for the killing of intestinal worms

- Inflammatory responses also combat parasitic infections

Despite Immune response(s) generated by intact and functional Immune system we still fall sick, and this is often due to evasive mechanisms employed by these microbes. Here are some of those.

**Strategies of Viruses to Evade the Immune System**

Antigenic variation: It is a mutation in proteins that are typically recognized by antibodies and lymphocytes. HIV continually mutates, thus making it difficult for either the immune system to protect against it and also hinders the development of a vaccine.

By disrupting 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity or by the production of soluble interferon receptors viruses disrupt the Interferon response.

By several mechanisms, Viruses affects the expression of MHC molecules.

A virus can infect immune cells: Normal T and B cells are also sites of virus persistence. HIV hides in CD4+T cells and EBV in B cells.

**Strategies of Bacteria to Evade the Immune System**

Intracellular pathogens may hide in cells: Bacteria can live inside metabolically damaged host leukocytes, and escaping from phagolysosomes (Shigella spp).

Other mechanisms:

- Production of toxins that inhibit the phagocytosis

- They are preventing killing by encapsulation

- The release of catalase inactivates hydrogen peroxide

- They infect cells and then cause impaired antigenic presentation

- The organism may kill the phagocyte by apoptosis or necrosis

**Strategies of Fungi to Evade the Immune System**

- Fungi produce a polysaccharide capsule, which inhibits the process of phagocytosis and overcoming opsonization, complement, and antibodies

- Some fungi inhibit the activities of host T cells from delaying cell-mediated killing

- Other organisms (e.g., Histoplasma
capsulatum) evade macrophage killing by entering the cells via CR3 and them escape from phagosome formation

**Strategies of Parasites to Evade the Immune System**

- Parasites can resist destruction by complement

- Intracellular parasites can avoid being killed by lysosomal enzymes and oxygen metabolites

- Parasites disguise themselves as a protection mechanism

- Antigenic variation (e.g., African trypanosome) is an essential mechanism to evade the immune system

- Parasites release molecules that interfere with immune system normal function
