Plain abdominal films are usually the first diagnostic imaging obtained. Eliciting the difference between an ileusÂ and a mechanical obstruction, especially if it is only a partial obstruction, can be difficult but is an important distinction to make. Supine and upright films may reveal dilated small bowel loops but should also show air in the colon and rectum without a transition point. If the plain film is vague, a computed tomography(CT) scan of the abdomen should be obtained. The abdominopelvic CT scan is most useful using oral and intravenous contrast not only to help delineate a potential transition point but also to rule out other intra-abdominal pathology, including a tumor or an abscess.

Laboratory evaluation should be ordered to help identify any potentially reversible causes of an ileus, such as hypokalemia or signs of infection. A complete blood count should look for anemia to rule out bleeding or an elevated white count, as may be seen with an abscess, infection, or intestinal ischemia. The electrolyte panel should look for electrolyte abnormalities and replace them as needed.
