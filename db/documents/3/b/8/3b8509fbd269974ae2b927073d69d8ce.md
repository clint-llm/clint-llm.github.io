The monitoring of platelet quantity and function is frequently useful in evaluating the bleeding risk in hospitalized patients.Â In healthy patients, platelets are incredibly numerous, with a range of 150 to 350 x10/L. A drop in this number can indicate the consumption of platelets by a condition such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, or autoimmune destruction of platelets, as in immune thrombocytopenia.

Clinicians can monitor the function of platelets by evaluating the bleeding time, which evaluates the time between breaking the vasculature and the formation of an effective platelet plug. This time may be elevated in conditions like uremia, in which platelet count is normal but demonstrates impaired function.
