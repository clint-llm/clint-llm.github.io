In preparation for surgery, the patient will need several tests performed in addition to the coronary angiography that diagnosed the coronary artery disease. They will need laboratory tests completed such as complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panels including liver function tests, coagulation panels, and hemoglobin A1c. Other tests may be required including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound, chest x-ray, and possibly a CT chest or vein mapping of the lower extremities.

Preoperative medications such as beta-blockers are most often continued throughout the perioperative period to prevent arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Aspirin was previously withheld 5 to 7 days before surgery, but recently, it has been recommended to be started or continued preoperatively.

On admission to the hospital, the patient will have intravenous access started, and their medications and preoperative tests will be reviewed. The surgical sites will be trimmed of hair, and the patient will be given a chlorhexidine bath.
