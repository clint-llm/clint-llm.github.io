The anterior pituitary, also known as adenohypophysis, is one of the two lobes of the pituitary gland located in the sella turcica and controlled by the hypothalamus. The anterior pituitary secretes a number of peptide and glycoprotein hormones that regulate various cellular processes including growth, metabolism, reproduction, and response to stress or trauma. By acting directly on their respective target cells or by stimulating other endocrine organs to release hormones, anterior pituitary regulates various aspects of body function. It is important to emphasize that the majority are produced in a pulsatile fashion and dependant on the releasing hormone generators.
