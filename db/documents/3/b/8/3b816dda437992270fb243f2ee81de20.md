The pars nervosaÂ originates from neuroectoderm similarly to the rest of the hypothalamus; this is in contrast to the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland, which originate from migratory oral ectoderm called the Rathke pouch. Between weeks four and eight of fetal development, a region of the ventral diencephalon projects downwards to meet the superiorly migrating involution of oral ectoderm, forming the neuro- and adenohypophysis respectively.
