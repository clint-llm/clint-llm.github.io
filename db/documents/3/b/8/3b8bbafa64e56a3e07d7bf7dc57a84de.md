Anesthetic gases (nitrous oxide, halothane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane), also known as inhaled anesthetics, are administered as primary therapy for preoperative sedation and adjunctive anesthesia maintenance to intravenous (IV) anesthetic agents (i.e., midazolam, propofol) in the perioperative setting.

Though indicated solely for the perioperative setting, these agents also have a significant off-label use within critical care to facilitate patient tolerance of endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and bedside procedures. Generally, for these cases, the recommended use of IV benzodiazepines (midazolam, lorazepam, diazepam) or propofol induces this level of sedation.

**FDA-label Indications**

- Preoperative sedation – primary or adjunctive; rapid induction of sedation, providing amnesia and anesthesia during surgical procedures.

- Perioperative sedation maintenance – adjunctive; maintains anesthesia after sedation by IV benzodiazepines or propofol.

**FDA-off-label Indications**

- ICU sedation – primary or adjunctive; facilitates tolerance of intubation, mechanical ventilation, bedside procedures.
