Pancreatectomy is a term for surgical removal of all or part of the pancreas. There is a multitude of surgical techniques for both benign and malignant processes of the pancreas, including different types of surgical excision. A surgeon must not only understand precise surgical techniques but also have a good comprehension of pancreatic anatomy, preoperative diagnostic modalities, and postoperative management.

Pancreatic surgery has advanced tremendously over the course of history. However, it continues to be technically challenging while also requiring significant experience and excellent clinical judgment from the surgeon. Anatomy, physiology, indications, contraindications, evaluation, and surgical techniques for multiple different types of pancreatic resections will be discussed here. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) will have a dedicated discussion regarding unique surgical techniques, challenges, and management elsewhere.
