The rectus sheath extends from the inferior costal margin and the costal cartilages of ribs 5 to 7 to the pubic crest. The composition of the anterior and posterior rectus sheath will differ according to its position superior or inferior to the arcuate line. The arcuate line is an area of demarcation visible from the peritoneal surface of the abdominal wall, residing one-third the distance between the umbilicus and the pubis. The arcuate line can be a sharp demarcation, or it can be a gradual transition zone where the fibers of the posterior sheath gradually disappear.

Superior to the arcuate line, the fascia of the external oblique and half of the internal oblique pass anterior to the rectus abdominis muscle and make up the anterior rectus sheath. The other half of the internal oblique fascia, the transversus abdominis fascia, and the transversalis fascia make up the posterior rectus sheath superior to the arcuate line. Extending inferiorly from the arcuate line, the anterior rectus sheath is comprised of all three fascial layers of the lateral abdominal wall musculature, leaving only transversalis fascia covering the posterior aspect of the rectus abdominis muscle and pyramidalis muscle.
