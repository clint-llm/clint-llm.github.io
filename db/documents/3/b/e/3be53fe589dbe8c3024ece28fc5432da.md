Patients usually go home on the day of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. Early ambulation and walking are essential to promote healing and prevent complications. Opioids may be needed initially for pain control but should slowly shift to NSAIDs about a week postoperatively. Patients may experience some difficulty swallowing that usually resolves over time. Recovery time can vary based on the initial presentation of the syndrome.

The recovery phase of rehabilitation is focused on soft-tissue overload and biomechanical dysfunction. The intent is to limit pain, normalize spinal mechanics, and improve neuromuscular control of the cervical spine. Therapists will work to restore resting muscle length and to safely progress to the full range of motion of the cervical spine with limited pain. Exercises start simple and in a single plane and advance to involve complex muscle patterns. The maintenance phase of rehabilitation requires the patient has a full cervical range of motion with proper spinal biomechanics and stabilization. Patients will transition to functional training exercises for sport or work-specific activities and progressive weight training as tolerated.
