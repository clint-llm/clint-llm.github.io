The management of patients with carotid artery stenosis is with an interprofessional team that consists of a nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, vascular surgeon, interventional radiologist, and neurologist. When a patient is discovered to have carotid stenosis, a referral should be made to the neurologist, who can determine if treatment is required. Carotid stenosis can be managed via surgery or stenting; both have similar outcomes in the short term. The treatment also dramatically reduces the risk of a future stroke.
