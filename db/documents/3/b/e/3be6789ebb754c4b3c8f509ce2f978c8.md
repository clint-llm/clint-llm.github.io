Abulia, also known as apathy, psychic akinesia, and athymia, refers to a lack of will, drive, or initiative for action, speech and thought, and is felt to be related to dysfunctions with the brain's dopamine-dependent circuitry. Treatment depends on etiology but often is geared toward increasing dopamine levels. Interprofessional team members should be familiar with the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of abulia. It can have several different etiologies, many of which require further evaluation and treatment. This activity outlines the presentation, evaluation, and management of abulia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in improving outcomes for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiologic factors associated with the development of abulia. 
- Summarize the typical signs and symptoms of abulia.
- Describe important treatment considerations and psychosocial considerations in managing this condition.
- Outline strategies for the interprofessional care team to employ for optimal management and counseling to patients with abulia.
