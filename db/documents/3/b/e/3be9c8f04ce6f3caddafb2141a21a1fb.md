As is with the entire nonunion disease process, treatment requires a multifaceted approach.

**Initial non-operative Treatment**

- Use of a fracture brace for an extended period of time postoperatively or immobilization in a cast

- Pulsed low-intensity ultrasound or other external bone stimulation

**Operative Treatment**

Treatment is tailored via the classification of nonunion. It is important to understand that multiple surgical techniques exist and that it is critical to utilize multiple techniques tailored to the patient's specific needs.

- Hypertrophic nonunion: the goal is to improve mechanical stability with internal fixation

- Compression plates
- Exchange nailing
- Augmented plating with ORIF
- Dynamization of nail (should not be used in the humerus because dynamization cannot work in a non-weight bearing limb

- Atrophic nonunion: the goal is to fix the biology and mechanical stabilityÂ 

- Internal fixation with biologic stimulation

- Biologic stimulation with bone graft
- Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP):

- Use of BMP-7 is FDA approved for tibial nonunions
- BMP-2 is FDA approved for 1 level degenerative disk disease in spinal fusion


- Autologous iliac crest bone graft
- Intramedullary reaming, irrigation, and debris aspiration (RIA)
- Demineralized bone matrix (DBM)
- Systemic parathyroid hormone (PTH) therapy, teriparatide

- Oligotrophic nonunion: Use a combination of both internal fixation and biologic stimulation depending on the clinical situation

- Infected nonunion: Must obtain WBC, ESR, CRP, and nuclear bone scan. Intraoperative cultures are the gold standard for guided antibiotic therapy

- A 2-staged surgical treatment protocol is the gold standard

- 1st stage - removal of loose or chronic infected hardware, debridement, and revision fixation of nonunion, and treatment of infection with culture-specific local and systemic antibiotics

- Modalities used for initial fixation in case of infection

- Antibiotic beads
- Antibiotic nails
- Antibiotic cement spacers
- Masquelet technique
- External fixation
- Soft tissue coverage with a flap




- 2nd stage

- Begins after a period of antibiotic therapy when both serologic and clinical signs of infection are absent
- Definitive fixation proceeds with internal fixation and bone grafting, other biological treatment, bone transport, depending on specific fracture characteristics.
