The cerebral venous veins are typically less surgically relevant than their arterial counterparts. Although there are some rare medical emergencies, one of which is cavernous sinus syndrome, which involves the cerebral veins and at times, surgical intervention may be necessary. The cavernous sinus is a difficult cavity to approach, and numerous surgical routes merit consideration when deciding how to enter the cavity. The routes of access available for consideration are comprised of two general approaches, the extradural and intradural routes.

**Extradural Routes**

The three extradural routes are the anterolateral, medial, and inferior. The anterolateral extradural approach is used to enter the floor of the cavity to approach the optic canal. The medial extradural approach is used to approach the contralateral side of the sinus and the pineal gland. The inferior extradural approach accesses the internal carotid artery within the sinus.

**Intradural Routes**

Among the intradural approach, there are two different routes to gain access; the superior and the lateral. The superior approach has a strategic vantage point of the anterior portion of the internal carotid artery. The lateral approach can examine a majority of the internal carotid artery within the sinus.
