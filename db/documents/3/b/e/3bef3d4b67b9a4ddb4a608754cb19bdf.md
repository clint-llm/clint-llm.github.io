**BIS Monitoring and Principle**

The bispectral index monitor processes electroencephalographic signals to obtain a value, which reflects the level of consciousness of the patient. The bispectral index (BIS) monitor collects raw EEG data through its sensors and uses an algorithm to analyze and interpret the data. The data displays as a number on the BIS view monitor. BIS values range from 0 to 100. A value of 0 represents the absence of brain activity, and 100 represents the awake state. BIS values between 40 to 60 represent adequate general anesthesia for a surgery, values less than 40 represent a deep hypnotic state. BIS value is usually maintained between 40 to 60 to prevent awareness under anesthesia.
