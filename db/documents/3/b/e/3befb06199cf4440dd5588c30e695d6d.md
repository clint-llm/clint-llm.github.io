- Idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus

- The main differential diagnosis of DIL is idiopathic SLE. There is a significant overlap in clinical features and autoantibodies in both these diseases. As mentioned above, severe manifestations such as renal or neurological involvement, vasculitis, and severe hematological involvement are rare in DIL, and when present, shall raise high suspicion for SLE.

- Idiopathic subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus

- Idiopathic SCLE is in the differential diagnosis of drug-induced SCLE. Widespread distribution of the rash, and resolution of rash after discontinuation of the drug is consistent with drug-induced SCLE rather than idiopathic SCLE.

In patients on anti-TNF agents presenting with fever, rash, and arthralgia, infections shall be ruled out first due to the immunocompromised state of these patients.
