Different articles have previously described the causes of this condition, but recent review articles have classified the etiology broadly into:

**A-Intracardiac Shunts**

Patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD), and atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) were listed as the most frequent etiologies.

**B-Extra-Cardiac Causes**

B-Extra-cardiac causes mainly include intrapulmonary shunts and extra-pulmonary shunts. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM), lung parenchymal diseases, and hepato-pulmonary syndrome are examples of pulmonary causes. A few articles described other causes of this condition such as fat embolism, Parkinson's disease, among others, but the precise mechanism of those etiologies leading to platypnea remained controversial and elusive.
