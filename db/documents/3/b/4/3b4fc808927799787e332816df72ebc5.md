The management of neonates born with omphalocele consists of the initial steps of airway stabilization, sterile wrapping of the bowel to preserve heat to reduce insensible fluid loss, insertion of an orogastric tube for bowel decompression, and the establishment of peripheral intravenous access. In case of vascular compromise suggested by tachycardia, low blood pressure, or a dusky bowel appearance, the patient should be positioned left side down right side up.

Providers have to avoid placing dressings that are excessively wet or circumferential as they may macerate the omphalocele and compromise blood flow.

After the initial steps, the subsequent management involves the administration of intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

If aÂ patient has a small omphalocele, surgical repair is an option within the first 72 hours of life via primary closure of the skin and fascia. Patients with other defects benefit from delayed closure after a silo is put in place in the first 24 hours of life. The silo is then progressively reduced over 3 to 7 days before the final closure of the defect.

Closure of giant omphaloceles is a major undertaking, especially if it contains the liver. A patch is often used to close large wound defects.

Infants with omphalocele do tolerate oral feedings soon after the closure. Topical antibiotics are usually applied to the omphalocele until complete healing occurs.
