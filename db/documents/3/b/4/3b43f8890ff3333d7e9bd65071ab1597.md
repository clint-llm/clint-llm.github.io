For administration of both CAR-T cell treatments, it is of great importance to confirm the patientâ€™s identity with the patient identifiers on the infusion bag as they are all only for autologous use. Leuodepleting filter cannot be used, and central venous access is the recommended method for infusion. Interleukin-6 antagonists (i.e., tocilizumab or siltuximab), corticosteroids and emergent equipment are needed before infusion and during the recovery period in case of side effects.
