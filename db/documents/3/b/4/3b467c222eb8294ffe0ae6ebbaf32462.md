Viral illness or another infectious disease can cause a person to develop a fever, raising the core temperature above 37 degrees Celsius. Fever is a result of the body releasing pyrogens such as cytokines, prostaglandins, and thromboxane. These pyrogens induce cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) to convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 binds to receptors in the hypothalamus, increasing the thermogenic set point. This elevated temperature set point results in the body working to achieve a higher internal temperature.
