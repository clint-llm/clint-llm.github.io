Non-tunneled CVCs are typically used for urgent/emergent access, whether that is for hemodialysis or resuscitation. The preferred insertion site, in the setting for acute kidney injury, is the right IJ, followed by the femoral vein. However, if the patient is obese, the left IJ is generally preferred over the femoral vein as it decreases the risk of CLABSI.

Tunneled CVCs are commonly used for hemodialysis (HD) access. While an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred access for HD, tunneled catheters may be used in those requiring HD for at least three weeks while awaiting maturation of an AVF, while planning peritoneal dialysis, when awaiting a living donor transplant, or when no other access is possible. Several dual-lumen, large-diameter catheters are available.

Tunneled CVCs with subcutaneous ports are used for those patients requiring chronic, intermittent intravenous therapies; this includes cancer patients and those requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. When used appropriately, these ports fulfill their requirements with low rates of infectionÂ (0.1 bloodstream infections/1000 catheter days). With the routine use of ultrasound and fluoroscopy, the short-term complications of composition, hematoma formation, and pneumothorax are minimal.
