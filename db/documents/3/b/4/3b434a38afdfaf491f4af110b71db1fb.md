Signs and symptoms vary according to the different subtypes:

- Type I tumors are revealed by respiratory distress due to air-filled cysts compressing on airways with or without pneumothorax.

- Types II and III tumors are revealed by dyspnea and chest pain. These children may present with signs of pneumonia or other generalized symptoms such as cough, fever, difficulty breathing, fatigue, loss of energy and decreased appetite.

Asymptomatic lesions revealed by a chest wall deformity or a tension pneumothorax have also been reported.
