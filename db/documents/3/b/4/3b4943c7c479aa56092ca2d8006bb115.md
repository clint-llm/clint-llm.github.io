Migraines affect around 12% of the general population and are more frequent in women than men. Peak migraine prevalence in women occurs between the early 30s to early 40s, and menstrual-related headaches are very common in the perimenopausal period, likely due to marked fluctuations in estrogen levels. Up to 41% of all women will have experienced a migraine episode by their early 50s.
