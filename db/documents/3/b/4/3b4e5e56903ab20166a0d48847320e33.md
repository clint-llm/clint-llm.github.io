Laryngomalacia ranks as the most prevalent cause of stridor in an infant. It is crucial to make the diagnosis in early infancy as it may affect multiple aspects of growth and development. Stridor and noisy breathing are important symptoms to recognize as they may indicate varying degrees of respiratory compromise. Thorough upper airway evaluation is necessary for children suspected of laryngomalacia for accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of the condition and any underlying comorbidities. Successful management requires the coordination of multiple specialties. This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of laryngomalacia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of laryngomalacia.
- Review the evaluation of laryngomalacia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for laryngomalacia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication amongst interprofessional team members to enhance the care of laryngomalacia and improve outcomes.
