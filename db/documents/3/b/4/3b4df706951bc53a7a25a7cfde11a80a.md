If adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is suspected, multidetector computed tomography, MDCT, is the best imaging modality to diagnose and evaluate the extent of disease, including perivascular extension and distant metastasis. MDCT is 77% accurate in predicting resectability and 93% accurate in predicting unresectability.

Multidetector CT protocol for pancreatic imaging utilizes a multiphase imaging technique, including a late arterial phase and a portal venous phase after administration of intravenous contrast material.  The late arterial or pancreatic phase is acquired at 35 to 50 seconds after the injection and allows optimum evaluation of the pancreatic parenchyma. The portal venous phase is acquired at 60 to 90 seconds after the injection of intravenous (IV) contrast and allows for optimum assessment of the venous anatomy and is best for the detection of hepatic and distant metastatic disease. Water can be used as oral contrast. Barium-based oral contrast is generally not used, as it will interfere with the evaluation of vascular anatomy and encasement. Multiplanar reformatted images in the coronal and sagittal plane, maximum intensity projection images, and volume-rendered images are helpful to delineate vascular encasement and narrowing better.

PET CT scan can be useful in detecting distant metastatic disease.

Abdominal MRI /MRCP with IV contrast is as good in the preoperative evaluation of pancreatic cancer and the assessment of vascular invasion. MRI is more sensitive to detect metastatic hepatic disease with a sensitivity approaching 100% compared with 80% for CT. MRI also employs a standard multiphase post-contrast imaging protocol. There is a small subset of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which will provide the same attenuation on CT scan so that it will be more conspicuous on MRI. If pancreatic cancer is highly suspected and the CT scan is negative, that would be an indication to order further imaging with MRI of the abdomen with IV contrast. The downside to MRI is that if the patient cannot follow breathing instructions or has difficulty holding their breath, the images will be of poor quality.  CT images are much faster to obtain and do not require significant breath-hold ability.

Ultrasound is of limited value in pancreatic imaging. Often the pancreas will be poorly visualized sonographically secondary to bowel gas.  Ultrasound can detect the secondary biliary ductal dilatation associated with pancreatic head cancer, but it is not helpful in visualizing the pancreatic mass itself.

ERCP with endoscopic ultrasound can be performed, and fine-needle aspiration biopsies can be done of suspicious lesions for the pathologic specimen. However, with a mass in the pancreas, biopsy confirmation is not necessary, and one can proceed directly to excision given that a full workup has been performed.

Endoscopic ultrasound, a test performed by gastroenterologists, can delineate the pancreatic mass and can be used to biopsy the mass under ultrasound guidance.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a test in which a contrast dye is injected into the biliary ducts and pancreatic duct with an endoscope. The level of biliary or pancreatic obstruction can be delineated. In some case, the placement of a biliary stent can help relieve symptoms of jaundice.

Two important definitions in the evaluation steps of pancreatic cancer are borderline and unresectable tumors. Generally, pancreatic cancers are categorized as resectable or non-resectable tumors according to the vascular involvements and evidence of distant metastasis. Metastatic disease in the liver, peritoneum, omentum, extra-regional lymph nodes, are considered unresectable. The presence of vascular involvement (greater than 180 degrees of the superior mesenteric artery, and celiac artery) also categorizes the patients in the unresectable group. However, in the case of superior-mesenteric vein involvement, the potential options for reconstruction should be evaluated carefully. Collectively, according to the published consensus by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the following characteristics in the pancreatic head and uncinate process are indicators of unresectability; 1. greater than 180 degrees involvement of SMA, and or celiac axis, 2. presence of solid tumor contact with the first jejunal SMA branch, 3. SMV or portal vein involvement that is not amenable for reconstruction, and 4. evidence of contact with the most proximal draining jejunal branch into the SMV. The presence of the following features would categorize the pancreatic body and tail lesions; 1. greater than 180 degrees involvement of SMA, and or celiac axis, 2. aortic involvement, 3. SMV or portal vein involvement that is not amenable for reconstruction. Borderline pancreatic tumors include tumors with short-segment occlusion of the SMV or SMV-portal vein confluence or hepatic artery.
