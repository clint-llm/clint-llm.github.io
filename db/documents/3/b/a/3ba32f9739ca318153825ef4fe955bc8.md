Suspicion for spondylotic myelopathy should prompt MR imaging evaluation. CT myelography is an alternative option and can provide a quantitative assessment of spinal canal narrowing, in addition to improved detail of bony structures and soft tissue calcification. MRI provides better detail of spinal cord pathology, is less invasive, and therefore preferred in patients presenting with suspected acute myelopathy.

Gadolinium contrast-enhanced MR imaging is the gold standard for diagnosis of MSCC (sensitivity 93%, specificity 97%), and imaging of the entire spine is advised in the evaluation of this condition.

Laboratory evaluation, although not always helpful, is a routine part of the diagnostic work-up for patients with suspected SEA. The absence of leukocytosis does not reliably rule out SEA; one study showed an elevated WBC count in only two-thirds of patients with SEA.

MRI with gadolinium contrast enhancement is the gold standard imaging study for evaluation of SEA. Imaging of the full spine for skip lesions should be considered. In a retrospective study of 233 adult patients with SEA, 22 (9%) had two or more fluid collections in two separate anatomic regions. The authors formulated a prediction algorithm with risk factors for skip lesions, including the following: symptoms for seven or more days, ESR >95 mm/h, and concomitant infection outside of the spine.
