TREX1, which stands for three prime repair exonuclease 1,  was initially described in 1969 as DNase III and further characterized in 1999 in biochemical assays from rabbit liver and calf thymus and is considered the most abundant mammalian DNA-specific  3′ to 5′ exonuclease.

TREX1 plays an important role in genomic DNA degradation, cell death processes, and gap-filling during DNA repair or proofreading during lagging-strand DNA synthesis.

In a subsequent development, mutations in TREX1 were described in patients with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS)
