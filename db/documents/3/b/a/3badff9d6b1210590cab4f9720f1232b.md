A high index of suspicion for serious etiologies in children with an antalgic gait, combined with a thorough history and physical examination, will help improve outcomes in children. Protocols guiding laboratory investigation, imaging, and treatment are very useful in maximizing good outcomes. The approach to diagnosis and treatment requires a team effort involving clinicians, therapists, nurses, and sometimes pharmacists. Outcomes are improved when there is coordination of this interprofessional team.
