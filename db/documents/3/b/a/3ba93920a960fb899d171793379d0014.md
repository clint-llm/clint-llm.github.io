Sialolithiasis is a benign condition involving the formation of stones within the ducts of the major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. It is the most frequent cause of salivary gland swelling, with a reported incidence of 1 in 10000 to 1 in 30000.

In the case of larger salivary stones involving the distal submandibular duct (Wharton’s duct), diagnosis is often possible based on physical examination. Cases involving smaller stones within the distal submandibular duct or parotid duct (Stenson’s duct) were historically diagnosed utilizing conventional radiography, sialography, and digital subtraction sialography. Modern diagnostic techniques involve point-of-care ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and direct visualization with sialoendoscopy.
