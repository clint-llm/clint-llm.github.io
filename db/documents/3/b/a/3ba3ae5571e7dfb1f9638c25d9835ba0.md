Strategies to improve the quality of head and neck cancer care doÂ exist.

The most important aspects of success involve interprofessional care of the patient. Nurses provide coordination of care, managing documentation, and follow-ups and reporting when untoward complications occur to the clinical team. The clinical team, assisted by the nursing staff, must make sure protocols are followed to avoid infections, hydration issues, and calorie intake. Interprofessional cooperation will assist in making sure patients obtain the best outcomes. Modern care of the cancer patient is by definition, multi-disciplinary. Tumor Boards, where all subspecialties and allied health practitioners meet to discuss and plan treatment for new cancer diagnoses are now the norm and the expectation.
