When there is suspicion of a chest wall recurrence, a biopsy of the lesion should first be done to confirm the histology. The ER/PR and HER2 status should be repeated for the recurrent tumor as there may be discordance between the primary and recurrent tumors, likely related to changes in the biology of the disease, tumor heterogeneity, divergent clonal subsets due to differential treatment effects, sampling errors or limited accuracy and reproducibility of assays
