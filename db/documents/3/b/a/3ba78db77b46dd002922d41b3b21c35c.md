Tear break-up time (TBUT) is a measurement used to assess the stability of the tear film, conducted under slit-lamp examination after instilling fluorescein. A decreased TBUT (defined as <10 seconds) is considered abnormal and often seen in evaporative dry eye disease.

Tear osmolarity can be used as an indicator for tear film stability. Osmolarity ranges between 300 to 310 mOsm/kg in normal eyes and can reach 360 mOsm/kg in dry eye disease.

Ocular surface staining with fluorescein, lissamine green, and rose bengal can be used to visualize defects in the corneal surface and degenerated and dead cells. The volume of tears can be evaluated using Schirmer’s test, which measures tear production over time. In Schirmer’s test, a strip is placed inside the lower eyelid, and the amount of wetting from tears is measured. Examination of the tear meniscus is another method to assess the tear volume. Measurement of inflammatory biomarkers (such as matrix metalloproteinases, lysozyme, and lactoferrin) can assess the degree of ocular inflammation and abnormalities in the tear film.
