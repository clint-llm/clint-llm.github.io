Insulin glargine is a synthetic version of human insulin that is FDA approved to treat adults and children with type 1 diabetes and adults with type 2 diabetes to improve and maintain glycemic control. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin injected once daily and provided a basal insulin level throughout the day. Regimens often combine it with rapid-acting insulin to obtain optimal glycemic control. The insulin should not be used to treat diabetic ketoacidosis, as short-acting insulin is preferred. This activity will cover the indications, mechanism of action, adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of insulin glargine pertinent for healthcare professionals.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of insulin glargine. 
- Describe the contraindications of insulin glargine. 
- Review the appropriate monitoring for insulin glargine. 
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance treatment with insulin glargine and improve outcomes.
