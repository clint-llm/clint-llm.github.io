There are several staging systems for multiple myeloma. The two main systems used today are the Durie-Salmon Staging System and the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS).

For many years, the Durie-Salmon staging system was the standard for risk stratification. It is based on the tumor cell mass, hemoglobin, calcium, IgA and IgG levels, urine monoclonal protein levels, and the extent of bone damage on X-rays. It divides patients into three stages (I, II, and III) and sub-classifies them further into groups A and B according to serum creatinine level.

- Stage 1: B2M less than 3.5 mg/L, albumin greater than or equal to 3.5 g/dL, normal LDH, and standard-risk cytogenetics

- Stage 2: Neither stage 1 nor stage 3

- Stage 3: B2M greater than 5.5 mg/L and high-risk cytogenetics [del(17p), and/or t(4:14), and/or t(14,16)] or elevated LDH
