The initial treatment approach for nickel toxicity involves decontamination and removal from the exposed environment. This includes removing contaminated clothing, jewelry, and any visible skin contaminants. Symptomatic relief is a crucial aspect of management, which may involve using bronchodilators, supplemental oxygen, and steroids. These interventions aim to alleviate symptoms and support respiratory function. Prompt and appropriate management is essential to mitigate the adverse effects of nickel toxicity and improve patient outcomes.

In cases of elevated urine nickel concentrations, diuresis can be considered a treatment option to reduce the half-life of nickel in the serum. A case analysis involving patients who ingested nickel and had initial urine concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/L showed that diuresis was employed as part of their treatment.

While current literature does not support the use of chelation therapy in nickel toxicity, there have been suggestions, and case reports exploring its potential. In acute nickel carbonyl poisoning cases, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) has been considered an antidote. For critically ill patients, DDC can be administered parenterally at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg IV and should be initiated early in the course of poisoning. In cases where urine nickel levels are equal to or greater than 10 mg/dL, oral dosing of DDC at 1 g can be considered. However, it is essential to note that further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of chelation therapy in nickel toxicity.

When DDC availability is limited, contacting local poison control can guide alternative treatment options. One such option is the use of disulfiram, which can be considered if DDC is not available. Disulfiram is metabolized in the body to form two molecules of DDC. It is important to note that data on chelation therapy for nickel toxicity is limited, and further research is needed to establish its effectiveness and safety.

In a separate case report, a patient developed delayed pneumonitis following exposure to nickel carbonyl. The patient showed a positive response to treatment with disulfiram. It is important to note that this is an isolated case, and further research is needed to establish the efficacy and safety of disulfiram in treating nickel carbonyl-induced pneumonitis.

The treatment of nickel dermatitis focuses on symptom management. In addition to avoiding nickel-containing objects, topical corticosteroids and moisturizers/emollients can be utilized. These topical agents help alleviate inflammation and soothe the skin. Implementing preventive measures such as using protective creams, gloves, and other protective equipment can act as a barrier to reduce exposure to nickel and prevent the onset or exacerbation of dermatitis.
