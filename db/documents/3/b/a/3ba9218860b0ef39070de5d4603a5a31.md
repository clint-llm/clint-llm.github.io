Lurasidone takes 1 to 3 hours to reach the maximum concentration after an oral dose of 40 mg. It reaches a steady-state concentration within seven days of dosing, and after absorption, lurasidone is mostly bound to plasma proteins, albumin, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.

Lurasidone is mostly excreted in feces approximating 80%, 9.2% in urine, and the remaining 10.7% is unknown. Dose monitoring is necessary for patients with renal and hepatic impairments. Dose adjustment is not recommended for mild impairment but rather for moderate and severe impairment.

The FDA has warned against lurasidone use with strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors; close monitoring is necessary when used with mild inhibitors and inducers. As CYP1A2 does not metabolize lurasidone, smoking does not affect lurasidoneâ€™s pharmacokinetics.

Lurasidone does not increase suicidal ideation or behavior.
