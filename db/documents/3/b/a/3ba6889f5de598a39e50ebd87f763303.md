A variety of proposed etiologies have led to the characterization of specific postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome subtypes as described below, with a general consensus of excessive tachycardia in the setting of cardiovascular deconditioning as the final common pathway.

**Neuropathic**

Neuropathic postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is a length-dependent autonomic neuropathy characterized by predominantly lower limb sympathetic denervation leading to reduced venoconstriction and venous pooling.

**Hyperadrenergic**

An estimated 30 to 60% of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome patients fall under the hyperadrenergic subtype, characterized by elevated standing plasma norepinephrine levels of greater than or equal to 600 pg/mL with predominant symptoms of increased sympathetic tone including palpitations, tremors, hypertension, anxiety, and tachycardia.

**Hypovolemic**

Up to 70% of patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome exhibit decreased plasma, red blood cell, and total blood volumes, although the degree of hypovolemia varies between studies.

**Autoimmune**

An autoimmunity hypothesis is one proposal for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome given the significant overlapping commonalities (female predominance, post-viral onset, elevated autoimmune markers) seen in other systemic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Sjogrenâ€™s syndrome.

**Deconditioning**

Physical and cardiovascular deconditioning is often evident in patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, although its presence as either a cause or effect is unclear.
