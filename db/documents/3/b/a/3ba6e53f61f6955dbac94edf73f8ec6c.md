Complications of pulmonary barotrauma due to lung overexpansion while surfacing from SCUBA diving include pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, and air gas embolism. Cerebral air gas embolism is the most devastating and feared complication.

Aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, pleural effusions, empyema, pyopneumothorax, scarring, fibrosis, and decreased lung function have been documented in patients after pulmonary barotrauma injuries.
