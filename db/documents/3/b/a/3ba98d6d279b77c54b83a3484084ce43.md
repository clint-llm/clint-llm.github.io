Symptoms commonly encountered in palliative care may include dyspnea, air hunger, constipation, uncontrolled bleeding, excessive respiratory tract secretions, delirium, depression, insomnia, refractory nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, and uncontrolled pain require continuous and frequent reassessments as patients transition to comfort-focused care near the end of life. Management of these symptoms will always involve nonpharmacologic therapy in addition to pharmacotherapy, yet knowledge of significant DDI, interpatient variability and drug-nutrient interactions by interprofessional team members is critical for safe and effective care. Existing literature encourages the utilization of mobile and online equianalgesic tables, opioid rotation guidelines, drug interaction checker apps, and clinical decision support (CDS) alerts in electronic medical record systems as they have all been critical in decreasing DDIs and potential adverse drug reactions.

This is where a pharmacist consult is necessary, so a thorough medication reconciliation can take place, looking for interactions, verifying dosing, and communicating with the prescriber as well as the palliative care nursing staff, so that all members of the interprofessional team are on the same page. Advance care planning should be discussed early in the disease process to understand individual patient preferences, needs, and values and to ensure the designation of a surrogate decision-maker. Only through an interprofessional team model involving clinicians, nursing, pharmacy, nursing assistants, other palliative care providers, as well as the patient and their family caregivers, can DDI in palliative cases be avoided.

Patients facing serious illness with complex symptom management value medication-specific optimization conversations and medication reviews by members of the interprofessional palliative team. Comprehensive palliative care assessment and goal setting through shared decision-making must align treatment plans with patientsâ€™ known goals and values and ensure transparency due to the delicate nature of this particular healthcare setting.
