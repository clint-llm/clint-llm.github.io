The pituitary gland is a well-vascularized tissue, and its blood supply connects with the hypothalamus via the hypothalamohypophyseal portal system.

The superior hypophyseal artery supplies the anterior lobe. It originates from the internal carotid artery or the posterior communicating artery. Together these two arteries from the primary plexus and supply blood to the median eminence. The hypothalamic cells end at the median eminence. The primary plexuses receive regulatory factors. The capillaries form venules that lead to the formation of portal hypophyseal veins. Secondary plexuses drain into the cavernous sinus. The intermediate lobe receives its blood supply from the anastomoses between the anterior and posterior lobe capillaries. Small branches from the superior hypophyseal artery supply the pituitary stalk and parts of the optic nerve and chiasm.

The inferior hypophyseal artery supplies the posterior lobe primarily the pars nervosa, and it originates from the meningohypophyseal trunk, which is a branch of the internal carotid artery. The posterior lobe drains into the cavernous sinus.
