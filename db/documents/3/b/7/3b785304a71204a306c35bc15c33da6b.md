The first step in management is to treat the underlying condition. Corticosteroids are beneficial for inflammation (sarcoidosis) and thyroid disease CON. For these conditions, withdrawal of the steroid treatment can cause acute deterioration of vision. Surgical orbital decompression can help CON caused by thyroid ophthalmoplegia.

In traumatic cases, conservative treatment is appropriate in patients with mild deficits as spontaneous improvement is possible. Steroids have no benefit for trauma. Surgery is used for patients with radiological evidence of compression.
