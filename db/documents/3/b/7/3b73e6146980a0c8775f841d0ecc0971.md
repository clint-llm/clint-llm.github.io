Data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database reveal an incidence of 0.2 per lakh women for sex cord-stromal tumors. Every year, about 1500 to 2000, new cases are diagnosed in the United States. Age-standardized incidence of granulosa theca cell cancer ranges from 0.58 to 1.6/100,000 women per year worldwide. The mean age at diagnosis was 50 years [a decade younger than epithelial ovarian cancer], and 57 percent were in the 30 to 60 year age group, with only 12 percent younger than 30 years old. The incidence also tends to be higher in black women than in white women [0.44 vs. 0.18 per lakh population].

Lee et al. reported the mean age at diagnosis of juvenile GCT to be 20 years (range 8 to 45 years) with more than 50 percent diagnosed before 20 years and 45.5 percent in the premenarchal group.
