On autopsy, an RTT brain does not show signs of inflammation or degeneration. However, there is an overall decrease in the size of the brain and individual neurons. A 12% to 34% reduction in brain weight has been reported, most prominent in the prefrontal, posterior frontal and anterior frontal regions. These findings suggest that RTT is a neurodevelopmental and not a neurodegenerative process. The neuronal cell size is decreased, but there is an increase in neuronal cell packing in the hippocampus along with delayed neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis in the cerebral cortex.
