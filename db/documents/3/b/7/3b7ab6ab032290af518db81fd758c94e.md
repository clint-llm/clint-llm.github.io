Duloxetine is a medication used to manage major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Off-label uses for duloxetine include chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and stress urinary incontinence. It is in the Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) class of medications. This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for duloxetine as a valuable agent in treating multiple health conditions. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant drug-drug interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), fibromyalgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the use of duloxetine.
- Describe the most common potential adverse events associated with duloxetine therapy.

- Explain the importance of monitoring for patients on duloxetine therapy and summarize key patient counseling points.
- Explain how the successful initiation and maintenance of effective therapy with duloxetine requires a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach.
