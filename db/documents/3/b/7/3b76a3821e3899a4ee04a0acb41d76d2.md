Most restrictive cardiomyopathies are due to infiltration of abnormal substances between myocytes, storage of abnormal metabolic products within myocytes, or fibrotic injury.

**Infiltrative (Between Myocytes)**

- Amyloidosis

- Primary (light chain amyloid)

- Familial (abnormal transthyretin)

- Senile (normal transthyretin or atrial peptides)

- Inherited metabolic defects

**Storage (Within Myocytes)**

- Hemochromatosis (iron)

- Inherited metabolic defects

- Fabry disease

- Glycogen storage disease (II, III)

**Fibrotic**

- Radiation

- Scleroderma

**Endomyocardial**

- Possibly related fibrotic diseases

- Tropical endomyocardial fibrosis

- Hypereosinophilic syndrome (LÃ¶ffler endocarditis)

- Carcinoid syndrome

- Radiation

- Drugs: e.g., serotonin, ergotamine
