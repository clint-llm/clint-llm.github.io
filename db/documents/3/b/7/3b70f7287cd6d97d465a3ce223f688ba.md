**Risks Common to All Types of DCR**

- Bleeding

- Infection

- Complications related to silicone stent usage, including injury to lacrimal punta

- Failure to improve tearing

- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, presumably due to a spiral fracture, has been reported to occur as a rare complication of endoscopic DCR and is well established as a rare risk during external DCR.

**Risks: External DCR**

- External DCR will always have a scar at the location of the skin incision. This is noticeable in approximately 1 in 5 patients and cosmetically significant in 1 in 10.

- Facial nerve injury also is common during external DCR and can cause variable lagophthalmos. While this is temporary in most patients, it can take up to 30 weeks to recover, but it also may remain permanent in 1 to 2%.

**Risks: Endoscopic DCR**

- Damage to the nasal mucosa with adhesion formation

- Orbital fat prolapse,

- Injury to the medial rectus muscle. This is rare and only occurs if the location of the sac is unclear to the operating surgeon, and bone removal with breach of the periorbita is performed posterior to the lacrimal sac.
