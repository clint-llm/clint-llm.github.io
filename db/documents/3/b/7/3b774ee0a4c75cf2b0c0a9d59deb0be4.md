Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is a type of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia that results due to the presence of a re-entry circuit within or adjacent to the AV node. The diagnosis of AVNRT requires visualization of an electrocardiogram (ECG). In most cases, an ECG will show heart rate between 140 and 280 beats per minute (bpm), and in the absence of aberrant conduction, a QRS complex of fewer than 120 milliseconds. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of AV nodal reentry tachycardia and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.
- Review the presentation of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia.
