The vagus nerve has several fibers that innervate the striated muscles of the larynx and pharynx; there are two exceptions: the stylopharyngeus muscle (CNIX) and the tensor veli palatini muscle (V3).

The vagus nerve innervates one muscle of the tongue: palatoglossus muscleâ€“its function is to elevate the posterior portion of the tongue.

The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve supplies the cricothyroid muscle.

The pharyngeal branches of the vagus supply: levator veli palatini, salpingopharyngeus, palatopharyngeus, and the uvula.

Recurrent laryngeal nerves innervate the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, except the cricothyroid muscle (the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve).
