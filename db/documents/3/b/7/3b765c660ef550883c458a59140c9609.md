Fresh retinitis lesions appear as whitish or slightly yellow lesions in the posterior pole or periphery depending upon the aetiological agent. In fresh lesions, the margin is usually blurred or fuzzy, and there is retinal edema leading to the opaqueness of the retina and obscuration of the details of the choroid. It may be associated with vitreous inflammation, vasculitis, vascular occlusions, or hemorrhage. OCT (optical coherence tomography) shows hyperreflectivity of inner or all retinal layers (according to the level of involvement) with or without overlying vitreous cells. FFA (fundus fluorescein angiogram) reveals early hypofluorescence with late hyperfluorescence of the lesions with leakage of dye into surrounding tissues. As they heal, they either heal with pigmentation or lead to retinal thinning and atrophy.

CMV infection probably reaches the eye through hematogenous spread. Three types of clinical appearance may be seen clinically in CMV retinitis:

- Wedge-shaped areas of a perivascular fluffy white lesion with many scattered hemorrhages (brush-fire)

- A more granular-appearing lesion that has few associated hemorrhages and often has a central area of clearing, with the atrophic retina and stippled retinal pigment epithelium  (granular type)

- Rarely, retinal vasculitis with perivascular sheathing (an atypical manifestation with a clinical appearance similar to frosted branch angiitis)

The disease usually spreads centrifugally along the retinal vessels; the border of active retinitis is irregular, and small white satellite lesions are very characteristic.

Clinically, Toxoplasma presents as focal areas of retinitis with overlying localized or diffuse vitritis classically described as "headlight in fog" appearance. There may be adjacent pigmented retinochoroidal scar with a variable degree of vitreous inflammation. Recurrent lesions tend to occur as satellite lesions next to old atrophic lesions, sites of previous toxoplasma infection. Anterior uveitis may be either granulomatous or nongranulomatous, with severity ranging from mild to severe. Perivasculitis may be present near the active lesion with periarteriolar collections of cells seen as distinct Kyrieleis plaques. Such plaques have also been reported in ARN, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behcet disease, CMV retinitis, leptospirosis, rickettsial disease, and syphilis.

PORT (Punctate Outer Retinal Toxoplasmosis) is a subset of ocular toxoplasmosis involving outer retinal layers and associated with little or no overlying vitreous reaction. Grey-white lesions at the level of the deep retina and retinal pigment epithelium are seen, which resolve as white, punctate tiny dots. It is important to identify this variant as the treatment of toxoplasmosis might improve outcomes in this disease.

ARN is characterized by prominent anterior segment inflammation that may be granulomatous, or non-granulomatous. The disease starts in the periphery with full-thickness discrete necrotizing lesions with scalloped borders. Typically, hemorrhages are less prominent, if present. The posterior pole is involved later in the course of the disease. Inflammation of the arterioles can lead to occlusive arteritis, causing more rapid retinal necrosis. Other associated features include vitritis/media haze, optic disc edema, raised intraocular pressure, and scleritis. Although the disease starts unilaterally in the majority, fellow eye involvement may occur as early as 1 to 6 weeks.

An extreme variant of necrotizing herpetic retinopathy in immunocompromised patients is progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN),  with early involvement of posterior pole and rapid progression. There is minimal vitreous inflammation despite extensive retinal involvement, particularly the deep retina.

Fifty percent of patients with Behcet disease have ocular manifestations while it is the presenting symptom in only twenty percent of patients.

Retinitis is the second most common posterior segment finding after retinal vasculitis, which affects veins more than arteries in Behcet disease.

Ocular manifestations of cat scratch disease include Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome or neuroretinitis. Neuroretinitis may present typically with optic nerve edema, macular star formation, and features of vasculitis. Discrete white retinal and chorioretinal lesions may be a more common finding than the 'classic' macular star. Other posterior segment findings include intermediate uveitis, granulomas, choroiditis, angiomatosis lesions, and serous retinal detachments.

Retinitis in Rocky Mountain spotted fever presents in the form of white retinal lesions, typically adjacent to retinal vessels with mild to moderate vitreous inflammation. It is usually self-limiting with the resolution of white retinal lesions with or without scarring in several weeks.

Toxocara retinochoroiditis can present acutely as a hazy, ill-defined white lesion with overlying vitritis. The lesion is seen as a distinct, well-demarcated, elevated white mass ranging from one-half to four disc diameters in size after the resolution of the inflammation with surrounding retinal pigment epithelium disturbance. The most common ocular feature, however, is posterior pole granuloma seen in 25% to 50% of patients.

Chikungunya retinitis may morphologically mimic herpetic retinitis; however, there is a markedly less vitreous reaction and confluent posterior pole retinitis. The absence of a history of fever, joint pains, and skin rash before the onset of visual symptoms can differentiate chikungunya from the acute retinal necrosis. Posterior uveitis can present with no involvement of the anterior segment. Posterior pole or macular retinochoroiditis is quite specific but carries a very poor visual prognosis. Other posterior segment signs include optic neuritis, neuroretinitis, and retrobulbar neuritis.

In DUSN, there are multifocal gray-white evanescent lesions at the level of the outer retina, typically clustered in one segment of the fundus. These evanescent lesions are thought to be related to host immune response to the nematode in subretinal space and characteristically migrate according to the worm's location. In the later stages of the disease, there may be sequelae of degenerative changes in the RPE and retina, retinal artery narrowing, and optic atrophy.

Chorioretinitis in sarcoid uveitis is seen typically as multiple small round chorioretinal lesions frequently seen in the inferior peripheral fundus that heal with hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation.
