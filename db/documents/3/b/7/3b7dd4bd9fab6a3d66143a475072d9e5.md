Creating an island pedicle flap severs the epidermal and dermal borders to allow all edges of the pedicle to move freely from one position to another, hence the name "island." A thorough knowledge of the underlying anatomy and facial cosmetic units is imperative to complete the flap without complication and optimize the aesthetics of the closure. Due to the preservation of the subcutaneous vessels, the base of the flap has an increased depth compared to other advancement flaps.

To optimize the cosmesis of the resulting scar, island flaps should be used in areas where 1 or 2 margins can be hidden in natural contour lines or rhytids.
