Typically, TE/TB presents as tiny (0.2 to 1 cm) skin-colored, slow-growing papules or nodules, similar to BCC. They often appear on the head (face or scalp) but may be found on the trunk or extremities.

Rarely, TBs may arise in nevus sebaceous (of Jadassohn), which may appear as a translucent and verrucous plaque with central nodularity and pigmentation.

Patients with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome present with multiple nodules (from ten to several hundred) that appear similar to BCC on the head and neck, ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 cm. Multiple confluent lesions involving the scalp may form a “turban tumor.” Rapid enlargement and bleeding may suggest malignant transformation, which occurs in about 5 to 10% of cases.
