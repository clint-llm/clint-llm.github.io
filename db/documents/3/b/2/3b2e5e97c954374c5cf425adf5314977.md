Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a mesenchymal tumor with partial epithelial differentiation. It is commonly seen in older children and younger adults. The presence of t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) is a pathognomonic feature of synovial sarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is the most well-established 'translocation-associated sarcoma,' and several molecular techniques are used to determine this translocation.

It is a very aggressive malignancy with a high potential for metastasis. Like other soft-tissue sarcomas (STS), surgical resection (to achieve microscopic negative margins) along with perioperative radiotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy remains controversial in adults but is utilized regularly in the pediatric population.
