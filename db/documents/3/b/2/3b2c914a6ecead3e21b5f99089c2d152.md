Pneumonectomy, while effective at removing lung tumors, can carry high morbidity and mortality by removing an entire half of a person's lung volume.

PSR was first attempted in the late 1940s for a benign mass to preserve lung function. In the mid-late 1950s, the feasibility of PSR for lung cancer was proven. By the early 1980s, SL was gaining traction with the technique used to treat low-grade lung malignancies.

Improvement in video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and robotic surgery platforms have allowed complex lung resections such as SL to be performed via minimally invasive approaches. There is now mounting literature establishing the safety and feasibility of SL using minimally invasive surgical techniques. PSR is already considered a technically challenging thoracic surgical procedure, so only certain centers will have the necessary expertise in performing PSR using minimally invasive techniques. It is notable that even though minimally invasive techniques are becoming more common for lobectomies, SL is still a smaller portion of all lobectomies performed.

Compared to pneumonectomy, PSR has improved survival, quality of life, improved pulmonary function, and lower mortality rates.
