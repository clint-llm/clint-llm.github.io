Gallstones occur when substances in the bile reach their limits of solubility. As bile becomes concentrated in the gallbladder, it becomes supersaturated with these substances, which in time precipitate into small crystals. These crystals, in turn, become stuck in the gallbladder mucus, resulting in gallbladder sludge. Over time, these crystals grow and form large stones. Complications caused by gallstones are a direct consequence of occlusion of the hepatic and biliary tree by sludge and stones.

There are two types of gallstones, cholesterol and calcium bilirubinate.

Cholesterol gallstones form the majority of gallstones. The major component of these stones is cholesterol. The bilirubinate stones contain bilirubin. In patients with a high turnover of heme, such as cirrhosis or chronic hemolysis, the unconjugated bilirubin will crystallize and eventually form stones. These stones are usually dark black or blue and account for about 15% of gallstones in the United States.

Sometimes, the cholesterol gallstones will become colonized with microorganisms, which leads to inflammation of the mucosa. The resulting leucocyte infiltration and presence of bilirubin leads to mixed stones.
