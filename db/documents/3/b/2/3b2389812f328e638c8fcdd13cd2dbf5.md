There are no laboratory studies that have been shown to aid in the diagnosis of uterine prolapse. The major modality for diagnosis of this condition is history given by the patient in combination with pelvic exam findings, as mentioned above. However, prolapsed segments can be seen on multiple imaging modalities such as ultrasound, CT, and MRIÂ and may serve to confirm the diagnosis.
