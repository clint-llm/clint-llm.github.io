Hereditary angioedema, otherwise known as C1 esterase deficiency, is defined by recurrent episodes of angioedema without urticaria or pruritus. These skin conditions typically involve the legs, hands, face, upper respiratory tract, as well as gastrointestinal tract. This disorder can lead to airway edema and potentially asphyxiation due to laryngeal swelling. Associated symptoms typically include abdominal pain and vomiting secondary to gastrointestinal involvement.
