Carbon dioxide (CO2) narcosis is a condition that develops when excessive CO2 is present in the bloodstream, leading to a depressed level of consciousness. This condition largely results from lung disease, hypoventilation, or environmental exposure. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of CO2 narcosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with carbon dioxide narcosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of carbon dioxide narcosis.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for carbon dioxide narcosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to enhance care delivery for patients with carbon dioxide narcosis.
