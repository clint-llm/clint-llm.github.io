To ensure appropriate patient care and improvement in outcomes, it is prudent to have a team approach when managing a patient with a double orifice mitral valve (DOMV). DOMV is predominantly an asymptomatic condition and given its low incidence rate, echocardiography technicians and cardiologists must be on high alert, especially when obtaining the parasternal short-axis views, scanning from the base to the apex to assess the sub-valvular structures. Early referral to a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon is warranted. DOMV is usually a disorder that is managed as an outpatient with inpatient care designated for acutely decompensated heart failure and further investigative workup. At the time of writing, valve intervention is only recommended at the stage of valve dysfunction, and as such, it is imperative to have a thorough risk vs. benefit discussion with a cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and of course, the patient, as to which form of valve intervention is best suited for the patientâ€™s best outcome.
