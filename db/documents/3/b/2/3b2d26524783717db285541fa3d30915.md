The vertebrobasilar (VB) system,  comprised of the vertebral and basilar arteries,  serves as a critical arterial supply to the cervical spinal cord brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and occipital lobes. Disruptions of VB circulation can have devastating neurologic consequences; thus, a thorough understanding of the anatomy and clinical significance of the VB system is critical for assessing neurologic syndromes and preoperative neurosurgical planning.
