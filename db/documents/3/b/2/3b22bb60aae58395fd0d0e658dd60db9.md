**Beckers Muscular Dystrophy (BMD)**

BMD has a later onset, and the length of survival is longer. Patients typically have higher concentrations of dystrophin protein.

**Intermediate form of Muscular Dystrophy**

Patients with this form of dystrophy have dystrophin levels between DMD and BMD.

**Myotonic Muscular Dystrophy**

Inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, distal muscles are more commonly affected. The ability to walk is often preserved.

**Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy**

This inherited dystrophy primarily affects muscles of the hip and shoulder girdles

**Congenital Myotonic Dystrophies**

This encompasses a group of inherited disorders associated with muscular dystrophy. The dystrophy is characterized by an increased severity at birth but has a benign course through life. There is a higher association with brain malformations. This includes diseases such as Ullrich type of muscular dystrophy, Fukuyama type of congenital muscular dystrophy, and muscular dystrophy associated with Walker-Warburg syndrome, to name a few.
