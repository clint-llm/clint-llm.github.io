Sympathomimetic is a broad pharmacological classification. A wide variation in the therapeutic index exists among pharmacological agents in this class. Due to the high rates of complications, the supervision of a physician with extensive experience with sympathomimetics is the recommendation when administering catecholamines. More sensitive monitoring with intra-arterial blood pressures is necessary for the administration of high-dose catecholamines.
