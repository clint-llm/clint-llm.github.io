The American Academy of Dermatology has evidence-based guidelines on the management of acne.

If the acne is severe, then a consult with a dermatologist is highly recommended. The pharmacist should be fully aware of the adverse effects of medications especially isotretinoin and its potential teratogenic effects. The pharmacist should never dispense retinoids to a female of childbearing age without first speaking to the dermatologist. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the potential teratogenic effects of retinoids and adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program.

**Outcomes**

For the most part, most patients have a good outcome after treatment. But in many patients, acne does leave residual scars. These can be avoided by educating the patient on not manipulating the lesions and seeking timely care. Once established, the treatment of acne scars is not optimal.
