Videostroboscopy is currently the gold standard for laryngeal imaging.

In addition to its part in evaluating voice disorders, videostroboscopy plays a role in oncologic surveillance. A reduction or absence of the mucosal wave suggests abnormal structural health and pliability of the vocal cord, which may indicate dysplasia, early glottic carcinoma, scarring, marked hyperkeratosis, or inflammation.
