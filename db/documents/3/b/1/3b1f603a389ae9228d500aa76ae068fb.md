In most instances, interstitial nephritis is not a long-term condition. Treating the underlying issue resolves the problem. The recovery rate can vary, and sometimes renal failure persists weeks before renal function recovers. In rare cases, it can develop into chronic or permanent kidney damage, such as kidney failure. This complication is more likely with older patients.
