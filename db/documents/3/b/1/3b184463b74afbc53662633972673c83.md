There are several diagnostic tests used make the determination of gallbladder disease. A simple abdominal x-ray can be used to identify calcified gallstones. Because only 10% of all gallstones are calcified, this imaging study has limited usefulness. Porcelain gallbladders can also be seen in plain x-rays. This condition is somewhat uncommon and results from calcification of the gallbladder wall. In 1924, two American surgeons developed the oral cholecystogram or OCG. The OCG is done by administering iopanoic acid by mouth. This is an iodine-based material that is absorbed by the intestines and concentrated in the gallbladder. When it combines with bile salts, it becomes a very radio-opaque liquid present within the gallbladder. This will outline any gallstones present in the gallbladder. The intervenous cholangiogram was developed in 1954. It was chiefly used to evaluate the bile ducts and to look for stones or strictures within these bile ducts. An iodine-based dye is injected intravenously. It is then concentrated in the liver and excreted into the bile ducts. The intervenous cholangiogram was a poor test to evaluate the actual gallbladder because sometimes the gallbladder was bypassed entirely as the dye went directly from the bile ducts into the small bowel. Both the oral cholecystogram and the intravenous cholecystogram are seldom used today.
