While complete recovery from DCS is generally quite high, especially with appropriate treatment, full recovery from IEDCS appears less common. Studies have reported residual deficits in between 32 and 91% of patients, with 3 out of 5 studies reporting residual deficits in more than 85% of patients.

One source states even with adequate recompression therapy, it is common to have residual deficits in balance and hearing.
