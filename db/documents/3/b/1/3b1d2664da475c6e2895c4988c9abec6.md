The prognosis for patients with chromium deficiency is highly favorable. Mortality due to the deficiency of chromium, specifically, has not been observed clinically nor described in the literature.

Patients diagnosed with chromium deficiency and on total parenteral nutrition require added supplementation with chromium. There are no guidelines at this time that recommend a specific dosage or the appropriate timeline, but studies have used various pharmacologic doses of chromium supplementation for around two weeks, and in some cases, possibly longer.
