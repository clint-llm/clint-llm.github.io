As noted previously, the most critical component in caring for a patient with a gastrojejunostomy is clear and constant communication between all facets of the care team. In many instances, complications secondary to a surgery that includes a gastrojejunostomy is promptly proceeding to the operating room and ensuring that is not delayed can be the most critical part of the patient's care. Typical interventions for issues with the small bowel, such as nasogastric decompression, are ineffective in the setting of an internal hernia and therefore, should not be relied upon in patients with gastrojejunostomies. Ultimately, the best intervention for a patient who has had this type of surgery is an early intervention, therefore focus should be on early diagnosis and prompt return to the operation room should any significant problem arise.
