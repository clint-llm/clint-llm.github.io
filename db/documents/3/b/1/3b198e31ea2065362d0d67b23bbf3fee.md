Doxorubicin is an antibiotic derived from the Streptomyces peucetius bacterium. It has had wide use as a chemotherapeutic agent since the 1960s. Doxorubicin is part of the anthracycline group of chemotherapeutic agents; other anthracyclines include daunorubicin, idarubicin, and epirubicin. Commonly, doxorubicin is an agent used in the treatment of solid tumors in adult and pediatric patients. Doxorubicin may be used to treat soft tissue and bone sarcomas and cancers of the breast, ovary, bladder, and thyroid. It is also used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and small cell lung cancer. The liposomal formulation of doxorubicin has FDA approval for the treatment of ovarian cancer in patients who have failed platinum-based chemotherapy, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, and multiple myeloma.
