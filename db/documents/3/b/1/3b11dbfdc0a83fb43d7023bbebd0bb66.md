Anesthesia for burn patients is a challenging subspecialty that requires a cautious approach and an understanding of the pathophysiology of burns to optimize clinical outcomes. An understanding of the airway difficulties one could encounter when managing severe head and neck burns is essential to prevent the dreaded "can't ventilate, can't intubate" scenario.Â  The most conservative approach involves just enough anesthetic to make the patient comfortable while still maintaining spontaneous ventilation and performing fiberoptic intubation.

An understanding of the pathophysiology of burns is essential to anticipate hemodynamic changes in burn patients and the means by which to properly fluid resuscitate the patient intraoperatively before transferring to an intensive care setting. Intraoperative intervention related to the thermoregulatory changes in burn patients undergoing anesthesia can help to prevent wound infection, impaired coagulation, and perioperative shivering. Anesthesiologists play a critical role in the perioperative care of burn patients, and a better understanding of the hazards in managing burn patients can reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality.
