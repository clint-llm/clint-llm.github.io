The common symptoms are lethargy and diarrhea hence the name celiac sprue. Other gastrointestinal symptoms are abdominal distension, discomfort or pain, vomiting, and constipation. In childhood, failure to thrive is an important aspect of the history, while in adulthood the corresponding symptom would be unexplained weight loss. Symptoms from other than gastrointestinal systems include recurrent aphthous ulcers in the mouth, iron deficiency anemia, ataxia, chronic headaches, and delayed menarche. The incidence of some obstetric complications such as preterm labor, growth restriction, and stillbirth in women with the untreated celiac disease is higher.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a skin condition caused by gluten intolerance, and just like the enteropathy it usually responds to the exclusion of gluten from the diet.

Extraintestinal symptoms are common and may include:

- Anemia due to defective absorption of vitamin B12, folate or iron

- Coagulopathy due to impaired absorption of vitamin K

- Osteoporosis

- Neurological symptoms like muscle weakness, paresthesias, seizures and ataxia
