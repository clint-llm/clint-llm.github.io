In the acute setting, any additional life-threatening injuries should be addressed as the amount of force needed to result in a pelvic fracture often causes other significant injuries. The primary goal in the acute setting is to provide early stable fixation as it has been associated with decreased blood transfusion, systemic complications, hospital stay, and overall improved survival.  Excessive movement of the pelvis should be avoided. Large-bore intravenous access for administration of analgesics and fluids should be obtained as soon as possible, and vital signs should be monitored closely.

Mechanical stabilization with an external compression device such as a **pelvic binder or sheet centered over the greater trochanter can help to stabilize the pelvic ring as well as help staunch internal bleeding from the venous plexus in APC type pelvic ring injuries**but should be avoided in lateral compression (LC) type pelvic ring injuries with an internal rotation component. Conversely,**skeletal traction is the appropriate stabilization for a vertical shear pelvic ring injury.**If appropriate, the patient can be taken for skeletal external fixation of the pelvis, which will provide the best stability in hemodynamically unstable patients, and generally can be performed in conjunction with an emergent laparotomy.

Modern improvements in pelvic implants, anesthetic techniques, intraoperative imaging, coordinated care in polytrauma along with a more advanced understanding of injury patterns have resulted in a shift towards the more operative management of pelvic fractures that were once previously treated nonoperatively.  This has shown improved clinical outcomes as a result of the prevention and repair of any significant pelvic defects and earlier mobilization of patients.

Nonsurgical treatments of pelvic fractures are appropriate for some pelvic ring injuries. APC Type I and LC Type I fractures can remain weight-bearing as tolerated, with early mobilization encouraged. Minimally displaced pelvic fractures can often be treated non-operatively but must be evaluated on a case by case basis.
