Infection at the injection site in the axilla or patient refusal is an absolute contraindication for using this block.

Preexisting nerve damage, including numbness, paresthesia, or motor weakness, may be a relative contraindication. These symptoms should be assessed and documented before doing any block as there may be anÂ increased risk for nerve injury. Anticoagulation and severe pulmonary disease may also be relative contraindications.
