There are preset protocols on how to approach, order, and evaluate laboratory tests. Clinical reasoning is necessary before ordering particular laboratory tests. The following queries should be answered before ordering laboratory tests:

- Is the test logically consistent with the diagnostic hypothesis in question?

- Would any change in the clinical condition of the patient justify the test or its repetition?

- Can the test outcome change treatment decisions?

- How safe is the test?

- Is there any harmful consequence if the test is not ordered?
