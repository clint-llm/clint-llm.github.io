H. pylori are the most frequent cause of gastritis with the infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear leukocytes in the mucosa and lamina propria. The severity of the inflammation depends on the strain of H. pylori, and marked acute inflammation can predispose to microabscesses. In chronic gastritis, there is an accumulation of mononuclear leukocytes in the lamina propria and the presence of lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers.

The histological features include pallor, loss of gastric folds, prominent vessels, and an atrophic border (demarcation of pale atrophy where normal pink border ends).

It is suggested that the extent of the atrophic border with the normal pink mucosa is directly related to the prediction of CAG progression to GC risk. In certain circumstances, corpus biopsies can provide valuable information as prolonged proton pump inhibitor use can have almost no infiltration of H. pylori, and the oxyntic mucosa affected is more proximal to the antrum.

On standard white light endoscopy, IM appears as small grey-white slightly elevated plaques with surrounded uneven patchy pale and pink mucosa.

Metaplasia is defined as the replacement of the differentiated mucosa type into another differentiated cell type, not normal for the organ. Intestinal metaplasia involves the replacement of gastric mucosa with intestinal mucosa characteristically, goblets cells, enterocytes, and colonocytes.
