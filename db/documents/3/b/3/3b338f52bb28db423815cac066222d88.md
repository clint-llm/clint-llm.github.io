Complications in reentrant arrhythmias vary depending on the origin and anatomic location of the arrhythmia. As with any uncontrolled heart rate, reentrant arrhythmias can lead to cardiac remodeling, hemodynamic compromise, and, eventually, heart failure.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are associated with a risk of thromboembolic complications and heart failure.

Many complications can occur from cardiac ablation. The most common complication is bleeding from the site of insertion. Mechanical trauma to the heart valves, vessels, and chambers may lead to pericardial effusion and even cardiac tamponade. A rare but worrisome complication is the iatrogenic creation of another arrhythmia, which potentially could make the patient unstable. The ablation of AVNRT and AVRT may result in an atrioventricular block, and the patient may require a pacemaker.
