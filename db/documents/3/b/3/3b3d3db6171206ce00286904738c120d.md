**Cerebellar ataxia.**Inactivation of the dentate nucleus results in cerebellar ataxia, a loss of finely coordinated movements.

**Freiderich ataxia.**Friedreich ataxia is the most common inherited autosomal recessive progressive ataxia.

**Myoclonic triangle disruption.**Disruption of the myoclonic triangle, resulting in disinhibition of the ION, can result in palatal tremor, which is associated with rhythmic involuntary contractions of the palatine muscles.

**Disruption of embryological neural migration.**Disruption of neural migration during embryonic development of the cerebellum, such as those that disrupt the reelin pathway or conditions in which reelin expression decreases, can cause a myriad of neuropsychological disorders ranging from congenital ataxia and epilepsy to schizophrenia, mood disorder, and autism.

**Maple syrup urine disease.**Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a genetic disorder involving the decreased function of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which is involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

**Canavan disease.**Canavan disease (CD) is a rare early childhood progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with swelling and spongy degeneration of white matter in the brain.

**Langerhans cell histiocytosis.**Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is cancer resulting from the dendritic cells of the skin (Langerhans cell). Although LCH usually affects the skin and bone, it can affect the central nervous system (CNS). T1-weighted MRIs of children with LCH shows changes in the CNS, ranging from pineal gland enlargement to dentate nucleus signaling modifications that may correlate with degeneration.

**Alzheimer disease.**Normal aging of the cerebellum correlates with a loss of about 2.5% Purkinje cells per decade. However, there is no evidence of age-related neuronal loss of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Patients with Alzheimer's disease have deposits of amyloid plaques on the cerebellar cortex; those at a later stage tend to have balance and gait problems due to a reduction of cerebellar glucose metabolism. Although amyloid and tau inclusions are largely absent from the deep cerebellar nuclei, there is an increased level of iron deposition as per MRI.

**Autism spectrum disorders.**Autism spectrum disorders are a group of behavioral neurodevelopment disorders associated with cognitive impairment and deficits in language and communication.

**Essential tremor.**Even though theÂ thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus has merited consideration as the driving center for tremors, this nucleus receives input from the main cerebellar projections. Research has found that the increased functional connectivity between the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus is compensating for the reduced connectivity between the dentate nucleus and thalamus.
