Care should be taken while polishing.

- Proper technique should be used to minimize abrasion to the tooth surfaces with the appropriateÂ amount of force, pressure, time, and speed.

- The least abrasive polishing agent must be used but must be effective enough to remove the stains.

- Restorations must be polished with an agent that is softer than the restoration itself.
