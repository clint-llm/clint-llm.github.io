The etiology of atypical fibroxanthomas is poorly understood. Researchers believe it arises from myofibroblasts or fibroblast-like cells. Ultraviolet light apppears to play a significant role since most lesions appear on the sun-exposed head and neck of White race patients. Genetic factors also contribute to the development of atypical fibroxanthoma, since it shares genetic alterations with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, including chromosome 9p and 13q deletions. However, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma has a statistically significant larger amount of genomic alterations and a more aggressive clinical course. Other possible risk factors for atypical fibroxanthoma include trauma to the skin, radiation therapy, and immunosuppression (e.g., diabetes, HIV, organ transplant).
