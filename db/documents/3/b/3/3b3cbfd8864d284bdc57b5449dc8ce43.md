The clinical presentation of acute hepatitis depends on the underlying etiology. It can clinically manifest with various clinical signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic elevated liver function tests to acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation. Hence, ascertaining the etiology of acute hepatitis is of utmost importance in its clinical management, making it very crucial to obtain a detailed history that should include the duration of the presenting illness, travel history, and assessing for high-risk activities like IV drug use, alcohol consumption, sexual history, prior blood-product transfusion history, or recent food intake. It is also imperative that drug history include not only recent or current prescription medications but also over-the-counter medications, acetaminophen (paracetamol), common cough/cold medications that contain acetaminophen, multivitamins and herbal/nutritional supplements.

Patients with acute viral hepatitis commonly present with symptoms such as fever, malaise, fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Patients may also report yellowish discoloration of their sclera (icterus) and /or skin (jaundice), dark-colored urine, and light-colored stools.

Depending on the underlying etiology, physical exam findings can range from the presence of icterus and jaundice to signs of acute encephalopathy, seizures, bleeding diathesis, hypotension, and other manifestations related to multiple organ failure
