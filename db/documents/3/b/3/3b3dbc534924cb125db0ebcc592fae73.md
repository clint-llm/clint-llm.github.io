Madelung deformity is relatively rare and thus may not be encountered in general medical training. Pediatricians and primary care providers must be aware of this progressive and potentially genetic condition. Patients may present first to a primary care provider or directly to a hand or orthopedic surgeon for evaluation.

Referral to the appropriate surgeon for evaluation is necessary to reduce delays in treatment. Referral to genetic counseling may be necessary and should be discussed with the patient and their family. The radiologist plays a crucial role in radiographic and MRI diagnosis, particularly in more mild cases.

Physical and occupational therapists are paramount in both nonoperative management and the postoperative period. Interprofessional management of patients with Madelung deformity allows for improved patient outcomes.
