Several techniques have been described to manage the open abdomen after a damage control laparotomy. Primary fascial closure remains the gold standard, and the goals of any management strategy should be to protect the bowel and minimize lateral retraction of the fascia. This activity reviews the types of temporary abdominal closure and highlights the importance of active strategies in managing the open abdomen.

**Objectives:**
- Describe and compare the techniques available for temporary abdominal closure.
- Outline strategies to facilitate fascial closure.
- Review common complications of the open abdomen.
- Explain the role of the surgeon in coordinating with the interprofessional team regarding fluid management, nutrition, and sedation goals to improve outcomes.
