Patients with pulmonary hypertension require special anesthetic considerations when undergoing anesthesia and surgery because of their increased morbidity and mortality. The anesthesiologist needs to understand the disease process to avoid potential complications, including myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and death. This review focuses on the preoperative evaluation for patients with pulmonary hypertension and the appropriate intraoperative monitoring and ventilator management, pain control, and pharmacologic therapies for non-cardiac surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Review the preoperative evaluation needed for patients with pulmonary hypertension.
- Discuss options for intraoperative monitoring.
- Review some potential complications of pulmonary hypertension.
- Summarize the pharmacologic therapies prescribed by the interprofessional team both in and out of the operating room.
