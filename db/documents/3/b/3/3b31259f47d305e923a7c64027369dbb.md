A child with PWS is usually first brought by the parents to a primary clinician who needs to differentiate it from its clinical mimickers.Â In case of a diagnostic dilemma, the child needs a referral to a dermatologist who should be able to establish the diagnosis and recognize any possible syndromic association.

Even though PWS occurring alone is considered benign, it can also be rarely associated with complications. Therefore an interprofessional team consisting of a pediatric dermatologist, primary clinician, radiologist, vascular surgeon, pediatric surgeon, plastic surgeon, and orthopedic surgeon may be required for the holistic management of these patients.
