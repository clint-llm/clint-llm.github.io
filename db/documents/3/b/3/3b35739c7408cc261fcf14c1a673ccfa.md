A visible skin-covered mass near the midline in the head's anterior or posterior area is a sign that a patient has an encephalocele. The anterior encephalocele is usually related to the nasal bridge, glabella, or medial orbit. In the posterior area, it can be above or below the torcula. The sac can be mostly filled with CSF and can be translucent.

Depending on the size, the encephalocele can cause severe facial deformity and hypertelorism.

An anterior encephalocele's most common presenting symptom is nasal obstruction, followed by CSF rhinorrhea and meningitis. Less frequent presentations included hypertelorism.

In posterior encephalocele, hydrocephalus is common in 40% to 60% of occipital cases.
