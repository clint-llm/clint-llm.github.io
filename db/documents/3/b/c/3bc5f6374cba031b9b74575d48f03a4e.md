Treatment for pericoronitis can differ among dental professionals depending on their experience, clinical skills, and clinical settings. There are a variety of treatment options to manage pericoronitis. Unfortunately, there is a lack of a consistent treatment algorithm for pericoronitis. Early recognition and initiating treatment to resolve signs and symptoms of pericoronitis is key to the successful management of pericoronitis. This resource should provide available treatment options that dental professionals can use according to their clinical judgment.

**Non-surgical Treatment Options**

Local debridement/Oral Hygiene: Local intervention to remove the impacted debris and decrease the bacterial load is the recommended first-line therapy for patients presenting with mildly symptomatic pericoronitis with a low concern of systemic infection.  Sterile solutions (normal saline, water, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide) can be used to irrigate the pericoronal space. Mechanical debridement using periodontal instruments can also help further clean the infected pericoronal pocket.

Pain management: Pain can greatly limit chewing and taking in good oral intake for patients with pericoronitis. Pain management, in addition to resolving infection, is crucial in pericoronitis management. There are multiple modalities for pain management: local anesthetic injections, topical analgesics, and oral analgesics. Oral analgesia with NSAID should be the primary method of pain management.

Systemic antibiotics: Antibiotics are indicated for pericoronitis when the systemic spread of infection is suspected. Amoxicillin (500 mg orally every 8 hours for five days) or metronidazole (400 mg orally every 8 hours for five days) are recommended for organisms causing pericoronitis. For patients who are allergic to penicillin, erythromycin can be considered. Microbial cultures can help guide antimicrobial selections.

**Surgical Treatment Options**

Soft tissue surgery: Removing the infected soft tissue can help resolve pericoronitis as it is the soft tissue disease overlying an erupting third molar. The operculum, soft tissue covering erupting third molar, can be removed to eliminate the deep pocket formed between the gingiva and the tooth. This surgery is also known as operculectomy, and laser, electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation, or scalpel can be used. Removal of the soft tissue covering the third molar can also help with the tooth eruption.

Pericoronal ostectomy: If a tooth is in a favorable position to erupt into functional occlusion with adequate space, removing the bone that is covering the coronal portion of the erupting tooth can help accelerate the eruption.

Extractions: Tooth extraction is an irreversible procedure. Dental providers should consider other treatment options and compare the risks and benefits before determining whether a tooth should be removed or not. Also, a referral to a specialist may be needed depending on the clinician’s experience or available surgical equipment. If, after close examination and assessment, a tooth is deemed not likely to erupt into functional occlusion and has an increased risk of persistent infection, extraction of the tooth or the opposing tooth can be considered.

Extraction of the opposing tooth: If there is an opposing tooth that is exacerbating pericoronitis by causing mechanical trauma, extraction of the opposing tooth may be considered to help address pericoronitis. Removing the source of mechanical insult can significantly reduce the symptoms of pericoronitis. Nevertheless, this treatment option may be a temporary solution when immediate extraction of the involved mandibular third molar is not feasible. It can be used to decrease the severity of pericoronitis with a plan to extract mandibular third molar extraction at a later date.

Extraction of the involved tooth: Extraction of a tooth is the most permanent solution to pericoronitis when the tooth does not have a favorable eruption position. For example, if a tooth is horizontally impacted, it is not possible to completely irrigate and debride the infected pericoronal space. The inferior portion of the pericoronal space created by the impacted tooth will not be cleaned, and bacteria will continue to proliferate, increasing the risk of chronic pericoronitis that could lead to a more severe infection. Removing the third molar will resolve pericoronitis by removing the unreachable, uncleansable space. Historically, there have been debates on whether extraction of a tooth involved with acute infection would increase the risk of deep space infection. Studies show that extractions should not be delayed when indicated. Early extraction with appropriate adjunct treatments, such as systemic antibiotics and drainage of purulence, expedite the recovery and minimize the risk of infection spreading.

Depending on how patients present and the dental provider’s assessment, different combinations of the therapies mentioned above can be used to treat and prevent pericoronitis.
