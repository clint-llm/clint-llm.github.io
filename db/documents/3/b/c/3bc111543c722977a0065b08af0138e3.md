Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a collection of interventions performed to provide oxygenation and circulation to the body during cardiac arrest. Our current modern-day approach to this process stemmed from the work of a handful of doctors in the 1950s and has now evolved into the process that will be discussed further here. The most widely accepted guidelines in North America are those produced by the American Heart Association (AHA). These are published every 5 years after theÂ International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) meeting.
