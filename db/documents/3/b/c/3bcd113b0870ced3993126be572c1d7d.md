Surgery is rarely indicated but may be required based on the underlying pathology of vestibular dysfunction, such as perilymphatic fistula repair or acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) removal. Ablative surgery is also sometimes completed in cases where recurrent vertigo cannot be controlled by less invasive means to convert fluctuating hypofunction into stable hypofunction to allow for compensation through other systems.

As mentioned previously, medication administration is sometimes indicated (though discouraged for long-term use in most cases) and would require proper administration and management. Medications can be used to reduce associated symptoms (vestibular suppressants, such as valium or meclizine) and ototoxic medications used for ablative purposes (particularly gentamicin).

Recall that a thorough medical history is imperative to differentiate the cause of “dizziness” that is often considered vestibular but could be vascular, cardiac, medication-induced, or neurological in nature.
