Most patients with DJS are often young adults and are asymptomatic. Hyperbilirubinemia is found as an incidental finding while undergoing routine testing or being tested for some other unrelated problem. They may rarely present with mild icterus, weakness, and/or upper abdominal pain. Pruritus is not a symptom of DJS since serum total bile acid levels are normal. In women, the condition may be subclinical and discovered because of hyperbilirubinemia or obvious jaundice once started on oral contraceptives or becoming pregnant, at which time development of jaundice may lead to the establishment of the diagnosis. Except for mild icterus, physical examination results are within normal limits.
