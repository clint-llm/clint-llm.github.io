Ethosuximide administration is via 250 mg capsules or a 250mg/5 mL oral suspension. The oral suspension has a faster absorption rate than the capsules.

Dosing should start at 125 mg twice daily for children between ages 3 and 6. Children above the age of 6 and adults can begin with 250 mg twice daily. Dosing can then be increased by 250 mg every 4 to 7 days to 20 mg/kg/day divided twice daily. Serum concentrations of ethosuximide follow linear kinetics with increasing doses. The maximum dose is 1500 mg/day. Patients on hemodialysis may require additional doses before or after their treatments to maintain therapeutic levels. When being discontinued, it should be tapered slowly as abrupt withdrawal may precipitate absence status epilepticus.

Ethosuximide has excellent bioavailability (over 90%). It has negligible protein binding once it enters the bloodstream and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.
