A cough is an essential protective and defensive reflex that the body uses to remove mucus, noxious substances, and irritants from the larynx, trachea, and bronchi; an impaired or absent cough reflex can be dangerous. Nocturnal coughs are common and can result from a variety of etiologies. This activity describes the causes of nocturnal coughs, reviews the workup, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the differential diagnosis of nocturnal cough.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a nocturnal cough.
- Summarize the management options for nocturnal cough.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of nocturnal cough and improve patient outcomes.
