One of the key benefits of adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is the earlier recognition of spontaneous breathing.

Various weaning protocols have been tried in the mode of ASV for better outcomes after cardiac surgery – namely, in the case of post-elective coronary artery bypass grafting. In a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of weaning under ASV, the protocol using decremental target minute ventilation served a better outcome and earlier extubation compared to that of maintaining a constant target minute ventilation.
