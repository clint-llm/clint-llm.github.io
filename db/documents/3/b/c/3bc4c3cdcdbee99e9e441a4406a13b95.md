Nonorganic functional hearing loss can have a significant impact on patientsâ€™ lives. Many patients have underlying psychiatric conflicts; therefore, appropriate patient education is critical. Patients should be counseled about discrepancies in audiological test results and encouraged that the condition will improve. If there is a need for specialist consultation with a psychiatrist, patients must be educated on the value of such interventions.

The need for close follow-up and the value of regular visits to the treating physician should be emphasized. Parents and teachers of children with nonorganic functional hearing loss need to be informed that the hearing loss is real to the child and that the child should not be blamed for the condition.
