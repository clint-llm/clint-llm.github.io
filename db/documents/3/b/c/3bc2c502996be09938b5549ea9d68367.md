The splenic artery is one of the major branches of the celiac axis.Â  It courses along the superior aspect of the body, and the tail of the pancreas towards the splenic hilum arises, but its course can be variable. The artery is commonly tortuous, dividing into separate branches that provide a segmental blood supply to the spleen. Aneurysms arise in the middle or distal third of the splenic artery near its bifurcation. SAAs are usually saccular as opposed to fusiform.
