Stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is an acute central nervous system (CNS) injury and one of the leading causes of death in the developed world. Estimates are that the incidence of stroke is 795000 each year, which causes 140000 deaths annually. Based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, stroke has moved from third place in 2007 to the fifth leading cause of death in 2017 in the United States.

Neuroimaging in stroke patients, especially in acute ischemic stroke patients, plays an essential role. It helps to differentiate other causes of stroke (i.e., stroke mimics such as migraine headache, tumors, seizure, metabolic disturbance, and peripheral or cranial nerve disorders), early detection of hemorrhagic stroke, distinguishing irreversible infarcted tissues from salvageable tissue, identification of vascular malformations,Â treatment planning for intravenous thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombectomy, and outcomes prediction.
