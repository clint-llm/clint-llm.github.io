NPPV is initiated at the physician level but requires the cooperation of an interprofessional team to ensure its success. While the physician performs the initial settings and titration, subsequent patient monitoring is usually done by a team including nurses with critical care training and respiratory therapists.

The patient must have their mental status and vital signs continuously monitored, and any abnormalities must be recognized and reported to the physician expediently. IV access should be secured before initiation of NPPV should hypotension develop. The patient will need frequent arterial/venous blood gas draws during titration of NPPV. During transfers of care, it is vital to communicate the patient’s prior NPPV settings and changes to ensure optimal adjustment and effectiveness of NPPV.
