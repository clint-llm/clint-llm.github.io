Seronegative spondyloarthropathies are a family of joint disorders that classically include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated arthritis, reactive arthritis (formerly Reiter syndrome; ReA), and undifferentiated SpA. Patients with seronegative spondyloarthropathy often present with inflammatory joint pain characterized by morning stiffness lasting more than one hour and improving with activity. NSAIDs may improve symptoms. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of seronegative spondyloarthropathies and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of seronegative spondyloarthropathy.
- Review the presentation of a patient with seronegative spondyloarthropathy.
- Summarize the treatment options for seronegative spondyloarthropathy.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members in reducing functional limitations, reducing symptoms, and decreasing complication which will improve outcomes for those with this disease.
