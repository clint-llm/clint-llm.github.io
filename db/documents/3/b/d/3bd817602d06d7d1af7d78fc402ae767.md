Patients who contract the virus but do not develop neurologic symptoms will fully recover, as do most adults with the only mild neurologic disease. Children who develop neurologic disease have a 30% chance of having a permanent disability such as seizures, spasticity, and cognitive or behavioral disorders. As compared with Eastern equine encephalitis for which mortality approaches 70%, mortality is low, only around 4%. Most fatalities occur in elderly patients.
