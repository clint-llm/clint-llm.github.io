Variable decelerations can be seen resulting from fetal movement if the fetus is premature.

In general, the fetus is well-adapted to life inside the uterus. The structure of fetal hemoglobin differs from adult hemoglobin. The fetus has a more sensitive Bohr effect which allows a high amount of oxygen to bind and unbind in response to oxygen tension in the fetal circulation.

Traditionally, variable decelerations are attributable to transient compression of the umbilical cord. During a contraction, the umbilical vein alone may initially undergo compression, leading to decreased fetal blood return and subsequent baroreceptor-mediated acceleration. This activity gives the appearance of a “shoulder” on the tracing.

Alternatively, variable decelerations may result from chemoreceptor responses to hypoxia. The physiology of the uterus and placenta are such that, when the uterus contracts, uteroplacental perfusion is impaired. If the resulting hypoxemia is mild, the fetus may switch to quiet sleep or decrease movements and breathing to reduce oxygen consumption. However, at a certain threshold of hypoxemia, the peripheral chemoreflex is triggered.
