The process of epithelialization is vital for skin renewal and wound healing. The epithelial layer is made primarily of keratinocytes, which proliferate in the basal layer, differentiate as they rise through the spinous and granular layer, and then lose their nucleus and flatten to become the outer layer of skin known as the stratum corneum.

Multiple anatomical connections between epithelial cells exist, including tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap junctions, which are important in epithelialization. Tight junctions split epithelial cells into apical and basal sections and are impermeable, preventing molecules from passing through the intercellular space. Anchoring junctions include desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens junctions. They are found on the basal and lateral surfaces of the epithelial cells and function to provide strength and flexibility. Desmosomes hold adjacent cells together using adhesion moleculesÂ such as cadherin. Hemidesmosomes link cells to the extracellular matrix using adhesion molecules such as integrins.
