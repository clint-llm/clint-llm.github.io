Clinical features of carcinomatous meningitis are pleomorphic because of the extensive involvement of neuraxis. Different pathophysiological mechanisms include:

- Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) caused by obstruction to CSF flow; if this obstruction occurs at convexities, communicating hydrocephalus emanates; if the blockage occurs at the ventricles, non-communicating hydrocephalus ensues.

- Disruption of the blood-brain barrier causing cerebral edema.

- Direct tumor cell invasion into cranial and spinal nerves from subarachnoid space.

- Malignant cells invade the brain parenchyma, usually via Virchow-Robin spaces, which are pia matter lined perivascular spaces in different regions of the brain and utilize the oxygen and glucose required for neuronal cell growth and functioning. This competition can cause widespread depression of metabolism in the cerebral cortex, causing encephalopathy.

- The coexistence of leptomeningeal metastasis with brain parenchymal metastatic lesions present with focal signs of intraparenchymal disease.

The most common presenting symptom is a headache and is found in about 39% of patients.

Posterior fossa involvement causes both cerebellar signs and cranial neuropathies. These are observed in 65% of the cases and incorporate nausea, vomiting, dizziness, ataxia, and diplopia.

CM may also involve the spinal cord and its exiting nerve roots. The spinal nerve roots that are affected produce symptoms in the anatomically associated regions. Symptoms may include segmental numbness, dysesthesia, pain, and lower motor neuron pattern limb weakness. The involvement of sacral nerve roots may cause bowel and bladder dysfunction. Cauda equina and conus medullaris syndromes can be the only presentation in CM patients. Leg weakness (28%) and back pain/paralysis (18%) are the initial presenting symptoms of leptomeningeal metastases of the spinal cord.

CM can be asymptomatic in 2% of the patients.
