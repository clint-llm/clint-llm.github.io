The amniotic fluid serves multiple functions necessary for adequate fetal development ranging from biomechanical protection and immunologic properties, hormonal regulation, and the development of whole organ systems as seen with pulmonary development.

Ultrasound offers a rapid, non-invasive way to evaluate amniotic fluid. Some studies have noted that sonographicÂ assessment of amniotic fluid may not be accurate compared to the more direct dye dilution method. However, ultrasound offers a safe real-time option with comparable clinical outcomes.
