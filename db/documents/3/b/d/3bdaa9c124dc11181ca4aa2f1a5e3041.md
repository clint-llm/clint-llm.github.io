The premise underlying the good Samaritan law traces its origin to the ancient biblical parable, ultimately yielding the definition of a good Samaritan as an individual who intervenes to assist another individual without prior notion or responsibility or promise of compensation.

Good Samaritan laws have their basis on the idea that consensus agreement favors good "public policy" to limit liability for those who voluntarily perform care and rescue in emergency situations.  It is well known that medical emergencies outside of the umbrella "medical setting" or "clinical environment" are common.

The general principle of most versions of the good Samaritan law provides protection from claims of negligence for those who provide care without expectation of payment. The good Samaritan laws also further public policy because few jurisdictions have created an affirmative duty for a medical professional to provide care in the absence of an established patient relationship. Each state has its version(s) of the law, and federal laws also exist for individual circumstances.

It is worth noting that other countries besides the United States of America (USA) have differing laws, opinions, and regulations regarding the good Samaritan scenarios. Most have no legal obligation to treat.  Many western countries recognize the moral duty to stop and render treatment rather than a legal requirement.

In legal terms, a good Samaritan is anyone who renders aid in an emergency to an injured or ill person.  Generally, if the victim is unconscious or unresponsive, a good Samaritan can help them on the grounds of implied consent.  If the person is conscious and can reasonably respond, a would-be rescuer should ask permission first.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia have a good Samaritan law, in addition to Federal laws for specific circumstances. Many good Samaritan laws were initially written to protect physicians from liability when rendering care outside their usual clinical setting. The details of good Samaritan laws vary by jurisdiction, including who is protected (physicians, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders) from liability and under what circumstances.  In general, these laws do not protect medical personnel from liability if acting in the course of their usual profession.

Good Samaritan laws give liability protection against "ordinary negligence." Ordinary negligence is the failure to act as a reasonably prudent person. It is the failure to exercise such care as the great mass of humanity ordinarily applies under the same or similar circumstances.

These laws do not protect against "gross negligence" or willful actions.  Gross negligence is a conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care, which is likely to cause foreseeable grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both.

For good Samaritan laws to be applicable for physicians (and other health care providers), certain conditions must apply.  There must exist no duty to treat.   For this reason, this protection does not typically apply to on-call physicians.
