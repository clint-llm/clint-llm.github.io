- Management of most of these disorders is supportive since the replacement of specific proteins and genes has been tried mostly in animal models. The use of these medications and gene therapy in humans has been part of clinical trials.

- Most centers managing such patients now have interprofessional teams, which include multiple subspecialists to help caregivers take care of these patients with multiple complex needs at home.

- Assisted mechanical ventilation is done at home with the help of parents and home nursing if respiratory muscles are affected.

- Intensive physical and occupational therapy is an essential part of the care of these patients while they are admitted to the hospital and should be continued at home.

- These patients require surgical intervention for other comorbidities like scoliosis due to prolonged immobility, placement of feeding gastrostomy, or gastrojejunostomy tube to keep up with nutritional requirements.

- Nutritional support plays a significant role in long term management of these patients as they are usually underweight, and macro/micronutrient deficiencies in them can exaggerate the underlying muscle weakness.

- Many patients can have normal intellectual ability and hence require support in the form of psychologists and psychiatrists to help them deal with the stress of chronic disease.
