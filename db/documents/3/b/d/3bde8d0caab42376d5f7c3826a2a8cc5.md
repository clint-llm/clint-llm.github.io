The infection rapidly transits the muscle fascia. After several days the overlying skin, which appears unaffected initially, will transition to an erythematous, reddish-purple to bluish-gray hue. The texture of the skin will become indurated, swollen, shiny, and feel warm in temperature. At this stage, the skin is exquisitely tender to palpation and can also be painful and out of proportion to presenting symptoms. Skin breakdown will begin in 3 to 5 days and is accompanied by bullae and cutaneous gangrene. Pain is reduced in the affected area secondary to thrombosed small vessels and destruction of the superficial nerves in the subcutaneous tissues. Advanced stages of the infection are characterized by systemic symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and sepsis.

Anaerobic bacteria mixed with aerobic organisms are commonly found in most soft tissue infections and include clostridium, Bacteroides, coliforms, proteus, klebsiella, peptostreptococcus, and pseudomonas. These organisms rapidly spread along with the subcutaneous tissues and deep fascial planes, causing vascular occlusion, tissue necrosis, and ischemia.
