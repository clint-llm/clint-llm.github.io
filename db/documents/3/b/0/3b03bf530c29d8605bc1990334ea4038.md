Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the skin, hair follicles, nails, and mucosa.

The oral variant, termed oral lichen planus (OLP), is a chronic condition with periods of relapses and remissions, requiring long-term symptomatic treatment and surveillance monitoring. About 15% of patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) develop cutaneous lesions, and 20% develop genital lesions.

Cutaneous involvement is usually self-limiting and characterized by violaceous, pruritic papules with overlying reticular white striae, known as Wickam striae. Lesions most commonly appear on the trunk or extremities, such as the wrists and ankles.

Genital involvement in females demonstrates erythema, erosion, white reticulated plaques, agglutination, resorption of the labia, or scarring.

More than a quarter of OLP patients also display oesophageal involvement, with symptomatic patients complaining of dysphagia and odynophagia. An endoscopic examination may reveal friable mucosa, white plaques, erythema, ulceration, erosions, and stricture formation.
