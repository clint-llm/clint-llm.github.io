The highest reported incidence of Lemierre syndrome was prior to the antibiotic era. With the widespread use of penicillin in the 1960s and 1970s, the incidence of LS declined sharply. Since the late 1970s, there has been a steady rise in reported cases which may be due to the decreased use of empiric antibiotics in oropharyngeal infections. It is still a rare syndrome with an estimated worldwide incidence of 1/1,000,000. LS typically affects young, previously healthy, adolescents and young adults. The median age of patients with LS is between 19 to 22 years of age depending on the study with a 2:1 male-to-female ratio. Approximately 90% of the patients who develop LS are between 10 and 35 years of age.
