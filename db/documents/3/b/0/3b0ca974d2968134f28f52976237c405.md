Clostridioides difficile is a gram-positive bacterium that is the cause most implicated in antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The emergence of a newer hypervirulent strain North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) has been attributed to the increase in incidence and severity of C. difficile infections (CDI) over the last decade. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of C. difficile infection and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various proposed etiologies of C. difficile infection.
- Describe the clinical presentation of C. difficile infection and the relevant examination criteria for evaluation.
- Summarize the treatment and management options for C. difficile colitis based on specific etiology.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by C. difficile colitis
