Owing to the rarity of myxopapillary ependymomas, there are no definitive treatment guidelines. The consensus is that surgical excision is the preferred initial treatment modality.

Early detection and treatment of patients affected by myxopapillary ependymomas are crucial to achieving optimal patient outcomes. The best treatment modality for myxopapillary ependymoma is complete surgical resection, which is associated with a complete resolution for the majority of patients.

In the case of subtotal resection, adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended. However, chemotherapy is used in young children who are more prone to negative side effects from radiation therapy.

Radical surgery for myxopapillary ependymoma is associated with a favorable outcome in both children and adults as with other spinal cord ependymomas.

Long-term survival is better in the case of gross total removal of myxopapillary ependymoma rather than subtotal resection.
