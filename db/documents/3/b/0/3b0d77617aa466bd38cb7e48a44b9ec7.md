While the pediatrician is almost always involved in the care of a patient with DIPG, it is essential to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a neurosurgeon, neuro-oncologist, and radiation oncologist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and the family. In the perioperative period for pain, wound infection, and nausea/vomit, the pharmacist will ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and appropriate antibiotics. The problem gets even more complicated when the parents suffer the emotional burden of the dismal prognosis ofÂ DIPG. Early phase interaction with psychologists, psychiatrists, and family therapists are needed to handle this critical issue.
