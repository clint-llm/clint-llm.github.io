Treatment is targeted at the underlying source of the patient's symptoms.

- Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo may be treated with medications (such as meclizine), the Epley maneuver, or vestibular rehabilitation.

- Meniere disease is typically treated with diuretics and salt restriction. Severe cases may be treated with intratympanic dexamethasone or gentamicin or with endolymphatic sac surgery by an otolaryngologist.

- Vestibular neuritis can be treated with supportive care with antiemetics and vestibular suppressants such as antihistamines, benzodiazepines, or dopamine antagonists. It can also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation or possibly with steroids.

- Vestibular migraines are often managed with reassurance and lifestyle modifications; however, at times, prophylactic medications are required, such as metoprolol, amitriptyline, topiramate, valproic acid, or flunarizine.

- Superior canal dehiscence requires surgical intervention.

- Idiopathic Perilymphatic fistulas are treated conservatively by avoiding activities that increase inner ear and intracranial pressure. PLFs with a known cause are treated surgically.

- Orthostatic Hypotension can be improved by increasing water intake, reviewing the medication list, making lifestyle changes, and in some cases adding Midodrine or a mineralocorticoid to the patient's medication regimen.
