A significant issue of concern with the histology of axons is the staining. In addition to the presence of myelin (in myelinated axons) and to the particular membrane structure, another feature distinguishes the axon from the soma. The axon is devoid of a rough endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, traditional cellular stains such as the Nissl staining method, which identifies the so-called Nissl bodies (granules of the rough endoplasmic reticulum) is only able to stain the soma and dendrites but not the axon or axon hillock. That said, newer methods of staining involving luminescence approaches have produced enlightening results. Retrograde stained tracers using fluorescent dyes have shown promise with higher resolution photo data.

Issues of concern of clinical interest are manifold as a large number of functional and/or structural alterations of the axon are at the basis of neurological disorders that can involve the CNS or PNS. On these bases, the study of the structure and functioning of the axon (i.e., axonology) is a field of research of considerable interest. As a consequence, immunocytochemical and immuno-ultrastructural techniques have illustrated the structure of channels, exchangers, and pumps that are involved in the operative mechanisms of axons. Moreover, the development of targeted strategies against axonal damage, or focused on axon regeneration, are of fundamental importance for the majority of all neurological diseases.
