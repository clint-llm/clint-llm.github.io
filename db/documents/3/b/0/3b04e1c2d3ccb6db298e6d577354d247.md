The same physical and physiological principles responsible for pathologic heart murmurs are responsible for innocent heart murmurs. This principle is Turbulent Flow.

Innocent murmurs are heard in settings of:

- Physiologically increased turbulent flow, as in relatively narrow ventricular outflow tracts, high cardiac output states like anemia, and false tendons in the left ventricle

- Relative vessel narrowing, as seen with vessels stretching during periods of rapid linear growth

- With lung expansion after birth as seen in peripheral pulmonic stenosis
