Patients should be reevaluated and considered for a repeated banding attempt 6 weeks after the initial banding. Surgical excision can be considered for grade 3 hemorrhoids that persist despite banding. Medical assistants and nursing staff also help to monitor the patient during the procedure and follow up with the patient to check for bleeding and pain after the procedure.
