An interprofessional team greatly contributes to the effective treatment and prevention of vitamin A deficiency. The initial care in resource-rich settings typically falls to the primary care physician, who then coordinates with dietitians and pharmacists to ensure optimal nutrition and medical treatment. Gastroenterologists, bariatric surgeons, and transplant surgeons can help treat malabsorptive patients, post-bariatric surgery patients, and liver cirrhosis patients, respectively. Ophthalmologists are vital in evaluating and treating the multitude of VAD-related eye disorders. After acute evaluation and management of vitamin A deficiency, the primary care physician resumes preventive care.

In regions of the world with limited medical care, public health nurses are vital in providing high-dose VAS to the most rural areas. They are instrumental in making appropriate specialty referrals for those with more severe disease. Governments and international health organizations play huge roles in providing the funds and organization for continued supplementation, education, and fortification programs.
