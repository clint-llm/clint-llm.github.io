Histological examination of piloleiomyomas reveal interweaving bundles of smooth muscle cells with characteristic “blunt-ended cigar-shaped nuclei” and eosinophilic cytoplasm admixed with collagen bundles. Piloleiomyomas are typically found in the reticular dermis, close to a hair follicle. Mitotic figures are rarely seen, but if present or abundant, should raise suspicion for leiomyosarcoma. Usually, piloleiomyomas are easily identified on H and E staining, but “special stains” may occasionally be needed to confirm smooth muscle origin. Masson's trichrome stain, smooth muscle myosin (SMS), Van Gieson, stain, and immunohistochemical stains for smooth muscle markers, actin, and desmin, may be required for appropriate staining. Additional immunohistochemical testing may be performed to identify fumarate hydratase deficiency in the specimen or accumulation of precursor substances.

Angioleiomyomas are deeper, well-circumscribed neoplasms, mostly located in the upper subcutaneous tissues. The pathological examination will reveal tightly compact myocytes in a world pattern around vascular channels.

Genital leiomyomas, particularly scrotal lesions, tend to have a more spindle cell appearance, while vulvar lesions display more epitheloid cells.
