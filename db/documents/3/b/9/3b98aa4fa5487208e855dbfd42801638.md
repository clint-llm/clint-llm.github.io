The sundry clinical presentations of plague result from a single bacterium of the enterobacteria family, Yersinia pestis.Y. Pestis emerged as a genetic clone of Yersinia
tuberculosis (an enteral pathogen) after the acquisition of three pathogenic plasmids several thousand years ago.Rattus rattus (the domestic black rat) and Rattus novegicus (the brown sewer rat) are the most common hosts, while Xenopsylla cheopis (the oriental rat flea) is the most common and efficient vector. Humans contract the bacterium typically through the bite of an infected flea but may contract the disease in many other ways. Cases of plague contracted via direct handling of animal tissue with open skin lesions, inhalation of aerosolized bacteria, consumption of infected animals, and human to human spread have all been documented.
