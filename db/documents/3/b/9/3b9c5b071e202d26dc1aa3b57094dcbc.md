Azoospermia is considered a severe and important cause of male infertility amongst childless couples attempting pregnancy. Classifying and diagnosing the type of azoospermia includes taking a detailed history and physical examination, hormonal investigations, ultrasonography, and genetic testing. Strategizing the medications, treatments, procedures, and protocols is the key to treating couples with infertility.

Physical and emotional support is also essential. These will help enhance the physician's ability to recommend reasonable treatments with appropriate counseling and patient expectations. Collaboration with radiologists, urologists, reproductive endocrinologists, OB-GYN specialists, and their respective nursing care teams is imperative for providing the best possible outcomes for these couples. Trained and competent nurses are an integral part of the interprofessional healthcare team.
