During the peripheral nerve evaluation stage (step 1), a surgeon, a nurse, and an X-Ray technician are needed. During the implant stage (step 2), a surgeon, a nurse, a scrub technician, and an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist are necessary for the procedure. Optionally, a representative from the SNM manufacturer is available during the procedure to prepare and test the product for implantation, interrogation of the IPG, and checking the leads for motor response.
