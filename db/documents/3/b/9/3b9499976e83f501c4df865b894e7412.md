**Lymphofollicular****hyperplasia:**The management of lymphofollicular type of thymic hyperplasia depends on how it manifests. Depending upon the signs and symptoms, it could have the following approaches towards treatment.

**Myasthenia gravis:**Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as physostigmine or pyridostigmine could be used for the symptomatic treatment of myasthenia gravis resulting from thymic hyperplasia. These agents act by inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine in synaptic cleft leading to the availability of more acetylcholine to interact with remaining acetylcholine receptors not yet effected by autoantibodies. Corticosteroids can help improve the symptoms of myasthenia gravis, especially in the case of myasthenic crisis. However, the exact mechanism by which steroids act to help with symptoms has not been well understood.
