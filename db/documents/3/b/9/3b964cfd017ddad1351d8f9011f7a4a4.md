Mannitol can be used for the reduction of intracranial pressure and brain mass, to reduce intraocular pressure if this is not achievable by other means, to promote diuresis for acute renal failure to prevent or treat the oliguric phase before irreversible damage, and to promote diuresis to promote excretion of toxic substances, materials, and metabolites. There are also multiple uses of mannitol that are not FDA-approved. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of mannitol, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with conditions where it is of clinical value.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the FDA-approved indications for mannitol.
- Explain the mechanism of action for mannitol for each of the four FDA-approved indications.
- Review the adverse effects and contraindications for using mannitol.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mannitol and improve outcomes.
