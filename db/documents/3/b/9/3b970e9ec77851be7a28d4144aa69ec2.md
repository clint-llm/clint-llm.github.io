Most patients with Plummer-Vinson syndrome are initially asymptomatic. Plummer-Vinson syndrome classically presents as a triad of iron-deficiency anemia, post-cricoid dysphagia, and upper esophageal webs.

Interestingly, splenomegaly, enlarged nodular thyroid glands, andÂ edentia (loss of teeth) have also been found in a few patients with PVS.
