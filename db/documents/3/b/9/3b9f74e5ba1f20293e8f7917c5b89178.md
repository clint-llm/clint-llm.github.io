A comprehensive organ-system and generalized physical examination, considering visceral or central obesity, increased blood pressure, purple skin striae, non-generalized muscle atrophy, and skin discoloration, should be undertaken to evaluate adrenal cortical hyperplasia. Every sign and symptom of elevated level of plasma and urinary cortisol, including significant weight gain, abnormal menstruation cycles, hirsutism, should be considered.

Several other evidence of the indirect effect of hypercortisolisms including diminished bone mineral density, accumulated fat depositions in specific areas, like the posterior aspect of the neck and proximal to the clavicle, and fertility disturbances should raise suspicion for the adrenal cortical hyperplasia. In the presence of the mentioned signs and symptoms accompanied with a positive history of exogenous corticosteroid administration, there is a lack of demand for further diagnostic investigations. On the other hand, a variety of imaging and laboratory examinations, including brain MRI, chest and abdominal pelvic CT scan should be obtained to clarify the possible underlying cause of Cushing disease.
