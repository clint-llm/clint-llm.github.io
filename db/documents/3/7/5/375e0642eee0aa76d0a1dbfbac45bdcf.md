EMS practitioners are responsible for assessing a patient’s condition, determining the immediate interventions necessary, and the need and ability for scene extraction for further medical care. Additional equipment, personnel, or resources are obtained at the discretion of the EMS provider before proceeding.

The mental and physical demands of the tactical EMS practitioner require that they are at their best each day. Maintaining a level of excellence in the workplace is highly dependent on the degree of wellness outside of the work environment. Avoiding practitioner fatigue is important to ensure that each one will be capable of making the best decisions consistently and safely. All of the steps, pre-mission planning, and preparation will help to ensure the safest environment for all team members and patients.
