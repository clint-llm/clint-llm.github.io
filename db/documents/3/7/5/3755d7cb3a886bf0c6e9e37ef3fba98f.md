While many studies have shown promising results with the use of SCS and FPR for specific dysfunctions, there is limited research on the physiology. The most significant area of concern is the limited number of clinical studies to determine the physiology of SCS and FPR.

Other studies have also questioned the ability of SCS to reduce pain and disability as well as questioned the length of relief provided from treatment.

Despite studies that question the effectiveness, use, and physiologic foundations of SCS and FPR, the number of promising studies for treating specific dysfunctions suggests a positive impact on medical practice implementation.
