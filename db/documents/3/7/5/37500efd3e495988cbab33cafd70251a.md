Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma management is similar to other indolent small B cell lymphomas. Asymptomatic patients are usually managed by close observation, and symptomatic patients are managed by single-agent rituximab therapy without maintenance. Treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia depends on the extent of end-organ involvement and symptoms. Asymptomatic patients are managed by close follow-up every 1 to 2 months including serial IgM measurements and assessment of serum viscosity. Symptomatic patients are managed by chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or an autologous bone marrow stem cell transplant. Chemotherapeutic agents that are effective in managing Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia include dexamethasone, fludarabine, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide. A bone marrow transplant is usually reserved for younger patients with more extensive bone marrow involvement. Treatment algorithms for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia recommend rituximab and bendamustine as a first-line treatment. In cases of failure or relapse less than 36 months, bortezomib and cyclophosphamide or ibrutinib should be considered. Third-line treatment for Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia can be either fludarabine, everolimus, or lenalidomide. Plasmapheresis is useful in managing hyperviscosity
