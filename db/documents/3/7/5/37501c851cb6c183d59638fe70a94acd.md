Wrist instability is mostly caused by direct or indirect injury. After a fall, patients with a persistent wrist injury can see a specialist who is knowledgeable and skilled in hand/wrist injuries. In the acute stages of these injuries, before chronic carpal changes develop, treatment is less invasive. The definitive treatment, as well as the rehabilitation, is very important in regaining wrist functions.
