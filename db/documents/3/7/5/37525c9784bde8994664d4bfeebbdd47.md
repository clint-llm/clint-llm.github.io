PVD is a systemic disorder and for the most part progressive. The condition is associated with life and limb-threatening complications. Despite many advances in endovascular surgery, amputations of digits and limbs are not uncommon. Thus, the present-day approach is to prevent the disorder in the first place. There is ample evidence that changes in lifestyle can significantly decrease the rate of progression of the disease and improve the quality of life. Besides physicians, nurses and pharmacists have a vital role in preventing PVD. These two healthcare professionals should emphasize the importance of smoking cessation, maintaining a healthy weight and controlling blood sugars. The pharmacist should also ensure that the patient is not on any medications that can lead to vasoconstriction. The patient should be taught about basic foot hygiene and wear protective shoewear. The patient should be educated on signs of vascular disease and seek assistance if any changes occur. Finally, current guidelines indicate that PVD patients should be treated with a statin and either aspirin or cilostazol. An interprofessional approach to patient education and management will improve outcomes.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes of PVD depend on where the disease is located and gender. Overall, females appear to have worse outcomes compared to males, primarily because they have smaller vessels, which are more likely to become narrowed. When surgery is done in females for peripheral vascular disease, complications are also more frequent and serious.
