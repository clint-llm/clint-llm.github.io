Following a procedure, surgeons suture superficial fascia together to ensure that there is no weakness in the wound. If the suturing is not done correctly, the sutures can tear, resulting in wound dehiscence. If the patient is malnourished, suturing the fascia together can prove much more difficult, showing the importance of adequate nutrition pre-op. Wound dehiscence is a surgical emergency, and the diagnosis is usually clinical.

Aponeurotic fascia (fascia lata) can be used as a surgical patch by plastic surgeons.

In some cases, retaining ligaments of the face can be cut or released for aesthetic purposes.

A new technique has gained traction in recent years called myofascial release. It is a form of noninvasive manual therapy usually provided by physical therapists. The goal is to use sustained pressure along with stretching techniques to restore optimal length, decrease pain, and improve the overall function of the treated area. It has also shown promise for post-operative orthopedic surgery patients.

The Desarda technique is a surgical technique that sutures the aponeurosis of the external oblique to create a new posterior wall and result in a mesh-free, open, surgical treatment for inguinal hernias.
