Clobazam was first synthesized in 1966 and first published in 1969. The primary goal for developing this drug was to provide greater efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine (BZD) related side effects. It was approved in Australia (in 1970) and France (in 1974) for anxiety. Marketing for epilepsy began in 1984.
