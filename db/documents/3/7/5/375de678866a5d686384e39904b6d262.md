When the electrical activity of the SA node is blocked or is less than the automaticity of the AV node/His bundle, a junctional rhythm originates. Numerous conditions and medications can lead to a diseased SA node and lead to the AV node/His bundle taking over due to the higher automaticity of the ectopic pacemaker.

Some of these conditions and medications are listed below.

- Chest trauma

- Sick sinus syndrome

- Radiation therapy

- Collagen vascular disease

- Myocarditis

- Clonidine

- Reserpine

- Adenosine

- Cimetidine

- Antiarrhythmics class I to IV

- Lithium

- Amitriptyline

- Neuromuscular disorder

- X-linked muscular dystrophy

- Familial disorder

- Vasovagal simulation (endotracheal suctioning)

- Carotid sinus hypersensitivity

- Beta-blockers

- Calcium channel blockers

- Digoxin

- Ivabradine

- Opioids

- Cannabinoids

- Isoproterenol infusion

- Hypothyroidism

- Sleep apnea

- Hypoxia

- Intracranial hypertension

- Hyperkalemia

- Anorexia nervosa

- Amyloidosis

- Pericarditis

- Lyme disease

- Rheumatic fever

- Ischemic heart disease

- Acute myocardial infarction

- Acute and chronic coronary artery disease

- Repair of congenital heart disease

- Inherited channelopathy

Other than the above-listed causes of severe SA node disease, which can result in junctional rhythm, a high-grade second-degree heart block and a third-degree heart block can also result in a junctional rhythm. Digoxin toxicity can also lead to an accelerated junctional rhythm.
