There are multiple types of normal and abnormal respiration. They include apnea, eupnea, orthopnea, dyspnea hyperpnea, hyperventilation, hypoventilation, tachypnea, Kussmaul respiration, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, sighing respiration, Biot respiration, apneustic breathing, central neurogenic hyperventilation, and central neurogenic hypoventilation. Each pattern is clinically important and useful in evaluating patients. This activity covers the essential features of abnormal respiration and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the key concepts of abnormal respirations.
- Outline the issues of concern concerning abnormal respirations.
- Describe the clinical significance of abnormal respirations.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the recognition and management of abnormal respirations and improve patient outcomes.
