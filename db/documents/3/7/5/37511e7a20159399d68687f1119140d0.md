KS: The early initiation of antiretroviral therapy in AIDS-associated KS can lead to possible regression of the disease.

PEL: combination chemotherapy-based treatment includes CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and modified DA-EPOCH (etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide). Both have an overall survival rate of approximately 40% when used with combination antiretroviral therapy in HIV/AIDS patients.

MCD: Generally, combination chemotherapy with (CHOP or CVAD) is indicated, especially for systemic symptoms. Other treatment modalities are surgical excision, radiation, and immunological agents such as steroids, rituximab (anti-CD20), atlizumab (anti- IL-6 antibody) can be used in the treatment of MCD. Rituximab can be used alone or in combination therapy.

There are several medications in different stages of clinical trials that target the various stages of the pathogenesis of HHV-8 associated diseases. Some of these include the NF-ÎºB inhibitor (berberine, cepharanthine, bortezomib), which targets various stages of the oncogenic process. Others include medications targeting interleukin-2, interleukin-6, mTOR, MAPK/RTK signaling pathways, and angiogenesis.
