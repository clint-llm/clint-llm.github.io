There are various treatments for pain based on etiology, age, and chronicity of back pain. The best evidence in adult back pain according to the "Noninvasive treatments for low back pain: current state of the evidence" clinician summary published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2016:

In adults:

For radicular low back pain, nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise, traction, and spinal manipulation have shown some benefits but have relatively weak levels of evidence to support it. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have moderate evidence of benefit. However, other pharmacologic interventions, such as diazepam and systemic steroids, do not seem to provide benefits [AHRQ,Â  2016].

For non-radicular acute or subacute low back pain, acetaminophen appears to have weak evidence of no benefit. However, NSAIDs, heat, and muscle relaxants have moderate evidence for positive gain. Massage has weak evidence that leans toward being advantageous [AHRQ 2016].

For non-radicular chronic low back pain, there is moderate evidence to support physical therapy[AHRQ 2016], particularly utilizing the McKenzie method

According to the American Pain Society, surgical referral should be reserved for patients with disabling low back pain impacting the quality of life for greater than one year

In children:

In pediatrics, treatments for pain are less well studied. However, activity modification, physical therapy, and NSAIDs have broad support as first-line therapies
