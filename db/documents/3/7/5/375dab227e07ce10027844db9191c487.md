The infectious pulmonary process that occurs after abnormal entry of fluids into the lower respiratory tract is termed aspiration pneumonia. The aspirated fluid can be oropharyngeal secretions or particulate matter or can also be gastric content. The term aspiration pneumonitis refers to inhalational acute lung injury that occurs after aspiration of sterile gastric contents. In an observational study, it is found that the risk of patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia in developing aspiration pneumonia is found to be about 13.8%. The mortality rate from aspiration pneumonia is largely dependent on the volume and content of aspirate and can be up to 70%. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of aspiration pneumonia and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of aspiration pneumonia.
- Review the evaluation of patients with aspiration pneumonia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for aspiration pneumonia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with aspiration pneumonia.
