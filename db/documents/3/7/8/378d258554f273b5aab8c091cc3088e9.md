The occurrence of intestinal fistulae varies depending on many factors. Underlying disease prevalence, type, and quality of surgical practice, quality of healthcare, the incidence of trauma, and the use of radiation are among the factors influencing the incidence of intestinal fistulae.

In countries where Crohn's disease is prevalent, intestinal fistulae incidence tends to increase.

Age, gender, and racial prevalence of fistulae follow the pattern of underlying diseases. Low-quality healthcare and surgical practice relate with a higher morbidity and mortality from intestinal fistulae.
