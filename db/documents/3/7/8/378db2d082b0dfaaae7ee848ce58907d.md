The term schizoaffective disorder first appeared as a subtype of schizophrenia in the first edition of the DSM. It eventually became its own diagnosis despite a lack of evidence for unique differences in etiology or pathophysiology. Therefore, there have been no conclusive studies on the etiology of the disorder. However, investigating the potential causes of mood disorders and schizophrenia as individual disorders allows for further discussion.

Some studies show that as high as 50% of people with schizophrenia also have comorbid depression.
