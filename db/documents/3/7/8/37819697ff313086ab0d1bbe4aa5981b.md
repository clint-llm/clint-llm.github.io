Insulin glargine comes either in 100 ml vials or dosing pens containing 3 ml cartridges of medication and is administered via subcutaneous injection only. The drug is available at a concentration of 100 units per ml. Its administration includes a diluent with a pH of 4.0 to maintain the solubility of the drug before use. The medication is administered once daily at the same time of day by the patient. Decisions of when to administer insulin glargine depend on the patient's schedule and the resultant effects that the insulin has on the patient's blood glucose levels. Patients should rotate injection sites to avoid lipodystrophy; these include the top of the thighs, back of the upper arms, buttocks, or abdomen.

The estimated starting dose of insulin therapy is usually 0.4 to 0.5 units/kg per day of total insulin. However, differing amounts might be necessary for patients undergoing puberty or those with obesity. The current consensus regarding basal insulin dosing is that it should make up 50% of the total daily insulin requirement. Although it is worth noting that recent studies have suggested that a basal dose closer to 40% of total daily insulin may result in more optimal glycemic control.
