The best treatment for cholecystitis is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. There are low morbidity and mortality rates with quick recovery. This can also be done with an open technique in cases where the patient is not a good laparoscopic candidate. In situations in which the patient is acutely ill and considered a poor surgical candidate, he or she may be treated with temporizing percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder. Milder cases of chronic cholecystitis in patients considered poor surgical candidates, they may be treated with dietary adjustments of low-fat and low-spice diets. Results of this treatment vary. Medical treatment of gallstones with ursodiol also has been reported to have occasional success.
