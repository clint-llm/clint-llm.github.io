Ultrasound has uses in a wide range of musculoskeletal procedures, including joint or bursa aspiration to evaluate for infection or crystalline deposition disease, joint or bursa injection such as an arthrogram or steroid injection, tendon sheath injection, tendinosis therapy such as dry needling, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection, and percutaneous biopsy. Injections into a joint, bursa, or tendon sheath can be both therapeutic (pain relief) and diagnostic by allowing the referring provider to gain knowledge of the patientâ€™s pathology based on their pain response post-treatment.

Shoulder pain can be complex and multifactorial. Clinicians use a combination of physical examination, history, and imaging to establish a differential diagnosis.
