Since most prelingually deaf children are born to hearing parents, oral/verbal communication is usually preferred over visual sign-language communications. However, some parents favor signing because they are either deaf themselves or wish to preserve the communication culture of the deaf community. Clinicians should be aware of this dynamic but also provide patients and their families with all the information regarding assistive hearing devices.

Parents will need to be informed of the treatment options and given realistic expectations of hearing improvement. Depending on the etiology of hearing loss, the timing of diagnosis, and selected treatments, hearing outcomes can vary substantially. Parents should be encouraged to maintain a key role in their childrenâ€™s rehabilitation and be guided on the financial implications of their local health insurance system.
