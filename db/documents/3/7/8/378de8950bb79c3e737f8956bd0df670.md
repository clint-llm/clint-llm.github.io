Several states have mandated the obtaining informed consent is the duty of the physician.

Parental consent is typically necessary for medical evaluation and treatment. Clinicians and staff need to understand that they must obtain consent before seeing and providing care to pediatric and adolescent patients. However, parental consent is not a requirement in an emergency. The AAP states that a pediatric examination, treatment, and stabilization should take place in an urgent or emergent situation without parental consent. Efforts should be made to obtain consent, but therapy should not delay if parents are not in attendance or unreachable. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act mandates that providers treat patients in emergent medical situations regardless of consent.
