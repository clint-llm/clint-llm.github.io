Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM) – a rare inherited disorder arising from mutations in the ATGL gene, which results in systemic TAG accumulation, myopathy, cardiac abnormalities, and hepatomegaly.

Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome or NLSD with ichthyosis (NLSD-I) results from mutations in CGI-58, the activator of ATGL. They also exhibit systemic TAG accumulation, mild myopathy, and hepatomegaly but also present with ichthyosis, which is a skin disorder characterized by dry, thickened, scaly skin.

Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) type 4 is associated with a mutation in the PLIN1 gene coding for perilipin 1. It is characterized phenotypically by loss of subcutaneous fat from the extremities. Histologically, the six patients with this mutation have small adipocytes with increased macrophage infiltration and abundant fibrosis.

Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) type 6 occurs due to a mutation in the LIPE gene coding for hormone-sensitive lipase. It is characterized by abnormal subcutaneous fat distribution, and thus the complications commonly associated with it it. These include dysregulated lipolysis, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, increased fat storage in bodily organs, and dyslipidemia; others may even develop muscular dystrophy as indicated by elevated serum creatine phosphokinase.

There are many disorders of fat metabolism that present with serious and specific characteristics but are not discussed here as they are beyond the scope of lipolysis, specifically. These include, but are not limited to, fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) such as MCAD deficiency or primary carnitine deficiency and peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome and adrenoleukodystrophy.
