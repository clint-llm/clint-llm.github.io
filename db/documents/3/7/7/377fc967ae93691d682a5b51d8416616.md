When the vascular endothelium sustains an injury, the hemostatic process initiates the coagulation cascade to restore vascular integrity and prevent further bleeding. Platelet activation occurs at the site of vascular rupture initiating promulgation of clotting factors and fibrin formation, resulting in a platelet-fibrin plug to inhibit further bleeding. Factor VIII, the deficit of which causes hemophilia A, provides essential enhancement of thrombin generation and promulgation of fibrin formation to inhibit further bleeding. Factor VIII adheres to von Willebrand factor to protect it from proteolytic degradation. Bleeding in hemophilia results from defective fibrin stabilization secondary to inadequate fibrin generation, which results in a failure of secondary hemostasis. Insufficient thrombin in the coagulation cascade results in a deficiency of fibrin.
