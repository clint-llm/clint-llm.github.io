There is a clear need to combat weight stigma, widespread throughout healthcare globally. An important barrier to treating high weight patients’ obesity is the belief that obesity is simply a consequence of personal decisions of lifestyle and behavior. Starting in 2012, major medical associations began to recognize obesity as a disease, changing the framework for recognition and management of this disease.

Obesity is the consequence of genetic and environmental factors that trigger the complex pathophysiology of gut hormones and neuropeptides.

Once a clinician accepts obesity as a chronic disease that must be treated, good patient-clinician communication and cooperation must develop a productive individualized management plan. Using “people-first” language is an important communication statement that prefers terms such as “unhealthy weight” rather than “fat” and “morbidly obese.” Using techniques of motivational interviewing and shared decision-making helps guide the patients towards healthier options and change. While patients may be focused on the cosmetic benefits of weight loss, it is important as a clinician to share the health benefits of lower body weight. As little as a 5% weight loss has significant health benefits, including reductions in most chronic diseases and all-cause mortality and improved quality of life metrics.
