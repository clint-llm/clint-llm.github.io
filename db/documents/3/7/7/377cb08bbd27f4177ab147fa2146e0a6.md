Frontotemporal dementia has three distinct clinical syndromes based on the underlying pathologic mechanism characterized by intracellular deposition of abnormal proteins aggregates in the frontal and temporal lobes resulting in the degeneration of neurons, microvacuoles formation, and astrocytosis; hence the term frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Abnormal aggregates of transactive DNA-binding protein TDP-43 account for 50% of cases, microtubules-associated tau protein for 45%, and in 5% to 10% cases, tumor-associated protein fused in sarcoma has been found.
