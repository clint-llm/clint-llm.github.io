The supraclavicular block is a regional anesthetic technique used as an alternative or adjunct to general anesthesia or used for postoperative pain control for upper extremity surgeries (mid-humerus through the hand). First introduced in 1911 by Kulenkampff as a landmark-based approach, the associated risk of pneumothorax was likely responsible for the technique falling out of favor, although this can now be mitigated with modern imaging. This activity describes the indications, technique, contraindications of the supraclavicular block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in the supraclavicular block.
- Describe the indications for a supraclavicular block.
- Review the complications of a supraclavicular block.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing the supraclavicular block.
