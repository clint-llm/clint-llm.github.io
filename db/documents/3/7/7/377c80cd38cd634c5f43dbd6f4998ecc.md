The endotracheal tube (ETT) was first reliably used in the early 1900s.

Pediatric ETT’s are sized by age with options across the spectrum from premature infants to adult size teenage children. Historically, pediatric endotracheal tubes were uncuffed for fear that the pressure from the cuff would damage the trachea via pressure necrosis as the airway just below the vocal cords (cricoid cartilage) is the most narrow part in children.  In adults, the narrowest portion of the airway is the vocal cords.  Except for neonatal patients, this practice has largely been discontinued in favor of cuffed pediatric ETT’s.
