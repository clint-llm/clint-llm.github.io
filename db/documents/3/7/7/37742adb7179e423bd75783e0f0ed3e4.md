Ethosuximide (3-ethyl-3-methyl pyrrolidine-2,5-dione) is one of three succinimides known to have anticonvulsant properties. The other two succinimides, phensuximide and methsuximide, have worse side effect profiles and are less effective than ethosuximide.

Thalamocortical neurons are hypothesized to be generators of the classic 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges seen with absence seizures and rely heavily on low threshold T-type calcium channels to do so. Ethosuximide can lower the threshold of T-type calcium currents and disrupt the oscillatory activity of thalamocortical circuitry by blocking T-type calcium channels.
