Start the incision with the point of the blade contacting the apex of the ellipse. Then, use the sharper belly of the blade to carry the cut along the arc in a smooth and directed fashion while simultaneously maintaining traction of the surrounding area with the non-dominant hand. Repeat the same process on the other side of the lesion. Mark the tissue with non-dissolvable suture or by nicking a specified location of the excision while in situ or after completely removing the tissue. Use toothed forceps to grasp and elevate the tissue at the apex while dissecting the tissue at the level of the subcutis with a scalpel or blunt-tipped scissors. Care should be taken to dissect the tissue along an even plane, yielding a defect with an even base and smooth walls.

Hemostasis can be achieved with direct pressure or by cautery. While heat cautery will work in a wet field, electric cautery will only work in a dry field. Blotting with gauze or cotton-tipped applicator helps to maintain a dry field for electric cautery. Larger vessels may require ligation with absorbable suture.

A layered closure consists of absorbable deep sutures and non-absorbable superficial suture. Deep sutures eliminate dead space, decrease tension on the wound edges of the dermis and epidermis, and facilitate wound edge eversion. If there is little tension on the wound, place the first deep suture in the center of the lesion and the remaining deep sutures halfway between the middle suture and the apices of the lesion. The distance between deep sutures is then progressively halved. If there is tension on the wound, place the deep sutures at the apices of the lesion and then incrementally closer to the center of the lesion. This method helps reduce the amount of tension as the deep sutures are progressively placed.

The superficial sutures are then placed to approximate the epidermal wound edges. This is done with non-absorbable sutures that require removal after the wound is given time to heal, usually between one and two weeks. If the wound is not under tension and there is good epidermal approximation, adhesive tapes or tissue adhesive may be used in place of superficial sutures.
