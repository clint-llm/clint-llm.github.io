A detailed history is a requirement for all individuals with a presentation suspicious for ocular infection. Particular attention should apply to inquire about contact lens wear, recent corneal injury, and exposure to dust, soil, or contaminated water. Acanthamoeba keratitis usually presents unilaterally but may rarely occur in both eyes.

A comprehensive ocular examination is also necessary for patients with suspected ocular infection. Early findings on slit-lamp examination include an epitheliopathy with punctuate keratopathy, epithelial or subepithelial infiltrates, pseudodendrites, and perineural infiltrates.
