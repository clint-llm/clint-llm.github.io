Hypopharyngeal cancers are an uncommon type of head and neck cancers and are associated with worse prognosis compared to cancers from other head and neck sites. Alcohol and tobacco use are known risk factors, and a majority of the patients present at an advanced stage. This activity reviews the risk factors for hypopharyngeal cancers, outlines the staging and treatment of the disease, and explores the interprofessional team's role in the management of the patient.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the risk factors for the formation of hypopharyngeal cancer.
- Describe the frequent presentations of hypopharyngeal cancer.
- Review the diagnostic process and imaging modalities used in hypopharyngeal cancer.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies that can result in better care coordination for patients presenting with hypopharyngeal cancer.
