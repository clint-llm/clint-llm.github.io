There are no set criteria for diagnosis for AI in critically ill patients, but most agree that in hemodynamically unstable patients with random cortisol levels below 18 mcg/dL, a trial of glucocorticoid therapy is reasonable.

Studies also show that although CST can be a good indicator of adrenal function in critically ill patients without sepsis, it can be very variable in patients with sepsis. Therefore CST should carefully utilized and interpreted in a critically ill patient. It is of utmost importance that in a critically ill patient suspected of corticosteroid deficiency, the administration of steroids should not be delayed for testing of AI or CST. If clinically feasible, random serum cortisol and ACTH levels should be drawn before administration of stress dose steroids.
