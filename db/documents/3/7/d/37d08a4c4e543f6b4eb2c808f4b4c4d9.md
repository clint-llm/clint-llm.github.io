Meckel diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the GI tract. There is no clear familial predisposition. Patients with other malformation of the GI tract, nervous system, or cardiovascular system have increased the risk of having a Meckel diverticulum. The prevalence of Meckel diverticulum in the general population is estimated to be approximately 2%;Â however, it is difficult to determine the exact number because many patients are asymptomatic.
