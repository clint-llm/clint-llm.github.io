Although clinical features may be quite variable and nonspecific, MBD should be suspected in patients with chronic alcohol abuse and/or malnutrition who present with certain common neurological symptoms. These symptoms can include psychotic and emotional disorders that can appear somewhat in an acute, subacute, or chronic form

- Acute presentation is characterized by a sudden onset of loss of consciousness and seizures. Also, other features can be apathy, aggressiveness, confusion, seizures, and psychosis.

- Subacute features can be depression, ataxia, apraxia, agraphia, anomia, dysarthria, visual dyslexia. Some of these can be a part of an interhemispheric disconnection syndrome, with a unilateral presentation.

- Chronic forms can present as progressive severe global dementia, visual hallucinations, auditory delusions, and behavioral abnormalities. Also, there can be signs of interhemispheric disconnection syndrome.

Another pattern of classification, according to clinical status and brain injury detectable by magnetic resonance can be:

- **Type A**
- Great deficit of consciousness, seizures, dysarthria, and hemiparesis.
- Hyperintense swelling of the corpus callosum can be observed.
- Associated with a worse prognosis.

- **Type B**
- Presents with dysarthria, gait disturbance, interhemispheric disconnection symptoms, and less impairment in consciousness.
- Only partial callosal lesions on magnetic resonance.
- Associated with a better prognosis.
