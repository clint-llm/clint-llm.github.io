The prognosis of severe hyperhomocysteinemia in the setting of homocystinuria is poor if it is left untreated. For patients with hyperhomocysteinemia without homocystinuria, the prognosis is difficult to assess as there is not enough research. However, theoretically, there is an increased risk for osteoporosis, schizophrenia, and brain atrophy in specific populations that can increase the morbidity of these patients. Therefore, further research is needed to determine a patient's prognosis when diagnosed with elevated homocysteine.
