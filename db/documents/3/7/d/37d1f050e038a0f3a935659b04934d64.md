Temporal lobe epilepsy is usually diagnosed in the first two decades of life, and has no sexual predilection, although females may experience catamenial seizures. Obtaining a reliable epidemiological evaluation of the frequency of epilepsy, in general, has been historically challenging, due to difficulty with methodological ascertainment. One fundamental challenge arises as a result of various modifications made to the definition of epilepsy by the ILAE since the first classification.Â  Additionally, with regards to the diagnosis of temporal lobe seizures, diagnostic accuracy relies on the use of electroencephalography (EEG) and imaging studies, for which the accuracy is subject to the level of evaluator expertise, as well as the limitation to access to these resources on a global spectrum.

Approximately 60 percent of all forms of epilepsy are focal in origin, with the majority originating in the temporal lobe. About 48 to 56 percent of these cases occur bilaterally.
