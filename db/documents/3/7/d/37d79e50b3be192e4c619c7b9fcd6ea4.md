**Neonates**

- In the neonatal patient, treatment focuses on managing jaundice and preventing kernicterus. This includes phototherapy based on standard published guidelines. In severe cases, an exchange transfusion may be necessary.

**Children and Adults**

- In older patients, management depends primarily on the overall clinical picture. Less severe presentations may be managed with supportive care and discontinuation and avoidance of the offending agents. Treat any infections as indicated by history and exam. More severe cases may require transfusions.
