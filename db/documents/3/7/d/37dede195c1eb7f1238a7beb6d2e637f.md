The supraspinatus tendon muscle unit sees its greatest stress forces during shoulder abduction. It acts to depress the humeral head during abduction and forward flexion positions. This depression keeps the humeral head centered on the glenoid and functions to allow for the deltoid to maintain its mechanical advantage, and thereby its power.

Sources of rotator cuff dysfunction can include traumatic events as well as degenerative tears. As discussed above, supraspinatus tendonitis is on the spectrum of rotator cuff syndrome/dysfunction.

While traumatic tears can be from a single event, Neer estimated that 95% of rotator cuff tears might find their origin in supraspinatus tendonitis associated with anatomic impingement predisposition environments. The impingement pathway supposes a slower erosive degeneration of the tendon during arm abduction and overhead lifting events. The latter describes the classic scenario now more accurately referred to as "external impingement" of the shoulder.

Indeed, several studies have challenged the previously proposed 95% external impingement pathway.  Moreover, there is some data to suggest there is a significant genetic predisposition to rotator cuff pathologies, which may predispose to rotator cuff tendonitis or tearing from either etiology.
