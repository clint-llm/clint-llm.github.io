The diagnostic criteria for schizoaffective disorder have been reworded and addended since its inclusion in the DSM, making it difficult to subsequently conduct appropriate epidemiological studies. Thus, there have been no large-scale studies on the epidemiology, incidence, or prevalence of schizoaffective disorder. Research shows that 30% of cases occur between the ages of 25 and 35,Â and it occurs more frequently in women.
