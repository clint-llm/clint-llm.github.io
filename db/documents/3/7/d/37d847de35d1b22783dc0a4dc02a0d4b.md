The ophthalmic veins drain the orbital contents and are the link between the facial and intracranial veins. As such, dilation of the ophthalmic veins is an important clinical consideration. The differential diagnosis for dilated ophthalmic veins is broad, with most common pathologies including carotid-cavernous sinus or dural-cavernous sinus fistulas, venous thrombosis, and facial or orbital arteriovenous malformations.
