Spontaneous pneumothorax is an abnormal condition of the lung characterized by the collection of gas in the pleural space between the lungs and the chest wall. This condition occurs without an obvious etiology and can be classified as either primary or secondary. Patients may present with symptoms such as tachycardia and dyspnea. The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and can be confirmed with imaging. The following activity emphasizes the essential knowledge necessary for interprofessional teams to have while treating patients with spontaneous pneumothorax.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of a spontaneous pneumothorax.
- Describe the workup of a patient with spontaneous pneumothorax.
- Summarize the treatment options for spontaneous pneumothorax.
- Identify the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to encourage those with spontaneous pneumothorax to quit smoking and avoid air travel in order to prevent recurrences of this condition.
