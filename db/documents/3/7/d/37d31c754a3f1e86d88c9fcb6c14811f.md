Myotonia congenita (MC) is a genetic neuromuscular channelopathy that affects skeletal muscle fibers (striated muscle controlled by the somatic nervous system).

Historically MCÂ has been classified into two distinct conditions: Becker disease and Thomsen disease. Becker disease (BD) is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and classically results in a more severe myotonic picture, which can progress to permanent weakness. Thomsen disease (TD) is an autosomal dominant condition presenting earlier in childhood than BD and may be associated with milder features.
