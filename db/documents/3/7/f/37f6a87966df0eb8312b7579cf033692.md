Airway collapse can occur from various causes, and CPAP is used to maintain airway patency in many of these instances. Airway collapse is typically seen in adults and children who have breathing problems such asÂ obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is a cessation or pause in breathing while asleep. OSA may arise from a variety of causes such as obesity, hypotonia, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, among others.

CPAP may be used in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to treat preterm infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed and who may have respiratory distress syndrome from surfactant deficiency.

It is used in hypoxic respiratory failure associated with congestive heart failure in which it augments the cardiac output and improves V/Q matching.

CPAP can aid oxygenation via PEEP prior to placement of an artificial airway during endotracheal intubation.

It is used to successfully extubate patients that might still benefit from positive pressure but who may not need invasive ventilation, such as obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or patients with congestive heart failure.
