- Tonsils lie along the lateral wall of the oropharynx, in a fossa located between the anterior and posterior pillars. Five arteries provide blood supply to the tonsils. They include the tonsillar branch of the facial artery (main supply), ascending palatine artery, dorsal lingual artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and lesser palatine artery.

- While not providing direct blood supply to the tonsils, it is important to note that the internal carotid artery is approximately 2.5cm posterolateral to the tonsils and requires precaution during surgeries to avoid accidentally cutting it.
