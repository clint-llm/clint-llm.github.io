The diagnosis and management of patients with KF syndrome should include an interprofessional team consisting of a neurologist, orthopedic surgeon, pediatrician, nurse practitioner, physical therapist, and neurosurgeon, among other medical staff personnel. The disorder can be managed non-surgically or surgically, depending on the presence of symptoms. For patients with functional limitations, orthotics and assistive devices may be necessary. However, these patients need education about protecting the cervical spine. They should not participate in contact sports if there is absolute contraindication given the obvious risk of spinal injury. Those with moderate to severe spinal deformity should undergo lifestyle modification.

Several types of surgical procedures are available, but the outcomes are unpredictable. There is always a risk of serious complications, making it necessary to have an interprofessional team of surgical specialists, including neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, orthopedists, and oro-maxillofacial surgeons managing the patient. The outcomes of patients depend on the initial deformity. While some patients have no symptoms, a significant number have myelopathy and neuropathy, which significantly lowers the quality of life.
