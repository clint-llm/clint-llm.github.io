The blood vessels and lymphatics that course through the submandibular triangle are significant landmarks to note for surgical incision into the triangle. The facial artery, being the fourth branch of the external carotid artery, courses underneath the posterior belly of the digastric and sits behind the submandibular gland in the triangle. After the artery passes posterior to the submandibular gland, it courses superiorly across the inferior border of the mandible. The submental artery and mylohyoid artery also course deep to the submandibular gland within the triangle. The submandibular lymph nodes follow the veins in the triangle and drain many of the inferior portions of the oral cavity. The facial vein runs superficially to the submandibular gland and eventually joins the anterior branch of the retromandibular vein, forming the common facial vein that drains into the internal jugular vein.
