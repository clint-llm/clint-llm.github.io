Vohwinkel syndrome is characterized by a PPK, digital constriction bands (pseudoainhum), and hearing impairment/deafness. The PPK begins within the first few years of life and appears as a callus-like thickening on the palms and soles and is often referred to as having a “honeycomb” pattern.

The loricrin variant presents as mild, generalized ichthyosis with accentuation of the ichthyosis in flexural surfaces.
