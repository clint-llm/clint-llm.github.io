Dexrazoxane, an FDA-approved cardioprotective drug, has been successfully used to ameliorate cardiac toxicity seen in anthracycline-based (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin) chemotherapy recipients for cancer, mainly in advanced breast cancer patients, adult patients with soft tissue sarcomas, or small-cell lung cancer.

Dexrazoxane has also shown an indication in the prevention of surrounding tissue damage caused by extravasation of anthracyclines, which can occur upon administration of these chemotherapeutic drugs.

However, dexrazoxane treatment does not completely eliminate the risk of cardiac toxicity induced by anthracyclines, so it is necessary to check on the patient’s cardiac function before and consistently during therapy to analyze the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

**FDA-approved indications:**

1. Reduction of incidence and severity of cardiac dysfunction associated with anthracycline use.

2. Dexrazoxane can also be used to treat tissue damage caused by anthracyclines when they leak from the vein while being administered.

**Non-FDA-approved indication:**

Although a study is still underway as of this writing, dexrazoxane may act as a beneficial neuroprotectant to treat neurodegeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease.
