Despite being common, prostate cancer has the highest 5-year survival of all cancers at 98%. As previously discussed, localized prostate cancer is frequently indolent and has an excellent prognosis even if left untreated. By definition, patients with high-grade, high-volume cancer are more likely to progress to locally advanced and metastatic disease, but risks can be mitigated by early detection and treatment.

Evidence demonstrates similar outcomes for patients treated with active surveillance, surgery, and radiotherapy, although patient wishes and side effect profiles should be taken into account. Patients choosing monitoring strategies should be aware of a small increase in the risk of progression and that subsequent radical treatment will be required in around 50% of cases, as often for patient anxiety as for biochemical, clinical, or imaging evidence of disease progression.
