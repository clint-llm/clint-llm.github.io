HHT can affect multiple organ systems, and early recognition and screening for clinical manifestations and prompt interventions can decrease morbidity and mortality.  Epistaxis is one of the most common presenting symptoms.  Patients with HHT benefit from a multidisciplinary approach and ideally should be referred to a center that specializes in HHT.
