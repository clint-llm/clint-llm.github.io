The interprofessional team is extremely important in diagnosing, managing, educating, and treating hearing loss in the elderly. For diagnosis, there must be communication between primary care providers, otolaryngologists, audiologists, caregivers, and possibly even neuro-otology subspecialists. Careful coordination between the interprofessional team is necessary for adequate patient-centered care. Additionally, as management is often a continual process, close collaboration between team members is critical for adequate treatment of hearing loss.

Especially in the elderly, caregivers or family may also play a crucial role, as their understanding may beÂ important in patients receiving fully delivered care. Family and caregivers can help create a more conducive environment for speech comprehension by making concerted efforts to face the person when speaking, speaking clearly, and decreasing background noise. Notably, masks have become more common during the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, and care should be taken to recognize the impact masks have on speech comprehension in those experiencing hearing loss.
