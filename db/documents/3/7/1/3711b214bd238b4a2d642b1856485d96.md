**Interpretation**

Topographic maps are color-coded and can be used to interpret shape, curvature, and elevation.

Axial or Sagittal Map:

Axial maps display the distance from a particular point of the corneal surface to a reference plane in which the lens is located (i.e., if a line were to be drawn, it would cross the reference plane at a 90-degree angle).

Instantaneous or Tangential Map:

This map displays the slope of the corneal surface, determined by a tangential line to that point. Compared to the axial map, the instantaneous map better elucidates the changes of curvature in comparison to the rest of its surroundings and gives a better overall sense of shape.

Elevation Map:

Elevation maps compare the corneal data to a best-fit sphere (BFS) in relation to diameter and position. An 8 to 9 mm diameter is usually chosen when evaluating for refractive surgery as a smaller or larger diameter will skew the results to be more steep or flat, respectively.

Pachymetry Map:

Corneal thickness is shown on pachymetry maps. With a similar color map to the elevation map, green are the areas that are within normal limits of pachymetry. Red and warmer colors are thinner, while blue and cooler colors are thicker areas of the cornea.

Refractive Power Map:

Refractive power maps correlate the curvature of the corneal surface to the refractive function by using Snellâ€™s Law of Refraction.

Scheimpflug Imaging

Pentacam and Galilei are Scheimpflug imaging commonly used to identify subclinical and clinical keratoconus. There are many indices used to interpret the data and stage the degree of keratoconus. More information regarding their different specifications is discussed below under clinical significance.

AS-OCT

Rather than a coronal view, AS-OCT allows viewing of the anterior segment through the cross-section. Anatomy more posterior to the cornea can be appreciated, including the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber at different orientations. It gives a higher resolution image and can distinguish tear film, and various layers of the cornea, including the epithelial thickness.

**Limitations**

Evaluation using tomography and topography is non-invasive and carries no risk. However, it does require the patient to maintain a fixed gaze and can be inaccurate with eye movement.

In regards to the different methods of corneal imaging, each imaging device has its purpose and should not be used interchangeably, but are complimentary. Topography can only measure the anterior curvature of the cornea, while tomography can capture the posterior surface as well.

For example, AS-OCT is more accurate for visualizing the posterior surface of the cornea and should be used for preoperative imaging in determining surgical procedures. Slit-scanning machines, like the Orbscan, are inaccurate when measuring the posterior surface post-LASIK due to the disruption of the corneal interface, causing light scatter.

Ultrasound is a gold standard when measuring central corneal thickness, and a meta-analysis found Pentacam to be clinically equivalent.

Pentacam had lower precision when measuring axial, tangential, and refractive power maps, and pupil center corneal thickness but is still superior to Placido-disc analysis.

Numerous studies compare these imaging methods from different manufacturers. These imaging instruments have their benefits and drawbacks and should be chosen based on its intended purpose.
