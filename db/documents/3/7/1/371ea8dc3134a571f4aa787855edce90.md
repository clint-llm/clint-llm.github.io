The SCCT has recommended that CCTAs be performed by technologists adequately trained to perform cardiac CTs, CCTAs, and use of contrast injection devices.  One member of the team should be proficient in the insertion of peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters.  During image acquisition, a team member certified in advanced cardiac life support should also be available.  Finally a team member, typically, a physician or physician assistant, trained in the administration of beta-blockers and nitroglycerin should also be present during the scan.  The interpreting physician should be trained in CCTA according to the respective ACC/AHA Clinical Competence Statement.
