Evaluation by an eye care provider plays a critical role in confirming the diagnosis of LWE. While patients may initially present to nursing staff, primary care providers, or emergency room clinicians with symptoms, specialized tools such as slit lamp microscopes and ophthalmic stains and dyes (such as sodium fluorescein, lissamine green, and rose bengal) are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

Primary care providers and nurses should be very familiar with the various causes of ocular foreign body sensations, including LWE. This knowledge will enable them to recognize the signs and symptoms associated with LWE and make appropriate referrals to eye care specialists for further evaluation and management. By enhancing their understanding of LWE and its diagnostic tools, primary care providers and nurses can play a crucial role in ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis.

In addition to referrals, primary care providers and nurses can also provide initial support and comfort to patients by initiating ocular surface lubrication with artificial tears. This can help alleviate symptoms and provide temporary relief while patients await evaluation by an eye care provider.

Promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and education among healthcare professionals is essential for enhancing the overall management of ocular conditions like LWE. By fostering knowledge exchange and facilitating appropriate referrals, healthcare teams can ensure that patients receive the specialized care they need for conditions such as LWE, ultimately improving patient comfort and outcomes.
