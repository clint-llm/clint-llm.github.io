The prognosis is dependent on the following factors: time to debridement, the material injected, extent, and location of soft tissue injury, and the magnitude of pressure the device released.   These four factors should be the surgeon's focus when managing a patient with a high-pressure injection injury.

There is not a consensus on how urgently one must perform the initial debridement. However, there have been several studies that demonstrate increased morbidity with delays to the operating room. Hogan et al. found that patients injected with organic solvents showed a higher rate of amputation when initial debridement took place after 6 hours.

The material injected is arguably the most important factor when managing these patients and determining overall prognosis. Organic solvents such as turpentine, diesel fuel, and some forms of paint have detrimental effects on the surrounding soft tissue.   One study demonstrated that amputation was necessary for 80% of patients with turpentine injections but only 20% of patients with grease injections.

The location of the injection injury has also been shown to affect the risk of amputation. Hogan demonstrated a sixfold higher risk of amputation of the fingers compared to the palm and thumb.

It is unclear if there is a pressure threshold to determine the absolute indication for surgical amputation. However, multiple studies have reported an increased risk of amputation with higher pressured injuries.
