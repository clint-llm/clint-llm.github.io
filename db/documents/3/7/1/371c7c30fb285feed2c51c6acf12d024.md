The defining histopathologic feature of progressive supranuclear palsy is an intracerebral aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau with preferential involvement of the subthalamic nucleus, pallidum, striatum, red nucleus, substantia nigra, pontine tegmentum, oculomotor nucleus, medulla, and dentate nucleus.

**Macroscopic Pathology**

The gross examination of the brain in progressive supranuclear palsy often shows atrophy of the frontal lobe (especially the precentral gyrus), midbrain (especially the tectum), and to a lesser degree, the pons. The subthalamic nucleus is smaller than expected and maybe discolored gray.
