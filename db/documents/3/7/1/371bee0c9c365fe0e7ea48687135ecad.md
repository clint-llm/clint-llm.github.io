The exact pathophysiology of lipomas is unclear. However, benign lipomas can be present in almost any organ of the body. Subcutaneous lipomas are not usually fixed to the underlying fascia. That's why the fibrous capsule should be removed completely to prevent ist reoccurrence.

In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the lipomas present as submucosal fatty tumors. The most common locations include small intestines, stomach, and esophagus. Gastrointestinal lipomas become symptomatic only after luminal abstraction or bleeding. Mucosal erosion over lipoma may cause severe bleeding in the bowel.

Colonic lipomas are usually discovered incidentally on colonoscopy. A biopsy specimen of the lipoma will most likely reveal a mature adipocyte, which is called the "naked fat' sign. As with other lipomas, colonic lipomas can also cause pain with obstruction or intussusception.

However, several cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified, including the following:

- Mutations in chromosome 12q13-15, 65% of cases

- Deletions of 13q (10% of cases), rearrangements of 6p21-33, 5% of cases

- Unidentified mutations or normal karyotype, 15% to 20% of cases

Rearrangements of the 12q13-15 result in the fusion of the high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) gene to a variety of transcription regulatory domains that promote tumorigenesis.
