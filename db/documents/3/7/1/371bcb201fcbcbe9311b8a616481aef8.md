The prognosis for patients diagnosed with endometrial cancers depends not only on the extent of disease found by surgical-pathological staging but also on the histotype, size, grade, and of course, co-morbidities.   Using the older FIGO 1988 surgical classification for uterine corpus carcinoma, the overall five year survival results for patients treated in the years 1999-2001, regardless of histotype and grade, were: Stage IA 90.8%, Stage IB 91.1%, Stage IC 85.4%, Stage IIA 83.3%, Stage IIB 74.2%, Stage IIIA 66.2%, Stage IIIB 49.9%, Stage IIIC 57%, Stage IVA 25.5%, and Stage IVB 20.1%. Besides the depth of invasion, lymphovascular involvement and carcinoma positive peritoneal cytology are associated with higher recurrence and poorer survival rates in patients with the Stage I (FIGO, 1988) cancers; although these factors are not used for staging in the current FIGO 2009 classification system (see above: Staging). Reported 5-year survival results using strictly clinical staging were significantly worse for Stages I, II and III (FIGO, 1988), likely reflecting the selection of patients deemed inoperable due to medical complications. Overall, patients with non-endometrioid and dedifferentiating cancers did worse, stage by stage, than those with endometrioid grade 1 tumors.
