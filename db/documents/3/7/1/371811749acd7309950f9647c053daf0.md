The care of patients with schizencephaly should be with an interprofessional team approach. When a primary clinician evaluates a patient with developmental delay, referral to a pediatric neurologist is recommended. The interprofessional team may include a pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, pediatric neurosurgeon, nurse, and pharmacist. Each team member should contribute from their specialty and openly communicate with other team members if they note anyÂ concerns. In fact, open communication is crucial to the success of the interprofessional model; this also includes meticulous record-keeping for each interaction or intervention on the patient so all members of the care team can access the same updated information. Clinicians will guide the overall directions of care, employing various specialties as necessary. Nurses can counsel patients and/or parents and will assist in cases that require surgical intervention with patient preparation and during the procedure, as well as providing post-procedure care and monitoring. Pharmacists will verify dosing and counsel patients or parents on the medication that may accompany the management of this condition [Level 5]
