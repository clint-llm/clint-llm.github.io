A detailed history delineates possible precipitating factors for acute hepatic decompensation. The following information should be obtained from the patient's chart, patient, or family:

- A known chronic liver condition, the degree of fibrosis or cirrhosis

- Any known history of hepatic decompensation

- Any concomitant relevant chronic health conditions

- The timeline of symptoms the patient presented with regarding systemic features, fluid overload, gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, altered mental status

- Toxic habits or high-risk behavior

- Any recent change in medications or recent ingestion of hepatotoxins including herbal products and sedatives/analgesics

- Any recent history of travel

- Any recent surgeries, including a TIPS procedure

Physical exam findings may include hypotension, altered mental status, jaundice, asterixis, fever (with possible infectious etiology), right upper quadrant discomfort, pain, and tenderness, with associated nausea, and signs of fluid overload.
