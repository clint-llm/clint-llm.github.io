A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for patients with LP. Counseling may involve a dermatologist, otolaryngologist, neurologist, psychiatrist, dentist, and geneticist depending on manifestations of the disease. Like other autosomal recessive conditions, carrier testing and reproductive counseling should be offered to patients and their family members.
