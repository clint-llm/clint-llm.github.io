As with any surgical procedure, there is a risk of bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures. High-risk patients may be at increased risk for complications that may result in significant morbidity. Complications can be divided into immediate, early (days to months), or late (after maturity).

- **Immediate Complications:**Hematoma, bleeding, edema, ischemic steal syndrome, or loss of thrill secondary to acute thrombosis or intra-arterial flap

- **Early Complications:**Stricture, thrombosis, infection, venous hypertension, central venous stenosis, ischemic steal syndrome, or failure to mature

- **Late Complications:**Aneurysm, stricture, late thrombosis, infection, or neuropathy

The most common dialysis fistula complications that may require intervention include aneurysm, infection, thrombosis, central venous stenosis, ischemic steal syndrome, and failure to mature.

- **Aneurysm:**Repeated needle punctures in a centralized area can weaken the vascular access wall and cause aneurysm formation. Aneurysmal dilation can also occur over time due to high blood flow and be accelerated by elevated pressures within the fistula. Aneurysms generally require surgical repair if there is a loss of skin integrity, ulceration, or limited puncture sites available. High-risk aneurysms that are left untreated can result in rupture and fatal exsanguination.

- **Infection:**Most AV fistula infections involve perivascular cellulitis presenting as erythema, edema, and possible systemic signs. Localized infections can be treated with appropriate antibiotics based on wound and blood cultures. More serious infections associated with aneurysm, hematoma, or abscess require surgical excision and drainage.

- **Thrombosis:**Thrombosis is the most common fistula complication and occurs in areas of stenosis, either at the anastomosis or fistula vein. The risk of thrombosis increases with the degree of stenosis. Compared to AV grafts, fistulas have lower rates of thrombotic events.

- **Central Venous Stenosis:**Venous hypertension can result from central venous stenosis and causes upper extremity swelling that may progress to decreased mobility. The most common cause of central venous stenosis is the placement of central venous catheters and devices. Central stenosis may present as reduced quality of dialysis, problems with cannulation, pain in the area of the fistula, or increased venous pressures.

- **Ischemic Steal Syndrome:**Steal syndrome is the result of decreased blood flow to the distal extremity after AV fistula creation. Clinically significant implications include pain, decreased motor function or sensation, or neuropathy. The rate of ischemic steal syndrome is decreased in forearm fistulas when compared to upper extremity fistulas. Furthermore, when compared to AV grafts, fistulas have a two-fold lower risk of developing steal syndrome.

- **Failure to Mature:**One of the most common causes of failed maturation is due to anastomotic stricture caused by neointimal hyperplasia. Stricture is defined as a greater than 50% decrease in the luminal diameter of the outflow vein.
