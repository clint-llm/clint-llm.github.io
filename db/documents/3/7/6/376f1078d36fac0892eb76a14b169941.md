Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic that has a binding affinity for dopaminergic (DA), serotonergic (5HT), adrenergic (a1), and histaminergic (HA) receptors. Regarding treatment for schizophrenia, antagonism of the dopamine (D2) receptor in the mesolimbic pathway has proven efficacious in diminishing positive symptoms, whereas the antagonism of the 5HT2A receptor in the mesocortical pathway has demonstrated reduction of negative symptoms of psychosis. Its efficacy and mechanism of action for treating bipolar disorder are unknown. The antagonization of both histaminergic and adrenergic (a1) receptors can induce somnolence and orthostatic hypotension.
