Approximately 795000 people suffer from stroke annually in the US. By this estimate, one person gets a stroke every 40 seconds, and approximately one patient dies due to stroke every 4 minutes.

Acute stroke can be classified as ischemic, hemorrhagic, subarachnoid, cerebral thrombosis, and spinal stroke.

About 80 to 87% of all strokes are of ischemic origin. Ischemic stroke is further divided into five subtypes:

- Large-artery atherosclerosis

- Cardioembolism

- Small-vessel occlusion

- Stroke of other determined etiology

- Stroke of undetermined etiology

Risk factors of stroke can be divided into modifiable and non-modifiable. Modifiable factors are hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, alcohol and drug use, physical inactivity, atrial fibrillation. Non-modifiable factors are age, sex, race, genetics.
