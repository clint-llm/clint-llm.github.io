History of the patient should include duration and external temperatures during exposures.

Physical examination may reveal blanched, white skin. Patients may complain of heaviness in an exposed extremity as numbness progresses. In later stages of frostbite, exposed areas may become dark or purplish in hue due to poor vascular tone and pooling of blood. Superficial frostbite affecting the epidermis and subcutaneous fat will have pale, white blisters upon rewarming. Deep, full-thickness frostbite will become hemorrhagic with rewarming and may become gangrenous.

It is important to know that the initial exam will not accurately reveal the final depth and extent of the injury.

Rewarming injury

During rewarming, edema may start to appear within 3-5 hours and may last 7 days. Blisters tend to appear within 4-24 hours.

Presence of eschar will be obvious at 10-15 days and mummification with a line of demarcation may develop in 3-8 weeks.
