Photodynamic therapy is not only used in dermatology but also in the fields of general oncology, cardiovascular, and ophthalmology. The various indications in dermatology include:

- Approved Indications:

- Actinic Keratoses: 

- Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of hypertrophic actinic keratoses on the face and scalp only with blue light. An ALA patch and an ALA gel formulation with nanoemul­sion with red light are also approved in Europe. In the FDA-approved protocol, the photosensitizer is to be applied only to the lesions, but due to the phenomenon of field cancerization, many providers are using broad facial applications. For broad area application, incubation period should be less than an hour in order to prevent a phototoxic reaction. Methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) is approved with an incubation period of 3 hours under occlusion with 37 J/cm2 or 75 J/cm2 of red light. A single therapy session is approved in Europe, with repeated sessions after three months for non-responsive/incompletely responsive lesions. Two therapy sessions using MAL instituted seven days apart are approved by the FDA.


- Basal Cell Carcinoma: MAL photodynamic therapy is also approved for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in Europe.
- Bowen disease: MAL photodynamic therapy is also approved for the treatment of Bowen disease in Europe.

- Off-label Indications:

- Cutaneous premalignant and malignant conditions: nevoid BCC syndrome (Gorlin syndrome), actinic cheilitis, disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis, keratoacanthoma, Kaposi sarcoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, cutaneous metastasis.
- Inflammatory dermatological disorders: psoriasis, acne vulgaris, scleroderma, lichen sclerosis, alopecia areata.
- Cutaneous infections: prevention of MRSA infection, leishmaniasis, tinea pedis, HPV infections/ dermatosis (verruca vulgaris, condylomata, epidermodysplasia verruciformis), molluscum contagiosum.
- Aging and photorejuvenation: PDT has been reported to stimulate the production of type 1 and type 3 procollagen and hence augment dermal remodeling.
- Tumor prevention

Indications of photodynamic therapy in the field of ophthalmology include:

- Neovascular age-related macular degeneration: Verteporfin photodynamic therapy was developed to treat subfoveal choroidal neovascularization in wet age-related macular degeneration. TAP and VIP studies approved the use of verteporfin PDT for wet age-related macular degeneration. However, after ANCHOR and MARINA Trials, Anti-VEGF injections became the mainstay of treatment for wet AMD. Currently, the role of PDT in treating wet AMD is limited and is generally used nowadays either in cases refractory to ant-VEGF injections or as a combination therapy with anti-VEGF injections.

- Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV): PCV often manifests as massive sub-retinal exudation and hemorrhage. Anti-VEGF injections, laser photocoagulation, and PDT are various modalities deployed to treat PCV.

- Non-AMD choroidal neovascularization: In recent years, anti-VEGF therapy has become the mainstay of treatment for non-AMD choroidal neovascularization like in myopic choroidal neovascular membrane (myopic CNVM), angioid streaks, idiopathic myopic CNVM, owing to better safety profile and better visual outcomes, and thus the role of PDT is limited in such conditions.

- Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR): CSCR is generally a self-limiting pathology in most cases, affecting young individuals. For chronic and recalcitrant CSCR, focal laser photocoagulation has been the mainstay of treatment. But laser can potentially cause significant adverse effects like symptomatic scotomas, RPE atrophy, and secondary CNVM. To overcome these side effects, Subthreshold micropulse diode laser may be used with similar results and way less collateral damage. However, Verteporfin PDT is now generally considered to be the preferred treatment modality since it can directly target the principal abnormality of choroidal hyperpermeability.

- Choroidal hemangioma: Various techniques have been used to treat choroidal haemangiomas in the past, including laser photocoagulation, transpupillary thermotherapy, and radiation therapy (external beam, plaque brachytherapy, or proton beam). Verteporfin PDT is now considered to be the treatment of choice for this condition.
