Syphilis is the leading spirochetal infection associated with Jarisch Herxheimer reaction (JHR). After first described in association with syphilis, the reaction has been noted in other infections of bacterial, fungal, and protozoal origin. Some of the other well-reported infections associated with JHR areÂ Lyme disease, louse-borne relapsing fever, leptospirosis, and tick-borne relapsing fever. Antibiotics that have been most associated with the development of JHR are penicillins, tetracyclines, and erythromycin. Newer antimicrobial agents such as cephalosporins, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, meropenem, and azithromycin can also cause JHR.
