Both the superior and inferior colliculi arise from the tectum, which forms from the mesencephalon during development. Expression of transcription factors Engrailed 1 and Engrailed 2 have involvement in the positioning of the mesencephalon during the development of vertebrates. In mouse models, research has found that if Engrailed 2 is knocked out, mice fail to develop both colliculi and the cerebellum. Mice that had Engrailed 1 knocked out had a reduction in the size of both the cerebellum and colliculi. A study determined that Engrailed 1 and Engrailed 2 must work in tandem for correct mesencephalon development to occur.
