The mpox (monkeypox) virus was first isolated and identified in 1959 when monkeys shipped from Singapore to a Denmark research facility fell ill.

Coincident immunity to the mpox virus was previously achieved with vaccinia vaccination; however, eradicating smallpox and subsequent lack of vaccination efforts paved the way for mpox to gain clinical relevance.
