After presenting with clinical symptoms and imaging findings compatible with a low-grade glioma, the determination of surgical operability is typically considered first. Surgery is indicated in patients with a significant mass effect and neurological deficits secondary to the tumor, and the decision-making becomes obvious. The major challenge arises when the tumor is detected incidentally when an individual presents with a seizure or other neurological symptoms like headache, which is medically controlled and is otherwise asymptomatic.

Multiple factors need to be taken into consideration while making this decision, which includes the preference of the patient and prognostic factors like age, tumor size, and location. Adjuvant treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be considered in patients that have a high risk of recurrence based on age and extent of resection. In low-risk cases where observation is commonly chosen, serial imaging should be performed with a plan to revisit the decision appropriately based on follow-up studies.
