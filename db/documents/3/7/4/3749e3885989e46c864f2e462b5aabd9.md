Primary orbital tumors are very rare. Early signs of orbital mass may be subtle and should be familiar to healthcare professionals inside and outside the field of ophthalmology. Some signs and symptoms of concern include proptosis, vision loss, restriction of extraocular muscle movements, and ptosis. Additionally, providers should become familiar with imaging and histopathologic characteristics of various primary benign orbital tumors. Management of orbital tumors can be complex due to the limited space and various important structures within the orbit. It is important to know when an orbital mass can be observed and when surgical excision is warranted.
