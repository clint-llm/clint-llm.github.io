Piloleiomyomas are a type of cutaneous leiomyoma. Patients with one or more piloleiomyomas should be evaluated for Reed syndrome, also known as Hereditary Leiomyomatosis with Renal Cell Carcinoma, which is likely an underdiagnosed condition. Affected patients suffer from early onset type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma, which, in 50% of patients, is metastatic at the time of diagnosis. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of cutaneous leiomyomas, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with cutaneous leiomyomas.
