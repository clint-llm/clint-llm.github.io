Amantadine keratopathy is a rare dose-dependent disease process in which the drug amantadine causes damage to corneal endothelial cells through unknown mechanisms. Damage to the endothelium can ultimately lead to severe corneal edema with decreased visual acuity. Edema is typically reversible with discontinuation of the drug, but irreversible cases requiring corneal transplants have been reported. This activity describes the evaluation and management of amantadine keratopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of amantadine keratopathy.

- Explain the risk factors for developing amantadine keratopathy.
- Identify the treatment options available for amantadine keratopathy.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to advance the care of amantadine keratopathy and to improve outcomes for patients with this condition.
