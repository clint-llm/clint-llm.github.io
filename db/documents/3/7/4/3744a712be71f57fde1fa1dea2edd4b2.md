Prognosis depends on the specific nerve agent exposure, amount, route, and duration of contact with the agent. Glasgow coma score (GCS) less than 13 portends a poor prognosis. The poisoning severity scale was originally used to determine prognosis but other scoring systems like Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS-II), and the Mortality Prediction Model II (MPM-II) outperformed it in predicting death in multiple studies
