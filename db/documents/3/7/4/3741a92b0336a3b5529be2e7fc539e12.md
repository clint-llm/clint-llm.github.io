Genetic mutations responsible for retinitis pigmentosa produce biochemical dysfunction, specifically affecting rod photoreceptors in the retina. Defects may be associated with multiple pathways of injury, including apoptosis, light damage, ciliary transport dysfunction, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.Â The common result of all the possible pathways is the death of the rod photoreceptors.

More than 100 genetic loci on 50 different genes have been found to cause multiple patterns of inheritance and expression for retinitis pigmentosa. Approximately 20% of RP cases are autosomal recessive, with 10 to 20% autosomal dominant and 10% X-linked recessive. The remaining cases are termed sporadic, and no family history or known molecular basis is found.
