According to one recent study, later development of PTSD is strongly associated with acute stress disorder (ASD). It also showed that an abnormal fMRI is associated with subsequent PTSD severity.

ASD patients are 24 times more likely to die from a suicide attempt compared to those without ASD. One study found that all-cause mortality for patients with a stress disorder diagnosis is two times more than those without.

Avoidance of many conditions that remind the patient of the traumatic event may continue to persist after the initial incident. For example, a car accident patient might avoid driving a car. The patient might lose their job due to abstinence from work or poor work performance. Resulting financial hardships can lead to homelessness in some cases. Social relationships can be limited and lead to break-ups with significant others, which would make the patient's emotional life, even more complicated.
