An echocardiogram is the investigation of choice for pulmonary regurgitation as it determines the severity, cause, mechanism, and determines progression to ventricular remodeling and heart failure.

Cardiac MRI can be used in moderate and severe PR and has been found to be as useful in noninvasive Doppler echocardiography. It can be used to quantify the regurgitant jet and can be used for monitoring the progression of the disease.

Exercise stress EKG is used in order to assess the risks associated with progressive RV dilation. It is particularly useful in detecting ventricular arrhythmias and in assessing the risk of sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular morbidity.
