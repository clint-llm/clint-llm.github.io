Patients suffering from this condition can develop or exacerbate anxiety, depression, and body vigilance. Secondary complications of persistent postural-perceptual dizziness include neck stiffness, gait disorder, fear of falling, agoraphobia, fatigue, and dissociation. Clinicians must understand that PPPD is not a psychiatric condition and that psychiatric conditions can develop due to PPPD making life worse for patients.

Fear of leaving home can arise as patients may attempt to avoid a setting in which their symptoms are exacerbated.
