CBC and platelet counts are obtained on patients at initiation of acetazolamide therapy and at regular intervals during therapy as acetazolamide is a sulfa drug. If there is a significant change from the baseline, discontinue the therapy. It is also recommended to monitor serum electrolytes periodically.
