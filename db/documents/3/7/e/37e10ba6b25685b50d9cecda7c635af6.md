Type II DM is a public health epidemic in the United States. The rate of obesity and DM, even in young people, is increasing at an alarming rate. With this increased incidence is an increase in the number of serious DFUs and infection. Diabetes is the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations in the United States. A patient who undergoes an amputation of a lower limb for a diabetic foot infection has a greater than 50% chance of losing the contralateral limb in the next year. There is a 70% mortality at five years in a patient who has undergone an amputation and has diabetes and a 74 % mortality rate at two years in a patient with DM who is on renal replacement therapy.

There are several Grading Systems for DFUs, with the Classic Wagner Grading system being the most commonly used; it consists of 5 grades based on anatomy and presence of infection and gangrene, from Grade 0 to Grade 5. The most superficial ulcer is a Wagner grade 1, the deepest, most serious, infected, and gangrenous is a Wagner 4. Most patients being treated at Wound Centers for DFUs present with Wagner 2 through 4 ulcers.

**Wagner Scale**

- Grade 0: no open lesions, may have healed lesions

- Grade 1: superficial ulcer, no penetration in deeper layers

- Grade 2: deeper ulcer reaching tendon, bone, or joint

- Grade 3: deeper tissues are involved, with abscess, osteomyelitis, or tendonitis

- Grade 4: gangrene of some part of the foot

- Grade 5: gangrene of the whole foot or enough of the foot that limb amputation is indicated
