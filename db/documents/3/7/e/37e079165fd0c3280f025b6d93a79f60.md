Spondylolysis refers to a posterior defect in the vertebral body at the pars interarticularis. Usually, this defect is due to trauma or from a chronic repetitive loading and hyperextension. If this instability results in translation of the vertebral body, spondylolisthesis has occurred. This process requires a fracture or deformation of the posterior spine elements creating an elongation of the pars. This condition occurs in all ages with the underlying cause varying based on the age group. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different types of spondylolisthesis, differentiating the patholological features that distinguish each variety.
- Outline the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Describe management strategies for spondylolisthesis, based on which variant of the condition with which the patient presents.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis.
