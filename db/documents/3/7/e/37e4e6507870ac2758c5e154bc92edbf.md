The primary signs and symptoms of giant fornix syndrome are chronic conjunctivitis with abundant, yellow purulent discharge and abnormally deep superior (or rarely inferior) conjunctival fornices. Some associated symptoms may include but are not limited to redness, pain, blurry vision, ptosis, and foreign body sensation.

Giant fornix syndrome is typically unilateral but can be bilateral. Patients may present with ptosis due to underlying inflammation of the superior conjunctiva. In severe cases, patients misdiagnosed for months to years may have corneal damage, including scarring, near or complete corneal perforation, vision impairment, pseudomembranous formation, and punctate epithelial keratopathy.
