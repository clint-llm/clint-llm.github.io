Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are typically (70%) benign tumors, which are most commonly caused when genes controlling tyrosine kinase expression undergo mutation leading to neoplastic growth involving cells from the lineage of the interstitial cells of Cajal. GISTs most commonly occur along the gastrointestinal tract but may occur extra gastrointestinally in rare instances. The most common findings of GIST include subendothelial lesions seen on an endoscopy or contrast-enhancing mass with a smooth margin on CT. For malignant GISTs, the lymphatic spread is extremely rare, and these lesions most commonly spread hematogenously (most commonly to the liver) or to the peritoneum.
