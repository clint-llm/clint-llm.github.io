The history should focus on age, gender, demographics (geographic area where the patient spent most of his life to determine if the patient is from an endemic goiter area), information of iodine deficiency, medical history (that should include medication use, exposure to head and neck irradiation), history of accidental or work-related radioactivity exposure, symptoms of hyperthyroidism and symptoms of goiter.

Symptoms caused by the effect of hyperthyroidism are the following:

**Common Presentation**

- Heat intolerance

- Weight loss

- Tremors

- Palpitations, tachycardia

- Increased bowel frequency

- Menstrual irregularity

- Sweaty palms, excessive sweating

**Less Commonly Presentation**

- Symptoms of muscle wasting and proximal myopathies like difficulty in rising from squatting or climbing stairs

- Atrial fibrillation

- Frequent fractures (due to osteoporosis)

- Lid lag and stare

- Decreased libido

- Enuresis in children

**Presentation Due to Neck Mass**

- Dyspnea

- Dysphagia

- Hoarseness of voice

- Tracheal compression (less common)

Physical exam findings in these patients secondary to the enlarged thyroid gland are multiple soft, smooth, mobile nodules. Findings due to hyperthyroidism are flushing, diaphoresis, thin and moist skin, thinning of hair, stare, lid lag, tremor, irritability, hyperkinesis, nervousness, psychiatric disturbances, normal or exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, and proximal myopathy.

Patients with Plummer disease have fewer signs and symptoms than those with Graves disease.
