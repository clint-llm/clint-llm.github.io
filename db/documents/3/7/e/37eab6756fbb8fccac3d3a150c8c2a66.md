The history findings of bacterial pneumonia may vary from indolent to fulminant. Clinical manifestation includes both constitutional findings and findings due to damage to the lung and related tissue. The following are major history findings:

- Fever with tachycardia and/or chills and sweats.

- The cough may be either nonproductive or productive with mucoid, purulent or blood-tinged sputum.

- Pleuritic chest pain, if the pleura is involved.

- Shortness of breath with normal daily routine work.

- Other symptoms include fatigue, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia.

Physical findings also vary from patient to patient and mainly depend on the severity of lung consolidation and existence or nonexistence of pleural effusion. The following are major clinical findings:

- Increased respiratory rate.

- Percussion sounds vary from flat to dull.

- Tactile fremitus.

- Crackles, rales, and bronchial breath sounds are heard on auscultation.

Confusion manifests earlier in older patients. A critically ill patient may present with sepsis or multi-organ failure.
