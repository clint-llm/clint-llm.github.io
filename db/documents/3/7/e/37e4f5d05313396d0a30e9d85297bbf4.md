Education is crucial in the prevention of allergic reactions. Patients need to be educated on foods likely to cause cross-reactions with latex sensitivity and any products that contain latex. It is also important to notify any members of the healthcare team involved with caring for the patient that there is an allergy. Patients must be given alternatives to latex products and if patients comply, there will be a decreased risk of reactions.
