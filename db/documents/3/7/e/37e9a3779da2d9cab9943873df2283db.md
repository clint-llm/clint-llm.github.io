Adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening disorder that can lead to very high morbidity and mortality if not recognized. Because of the varied presentation, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of an endocrinologist, radiologist, an infectious disease specialist, intensivist, critical care nurse, and a pharmacist. While the cause of adrenal insufficiency is being investigated, the patient should immediately be managed with corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids because even with treatment, mortality rates remain high. The pharmacist should assist with medication reconciliation and appropriate dosing. Once treatment is initiated, patients need close monitoring by a specially trained critical care nurse with open and rapid communication with the clinicians. Any infection or stress can precipitate adrenal crisis leading to death. Hence, the nurses should educate patients about the symptoms and when to return immediately to the emergency department.
