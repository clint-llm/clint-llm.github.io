The adductor magnus muscle is both a dynamic stabilizer of the pelvis and femur as well as a prime mover of the femur into adduction. The adductor magnus can be likened to the deltoid muscle; one portion flexes the thigh and works as a medial rotator while the other extends the thigh and is a lateral rotator, and both portions adduct the thigh. This is similar to the anterior (flexor/medial rotator/abductor) and posterior (extensor/lateral rotator/abductor) actions of the deltoid. The curvilinear attachment of the adductor magnus on the pelvis is also reminiscent of the curvilinear attachment of the deltoid on the spine of the scapula, acromion, and clavicle. Additionally, both muscles serve as dynamic stabilizers of the ball and socket joints with which they are associated, shoulder or hip, respectively. This comparison may aid students in making the correlations between the functions of the upper and lower extremities.
