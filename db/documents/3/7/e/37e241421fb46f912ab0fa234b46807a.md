Both physical features and family history can help establish the diagnosis of Holt-Oram syndrome. Specifically, a family history of congenital heart malformations should warrant further investigation with an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.Â In addition, upper limb x-rays can demonstrate various abnormalities. Finally, genetic testing looking for TBX5 mutations should be a consideration.

In addition to using physical features to aid in the diagnosis, a lack of certain features are involved, the diagnosis is unlikely: head and face region, eyes, ear malformations or hearing loss, kidneys, vertebrae, lower limbs, or anus.
