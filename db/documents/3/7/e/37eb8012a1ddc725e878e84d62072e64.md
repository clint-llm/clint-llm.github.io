No single aspect of clinical history has high enough sensitivity or specificity to lead us to a definitive diagnosis. A comprehensive and thorough history should always be taken in these patients since the differential is so broad. History taking should include sick contacts, recent travels, substance abuse, sexual history, preceding or concurrent infections, and recent use of medications keeping in mind drug-induced aseptic meningitis.

- For neonates, birth history including premature birth, maternal illness, high serum white blood cell count, low hemoglobin (<10.7mg/dL), and the onset of symptoms before one week of age warrant an early and aggressive workup and management.

- When tackling the clinical presentation of patients, it is essential to differentiate how children may present compared to adults.

- Adults can present with a myriad of symptoms and are more likely to complain of headaches, nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, stiff neck, photophobia, or even altered mental status.

- In children, symptoms at presentation seem less specific, consisting of fever, coexisting respiratory illness, rash and irritability.

Nuchal rigidity (sensitivity 70%) and fever (sensitivity 85%) are common physical findings in both children and adults. Kernig and Brudzinski's signs have a high specificity of 95%, but the sensitivity of 5% limits their use. There may be other associated findings depending on the underlying cause.
