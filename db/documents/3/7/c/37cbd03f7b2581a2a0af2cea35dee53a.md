The primary structures of the coracoclavicular ligament receive their blood supply from two sources: the suprascapular artery, which arises from the subclavian artery at the level of the thyrocervical trunk and the thoracoacromial artery off the axillary artery.

The suprascapular vein, tributary of the external jugular vein, is related to the coracoclavicular ligament.

In the area of the coracoclavicular ligament, one can find lymphatic ganglia coming from the axilla and the cervical tract.
