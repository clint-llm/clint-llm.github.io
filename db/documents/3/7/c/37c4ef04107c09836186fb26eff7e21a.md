Symptoms of PDPH include bilateral frontal or an occipital headache worse in the upright position, improved supine, associated with nausea, dizziness, neck pain, visual changes and occasionally tinnitus, hearing loss or radicular symptoms into the arms. Symptoms, especially headache, may also be worse with coughing and Valsalva maneuver, even in the supine position.

Physical examination is usually unremarkable, and the typical patient should not exhibit fever, meningismus, altered mentation or focal neurologic findings. In unusual cases, focal findings might include nystagmus, horizontal diplopia, facial numbness or palsy. Palsy of cranial nerve VI (Abducens) is an uncommon finding that may cause diplopia.  A firm continuous pressure in the abdomen may temporarily improve headache symptoms by indirectly increasing CSF pressure. Pressure on the jugular vein can worsen the headache symptoms.
