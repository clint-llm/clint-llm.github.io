Prognosis is usually good for AFS, but can be dire for IFS, particularly if the underlying immune status cannot be restored

1) Allergic fungal sinusitis is typically responsive to surgical treatment, and recurrence can be controlled successfully as well. Functional endoscopy in the office is the follow-up method. Local debridement is possible during the same procedure. Untreated cases can rarely erode into adjacent structures via mass-effect in longstanding, untreated disease.

2) Invasive fungal sinusitis is potentially life-threatening and carries a poor prognosis. Invasion causes complications such as cavernous sinus thrombosis and central nervous system infections with mortality of around 50%; therefore, urgent treatment is necessary. Complications can occur fast, and recurrence of disease is not unusual, and repeated debridements are often required. Survivers might have facial deformities, nerve damage, and chronic pain. The principal prognostic factor is the patient's immune status. If it can be normalized, the prognosis can be better. If the immune status cannot be restored, the prognosis is very grave and often fatal.

3) Granolumatose sinusitis can be a manifestation of systemic diseases such as Wegener granulomatosis, and prognosis will depend upon the management of the systemic disease.
