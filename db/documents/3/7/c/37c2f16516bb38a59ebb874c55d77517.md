Administered doses of succinylcholine higher than those recommended based on the patient's actual body weight may result in neuromuscular blockade toxicity, potentially resulting in neuromuscular paralysis beyond the time required for procedures, surgical interventions, and anesthesia. Succinylcholine toxicity may manifest via generalized muscle weakness, decreased or absent respiratory reserve, low inspiratory or tidal volumes, or apnea.

Taking the dose of succinylcholine administered above the recommended dose and the duration of administration into consideration, depolarizing neuromuscular blockade toxicity, which is a phase-I blockade, may convert to a phase-II blockade with patient assessment characteristics resembling those of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade. Primary treatment and intervention for succinylcholine toxicity are airway maintenance and respiratory support sufficient for the patient to maintain adequate oxygenation until the drug is metabolized and the patient can maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation without mechanical support.
