Monofocal lenses were the standard of care over a long period. With the increased demand for spectacle independence and the increasing use of computers and other screen devices, the need for better intermediate and near acuity also arose. Bifocal intraocular lenses, which corrected both distance and near, were manufactured.

Reduction of contrast sensitivity and nighttime glare/haloes were some issues accompanying the bifocal IOLs. The intermediate vision needed correction with spectacles, or the distance at which the devices were used had to be adjusted. Enhanced optics lenses were manufactured, which could give better near acuity without spectacle correction than monofocal lenses.

Furthermore, enhanced depth of focus lenses (EDOF) gave better intermediate vision without the use of spectacles.

ToricÂ versions have been introduced in monofocal, bifocal, or trifocal IOLs to take care of corneal astigmatism so that astigmatism for distance vision is reduced and the need for glasses for distance is minimized.
