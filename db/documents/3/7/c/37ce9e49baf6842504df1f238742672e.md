Pheochromocytoma can be asymptomatic and diagnosed by further workup of an adrenal incidentaloma. It can present with vague symptoms like a headache (50%), palpitations (60%), and diaphoresis (50%) that can lead to a paroxysmal hypertensive crisis due to increased catecholamine production. Other associated symptoms include pallor (40%), nausea (40%), tremor, trembling, fatigue (40%), anxiety, fever, pain, and flushing (20%).

Pheochromocytoma can also cause hyperglycemia (40%), lactic acidosis, and weight loss.
