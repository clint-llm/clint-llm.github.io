The most common complication of nasotracheal intubation is epistaxis, which occurs to some degree with nearly every NTI. Other complications include bacteremia (by introducing bacteria from the nasal cavity into the body due to trauma from the tube) and risk of perforation (retropharyngeal perforation, soft palate perforation, or perforation of a piriform sinus). It is best to avoid NTI in patients who have sustained high-speed trauma or isolated facial trauma due to theÂ potential for loss of skull base integrity and inadvertent placement of the ETT intracranially.
