A blood sample is taken from a peripheral venous draw. A healthcare professional puts a rubber band around the arm and asks the patient to keep pumping fist for some time. Healthcare professional palpates the vein for confirmation and then applies alcohol swabs to clean the area. After it has dried up, the phlebotomist introduces a needle into the vein and collects a blood sample in a test tube or a vial. After collecting the sample, the band is removed, the pressure is applied over the puncture site, hemostasis is secured, and a bandage is applied. Complications of the procedure include mild tenderness, bruising, oozing of blood or infection at the puncture site.
