Blockade of the suprascapular nerve is an effective modality to treat chronic, acute, and post-surgical shoulder pain. An anterior and a posterior approach to the suprascapular nerve block have been described. This review will describe the relevant anatomy, indications, and ultrasound-guided techniques for both approaches to blocking the suprascapular nerve. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team involved in performing a suprascapular nerve block.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomic structures involved in both techniques to block the suprascapular nerve. 
- Describe the technique for performing an anterior or posterior suprascapular nerve block. 
- Summarize the potential indications for a suprascapular nerve block.
- Explain the alternatives to suprascapular nerve block.
