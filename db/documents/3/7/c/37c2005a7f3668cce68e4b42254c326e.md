Etiologically, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosisÂ can be classical or idiopathic, malignancy-associated, or drug-induced. Each of these ultimately leads to either unsolicited neutrophil proliferation or persistence in the blood and tissue, which is responsible for the clinical manifestations of the disease.

- Infections: Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, mycobacterial infections, and sporotrichosis

- Autoimmune: Collagen vascular disorders, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pemphigus vulgaris, autoimmune thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease

- Malignancy associated: Hematological malignancies chiefly acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, solid organ malignancy

- As a part of autoinflammatory disorders: Stills disease, SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis)

- Drug-induced: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSFs), trans-retinoic acid, imatinib, bortezomib, oral contraceptives, propylthiouracil are the most consistently associated drugs

- Anecdotal case reports suggest an association with antibiotics, antiepileptics, NSAIDS, retinoids, and diuretics. However, the causal association has not been established by re-challenge.

- Pregnancy-associated
