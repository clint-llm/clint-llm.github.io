The human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viruses to infect children worldwide and increasingly is recognized as an important pathogen in adults, especially the elderly. The most common clinical scenario encountered in RSV infection is an upper respiratory infection, but RSV commonly presents in young children as bronchiolitis, a lower respiratory tract illness with small airway obstruction, and can rarely progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure, apnea, and death. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of respiratory syncytial virus infection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of respiratory syncytial virus infection.
- Review the presentation of respiratory syncytial virus infection.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for the respiratory syncytial virus.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus and improve outcomes.
