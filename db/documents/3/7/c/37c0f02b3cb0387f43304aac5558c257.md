Hypoglycemia is common with type 1 diabetes, particularly in those patients receiving intensive insulin therapy. Severe hypoglycemic events have been reported to be anywhere between 62 to 320 episodes per 100 patient-years in type 1 diabetes.

Those with a previous history of hypoglycemia are at risk of subsequent episodes, especially if the initial cause was not determined. Excessive physical activity, insufficient dietary intake, history of gastric bypass, excessive alcohol consumption, and weight loss also put individuals at risk for hypoglycemia. Additional risk factors include acute illnesses consistent with hypovolemia, cognitive deficits and/or dementia, advanced age and low fasting glycemia.
