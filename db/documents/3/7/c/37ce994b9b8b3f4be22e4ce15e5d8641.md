Verbal agnosia is often confused by parents as hearing loss. Moreover, the behavioral disorders related to aphasia can lead to the suspicion of a form of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), although regressive forms of ASD show cognitive impairments in multiple domains rather than just about language. Furthermore, there might be a suspected diagnosis of conditions characterized by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thus, it is mandatory to rule out a hearing loss, autism, or ADHD.

On the other side, the epileptic manifestations, impose a differential diagnosis with epileptic syndromes associated with the enhancement of epileptiform activity during sleep, such as:

- ContinuousÂ spike-waves during slow sleep syndrome (CSWS)

- Atypical benign partial epilepsy (ABPE)

- Early-onset benign partial epilepsy with occipital paroxysm (or Panayiotopoulos syndrome)

- Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

- Pseudo-Lennox syndrome

- Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) or rolandic epilepsy (RE)

Of note, LKS, CSWS, and RE can be considered as a single and continuous spectrum of childhood epilepsies and epileptic encephalopathies (i.e., the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum) featuring acquired cognitive, behavioral and speech and/or language impairment.

Finally, clinicians must also consider that aphasia can be the effect of various organic causes such as space-occupying lesions, post-traumatic effects, and infections.
