The incidence of clinodactyly is unknown; however, rates have been reported between 1% and 19.5%. It is often seen bilaterally, and males have been found to be more likely to express the trait. In has been associated with several syndromic anomalies, including Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Cenani-Lenz syndactyly, Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, Fanconi anemia and is present in up to 25% of children with Down syndrome. Clinodactyly is often present in the neonate; however, its presentation typically occurs in later childhood years as the deformity becomes more noticeable as longitudinal growth occurs. Patients present for treatment typically due to the abnormal appearance of the digit; however, the deformity rarely causes functional impairment due to compensatory abduction of the affected digit, which prevents the curvature from obstructing full digit flexion.
