Rehabilitation in the form of glasses or contact lenses is the most effective and cost-effective care for hyperopia. Constant use of glasses, along with amblyopia therapy (occlusion/orthoptic exercises), is the mainstay of management of developing refractive amblyopia. It can also prevent strabismus development.

Keratorefractive surgeries are one of the most important solutions for hyperopia. After laser or radiofrequency ablation based surgical procedures,

- Dark glasses (LASIK) or eye patching (CK) are given.

- Topical broad-spectrum antibiotics for 5 to 7 days or more if needed, along with artificial tear substitutes

- Immediate postoperative rubbing to be avoided.

- Topical cyclosporine A after surgery can treat dry eyes.

- Follow up at regular intervals to evaluate refraction, flap condition, and diagnose complications.
