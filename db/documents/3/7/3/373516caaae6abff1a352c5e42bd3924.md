Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) comprises a group of interventions performed to provide oxygenation and circulation to the body during cardiac arrest. The most widely accepted guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation in North America are produced by the American Heart Association (AHA). These are published every 5 years, following the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) meeting. This activity describes the evaluation and management of patients who may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected individuals.
