Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease of inadequate control of blood levels of glucose. It has many subclassifications, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and steroid-induced diabetes. Type 1 and 2 DM are the main subtypes, each with different pathophysiology, presentation, and management, but both have a potential for hyperglycemia. This activity outlines the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of DM and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.
