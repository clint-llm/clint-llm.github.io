As previously described, Horner syndrome is a consequence of sympathetic disruption. The symptomology depends on the location of the lesion, and severity depends on the degree of denervation.

Superior tarsal muscle helps raise the upper eyelid and has a sympathetic nerve supply. Denervation of this muscle causes ptosis, which is milder than oculomotor (CN III) palsy which supplies the levator palpebrae superioris. The superior tarsal muscle is responsible for keeping the upper eyelid in a raised position after levator palpebrae superioris raises it. This explains the partial ptosis seen in Horner syndrome. The lower eyelid may be slightly elevated owing to denervation of the lower lid muscle, which is analogous to the superior tarsal muscle.

The sympathetic nervous supply is responsible for pupil dilationupil (mydriasis). When disrupted, parasympathetic supply is uninhibited, and constriction of the pupil (miosis) ensues. The reaction of the pupils to light and accommodation is normal as those systems do not depend on sympathetic nerve supply.

Ipsilateral anhidrosis, another classic presentation, depends on the level of interruption of the sympathetic supply. Anhidrosis with first-order neuron lesions affects the ipsilateral side of the body as the sympathetic supply from its central origin.

Iris heterochromia (relevant deficiency of pigment in the iris on the affected side) is seen in children younger than 2 years and is the congenital form of Horner syndrome.
