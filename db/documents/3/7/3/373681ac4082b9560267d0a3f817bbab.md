Resumption of the enteral feeds may be delayed in some patients, especially those having perforation peritonitis or those who had undergone resection of the necrotic bowel with anastomosis. In these conditions, a nasogastric tube provides optimal bowel decompression. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can be considered in patients who require prolonged fasting due to resection of a major proportion of the small bowel. Colostomy and/or ileostomy care must be taught to the patients and their relatives.
