The prognosis following tetanus depends on time to symptoms or incubation period. In general, a short incubation period usually indicates severe disease. Negative prognostic factors including an incubation period of fewer than 48 hours, addiction to narcotics, generalized tetanus, high fever (greater than 104F), acquiring tetanus from surgery, burns, intravenous drug abuse, or a septic abortion. Both cephalic and neonatal tetanus have poor outcomes.

Patients with localized tetanus have low mortality and morbidity. Recovery in most patients is slow but can take months or years for a full recovery. Unfortunately, some patients may remain hypotonic for life. Since tetanus does not provide any immunity, those who survive should be actively immunized.
