Budesonide is a potent topical anti-inflammatory agent.

It also inhibits the activation of the eosinophils by increasing apoptosis and suppresses the activation of the inflammatory cells such as mast cells, neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. The overall inhibition of ILs and TNF leads to reduced airway inflammation and hyperreactivity, causing inhibition of the bronchospasm, wheezing, and coughing.
