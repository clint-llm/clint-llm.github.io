The differential diagnosis of spontaneous muscular hematoma is largely dependent on the location of the bleed. Abdominal wall hematomas must be a consideration in all causes of pain in either the right or left iliac fossa. Furthermore, pain from spinal root compression caused by a hematoma in the lumbar or gluteal regions must merit consideration. Finally, in this region, one should also assess the possibility of a strangulated hernia, torsion of an ovarian cyst, obstruction or perforation of the intestine, abdominal neoplasm, or appendicitis.
