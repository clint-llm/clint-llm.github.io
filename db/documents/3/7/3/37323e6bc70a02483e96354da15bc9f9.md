Presbyopia is physiological insufficiency of accommodation that reduces the amplitude of accommodation with a gradual progressive fall in near vision.

De Carle described the simultaneous vision lenses in 1957. In 1957-58, Wesley and Jessen described the concentric bifocals with the distance portion in the central axis. In 1958 Jessen further proposed the first multifocal lens, later named the aspheric bifocal contact lens in 1961. The principle of presbyopia-correcting contact lenses depends on selecting a type of lens or correction mode that will correct the near, intermediate, and distant vision.

**Why is There a Need for a Presbyopia Correcting Contact Lens?**

Bifocal spectacles or reading glasses require head tilt to near objects, give a restricted field of view, image jump, magnified image, an outward symbol of aging, require switching of spectacles for reading and distortion of images through progressive bifocals.
