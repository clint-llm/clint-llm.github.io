For congenital varicella syndrome, sampling of fetal blood or amniotic fluid does not reliably identify cases.

For neonatal varicella infection, confirmation of the virus in the mother is prudent. The diagnosis of varicella in pregnant women can often be made from the classic clinical presentation of a diffuse vesicular rash in various stages of evolution. If the diagnosis is in question, the base of a vesicular skin lesion can be scraped for direct fluorescent antibody testing or PCR. Viral cultures can also be obtained but often take up to 1 week to yield results.
