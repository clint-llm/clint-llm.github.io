The secondary survey is a rapid but thorough head to toe examination assessment to identify potential injuries. It should be performed after the primary survey and the initial stabilization is complete. The purpose of the secondary survey is to obtain pertinent historical data about the patient and his or her injury, as well as to evaluate and treat injuries not found during the primary survey. It is helpful for prioritizing continued evaluation and management. This activity describes how a secondary survey is performed in a trauma patient and its clinical importance. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for trauma patients.
