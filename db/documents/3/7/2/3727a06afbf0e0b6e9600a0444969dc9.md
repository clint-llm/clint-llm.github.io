**Physiological Variation**

Age can have an impact on the basal serum osmolality as children tend to be more susceptible to hypo-osmolality due to their limited intracranial volume, but on the contrary, atrophy of brain neurons in elderly puts them at a lower risk of complications from acute hyponatremia. Another non-modifiable determinant is sex, as an increased fatality caused by hyponatremia occurs in postpartum and postmenopausal women.

**Adipsic Diabetes Insipidus**

Arteries arising from the anterior communicating artery is the source of blood supply for the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.

**Liver Transplant**

Some studies show that patients who have had liver transplants in the past have a significant elevation in plasma osmolality; this is attributable to the denervation of the transplanted liver, which in turn affects the functioning of the peripheral osmoreceptors present in the portal veins.
