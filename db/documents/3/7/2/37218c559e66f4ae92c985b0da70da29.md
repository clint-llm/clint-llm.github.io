The etiology of AUB-O is believed to be rooted inÂ a disturbance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.

Various common etiologies of anovulation are as follows:

- Hyperandrogenism (e.g., PCOS, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-producing tumors)

- Hyperprolactinemia

- Anorexia

- Excessive exercise

- Stress

- Thyroid dysfunction

- Primary pituitary dysfunction

- Premature ovarian failure

- Medications

Medications that correlate with ovulatory dysfunction include antiepileptics, such as valproate and lamotrigine, and antipsychotics.
