All patients on tamoxifen should have routine lab work, including a complete blood count with platelets, serum calcium, and liver function tests. Female patients should monitor for abnormal vaginal bleeding and receive a breast and gynecologic exam at baseline and routinely after. Patients should also watch for signs and symptoms of a DVT or PE.

Other monitoring parameters tend toÂ vary depending on patient-specific factors. In patients with pre-existing hyperlipidemia, triglycerides and cholesterol should require monitoring.
