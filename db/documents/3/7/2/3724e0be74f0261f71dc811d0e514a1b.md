Splinting is primarily used to immobilize a joint to allow for pain control, injury stabilization, and ultimately tissue healing. In the acute setting, splinting is a useful temporizing measure for sprains, strains, joint dislocations, and fractures. This activity reviews the indications for and contraindications to ankle splinting and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients requiring ankle splints.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for ankle splinting.
- Review the relative contraindications to ankle splinting.
- Identify the technique involved in ankle splinting.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients requiring ankle splinting.
