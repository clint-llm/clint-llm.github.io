Performing electrodiagnostic studies in CTS patients has several relative contraindications. Needle electromyography (EMG) is relatively contraindicated in those with severe bleeding disorders or in those who have platelet counts <50,000 per microliter of blood. Some feel an international normalized ratio greater than 1.5 to 2.0 is a relative contraindication. Given that the incidence of significant hematomas while doing EMG for CTS, many feel it is safe unless the INR is higher than the therapeutic range.

Needles should also not be inserted in areas of active soft tissue infection. NCS are generally safe for patients with implanted modern bipolar cardiac devices, though the recommendation is to avoid NCS in those with external pacing wires.
