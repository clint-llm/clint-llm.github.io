Denosumab is a bone anti-resorptive drug used to treat osteoporosis and other bone-related disorders. FDA-approved indications include prevention of skeletal-related events (e.g., bone pain and fractures) secondary to multiple myeloma or bone metastases from solid tumors, giant cell tumor of the bone, hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as men with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and bone loss. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of denosumab pertinent for interprofessional team members when denosumab therapy is appropriate to achieve optimal patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of denosumab.
- Summarize the FDA-approved and other indications for therapy with denosumab.
- Outline the adverse event profile of denosumab.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using denosumab therapy.
