The most common non-traumatic etiology for cerebellar hemorrhage as for all intracranial hemorrhages is hypertensive vasculopathy causing microaneurysms and resultant rupture. Cerebellar hemorrhage from hypertension most commonly occurs in the middle-aged or older population, often in the dentate nucleus with extension to other areas from the rupture of microaneurysms along the penetrating small vessels. Other causes of cerebellar hemorrhage include trauma, coagulopathy (cirrhosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombocytopenia) or bleeding disorders (primary and drug-induced (anticoagulation, antiplatelet or thrombolytic medications)), ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation, cerebral amyloid angiopathy,

The most common primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors to undergo hemorrhagic transformation are glioblastomas. The metastatic CNS tumors that are more prone to hemorrhage include lesions from the lung, breast, kidney, and melanomas. Cerebellar hemorrhage in younger patients may be due to substance abuse, trauma, or CNS aneurysms, or AVMs.
