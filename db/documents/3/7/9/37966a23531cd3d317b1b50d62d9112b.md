Embryologically, PDL, cementum, and alveolar bone development are accompanied by the formation of the root of the tooth and its eruption.

To understand the gingival epithelium better, it can be studied as 3 different sections, the oral epithelium, sulcular epithelium, and junctional epithelium, which is the closest to the tooth surface and attaches to it with hemidesmosomes. Histologically cementum is comprised of 2 parts cellular and acellular. The gingival epithelium is composed of stratified squamous epithelium.
