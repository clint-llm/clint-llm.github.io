Patients undergoing PVB risk wound infection, bleeding, pneumonia, conduit occlusion, and peripheral nerve damage. These patients often also have a higher prevalence of cerebrovascular and coronary artery disease, significantly increasing their risk for stroke and myocardial infarction surgery. Indicators for potential adverse outcomes include smoking, pulmonary disease, female sex, diabetes mellitus, previous bypass history, and advanced age. Conduit-related complications can be divided into immediate and long-term. Immediate, including acute thrombosis and bleeding. Long-term, including infection and occlusion secondary to intimal hyperplasia.
