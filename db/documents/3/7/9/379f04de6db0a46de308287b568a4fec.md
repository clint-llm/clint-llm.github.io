Mild to moderate hypertension may be associated with a risk of atherosclerotic diseaseÂ if left untreated in 30% of people and organ damage in 50% of people within 8-10 years after onset. Patients with resistant hypertension also have a higher risk for poor outcomes, especially for those with certain comorbidities (e.g., chronic kidney disease and ischemic heart disease). Patients with resistant hypertension who have lower BP appear to have a reduced risk for some cardiovascular events (eg, incident stroke, coronary heart disease, or heart failure).
