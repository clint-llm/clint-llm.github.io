Like all fascia in the body, the fascia in the foot is derived from the mesoderm. Some anatomists believe the plantar fascia shares its origin with the Achilles tendon. A connection that they believe diminishes with age.

**Intrauterine packaging phenomenon**

During fetal development, the position of the fetus in the uterus can influence the development of certain conditions, most notably:

- Metatarsus adductus (MA)

- Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH)

- Acetabular dysplasia

- Congenital hip dislocation

- Congenital torticollis

This phenomenon influences not only the osseous development of these aforementioned anatomic structures, but these conditions can also implicate soft-tissue deformity, pathologic function, and a varying spectrum of flexibility versus rigid contractures.  For example, the position of the fetus in babies born with MA is thought to contribute to the increasing pressures and compression of the forefoot as the legs are crossed over the body. Moreover, as the fetus continues to grow during late gestation, the incidence of MA increases in babies born at full-, late-, or post-term compared to infants delivered prior to 30 weeks of gestation
