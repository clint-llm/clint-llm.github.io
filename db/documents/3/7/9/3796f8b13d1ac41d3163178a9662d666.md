The diagnosis and management of patients with Klinefelter syndrome are with an interprofessional team that includes an endocrinologist, urologist, geneticist, internist, speech therapist, neurologist, and physical therapy. The pharmacist and the nurse should educate the patient and caregiver on the potential adverse effects of testosterone. In addition, as these patients get older, they need to be aware of type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, and dyslipidemia. Finally, the primary care providers, including the nurse practitioner, must closely examine the patients at each visit as they are prone to malignancies.

The overall prognosis for patients with Klinefelter syndrome is guarded. The life span is slightly reduced, and depending on the mental status, the quality of life may be adversely affected. An interprofessional team approach will lead to the best outcomes.
