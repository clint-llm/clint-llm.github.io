There are various cellular components in the process of coagulation. Most notably are those processes associated with the endothelium, platelets, and hepatocytes.

**Endothelium**. Clotting factors III and VIII originate from the endothelial cells while the clotting factor IV comes from the plasma.

**Platelets**. These are non-nucleated disc-like cells created from megakaryocytes that arise from the bone marrow. They are about 2 to 3 microns in size. Some of their unique structural elements include plasma membrane, open canalicular system, spectrin and actin cytoskeleton, microtubules, mitochondria, lysosomes, granules, and peroxisomes.

**Hepatocytes**. The liver produces the majority of the proteins that function as clotting factors and as anticoagulants.
