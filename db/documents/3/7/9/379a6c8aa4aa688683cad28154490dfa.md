It is important to distinguish Munchausen from malingering in which an external gain is a primary motivation. Additionally, it is different from conversion disorder in that patients with Munchausen are intentionally falsifying their condition for attention or feelings of importance. When differentiating Munchausen from other psychiatric disorders, it must be remembered that Munchausen patients have insight into their disorder and are aware that they are fabricating their illness.
