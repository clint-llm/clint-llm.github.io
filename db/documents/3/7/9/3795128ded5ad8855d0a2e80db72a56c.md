The equipment can be categorized into what is needed intraoperatively and what is needed post-operatively to maintain the stoma.  The operative technique section of this review will cover the equipment that is used. The long-term management of the stoma requires stoma bags and anti-adhesive spray. Occasionally stoma paste, stoma rings, and barrier cream are also needed, particularly in the case of an ileal conduit as urine can cause excoriation of the skin.
