Restricting the use of angiography and interventional or surgical vascular procedures in those with a high risk of atheroembolic events may of important for primary prevention of this disease. The use of alternate diagnostic procedures like MR angiography or computer-assisted topographic angiography should be considered in high-risk patients if the alternate procedure can provide adequate information. Minimizing direct trauma of the tip of the catheter to the atheromatous wall of the vessel may reduce the risk of atheroembolization. The use of embolic protection devices during vascular procedures may catch the atheromatous debris and prevent their migration to distal sites and reduce the risk of embolization.
