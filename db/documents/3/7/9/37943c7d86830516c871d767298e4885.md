The common ocular complaints in patients of LIG are:

- Redness of the eye- sudden onset

- Unilateral eye pain - sudden onset, may be accompanied by headache, nausea, and vomiting

- Diminution of vision - gradually progressive in cases of cataracts

- Colored halos, photophobia, and epiphora

A detailed history regarding the onset, duration, and progression of the presenting symptoms is essential. The clinician must note any history of similar episodes or ocular surgery.

Any clinical history suggestive of a contraindication to systemic steroid use like osteoporosis, peptic ulcer disease, psychiatric illness, or tuberculosis should be elicited.
