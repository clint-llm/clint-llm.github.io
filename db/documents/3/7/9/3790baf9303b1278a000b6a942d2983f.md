Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is pharmaceutically manufactured as sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy. This formulation is considered a Schedule III drug in the United States and is sometimes abused. In Europe, GHB is also still therapeutically used as an anesthetic and for the treatment of alcohol and opiate dependence. Since there is no specific antidote to reverse the toxicity, aggressive supportive care including mechanical ventilation may be required. Severe withdrawal symptoms are life threatening and can last up to 15 days. Patients should be treated with benzodiazepines and managed in the intensive care unit. Parents and guardians should be educated about safe storage of this agent to prevent accidental poisoning in children. This activity outlines the potential for abuse of this drug, reviews treatment for patients who have overdosed on it, and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients that use gamma hydroxybutyrate.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of gamma hydroxybutyrate toxicity.
- Describe when gamma hydroxybutyrate toxicity should be included on differential diagnosis.
- Explain the management of gamma hydroxybutyrate toxicity.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination to advance recognition and management of gamma hydroxybutyrate toxicity and improve patient outcomes.
