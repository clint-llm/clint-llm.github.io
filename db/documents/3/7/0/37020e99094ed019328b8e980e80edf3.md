The substantia nigra has split irrigation from branches of the basilar and posterior cerebral arteries. The medial portion of the substantia nigra, along with the corticospinal tracts of the crus cerebri, receive supply from paramedian branches of the basilar artery. The oculomotor nucleus and accessory oculomotor nucleus also receive vascular supply via this branch. Short circumferential branches of the posterior choroidal arteries, a branch of the posterior cerebral arteries, supply the more lateral portions of the substantia nigra and crus cerebri, as well as the medial lemniscus which are the crossed afferent fibers from the nucleus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus. Parkinsonism due to stroke is a less common form of acute onset (developing over one year after a stroke) called vascular parkinsonism and in one study was diagnosed in 17% of stroke patients.
