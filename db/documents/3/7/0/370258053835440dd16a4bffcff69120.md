Symptoms of enteroviral disease are specific to the course of the specific disease.

Rhinoviruses cause fever, cough, sneezing, rhinorrhea, otalgia, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, and sinus pressure. They can also cause wheezing and dyspnea.

Non-rhinovirus enteroviruses may cause fever, malaise, gastrointestinal upset, rash, lymphadenopathy, weakness, altered mental status, cough, sneezing, sore throat, and chest pain.

The diagnosis of enteroviral disease is often clinical and depends on understanding disease course, symptom severity, and risk factors. A careful history should elucidate the onset of symptoms, type and severity of symptoms, vaccination status, and possible disease exposures.

Comorbidities such as premature birth, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), underlying chronic lung disease, immunocompromised status, concomitant hematological disease, and diabetes can assist in stratifying risk and making treatment decisions. All may predispose the patient to more serious, though not necessarily more frequent, infections.

Physical exam should be directed by history and may include findings of upper or lower respiratory disease, meningeal signs, impaired muscle strength or deep tendon reflexes, hypoxia, or altered mental status.
