According to the ICHD-3, “Vasoconstrictions may not be observed in the early stage of RCVS. For this reason, probable primary thunderclap headache is not a diagnosis that should be made even temporarily.”

The differential diagnosis includes other primary headache disorders and secondary TCH causes. Primary cough headache, primary exercise headache, and primary headache associated with sexual activity can all present as TCH.
