Bulimia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder that can lead to potentially critical complications. Unlike in anorexia nervosa, in which complications are due to weight loss and malnutrition, the type and severity of medical complications of bulimia nervosa can be determined based on the frequency and the method the patient uses to purge.

Complications associated with bulimia nervosa include the following:

- Salivary gland hypertrophy (sialadenosis) and swollen cheeks - typically in the parotid gland but also has been recorded to cause swelling of the submandibular salivary gland.

- Mallory-Weiss syndrome (mucosal and submucosal esophageal tears near the gastroesophageal junction) - at times preceded by gastroesophageal intussusception, caused by forceful contraction of the stomach when a patient vomits. Mallory-Weiss tears can develop into Boerhaave’ syndrome (esophageal rupture)

- GERD - gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can increase the risk of Barrett’s esophagus.

- Barrett’s esophagus - a condition in which abnormal columnar mucosa replaces normal squamous cell mucosa as a result of irritation of the tissue by gastric acid. It possibly increases the risk of developing esophageal cancer, although there is only limited evidence for a causal link.

- Laryngopharyngeal reflux - the movement of gastric contents back into the laryngopharynx can manifest as coughing, hoarse voice, sore throat, and dysphagia.

- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - one study found that among patients with bulimia nervosa, the prevalence of IBS was about 69%

- Achalasia - the inability of lower esophageal muscles to relax

- Esophageal spasm - irregular contractility of esophageal muscles

- Cardiac arrhythmia - can be caused by hypokalemia due to self-induced vomiting. Hypokalemia can contribute to QTc prolongation. Furthermore, abuse of ipecac is associated with other cardiac complications, including congestive heart failure and death.

- Constipation - chronic abuse of stimulant laxatives, which include senna, cascara, phenolphthalein, or bisacodyl, can result in cathartic colon syndrome.

- Dental enamel erosion - result from gastric acid washing over teeth. Exposure of enamel to gastric acid increases the risk of tooth erosion, particularly on the occlusal (“biting”) surfaces of the teeth but can also extend to the buccal-facing and palate-facing surfaces of molars. Gingival recession may also occur for the same reason.

- Rectal prolapse - case reports of rectal prolapse in women with bulimia nervosa are available. The hypothesis is that this is due to constipation or elevated intra-abdominal pressure associated with vomiting.

- Recurrent acute pancreatitis has been documented in several cases of bulimia nervosa, although a single direct mechanism has not been established.

- Diabetes - a meta-analysis of ten studies found that bulimia nervosa was associated with a relative risk of type 2 diabetes of 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.5).
