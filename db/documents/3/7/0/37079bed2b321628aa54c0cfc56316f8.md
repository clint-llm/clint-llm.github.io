Numerous rating scales determine the presence and severity of tardive dyskinesia. The most widely used instrument is the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). It is recommended to administer the AIMS at baseline before initiating antipsychotic medications, with a follow-up screening performed no longer than three months later. Upon evaluation of the patient, it can be noted that tardive dyskinesia is present at rest and somewhat diminished when there is any form of volitional movement. For example, tongue dyskinesias reduce when the patient is asked to protrude their tongue.

If tardive dyskinesia is present in conjunction with dementia, one should consider Huntington's disease, Wilson's disease, or a central nervous system tumor. A diagnosis of antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia is made after the symptoms have persisted for at least one month and required exposure to neuroleptics for at least three months. Tardive dyskinesia should be distinguished from withdrawal dyskinesias as these most likely remit soon after the termination of the antipsychotic.

Workup for tardive dyskinesia may include selected laboratory studies and imaging. Typically, brain CT and MRI are normal in patients with tardive dyskinesia. However, they may assist in ruling out other conditions such as Huntington's disease, where atrophy of the caudate nucleus is seen, and Fahr syndrome, where calcification is noted in the basal ganglia.
