Measles is a preventable infection, and hence all healthcare workers, including nurses and pharmacists should educate patients on the importance of vaccination. Patients should be informed that the adverse effects of the measles vaccination are rare and minor; without vaccination, there is a high risk of transmitting the infection to others and inducing serious neurological complications.
