Above-the-knee amputations can have a significant clinical impact on the lives of patients. Many patients do not have the resources to obtain a prosthesis and may have to continue using a wheelchair following the procedure. For those who do get a prosthesis, their mobility is significantly affected. One study showed that patients with a unilateral transfemoral amputation had a self-selected walking speed 8.6% slower than their non-amputee counterparts.
