HACE generally occurs after 2 days above 4000m but can occur at lower elevations (2500m) and with faster onset.   Some, but not all, individuals will suffer from symptoms of AMS such as headache, insomnia, anorexia, nausea prior to transitioning to HACE.  Some may also have concomitant High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE).  HACE in isolation is rare, but the absence of concomitant HAPE or symptoms of AMS prior to deterioration does not rule-out the presence of HACE.
