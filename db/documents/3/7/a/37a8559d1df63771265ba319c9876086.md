Doppler ultrasonography is an essential diagnostic tool in diagnosing and managing various disease processes. The use of Doppler ultrasound by healthcare team members has become increasingly common as the technology has improved and become more cost-effective. Additionally, there has also been an increased use of point-of-care ultrasound as a diagnostic modality. All clinicians need to understand the underlying principles, potential pitfalls, and possible advantages of Doppler ultrasound. This activity will highlight the physics, imaging characteristics, clinical utility, and other key factors (e.g., pitfalls, errors, and safety considerations) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients who undergo Doppler ultrasound examination for diagnosis, monitoring, and management of various disease processes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for Doppler ultrasonography.
- Review the common imaging findings on Doppler ultrasonography.
- Outline the imaging findings associated with various disease processes on Doppler ultrasonography.
- Explain the importance of understanding the clinical utility and pitfalls of Doppler ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool.
