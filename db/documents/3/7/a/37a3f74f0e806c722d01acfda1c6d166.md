Macular edema is defined as a collection of localized swelling in the macular area, leading to increased central retinal thickness. In the initial stage, the fluid accumulates in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and/or the inner nuclear layer (INL). Swelling of the MÃ¼ller cells has also been noted. The accumulated fluid may involve the intracellular and/or extracellular retinal spaces. It is a non-specific sign or sequelae for a myriad of intraocular and systemic diseases.

The macula is the most predisposed region for the development of edema due to its unique anatomical features. The various predisposing factors include a high rate of fluid production due to the high cell count in this region along with the high metabolic activity; low rate of extracellular fluid resorption due to the presence of a central avascular zone; and the peculiar arrangement of the Henle fiber layer which makes the region a potential fluid reservoir.
