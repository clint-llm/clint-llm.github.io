Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is generally well tolerated, and most side effects can be minimized by careful patient preparation and planning. The most common adverse event associated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy is middle ear barotrauma, which manifests as pain or pressure in the ears during chamber compression or decompression. Slow compression, pressure reduction maneuvers (such as the Valsalva maneuver), and prophylactic administration of decongestants (such as pseudoephedrine) can reduce the risk of ear barotrauma. Sinus, dental, and pulmonary barotraumas may also occur but are rarely encountered in clinical practice. Patients should avoid holding their breath during chamber ascent to reduce the risk of pulmonary barotrauma.

Oxygen toxicity seizures are rare and may be minimized using scheduled air breaks. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is rare and may be minimized by maintaining well-defined intervals of several hours between each hyperbaric treatment. Patients with diabetes may experience hypoglycemia during hyperbaric treatments, and patients with a history of claustrophobia may experience confinement anxiety.
