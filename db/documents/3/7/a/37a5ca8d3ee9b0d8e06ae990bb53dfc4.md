The following monitoring parameters are from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Cholesterol Guideline Recommendations.

Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels should not be routinely measured; however, the clinician can base special considerations for measuring CPK on family history of statin intolerance, drug-drug interactions leading to increased risk of myopathy, or other clinical presentations that create a high index of suspicion of myopathy.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin levels do not need to be measured routinely. Only if symptoms suggest underlying hepatotoxicity during therapy, it may be beneficial to obtain these levels.

Lipid panel testing, including low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and total cholesterol, should be obtained on an initial visit to establish a baseline. Thereafter, a fasting lipid profile should be obtained within four to twelve weeks after initiation or dose adjustment. Furthermore, after receiving these initialÂ two levels, further fasting lipid profiles are only necessary every three to twelve months or as clinically indicated. If two consecutive low-density lipoprotein levels are less than 40 milligrams per deciliter, the clinician should decrease the dose.
