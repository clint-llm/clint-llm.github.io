The underlying risk factors that can lead to MGD include age, androgen deficiency, history of atopy, systemic associations like Sjogren syndrome, Steven-Johnson syndrome, psoriasis, acne rosacea. Ocular predisposing factors include the use of contact lenses, eyelid tattooing, chronic blepharitis, or trachoma.

Infestation of eyelashes by Demodex folliculorum also affects the functioning of meibomian glands. Systemic use of antibiotics, isotretinoin for acne, antidepressants, or hormone replacement therapy affects meibomian glands' functioning.
