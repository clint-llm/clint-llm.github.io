An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to diagnosing and treating dermoid cysts can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Health care staff of primary care and emergency departments play a vital role in diagnosing and referring patients with head and neck subcutaneous nodules to dermatology or head and neck surgery. This will aid in better patient satisfaction, quality of life, proper care, and decrease the chance of complications.

Collaboration shared decision making and communication are crucial elements for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach to planning and evaluation of all joint activities. The earlier signs and symptoms of dermoid cysts are identified; the better is the patient outcome, satisfaction, and prognosis.
