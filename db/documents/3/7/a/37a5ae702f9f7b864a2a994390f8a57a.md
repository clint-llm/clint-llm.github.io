Due to the complex arrangement of structures in and around the middle ear, complications, once developed, are challenging to treat. Complications can be divided into intratemporal and intracranial complications.

The following are the intratemporal complications;

- Hearing lossÂ (conductive and sensorineural)

- TM perforation (acute and chronic)

- Chronic suppurative otitis media (with or without cholesteatoma)

- Cholesteatoma

- Tympanosclerosis

- Mastoiditis

- Petrositis

- Labyrinthitis

- Facial paralysis

- Cholesterol granuloma

- Infectious eczematoid dermatitis

Additionally, it is important to discuss the effect of OM on hearing, particularly in the 6-24 month age range, as this is an important time for language development, which is related to hearing. The conductive hearing loss resulting from chronic or recurrent OM can adversely affect language development and result in prolonged speech problems requiring speech therapy. This is one reason the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery recommend aggressive early treatment of recurrent AOM.

The following are the intracranial complications;

- Meningitis

- Subdural empyema

- Brain abscess

- Extradural abscess

- Lateral sinus thrombosis

- Otitic hydrocephalus
