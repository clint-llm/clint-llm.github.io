The targeted temperature management process can divide into three phases: the induction phase, maintenance phase, and rewarming phase. The goal is to achieve a core temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius as soon as possible, maintain this temperature for 12 to 24 hours, and then rewarm at a controlled rate of 0.2 to 0.5 C/hour.

**Induction**

Induction of hypothermia is the process in which a target core temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius is reached as quickly as possible. This is achievable through several different external and internal cooling mechanisms. Hypothermia induction may be started in the ambulance or once the patient arrives at the hospital. Although it was thought that earlier cooling by paramedics en route to hospital would result in improved outcomes due to more rapid attainment of target temperature, this was not the case in some studies. One randomized controlled trial assigned 234 patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest to either prehospital cooling or cooling after admission.

There are three main categories of cooling methods: conventional cooling techniques, surface cooling systems, and intravascular cooling systems.

**Conventional Cooling Techniques**

These consist of using cold saline infusions and ice packs and are the simplest and most cost-effective methods. The advantages of this method are that its availability is widespread; it is easy to use; it can be initiated by paramedics in the field and is considered a safe method for hypothermia induction. It can also be used as an adjunct to more advanced cooling methods to augment the cooling rate. The disadvantage of using conventional methods is that they are very labor-intensive, often result in temperatures lower than the target temperature, and are not effective in maintaining the target temperature.

**Surface Cooling Systems**

Surface cooling systems use blankets or pads wrapped around the patient that circulate cold air or fluid. These devices are less labor-intensive and easier to use, with most being equipped with auto feedback mechanisms that alter the water or air temperature to maintain the set target temperature. Disadvantages include the rare risk of skin burns and irritation (mottling and redness), as well as the risk of overshooting the target temperature in the induction phase.

**Core Cooling Systems**

These currently consist mainly of intravascular catheters placed in a central vein that circulate cold saline. These devices have a high cooling rate, with rates between 2.0 and 4.5 degrees C/hour (depending on the size of the catheter and setting). They are considered the most reliable in all three phases of hypothermia treatment. The disadvantages of intravascular cooling devices are that they require an invasive procedure, there is a possibility of catheter-related thrombosis and infection, and they are relatively expensive. Other core cooling systems, such as the use of peritoneal lavage and extracorporeal circulation devices, are not in widespread use yet.

One prospective intervention study compared several different methods of hypothermia and normothermia induction.

**Temperature Measurement**

The application of therapeutic hypothermia requires constant monitoring of core body temperature. This is vital to achieving an accurate target temperature, preventing overcooling, assessing variations in temperature during the maintenance phase, and ensuring a steady, controlled increase in temperature during the rewarming phase. The ideal site to measure core temperature is one that will give an accurate, real-time measurement. The current gold standard is the measurement of the temperature of the blood using a pulmonary artery catheter. The most commonly used monitoring sites (bladder, rectum, esophagus, and tympanic membrane) exhibit a time lag between registered temperature and measured core temperature, especially during the induction phase in which there are large temperature changes over a short time.

**Rewarming**

In this phase, the core body temperature is gradually raised by 0.2 to 0.5 degrees C per hour until it is greater than 36 degrees C. A slower rate of rewarming is associated with fewer complications, and rapid rewarming may negate the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia. Upon reaching a temperature of 36 degrees C, cooling devices and medications used to control shivering can be discontinued. The rewarming phase starts 12 to 24 hours after initiating induction and can take up to 8 hours.
