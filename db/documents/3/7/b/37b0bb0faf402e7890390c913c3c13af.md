Little anatomic variation of the anal canal exists in the literature. Multiple case reports have discussed anal canal duplication in which a neonate is born with an extra anal canal, either superior or posterior to the main canal. Individuals with a duplicated anal canal tend to have a fairly typical accessory anal canal; however, it ends in a blind pouch with no connection to the rectum. Currently, this condition is treated with surgical excision to avoid the accessory anal canal acting as a potential nidus of inflammation, fistulization, or malignancy.

There is some variation of the anal canal that relates to aging. The internal anal sphincter increases in thickness as individuals age. The effect is usually more pronounced in females over 50. Current guidelines consider maximal internal anal sphincter thickness greater than 4 mm as abnormal in patients under 50 years of age and 5 mm in those over 50 years of age. This becomes important when identifying patients with hypertrophy of the internal anal sphincter.
