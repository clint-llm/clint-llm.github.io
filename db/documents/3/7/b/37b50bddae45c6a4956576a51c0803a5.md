A 2015 Dutch literature review on alcohol-related psychotic disorder found that there is a 0.4% lifetime prevalence in the general population and a 4% prevalence in patients with alcohol dependence. The incidence is highest in working-age men. There is also a higher prevalence of alcohol-related psychosis in 1.) patients who became dependent on alcohol at a younger age, 2.) those with a low socioeconomic status, 3.) individuals who are unemployed or living on their pension, and 4.) those who live alone. Â In patients with alcohol use disorder, paternal alcohol and mental health problems were found to be associated with a higher incidence of alcohol-related psychosis. Twin studies also suggest a genetic predisposition to the development of alcohol-related psychosis. Once diagnosed with alcohol-related psychosis, there is a 68% chance of re-admission and a 37% co-morbidity with other mental disorders. Patients with alcohol-related psychosis have a 5% to 30% risk of developing a chronic schizophrenia-like syndrome.
