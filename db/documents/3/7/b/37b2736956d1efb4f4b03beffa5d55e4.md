The care of a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis includes a primary care physician along with a gastroenterologist, hepatologist, transplant team, nutritionist, and a social worker. A primary care physician has an important role in identifying those at risk of cirrhosis or liver disease and ordering the pertinent tests and imaging necessary for diagnosis before a consultant gets involved. A gastroenterologist can help progress the management of the patient's care and diagnose some of the complications associated with cryptogenic cirrhosis such as esophageal varices via endoscopy. A hepatologist can provide further expertise in additional treatment and management that will be beneficial. Once the patient is deemed a candidate for transplant, further planning including lab testing, imaging and history taking can be done by transplant hepatologists and surgeons. Given the close association between cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH, nutritionists play a pivotal role in lifestyle and diet modification. Lastly, social workers are key members of the team as they can coordinate care between all the physicians and ensure the patient has travel accommodations not to miss appointments.
