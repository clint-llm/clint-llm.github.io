The incidence rate and racial predilection of MPS have not been established because of the condition's rarity. However, males and females are equally affected, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1. Based on many reports of affected siblings and twins with normal parents, there were postulations of genetic susceptibility to mostly autosomal recessive inheritance and increased susceptibility in consanguineous marriages.

Autosomal dominant, X-linked dominant, X-linked recessive, and sporadic cases have also been demonstrated and reported in some case reports for same-sex siblings.
