Transthoracic echocardiography needs minimal preparations; however, this includes removing clothing over the chest and potentially cardiac monitoring stickers, and the patient should lay in a decubitus position on their left side. It is important to keep patients modest and covered when possible. Preparations for transesophageal echocardiography are more intensive, as the patientÂ would need to be sedated, and for more difficult studies, the patient may need to be intubated. When performing invasive imaging, the femoral and radial vessel insertion sites, including the groin or wrist, would need to be cleaned, prepped, and draped in a sterile technique. Prior to any procedure, a time out is completed, where the name, date of birth, and procedure being performed is read aloud and agreed upon by all involved.
