Prognosis depends both upon the degree of injury and the underlying diagnosis.

Neurapraxia has the best prognosis, and patients usually recover in about three months.

In the case of axonal loss, recovery follows over 6 to 12 months. Neurotmesis has a guarded prognosis and may require surgical treatment with either a nerve transfer or tendon transfer. The appropriate time to refer to a peripheral nerve surgeon is approximately 6 to 9 months after injury. Denervated muscle does not recover significant function after 18 months.

In cases of other etiologies such as Lou Gehrig's disease or space-occupying lesions, the prognosis will differ and depend upon the diagnosis itself rather than the peripheral nerve involvement.
