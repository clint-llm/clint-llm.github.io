Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the largest member of the herpes viridae family (HHV-5), and humans are the main reservoir. The virus sheds in bodily fluids such as saliva, urine, breast milk, semen, and blood. Primary infection of the host occurs when a previously uninfected individual acquires the disease for the first time.Â  In addition to primary infection, there can also be latent or non-primary infections. Non-primary infections result from reactivation of a previous infection or infection with a different strain of the virus.

An important risk factor for primary infection during pregnancy is prolonged exposure to young children.
