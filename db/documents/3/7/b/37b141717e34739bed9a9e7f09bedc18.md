PTSD psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for PTSD/ASD but is not shown to be very efficacious. The lack of effective therapies continues to make PTSD a chronic illness. Therefore there is an immediate need to explore new compounds and approaches. One promising approach is the use of psychedelics such as ketamine, psilocybin, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to treat PTSD.
