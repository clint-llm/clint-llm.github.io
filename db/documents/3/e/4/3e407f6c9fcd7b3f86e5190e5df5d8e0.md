As the DSN is formed by the anterior rami of C5, it passes posteriorly going through the substance of the middle scalene muscle in a slight posteroinferiorly path. Emerging from the middle scalene, it passes posteriorly between the posterior scalene, levator scapulae, and the serratus posterior superior muscle. From this location, the DSN passes inferior and medial to the scapula, coursing anterior to the rhomboid minor and major. From this position, the DSN terminates by innervating the rhomboid major and minor on their anterior surfaces.
