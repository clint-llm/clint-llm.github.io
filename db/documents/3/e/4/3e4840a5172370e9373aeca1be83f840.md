Normal saline solution can be administered only via intravenous access.

1) Fluid bolus

- This route is normally used in the acute care setting when a rapid infusion of fluids is necessary (e.g., hypovolemia). Delivery of fluid should be administered through large-bore peripheral lines or via central-line access.

2) Maintenance

- The calculation of daily fluid requirements is achievable in various ways. Common practices utilize the formulas created by Drs. Holliday and Segar which indicate that one can use the "100-50-25" or "4-2-1" rules.

Examples:

For a 50 kg patient

First 10 kg weight = 1000 mL (100 mL/kg x 10)

Second 10 kg weight = 500 mL (50 mL/kg x 10)

Remaining 30 kg weight = 750 mL (25 mL/kg x 30)

Total = 2250 mL/day or 94 mL/hr

First 10 kg weight = 4 mL/kg/hr x 10 = 40 mL/hr

Second 10 kg weight = 2 mL/kg/hr x 10 = 20 mL/hr

Remaining 30 kg weight = 1 mL/kg/hr x 30 = 30 mL/hr

Total = 90 mL/hr
