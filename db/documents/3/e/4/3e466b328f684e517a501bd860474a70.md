Bursae are sac-like structures, lined with synovial fluid, found throughout the musculoskeletal system in locations prone to friction, such as bony prominences and areas surrounding tendons and ligaments. They create a physiologic cushion between adjacent tissues and structures to facilitate dynamic function and movement.
