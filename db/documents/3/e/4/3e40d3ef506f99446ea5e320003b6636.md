Individuals suspected of having PH require extensive diagnostic testing, including echocardiography, laboratory testing, cardiopulmonary functional testing, and cardiac catheterization, to make an accurate diagnosis.

Early referral to specialized centers can help make a timely diagnosis and improve clinical outcomes for this devastating disease. Once the diagnosis is made, a multimodal interprofessional approach to treatment is required to achieve the best possible outcomes. A specialty-trained nurse is necessary to help educate the patients about the etiology of their disease and emphasize medical compliance with therapy. A clinical pharmacist specializing in the treatment of PAH is an integral part of the team as they help ensure intolerable adverse outcomes do not occur with these therapies.Â The pharmacist's role is critical in maintaining adequate dosing, preventing drug interactions, and ensuring compliance by the patient for the duration of the treatment.

An integrated interprofessional team can improve clinical symptoms, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival for these patients.[Level 5]
