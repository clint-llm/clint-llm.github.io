Sugammadex is biologically inactive and is generally well tolerated. However, concerns related to anaphylaxis caused the Food and Drug Administration to delay approval for sugammadex for years. An earlyÂ manufacturer-sponsored study found a 0.3% incidence of anaphylaxis. The study involved 299 subjects, and one subject who received the largest dose, 16 mg/kg, had an anaphylactic reaction. Sugammadex has been approved in the United States since 2015, in Japan since 2010, and in the European Union since 2008. The actual rate of anaphylaxis appears to be much lower, perhaps similar to the incidence of anaphylaxis from rocuronium.
