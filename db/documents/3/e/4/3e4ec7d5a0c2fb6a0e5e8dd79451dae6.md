"Jumper's knee," also called patellar tendinopathy, is a painful condition of the knee, mainly activity-related, caused by small tears in the patellar tendon that mainly occurs in sports requiring strenuous jumping and results in localized patellar tendon tenderness. The tears are typically caused by accumulated stress on the patellar or quadriceps tendon. As the name implies, the condition is common in athletes from jumping sports, where there is a high demand for the speed and power of leg extensors. These sports often lead to high eccentric quadriceps loadings, such as volleyball, track (long and high jump), basketball, long-distance running, and skiing. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of jumper's knee and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients about their prognosis.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the differential diagnosis of jumper's knee.
- Identify the risk factors for developing jumper's knee.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of jumper's knee.
- Explain the interprofessional team's strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding managing patients with jumper's knee.
