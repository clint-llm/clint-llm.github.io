Genitourinary tuberculosis (GUTB) usually involves the urinary tract or genital organs due to the hematogenous spread of chronic latent pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis of GUTB is often delayed due to symptoms and signs often being masked by another disease, usually a urinary tract infection (UTI). Resistant or recurrent urinary tract infections should be tested for GUTB without delay. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of genitourinary tuberculosis and highlights the role of an inter-professional team to improve outcomes in patients affected by GUTB.

**Objectives:**
- To outline the pathophysiology of genitourinary tuberculosis. 
- To review the presentations of genitourinary tuberculosis.
- To describe the management of genitourinary tuberculosis.
- To describe how an inter-professional team is very important for the better outcomes of the patients in the management of genitourinary tuberculosis.
