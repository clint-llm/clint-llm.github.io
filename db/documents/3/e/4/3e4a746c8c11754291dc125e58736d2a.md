Complications of ASC-US may arise from inadequate follow-up or the lack of it, or they may result from treatment in general. An ASC-US diagnosis may completely return to normal on repeat Pap test, but generally, an ASC-US diagnosis that is not followed up may worsen to HSIL/CIN 2+ or invasive cancer in underserved populations with limited or no access to comprehensive screening services.
