Nurses should assist with monitoring patients after they awaken from anesthesia. They should evaluate the incision site to ensure that the sutures are holding and the wound is successfully healing. The nurse may also identify possible infection and administer antibiotics and pain medication. Patients are more vulnerable to illness after a surgical procedure, as such the nurses must watch for signs of pneumonia or easily transmitted ailments, such as staph infections. The nurses should also regularly assess the patient’s vital signs, such as heart rate, pulse, respiration, and temperature. The nurse should also monitor the patient’s IV line and urinary catheter if present. If complications arise the nurse should have an open line of communication with the surgical team. Only with coordination between the nurse and the surgeon will outcomes be improved. [Level V]
