Presence of hematological abnormalities and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are needed to make a clinical diagnosis of SDS, according to the latest guidelines. However, other causes of bone marrow failure and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should be excluded.

Patients with suspected exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should have a 72-hour stool fat quantification test performed. Trypsinogen and isoamylase levels aid in the diagnosis; however, trypsinogen levels can only be measured before three years of age as levels start increasing after three years; whereas, isoamylase levels always remain low. A sweat chloride test is normal in these patients, and this distinguishes between SDS and cystic fibrosis.

Routine blood workup can provide information about cytopenias. Patients with SDS need frequent monitoring of blood for early detection of progression to myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

Genetic testing for mutations of the SBDS gene can confirm the diagnosis in 90% of the cases. Upon confirmation of diagnosis, a bone marrow biopsy, aspirate smear, cytological testing, and a skeletal survey is recommended.

Referral to a specialist should be made if any neurocognitive deficit is suspected.
