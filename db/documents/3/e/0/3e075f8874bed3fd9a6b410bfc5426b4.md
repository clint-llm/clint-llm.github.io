The heart is a muscular pump that provides the force necessary to circulate blood throughout the body.  Cardiac muscle requires blood flow to function.  This flow is provided by the coronary arteries.  The right coronary artery arises from the right aortic sinus of the aorta, just above the aortic valve.  Similarly, the left coronary artery, also known as the left main coronary artery, arises from the left aortic sinus.  The left main coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending artery that supplies the anteroseptal wall of the heart and the circumflex coronary artery that supplies the posterior and lateral portions.
