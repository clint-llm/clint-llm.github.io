Cystic hygromas are the most common subtype of lymphangiomas, presenting at birth and in early infancy. Enlargement of cystic hygromas is common, and they pose an airway obstruction risk in infants. To avoid the high mortality associated with this condition, they must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of cystic hygromas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of cystic hygromas.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of cystic hygromas.
- Describe the management options available for cystic hygromas.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cystic hygromas and improve outcomes.
