Under light microscopy, hair follicles are easily distinguished from the surrounding dermis. However, careful inspection is required as not all hair follicles are oriented in the same direction within tissue samples. Hair-bearing tissue may reveal several longitudinal, oblique, and cross-sectional views of hair follicles. Associated structures such as muscle fibers of the arrector pili muscle and/or sebaceous glands of the pilosebaceous unit may be helpful in determining unknown structures as hair follicles. The base of the hair follicle includes the dermal papilla and the matrix cell layer. These layers are easily distinguished from one another upon H&E staining. The hair matrix cells are basophilic, which contrasts the pale and lightly eosinophilic areas of the dermal papilla. The dermal papilla, as mentioned, forms an invagination of dermis into the basophilic hair bulb. The hair follicle is encased by the dermal sheath, which appears as a fine eosinophilic line surrounding the basophilic hair follicle. Higher magnification will reveal the finite structures of the root sheath layer and hair shaft.
