Similar to exstrophy bladder, the diagnosis of epispadias is clinical and does not require any other additional investigations for diagnosis. A plain radiograph should always be performed to document pubic diastasis. In children with incontinent epispadias, the bladder is a low-pressure receptacle. Thus, an ultrasound KUB to rule out associated congenital anomalies of the upper tract is usually sufficient in the preoperative period. Other investigations, including cystourethrography (MCUG) and nuclear scintigraphy scans, should be performed to assess the baseline renal function in children with continent epispadias, as tubularizing the open urethral plate will further increase the outlet resistance and may lead to upper tract damage. However, it has been shown that the incidence of vesicoureteric reflux before surgery ranges from 35% to 85%, due to lateral ureteral ectopia. Due to this, some surgeons perform MCUG and nuclear scintigraphy scans in all children.
