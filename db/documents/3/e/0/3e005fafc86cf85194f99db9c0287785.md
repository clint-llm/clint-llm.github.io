The tibialis anterior muscle, also known as the tibialis anticus, is the largest ofÂ four muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg. Its thick muscle belly arises from its proximal attachment at the lateral tibia; the tibialis anterior tendon (TAT) inserts distally on the medial border of the foot. The muscle is primarily responsible for dorsiflexion and inversion of the foot.
