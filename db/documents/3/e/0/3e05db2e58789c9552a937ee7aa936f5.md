Blockade of the brachial plexus effectively provides anesthesia to the upper limb from the shoulder to the fingertips. Approaches to blocking the brachial plexus depend on the indication, planned surgery or procedure, patient-specific body habitus, medical comorbidities, and individual anatomical variants. This activity will address the indications, ultrasound probe placement, sonoanatomy, and steps in the technique of the ultrasound-guided interscalene block, superior trunk block, supraclavicular brachial plexus block, infraclavicular brachial plexus block, and axillary brachial plexus block. This activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in implementing use of brachial plexus blocks to improve patient outcomes in the perioperative period.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the sonoanatomy of the brachial plexus that is relevant to brachial plexus blockade.
- Select a brachial plexus block that best suits the clinical presentation.
- Manage the complications of a brachial plexus block.
- Apply effective strategies to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to facilitate positive outcomes for patients undergoing a brachial plexus block.
