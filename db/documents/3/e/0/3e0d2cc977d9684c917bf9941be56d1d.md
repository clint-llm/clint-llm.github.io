Myocarditis can be hard to distinguish from cardiac sarcoidosis due to similar clinical presentation, including ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure, presence of LGE on CMR, and abnormal uptake on FDG-PET. Viral myocarditis may or may not be preceded by a viral prodrome, and giant cell myocarditis usually has a more fulminant course.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is another condition that can present with findings very similar to CS.

LGE in the ventricular septum is usually absent in ARVC, and intramyocardial fat infiltration is more likely in ARVC.

The presence of LGE on CMR can be found in a multitude of other conditions, including prior myocardial infarction, cardiac amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Fabry disease, and hereditary hemochromatosis. A pattern of distribution of LGE that appears to correlate with coronary artery supply can help distinguish scar from prior myocardial infarction and CS. Similarly, hereditary hemochromatosis can present with arrhythmias and heart failure but is associated with skin hyperpigmentation and diabetes, and there is evidence of reduced T2* times on CMR.

Histologically, granulomas seen on endomyocardial biopsy can also be seen in tuberculosis, fungal infections, systemic vasculitis, and immunodeficiencies.
