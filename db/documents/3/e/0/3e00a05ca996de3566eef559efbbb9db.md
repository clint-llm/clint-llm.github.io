The exact reason for sporadic renal angiomyolipoma is not fully known.

Hereditary renal angiomyolipomas are caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene.

Deficient or defective TSC1 or TSC2 gene activity will lead to unchecked activation of the mTOR pathway resulting in the formation of angiomyolipomas.

Angiomyolipomas are generally considered benign and will only very rarely become malignant.
