The diagnosis of an AP window is usually made by echocardiography. It cannot be emphasized enough that a high clinical suspicion of a large left to right shunt and bounding pulses should prompt an echocardiogram focusing on an evaluation for an AP window. Late repair of AP window is a risk for persistence of substantial pulmonary hypertension, and preoperative catheterization is recommended in advance of late AP window repair. There should be a low threshold for postoperative cardiac catheterization for evaluating pulmonary vascular resistance. In general, early repair of an AP window results in an excellent long-term prognosis.
