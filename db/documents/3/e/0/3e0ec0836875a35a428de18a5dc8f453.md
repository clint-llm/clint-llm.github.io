**Zenker diverticulum**

The inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle subdivides into the thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscle. The thyropharyngeus muscle is superior to the cricopharyngeus muscle, and during normal swallowing, the thyropharyngeus contracts while the cricopharyngeus relaxes to propel the food into the esophagus. If there is incoordination of contraction and relaxation of these two muscles, intrapharyngeal pressure can rise and form a diverticulum between the weak spot of the two muscles. This structure is called Zenker diverticulum, and it can cause an accumulation of food into the pouch and can lead to dysphagia. Other complication includes gurgling, aspiration, foul breath, and neck mass.

**Pharyngitis**

The pharynx can become inflamed and present with pain, irritation, discomfort, and dysphagia of the throat. This condition can be the result of bacteria or viral infections. If a viral infection is suspected, treatment is often supportive and given NSAIDs for pain. If a bacterial infection is suspected, antibiotics are the therapeutic intervention. Pharyngitis caused by Streptococcus Pyogenes is promptly treated to prevent the sequela of rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis.

**Dysphagia**

Dysphagia is difficulty swallowing foods or liquids, and some etiology can be due to dysmotility of the pharyngeal muscles. Stroke patients can present with dysphagia due to its effect on the pharyngeal muscle.
