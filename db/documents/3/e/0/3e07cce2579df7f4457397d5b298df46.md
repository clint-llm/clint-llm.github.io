Patients presenting with somnambulism have the potential to harm themselves physically. Parents of children who sleepwalk must take steps to ensure the avoidance of unsafe situations, such as falling down the stairs or off balconies. Patients that sleepwalk should always have their bedrooms on the first floor of the house, and windows and doors must be firmly locked. When dealing with a child that sleepwalks, parents should not try any interventions and avoid slapping, shaking, or shouting at the child. Childhood sleepwalking behavior generally improves by adolescence without any interventions or medication.

Caregivers or spouses of patients that sleepwalk should be educated about scheduled awakenings. Parents of a child that sleepwalks can be instructed to keep a diary of the time of sleepwalking for several nights. Then they should start waking the patient 15 minutes prior to which the sleepwalking has been occurring and make sure the patient is fully awake for a few minutes.
