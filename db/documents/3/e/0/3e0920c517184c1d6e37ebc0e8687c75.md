Currently, there is no known toxicity is associated with high doses of vitamin K1 or vitamin K2. Therefore, there is no designated upper intake level (UL). Despite this, an allergic reaction is possible with either version of vitamin K. Vitamin K1 has had documented associations with bronchospasm and cardiac arrest with IV administration. The oral form of vitamin K does not seem to cause severe reactions.

Vitamin K2 also does not display any adverse effects when ingested orally. Studies have shown that coagulation studies in humans did not show an increased risk of blood clots when ingesting 45 mg per day of vitamin K2 (as MK-4). Researchers observed this in a patient who took upwards of 135 mg per day (45 mg three times per day).

The synthetic vitamin K3 is very toxic, and as a result, has been banned from over-the-counter sales in the United States because ingestion could result in allergic reactions, hemolytic anemia, and cytotoxicity in liver cells.
