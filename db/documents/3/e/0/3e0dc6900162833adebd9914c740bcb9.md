The histologic findings are heterogeneous. BD shows bullae with inconsistent levels of skin layer separation. Initial reports described intraepidermal blisters (subcorneal or suprabasal) without acantholysis, situated in most cases in the superficial part of the prickle-cell layer, whereas recent publications have usually described subepidermal bullae.

Interestingly, the adjacent epidermis is often unremarkable. The dermis shows minimal inflammation, and microvascular changes consistent with diabetes are also present. The proteinaceous fluid contained in bullae is, most of the time, clear and sterile. However, the sub-epidermal variant can be hemorrhagic.

Direct immunofluoÂ­rescence examination is usually negative, although one report described non-specific associated immunoglobulin M and complement C3 deposits within dermal blood vessel walls.
