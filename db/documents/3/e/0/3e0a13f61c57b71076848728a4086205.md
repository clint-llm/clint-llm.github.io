Inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) is characterized by tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and shortness of breath. The differential diagnosis of IVCS is broad, mainly because it is rarely ever diagnosed as a primary disease process. The differential diagnosis of IVCS are:

- Chronic venous insufficiency

- Shock

- IVC compression

- Malignancy

- Deep vein thrombosis

- Iliocaval syndrome

- Aortocaval syndrome
