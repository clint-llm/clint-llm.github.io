Bactericidal antimicrobials, such as amoxicillin, often are most effective in a “time-dependent” manner rather than a “concentration-dependent” manner. Time-dependent refers to the time that serum concentrations exceed the minimum-inhibitor-concentration (MIC) for the microorganism. Therefore, they are often dosed more frequently, rather than the concentration-dependent drugs, which can be dosed, for example, daily. The more “around-the-clock” dosing provides minor variation in peak and trough serum concentrations.

Amoxicillin is an oral antimicrobial; whereas, ampicillin (which is structurally similar) can be given orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly. Amoxicillin comes in immediate-release or extended-release tablets. It also comes in a chewable tablet or a suspension. It may be mixed (after thoroughly shaking) and administered with formula, milk, water, fruit juice, ginger ale, or other cold drinks if given in suspension. The administration should take place immediately after mixing. Patients should not crush Extended-release tablets, and the administration should be within 1 hour after finishing a meal. Amoxicillin is sometimes preferred over penicillin in children because of its taste.

**Dosing**

- In adults, 750-1750 mg/day in divided doses every 8-12 hours.

- In Pediatric Patients > 3 Months of Age, 20-45 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 8-12 hours.

- Dosing for H. pylori Infection: Triple therapy: 1 gram amoxicillin, 500 mg clarithromycin, and 30 mg lansoprazole, all given twice daily (every 12 hours) for 14 days.

- Dual therapy: 1 gram amoxicillin and 30 mg lansoprazole, each given three times daily.

**Dosing in Renal Impairment**

- Patients with impaired renal function do not generally require a reduction in dose unless the impairment is severe.

- Severely impaired patients with a glomerular filtration rate of < 30 mL/min should not receive an 875-mg dose.

- Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of 10 to 30 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection.

- Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/min should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on the severity of the infection.

- Hemodialysis patients should receive 500 mg or 250 mg every 24 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. They should receive an additional dose both during and at the end of dialysis.

**Geriatric Consideration**

- It is important to note that it is excreted in most people by the kidney, and some renal adjustment and extra caution may be necessary for renal insufficiency. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, the clinician should adjust the dose. It is reported to be partially dialyzable, and therefore, immediate-release tablets can be an option for dosing after hemodialysis.

**Pregnancy**

- Amoxicillin is a pregnancy category B drug under the old FDA classification system, which means there have been no studies demonstrating clear risk. Amoxicillin is widely used in pregnant women. Based on available data, amoxicillin is usually considered compatible for use during pregnancy. The dose and duration of amoxicillin therapy in pregnant and postpartum women are the same as in nonpregnant adults.

**Breastfeeding**

- An exclusively breastfed infant would be expected to receive a maximum daily dosage of about 0.1 mg/kg of amoxicillin with a maternal dose of 500 mg three times daily. This amounts to 0.25 to 0.5% of a typical infant amoxicillin dosage. As discussed above, amoxicillin produces low levels in milk that are not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants. Occasionally, rash and disruption of the infant's gastrointestinal flora, resulting in diarrhea or thrush, have been reported. Consequently, amoxicillin is acceptable in nursing mothers.
