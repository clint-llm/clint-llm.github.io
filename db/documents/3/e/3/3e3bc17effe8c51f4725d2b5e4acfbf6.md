Nowadays, with the use of immune globulin, infection rates of patients with common variable immunodeficiency have been declining; therefore, the major causes of death are more associated with chronic lung disease and malignancies. A prospective study of 473 patients who were followed for 4 decades showed the leading causes of death were a respiratory failure due to chronic lung disease (36 percent), lymphoid and other malignancies (29 percent), and liver disease (9 percent). During the study, 19.6 percent died, with a median age at death of 44 for males and 42 for females.
