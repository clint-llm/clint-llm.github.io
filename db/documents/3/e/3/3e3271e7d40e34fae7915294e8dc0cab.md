Wide-awake Local Anesthesia No Tourniquet (WALANT) is a surgical technique that relies on local anesthetic and hemostatic agents to provide conditions suitable for hand surgery without sedation and tourniquet.

Canadian plastic hand surgeon Dr. Lalonde first implemented WALANT to decrease wait times for surgery.
