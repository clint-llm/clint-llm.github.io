Saturday night palsy has in other instances been referred to as "honeymoon palsy". Both names suggest a scenario where immobilization in an unnatural position can result in prolonged compressive damage onto the radial nerve. Intoxicated individuals may not retain the reflexive ability to correct their position while asleep. Saturday night palsy classically involves an individual falling asleep with the arm hanging over a chair or other hard surface, leading to compression within the axilla. Honeymoon palsy, on the other hand, refers to an individual falling asleep on the arm of another and consequently compressing that person's nerve. While these areÂ the classically described presentations, one must be aware that Saturday night palsy can be caused by any unnatural positioning or use of the limbs that can cause compression by a similar mechanism. This includes but is not limited to compressive clothing or accessories, improper use of crutches, prolonged blood pressure cuff usage, and more.
