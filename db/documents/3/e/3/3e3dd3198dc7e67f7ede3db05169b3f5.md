According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in December 2015, the rate for heart failure-related deaths decreased from 103.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 to 89.5 in 2009 but subsequently increased to 96.9 in 2014. They note that the trend correlates with a shift from coronary heart disease as the underlying cause of heart failure deaths to metabolic diseases and other noncardiac causes of HF such as obesity, diabetes, malignancies, chronic pulmonary diseases, and renal disease. The mortality rate following hospitalization for heart failure is estimated at around 10% at 30 days, 22% at 1 year, and 42% at 5 years. This can increase to greater thanÂ 50% for patients with NYHA class IV, stage D heart failure.

**Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score**

The Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score is a useful tool for prognosis determination in patients with HF who present to the emergency department with symptoms of HF. It determines the 14-day risk of mortality, hospital readmission, and acute coronary syndrome in patients who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of HF to help arrive at safe disposition planning. Patients with a score of 0 are considered low risk. A score of 1-2 is considered moderate risk, a score of 3-4 is considered high risk, and a score of 5 or higher is considered very high risk. The scoring criteria are as follows:

One point for each of the following

- History of stroke or transient ischemic attack

- Oxygen saturation less than 90%

- Heart rate greater than 110 beats per minute on the 3-minute walk test

- Acute ischemic ECG changes

- An NT-proBNP level of greater than 5000 ng/L

Two points for each of the following

- Prior history of mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress

- Heart rate greater than 110 beats/min on presentation

- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) greater than 33.6 mg/dl (12 mmol/L)

- Serum bicarbonate greater level than 35 mg/d
