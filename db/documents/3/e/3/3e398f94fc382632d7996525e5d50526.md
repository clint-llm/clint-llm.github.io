Elevated hemidiaphragm occurs most commonly from direct or indirect injury to the phrenic nerve. It is often found as an incidental finding on diagnostic studies, and the severity can range from asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of elevated hemidiaphragm and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of elevated hemidiaphragm.
- Describe the typical imaging findings for elevated hemidiaphragm.
- Explain the treatment and management options available for elevated hemidiaphragm.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by elevated hemidiaphragm.
