Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare dermatologic condition characterized by painless erythematous papules on the face with folliculocentric keratin spines. This condition is unique to patients with trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV) in the setting of immunosuppression. The comparatively low incidence of trichodysplasia spinulosa within the susceptible population does not align with the ubiquitous nature of TSPyV in the general population, implying an insufficient understanding of this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and proposed treatment of trichodysplasia spinulosa and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in identifying patients with this condition to improve patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of trichodysplasia spinulosa.
- Review the clinical presentation of trichodysplasia spinulosa.
- Identify the diagnostic findings and histopathologic features of trichodysplasia spinulosa.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in recognition, work-up, and treatment of this condition.
