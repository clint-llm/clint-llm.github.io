Pediatric scleredema is an uncommon and under-recognized disorder. An enhanced education program about the disease is required, especially among pediatricians, primary care providers, and nurse practitioners. The primary clinician may not know how to manage the disorder, but they should know when to refer the patient to a dermatologist. Without the benefit of controlled trials, the treatment remains empirical and based on personal experience. The pharmacist should educate the patient on the different medications used to treat the disorder and their potential side effects, as well as performing medication reconciliation to avoid any drug-drug interactions. Concerns should be reported to the clinician managing the patient. Patients should have screening for diabetes and hematological malignancies. Because many patients develop anxiety and depression, a mental health nurse should counsel these patients. Nursing can also monitor for treatment effectiveness and inquire regarding potential medication side effects, reporting these to the healthcare team. Open communication and collaboration between members of the interprofessional team are necessary to achieve good outcomes. [Level V]
