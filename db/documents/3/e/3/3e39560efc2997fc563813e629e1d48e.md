Testing for pertussis is not readily available in the emergency department. Nasopharyngeal culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may yield laboratory confirmation, but the fastidious and slow-growing Bordetella organisms require specialized media, and cultures are typically not positive for 3 to 7 days. In adults, by the time the diagnosis is suspected, cultures are typically negative (96%), and overall culture sensitivity is only 20% to 40%. PCR is more sensitive and specific than culture, but testing is not widely available.

In the emergency department, pertussis should be considered in patients with prolonged cough, especially occurring in paroxysms or with whoops or post-tussive emesis. During the late catarrhal and early paroxysmal phases, leukocytosis (often 25,000 to 60,000 per mL) with lymphocytosis may raise suspicion for pertussis. In a study of 100 infants less than 120 days old and admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit, there was a significantly higher leukocytosis in the five fatal cases. Unfortunately, leukocytosis may be the only laboratory finding useful in the emergency department. Chest x-ray findings are nonspecific and may show peribronchial thickening, atelectasis, or infiltrates. The classic association, though not often seen, is a “shaggy” right heart border.
