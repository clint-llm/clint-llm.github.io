Grossly, otosclerotic foci are chalky white, greyish, or yellowish in appearance. If the osteosclerotic centers are active and progressing rapidly, then they appear red due to increased vascularity.

Microscopically, the dense enchondral layer of the otic capsule appears to contain the spongy bone. In immature active lesions of otosclerosis, there is plenty of marrow and vascular spaces with numerous osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Also, there is a large quantity of cement substance that stains bluish-grey (blue mantles) with hematoxylin-eosin stain.
