The success of statins in lowering lipids or preventing cardiovascular events depends on the patient's medication adherence. Some barriers to successful statin therapy include experiencing adverse effects, lack of understanding of the importance of statin therapy, and cost; these factors may prevent patients from taking these medications as prescribed. It is also crucial for the interprofessional team to emphasize the importance of lifestyle modification in treating hyperlipidemia. This includes eating a proper, healthy diet, adding exercise or activity several times a week, and losing weight if necessary. A dietician or nutritionist may be a valuable addition to the healthcare team to help guide patients through the necessary dietary changes.

All interprofessional health care team members can help identify barriers to adherence. Additional education and counseling around patient concerns and medication benefits may help improve compliance.
