Radiation esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus due to radiation. Radiation esophagitis is typically an adverse effect that develops in individuals receiving radiation cancer therapy, most commonly for breast, lung, and other lymphomas. Symptoms present two to three weeks after the initial therapy and include throat pain, dysphagia, and the sensation that food is stuck. Amifostine is a medication used as a radiation protector in selected populations at risk of radiation esophagitis. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of radiation esophagitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radiation esophagitis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with radiation esophagitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for radiation esophagitis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by radiation esophagitis.
