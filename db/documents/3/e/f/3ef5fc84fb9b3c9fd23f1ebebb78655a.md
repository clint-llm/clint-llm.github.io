**Transsylvian Approach**

The transsylvian approach through a pterional craniotomy gives access to important neural (insula, basal ganglia, I-III cranial nerves), vascular (middle cerebral artery, proximal anterior cerebral artery, internal carotid artery, upper basilar artery), and cisternal (lamina terminalis, chiasmatic, interpeduncular, carotid, crural) structures. For extra-axial lesions (aneurysms, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma), the split of the Sylvian fissure helps to expose the surgical region. For intra-axial lesions in the deep structures to the Sylvian fissure (insular gliomas, basal ganglia gliomas, deep arteriovenous malformations, intracerebral hematomas), a transsylvian-transinsular approach may be useful. The transsylvian-transinsular approach has two main variants anterior and posterior. The anterior transsylvian transinsular approach exposes the lateral head of the caudate nucleus and the anterior limb of the internal capsule. The posterior transsylvian-transinsular approach exposes the wedge of the basal ganglia (lateral to the internal capsule), the claustrum, the extreme capsule, the putamen, and the globus pallidus.

**Sylvian Fissure Split**

The splitting of the Sylvian fissure is one of the most important surgical skills in neurosurgery, and it requires a deep knowledge of neuroanatomy. The "inside-out technique," introduced by Yasargil, is an effective and atraumatic way to open the Sylvian fissure.

**Indications**

- Insular tumors

- Middle cerebral artery aneurysms

- Anterior circulation aneurysms

- Basilar aneurysms (distal)

- Anterior skull base tumors

**General Principles:**use the "inside-out" dissection

Patient's position: supine, head rotated away 30 degrees.

There are three spaces from superficial to deep, with different challenges:

- Superficial opercular compartment: 

- Identify the anterior Sylvian point below the pars triangularis of the inferior frontal lobe, the best point to start the dissection. 
- Sharp incision of the outer arachnoid membrane, always on the frontal side of the superficial Sylvian veins 
- Gentle displacement of the superficial veins to the temporal lobe.
- Dissection of the arachnoid bands that connect brain-brain and vein-vein, exposing the lateral Sylvian membrane.

- Deep opercular compartment: 

- Dissection of the lateral Sylvian membrane exposing the deep opercular compartment 
- Dissection of the arachnoid bands, mainly brain-brain (intermediate Sylvian membrane is a prominent brain-brain arachnoid band) and artery-brain.

- Cisternal compartment 

- Identification of the M2 segment (perpendicular to the surgeon's line of sight) deeply seated on the lateral surface of the insula.

Follow the branches of the middle cerebral artery from distal to proximal gives orientation to the neurosurgeon.

The Sylvian dissection, preservation of the venous anatomy, and its drainage pathways can be largely facilitated by applying the intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) venography.
