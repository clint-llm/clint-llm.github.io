The muscles that make up the neck are part of the myofascial system, which determines both an anatomical and functional continuum.

The neck muscles (superficial and deep) are activated by the cortical system via the reticulospinal system; activation is synchronous, regardless of the depth of the muscle layer.

The SCM in healthy subjects is rich in white or anaerobic fibers (about 65%), with a lower percentage of red or aerobic fibers (about 35%).
