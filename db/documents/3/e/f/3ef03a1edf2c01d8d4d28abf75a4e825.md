Patients with partial seizures have a higher risk of seizure recurrence than those with generalized seizures. However, recurrence rates of simple and complex partial seizures appear to be the same. The risk of seizure-related complications like aspiration, and overall morbidity and mortality are lower in simple partial seizures than in those where consciousness is impaired.

Simple partial seizures can result in falls and trauma. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled seizures can cause chronic neurological and cognitive impairment. The prognosis of a simple partial seizure is believed to be similar to that of a complexÂ partial seizure and is dependent on the underlying etiology of seizures.
