In xanthelasma palpebrarum, the epidermis is spared and the papillary dermis as well. In the reticular dermis, the inflammatory infiltrate is perivascular, and it is composed of mixed cells, including mono and multinucleated foam cells within the lipid-laden cytoplasmic vacuoles in the superficial reticular dermis. The subcutaneous fatty layer is usually spared.
