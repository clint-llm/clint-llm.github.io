Protected health information is clinically relevant because the circumstances surrounding its disclosure shape the interactions between patients and healthcare providers. For instance, when a patient happens to be a celebrity, health care providers must balance the patient's privacy needs with the public's "right" to know.

There are many ways that healthcare providers can take precautions to ensure that protected health information remains properly protected, to enhance patient care, and preserve patient safety, particularly concerning electronic storage and transmission of PHI. Some standard procedures include data masking, encryption, and deidentification. Encryption is the equivalent of locking data in a vault and preventing anyone without the necessary digital key or certificate from accessing it. Data masking is the replacement of sensitive data values with altered values that nonetheless preserve the utility of the data set as a reference source. Encryption is more useful when attempting to protect data during transmission, while data masking is most useful when sharing data with an external organization. Deidentification is the systematic removal of eighteen pieces of identifying information,Â ranging from names and telephone numbers to biometric identifiers like finger and voice prints.
