When a patient arrives at the trauma center, it is vital to rule out life-threatening injuries as soon as possible and initiate necessary treatment. Commonly the preferred method of evaluation is the "ABCDE rule" under the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) guidelines:

(1) Airway – ensure the patient has a patent airway while maintaining cervical spine stability

(2) Breathing

(3) Circulation and control of hemorrhage if applicable

(4) Disability – evaluation of the patients mental status

(5) Exposure – removing all clothing items from the patient to obtain a full assessment.

Another exam modality commonly implemented in the emergency department when assessing a trauma patient is the focused abdominal sonogram for trauma or FAST exam. This exam uses ultrasound to identify free fluid in the abdomen. This exam is preferred over a CT initially due to time, feasibility, and accessibility. If the FAST exam is positive, then a CT is generally obtained.
