The ovary has two primary functions. First, the ovary produces hormones that drive the female reproductive system. Second, the ovary controls the development, selection, and release of a mature oocyte for fertilization. This process, known as ovarian folliculogenesis, begins while the female is in-utero. After puberty, primordial follicles can transform through a multi-step process into mature, pre-ovulatory follicles.
