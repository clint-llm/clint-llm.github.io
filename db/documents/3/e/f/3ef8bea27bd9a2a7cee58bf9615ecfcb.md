A typical scenario elicited on history may be that the patient ingested a large amount of alcohol at a party, became intoxicated, and perhaps slept with his or her body weight on the left arm. It is possible that several days elapse before a paresis of the fingers and wrist of the affected hand evolve. In these scenarios, the patient may also complain of pain that runs along the posterior or lateral aspect of the upper arm, travels to the posterior aspect of the forearm, and then to the back of the left hand. The anesthesia may also extend to the posterior aspect of the first three-and-a-half digits.

On physical examination, the individual will have weakness of wrist extension and the inability to extend the fingers. When a lesion to the radial nerve is high above the elbow joint, then the patient may also complain of numbness to the forearm and hand along the radial nerve's dermatome described above.

When testing for wrist-drop deformity, the patient should be asked to hold the affected arm out with the forearm parallel to the floor. The back of the hand should be facing the ceiling and the fingers should be pointed downwards. An individual with a wrist drop will be unable to move the hand from this position to one where the wrist and fingers are straight. There may also be a loss of the triceps muscle reflex, as the radial nerve is responsible for extension of the elbow.
