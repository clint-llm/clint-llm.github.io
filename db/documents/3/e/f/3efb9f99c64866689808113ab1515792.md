Pulmonary hamartomas are benign malformations of the lung and include an abnormal mixture of tissue components such as cartilage, epithelium, fat, or muscle which are common to the lung but the organ architecture is not preserved. This activity describes the evaluation and management of pulmonary hamartoma and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of pulmonary hamartoma.
- Identify the typical 'popcorn' or 'comma-shaped' appearance of calcification on imaging of pulmonary hamartoma.
- Outline the use of surgery in the management of pulmonary hamartoma.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve the delivery of care for patients affected by pulmonary hamartoma.
