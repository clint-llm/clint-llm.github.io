The typical triad of clinical features associated with renal cell carcinoma comprises flank pain, abdominal mass, and haematuria.

Hypertension, anemia, and cancer anorexia cachexia are the common paraneoplastic conditions observed.

Hepatitis, rich in a lymphocytic infiltrate with raised Interleukin 6 levels, has been postulated to underlie paraneoplastic hepatic dysfunction (Stauffer syndrome), which is diagnosed by hepatic enzyme elevation in the absence of liver metastases or intrinsic liver disease or cholestasis.

Hypercalcemia may be due to direct bone involvement, due to parathormone related peptide, dihydrocholicalciferol derived from the tumor and prostaglandins.

Erythropoietin production by the renal parenchyma or by the surrounding tissue in response to hypoxia may lead to polycythemia.

Anecdotal symptoms attributable to paraneoplastic phenomena include hypoglycemia, neuropathy, myopathy, vascular thrombosis, Cushing syndrome, protein-related enteropathy, gynecomastia, decreased libido, hirsutism, amenorrhoea, necrotizing myopathy, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

Although physical assessment has a limited role in diagnosing this condition, the presence of an abdominal mass, lower extremity edema, and new-onset varicocele should prompt a search for a mass lesion in the retroperitoneal region.
