Continuous application of cold water to the skin can be achieved by either sponging the patient or using a spray bottle. Placing a fan to blow directly on the patient, while also spraying or sponging the patient, will increase the rate of evaporation, and thereby more rapidly decrease body temperature. Another option is to submerge a sheet in cold water and then wring it out and wrap the patient in the damp sheet. This sheet can be changed and re-submerged when it is no longer cool. The downside of these methods is that they require continuous reapplication of the water and ice to maintain efficacy.

Another option is to apply ice packs to the patient. The areas that are most effective in cooling core temperature are the groin, axillae, neck, and torso. Cold saline can be infused with care to monitor for resultant shivering. More frequent ice pack changes and reapplication of cold water will allow for more rapid cooling.

If a pool is available, then ice water immersion should be performed. Fill the pool with water and ice. Place the patient in the pool, taking care to submerge the torso to the groin and axillae preferentially to the extremities. Frequently recheck the patient's vital signs and monitor mental status. When the temperature is below 40 degrees C, removed the patient from the pool.
