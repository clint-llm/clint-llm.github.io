Differential diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes the following:

- Cholangiocarcinoma

- Fibrous nodular hyperplasia

- Dysplastic/Regenerative nodules in cirrhosis

- Hepatic adenoma

- Primary hepatic lymphoma

- Cirrhosis

- Metastatic cancer

Ultrasound with doppler typically demonstrates fine branching patterns with increased vascularity and greater flow velocity as compared to hemangioma and metastatic disease to the liver. HCC appears hypervascular on the arterial phase with portal venous washout while regenerative nodules appear isoechoic or hypoechoic in contrast to the rest of the parenchyma. Cholangiocarcinoma may present on multiphasic CT with both arterial and delayed enhancement.
