Initial evaluation and treatment of a patient with serotonin toxicity are similar to any overdose, altered mental status, or poisoning patient with the establishment of intravenous access, initiation of cardiac monitoring, stabilization of vital signs, and fluid resuscitation. Diagnosis of serotonin toxicity is not only clinical but also a diagnosis of exclusion, therefore, even though diagnosis does not rely on any specific laboratory value, thorough testing to rule out other causes of altered mental status is essential.
