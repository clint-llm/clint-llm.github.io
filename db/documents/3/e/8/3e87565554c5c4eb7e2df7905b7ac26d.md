The prognosis of intercostal neuralgia is variable.  Some patients achieve resolution of symptoms over time with or without supportive conservative measures, while others develop chronic pain, which can be a significant source of morbidity.

Studies indicate that up to 5% of patients will develop severe chronic symptoms that are disabling and interfere with normal life after thoracic surgery.

There is approximately a 30% lifetime risk of developing HZ infection, with most cases occurring in patients over the age of 50 and/or immunocompromised. The incidence of developing PHN after HZ infection is reportedly 5 to 30%, and risk factors include older age, prodrome, severe rash, and uncontrolled pain during HZ infection.
