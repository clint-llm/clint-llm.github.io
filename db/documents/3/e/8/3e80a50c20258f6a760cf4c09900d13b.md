It bears mentioning that bombesin is not structurally compatible with the biochemical processes because radioactive iodine (i.e., needed for biotech processes) normally binds to a tyrosine residue on the peptide of interest. Bombesinâ€™s primary structure conflicts with the radioactive iodine and hence renders bombesin incapable of creating a radioactive peptide. This fact is important because the radioactive peptide is what researchers use for receptor binding studies. This issue is also true of all peptides structurally related to bombesin, thus potential use in radioactive labeling may not be possible.
