There are cases reported of Bartonella quintana causing endocarditis from chronically infected patients and bacillary angiomatosis, mainly in immunocompromised patients. Patients documented to present with endocarditis typically have chest pain, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, and other non-specific symptoms of malaise, cough, and fatigue. The examination usually mimics classic endocarditis. This includes new cardiac murmurs, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, and vascular and immunologic phenomena.

Organisms most common for blood culture-negative endocarditis include but are not limited to Bartonella, Coxiella, Chlamydia, Legionella, Mycoplasma, Aspergillus, and Brucella.Bartonella is the causative organism in approximately 20% of all charted cases of blood culture-negative endocarditis.

Not all patients with trench fever develop bacillary angiomatosis, but it should be considered in those patients who have a cell-mediated immunodeficiency, such as HIV, and posttransplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy. Bartonella quintana can induce new blood vessel formation, which leads to antiproliferative tumors.Bartonella organisms express surface adhesins and stick easily to one another.
