There are no laboratory abnormalities specific to the Pancoast tumor.

A chest x-ray can be used for initial screening, which shows the increased size of the apical cap or apical mass of the lung. CT scan provides additional information with regards to the extent of the tumor, satellite nodules, as well as mediastinal adenopathy, all of which are vital in the staging of these tumors. Although CT has poor sensitivity and specificity for accurate local staging, especially in evaluating the brachial plexus, subclavian vessel, and chest wall involvement, it identifies bony involvement.

MRI of the neck, chest and upper abdomen usually is done after the diagnosis is made and before surgery to identify the extent of vascular and brachial plexus involvement. However, MRI has been suggested as more useful in these tumors, as it helps better delineate soft tissue involvement, invasion of brachial plexus, vasculature, and spinal involvement. Therefore, MRI is currently preferred on potentially surgically resectable tumors.

Due to the outer location of these tumors, CT-guided core biopsy is the diagnostic test of choice with a reported yield of more than 90%. Bronchoscopy has been reported to be diagnostic in around 30% to 40% of the cases, which maybe because of the presence of an additional endobronchial tumor. Sputum cytology and scalene node biopsies usually have a low yield.
