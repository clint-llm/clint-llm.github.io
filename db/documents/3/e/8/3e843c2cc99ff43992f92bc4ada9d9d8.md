As the most common cause of clinic visits due to nerve entrapment, carpal tunnel syndrome affects a significant portion of the population. Often, history and physical exam may be inadequate to evaluate the severity fully or to confirm the diagnosis. This activity describes the invaluable electrodiagnostic findings of nerve conduction tests and needle electromyography studies and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in patients suspected of carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Outline the importance of communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.
