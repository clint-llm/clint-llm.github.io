In managing PPS, an interdisciplinary approach is essential. It should involve healthcare professionals from primary care, neurology, radiology, psychiatry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech pathology, nutrition, neuropsychology, social work, palliative care, and specialty-trained nursing.

Collaboration among interprofessional healthcare team members can enhance disease management and improve functional outcomes for patients. Because PPS conditions advance rapidly and result in profound functional impairments, healthcare professionals must coordinate care promptly to limit disease progression and alleviate debilitating symptoms. Medications require strict management to maximize therapeutic benefits and limit harmful side effects. Therapies and support services provided early in the disease course can improve patient function and limit the development of comorbidities.

Since the prognosis is poor and most patients end up in long-term facilities where the quality of life might not be optimal, caregiver education is vital to improve care for patients while they are at home.
