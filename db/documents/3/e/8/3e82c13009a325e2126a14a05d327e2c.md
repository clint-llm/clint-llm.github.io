Laboratory investigations are directed toward defining the potential underlying etiologies as well as evaluating the complications of cor pulmonale.

- Chest radiograph: Enlargement of the pulmonary artery may be seen, cardiomegaly is confined predominantly, if not exclusively, to the right ventricle and other features may be detected according to the cause

- Electrocardiogram: Shows features of right ventricular hypertrophy/enlargement

- Doppler echocardiography (most practical but heavily operator dependent): The non-invasive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is presently based on echocardiography. Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography allows the calculation of the trans tricuspid pressure gradient from the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet

- Chest CT angiography to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism as a cause. Main pulmonary artery diameter measurements greater than 29 mm have a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 75% for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension

- Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scanning can be particularly useful in evaluating patients with cor pulmonale, especially if pulmonary hypertension is due to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)

- MRI: This noninvasive technique yields highly accurate dimensions of the right ventricle but is not routinely used

- PFTs and 6-minute walk test for assessment of the severity of lung disease and exercise capacity respectively

- A right heart cath is a gold standard for diagnosis, assessment of Pulmonary hypertension severity. Right heart catheterization reveals evidence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction (mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) above 25 mmHg) without left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Differentiating left-sided from the right-sided disease includes measuring the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), which is an estimation of left atrial pressure. Thus, RV dysfunction is also defined as having a PCWP below 15 mmHg.
