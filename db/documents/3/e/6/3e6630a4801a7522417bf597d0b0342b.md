Several factors impede the application of laboratory-related biosafety measures within the facility. These may include, but not limited to:

- The absence of a technical document containing specific biosafety guidelines

- Poor biosafety skillsÂ (for example, on spills management) because of lack of training

- The continuous presence of laboratory hazards and increased vulnerability due to poor execution of bio-risk assessment, reduction, and management activities

- Use of substandard laboratory supplies

- Poor equipment maintenance

Biosafety guidelines are more likely to be poorly implemented in facilities because of:

- Poorly written guidelines, including the adoption of generic, nonspecific procedures

- Unclear roles and responsibilities for each staff involved

- Lack of review and updating process of existing guide

- Poor dissemination and access to such guidelines
