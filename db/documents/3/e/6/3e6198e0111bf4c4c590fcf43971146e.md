Evaluation is based on fundoscopic examination, visual field testing, tonometry, optical coherence tomography, and gonioscopy. Other helpful tests include visual acuity to see if vision is being affected, pachymetry to evaluate corneal thickness, and retinal scans to help monitor for progressive changes in the retinal nerve fiber layer.

Glaucoma is diagnosed based on clinical characteristic findings of a progressive optic neuropathy or visual field defects based on the testing modalities listed above. There is no single ‘gold standard’ test for the diagnosis of glaucoma. Providers must recognize the characteristic optic nerve appearance, risk factors, and collate the results of ancillary testing to establish a correct diagnosis and staging of glaucoma. Currently, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends routine comprehensive eye examinations for patients with risk factors for glaucoma with a frequency determined on an individual basis, considering age, risk factors, race, and family history.
