Parotidectomy is the partial or complete removal of the parotid gland, and it may be indicated for a variety of reasons that can include inflammatory conditions, certain infectious processes, congenital malformations, and benign or malignant neoplasms. Regardless of the indication for surgery, parotidectomy is a meticulous procedure requiring experienced surgeons, particularly due to the relationship of the gland to the facial nerve. Therefore identification and preservation of the facial nerve are the most crucial steps during the procedure (second only to oncologic safety in the case of known malignancy). Emphasis is on identification because, in the vast majority of cases, preoperative prediction of the relationship of the tumor to the nerve is not possible with much accuracy unless facial paralysis is already present prior to intervention.
