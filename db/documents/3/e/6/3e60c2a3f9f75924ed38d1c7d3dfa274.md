Grossly renal oncocytomas are well-circumscribed, tan-brown or mahogany-colored masses with a central stellate scar.

Microscopically, renal oncocytomas appear well-circumscribed. The mass is composed of nests and tubular structures line by round to polygonal cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cells have uniform nuclei with prominent central nucleoli.

It is well established that oncocytomas may contain a degree of cytologic atypia, which is thought to be degenerative. This atypia may include increased nuclear size, irregular nuclear contours, and smudged chromatin.

Clinicians can confirm the diagnosis of oncocytoma with immunohistochemistry. The most common stain used is cytokeratin 7, which is minimally positive and limited to scattered individual cells or small clusters. AMACR may be positive in low intensity. Oncocytoma should have membranous positivity for CD117. Other positive stains include cyclin D1, kidney-specific cadherin, S100A1, and E-cadherin.

If evaluated on a cytology specimen, oncocytoma will have large cells with granular cytoplasm, regular nuclei with tiny nucleoli, and minimal atypia.
