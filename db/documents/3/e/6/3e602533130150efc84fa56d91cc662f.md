Bariatric surgery typically requires a multidisciplinary team that evaluates the patient before surgery. This includes a dietitian, a psychiatric specialist, an anesthetist, nursing, surgical team, and the primary care provider. This approach has been shown to improve patient outcomes and decrease the chances of a major postoperative complication.
