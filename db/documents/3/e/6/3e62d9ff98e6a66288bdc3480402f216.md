Cetirizine is a medication used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and urticaria. It is a second-generation antihistamine. Cetirizine was FDA-approved in the United States as a prescription-only product in 1995, and later in 2007, it got approval as an over-the-counter medication. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for cetirizine as a valuable agent in treating rhinitis and urticaria. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients using cetirizine.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of cetirizine.
- Outline the adverse effects of cetirizine.
- Review the monitoring of cetirizine.
- Explain how healthcare professionals should educate patients on the potential adverse effects of cetirizine, such as drowsiness and fatigue.
