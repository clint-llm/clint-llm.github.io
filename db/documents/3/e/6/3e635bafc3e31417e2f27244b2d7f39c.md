The first, second, and third pharyngeal arches play a role in the development of the submandibular triangle. The first pharyngeal arch is the progenitor to the mandible while the second and third give rise to the hyoid. The majority of the contents of the submandibular triangle are contained between these structures and primarily arise from mesoderm and neural crest derivatives. The submandibular gland arises from an outpouching of endodermal tissue.
