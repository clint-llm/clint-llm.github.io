Several laboratory tests can be sent if an infectious process in the pancreas is suspected. However, none are specific to the condition. A complete blood count (CBC) with differential, basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver function test (LFT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase and blood cultures should be obtained in patients presenting with pancreatitis and not improving despite conservative management. CRP greater than 150 has been associated with the detection of the presence of pancreatic necrosis with a 100% sensitivity and 81.4% specificity.****A hematocrit of higher than 44% has been established to be a risk factor for pancreatic necrosis and the development of an abscess.

Imaging studies are also required when the patient fails to improve within 72 hours of treatment.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both options for assessment of pancreatic necrosis and abscesses, although CT is more commonly used. On imaging, the presence of extraluminal gas in the pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissues is consistent with an underlying infection.
