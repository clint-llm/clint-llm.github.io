The outcome of MFS is usually good with a case fatality of less than 5%. The mean recovery times range between 8 to 12 weeks. Residual symptoms may be present in some patients, and recurrence has been reported in the literature. In GBS, however, hyponatremia is predictive of poor outcomes with the development of the syndrome of inappropriateÂ antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). About 21 to 48% of GBS patients can suffer from hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is an independent predictive factor for mortality that has been called into question in newer studies, making respiratory status and complications in the ICU as the top predictors of mortality and morbidity.
