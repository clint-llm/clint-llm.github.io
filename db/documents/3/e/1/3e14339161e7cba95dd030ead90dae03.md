There have been no formal studies examining interprofessional care and its relationship to butterbur. Nevertheless, close coordination among all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare providers, is recommended to monitor for side effects and interactions with other medications, especially anticholinergics. As a herbal remedy, butterbur may often not appear on a patient's official prescribed medication list. Therefore, every healthcare provider needs to inquire about alternative or natural remedies when interviewing patients and record it in the patient's chart. By employing interprofessional care coordination and open communication, the healthcare team can optimize patient care and prevent adverse events for patients using butterbur. [Level 5]
