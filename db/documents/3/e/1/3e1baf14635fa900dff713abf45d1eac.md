Cell-free fetal DNA screens are less predictive in cases of maternal obesity leading to low fetal fractions, multiple pregnancies, and less than 10 weeks gestational age. It has, in rare cases, given false results due to occult maternal malignancies.

In the case of multiple pregnancies, no screening test is as accurate as it is in singleton pregnancies. Screening tests for aneuploidy should not be performed if there is evidence of fetal demise or if one of the fetuses has abnormalities identified on ultrasound.

Ultrasound interpretation is dependent upon the skill of the technician.
