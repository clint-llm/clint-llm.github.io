Pulmonary toxicity is a rare but well-documented adverse effect of mitomycin C. In one trial at the Mayo Clinic, despite pre-medication with the use of corticosteroids, pulmonary toxicity occurred, with changes in diffusing lung capacity of 9 and PaO2 of 49 mm Hg. A significant number of patients who had bronchoscopies had changes noted on pulmonary histology consistent with lung injury.

Despite initial responses to corticosteroids, 40% of patients still experienced progressive pulmonary insufficiency despite very high corticosteroid doses. Attention must focus on the chronic and progressive phase of lung toxicity associated with mitomycin C, as this event is a largely underestimated complication of the treatment regimen.
