The genome is encoded by the chemical sequence of DNA nucleotides within our cells. In periods of cell growth, histone proteins around DNA are acetylated causing less interaction between the DNA and histone protein. This opened DNA is called euchromatin and allows transcriptional enzymes access to the DNA. Before periods of cell division, the histone proteins are deacetylated allowing for the formation of a condensed form of DNA called heterochromatin. Somatic human cells contain 23 paired chromosomes or 46 total chromosomes. Forty-six is considered the “diploid” number (2n), while 23 is considered the “haploid” number (1n) or half the diploid number. “Aneuploidy” refers to the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes. Monosomy (n-1) is a form of aneuploidy characterized by missing a single chromosome resulting in 45 total chromosomes. Trisomy (n+1) is another form of aneuploidy that has an extra chromosome resulting in 47 total chromosomes. Each type of aneuploidy can be attributed to nondisjunction during mitosis or meiosis.
