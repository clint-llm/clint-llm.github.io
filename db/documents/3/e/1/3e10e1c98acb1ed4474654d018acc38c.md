Intestinal trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, healthcare providers must evaluate and treat these patients using a systematic approach. Initially, standard trauma protocols should be followed to identify life-threatening injuries and stabilize the patient. This should be done using an interprofessional team approach, including medics, emergency medicine providers, surgeons, nursing staff, radiology staff, operating room staff, anesthesia, and pharmacy support. Multiple studies have shown improved patient outcomes with an interprofessional team approach.
