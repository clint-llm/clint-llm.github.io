Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of cancer death, and its 5-year survival rate is only about 12% despite the advancement in medical care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular biology. The pancreatoduodenectomy, also known as the Whipple procedure, is the surgical procedure of choice for the resectable and the borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. This activity reviews the procedure of pancreaticoduodenectomy, relevant surgical anatomy, technical details, contraindications, and complications. The pancreaticoduodenectomy is the curative treatment for pancreatic cancer. The role of an interprofessional team in the management of cancer patients is important.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for pancreaticoduodenectomy.
- Describe the technique of pancreaticoduodenectomy.
- Review the potential complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in pancreatic cancer patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.
