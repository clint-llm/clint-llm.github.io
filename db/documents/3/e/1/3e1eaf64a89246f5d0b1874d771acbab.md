Patients should be educated on the transmission of HIV, how the virus is acquired, and how it can spread to others. Education regarding the CD4 count level is necessary, as well as the role ART plays in maintaining the patient’s immune function and the side effects of the medications.  Patients should be made aware of the opportunistic infections, malignancies, and comorbid conditions that may occur with long-term HIV infection, AIDS, and ART.  Emphasis should be on the fact that with proper medical care and ART, many patients with HIV can lead very normal lives for many years after diagnosis, which just a few decades ago was not the case for this disease.
