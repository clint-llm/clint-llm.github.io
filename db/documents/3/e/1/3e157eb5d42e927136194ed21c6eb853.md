Candida vulvovaginitis is usually managed by the gynecologist, nurse practitioner, primary care provider or an internist. The condition is clinically diagnosed and management is with antifungal medications. Most simple cases resolve within days.Â Patients with complicated candidal vulvovaginitis require longer therapy. Pregnant patients should not be given oral antifungals. In these patients, a 7-day course of intravaginal therapy is appropriate. Fluconazole is considered safe in breastfeeding women. There is inadequate evidence to recommend intravaginal or oral yogurt therapy, intravaginal garlic, or douching.

At the same time patient education is important. The condition is not life threatening but can be associated with embarrassment and withdrawal from sexual activities. It is also important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis. Trauma, abuse, foreign body, malignancy, immune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and sexually transmitted infections can all present with vaginal discomfort. The provider should always perform a careful and complete physical exam, appropriate ancillary testing as described above, and further testing if treatment failure occurs.
