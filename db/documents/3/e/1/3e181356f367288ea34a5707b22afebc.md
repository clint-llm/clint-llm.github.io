Previous studies have found these factors to have a substantial effect on functional outcome

- Level of the amputation

- Number of fingers injured

- Circumstance and mechanism surround the injury

- Time from injury

Survival rates following replantation have been reported between 80 to 90%, although these figures have come from specialist institutions. It is also worth noting that venous repair improves survival regardless of the level of amputation. This fact is important, as the venous repair is not always possible, and as a result, it could lead to venous congestion.  One solution would be to make a small distal incision to allow venous drainage or the use of leeches.
