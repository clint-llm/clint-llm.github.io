- Bone GCT is a benign but locally aggressive primary bone tumor

- Local control is achieved by the removal of the tumor, but curettage therapies are often performed due to acceptable long-term outcomes and functional consequences of complete resection.

- After the treatment, the patient should be monitored with serial radiographs of the chest and site of involvement in addition to serial physical examinations.

- Relapses may be correlated with new swelling or pain.

- Tumor recurrence has been detected up to many years after the initial involvement and the subsequent treatment.

- At least a 5-year close follow-up is recommended.

- An intensified surveillance (preferably with CT) has been recommended for pulmonary metastasis in patients with a local recurrence of bone GCT, particularly for the first three years after the local recurrence diagnosis.
