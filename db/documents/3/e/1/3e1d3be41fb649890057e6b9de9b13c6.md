Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX) is a systemic disorder that leads to the accumulation of extracellular material in various ocular tissues,

This systemic disorder is typically clinically diagnosed during routine ophthalmic examination with slit-lamp visualization of white, flaky fibrillar (pseudoexfoliative) material on the pupillary margin of the iris and the anterior lens capsule.

The history of PEX dates back to the early 20th century in 1917 when John G. Lindberg first described the characteristic flaky material found in the eyes of patients with glaucoma.

PEX may be present unilaterally or bilaterally. PEX is strongly associated with raised intraocular pressures (IOP) in up to 44% of patients and subsequent development of pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEG), making it the most commonly identifiable cause of secondary open-angle glaucoma.
