**Nonoperative**

Treatment for piriformis syndrome begins with nonoperative modalities including:

- Oral analgesics (e.g. NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and gabapentin)

- Physical therapy: 

- Regimens include nerve stretches, isometric exercises, gluteal muscle strengthening

- Injections

- Diagnostic and therapeutic modalities
- Agents used include cortisone, local anesthetic, or botulinum toxin
- A recent study reported positive outcomes in patients managed with physical therapy and Botulinum toxin injection

**Surgical Treatment**

- Surgery is considered in refractory cases after exhausting nonoperative modalities

- A 2005 study reported surgical outcomes in 64 patients managed with surgical intervention for refractory symptoms: 
- 82% reported initial improvement
- 76% had long-term positive outcomes
- 92% of those managed with surgery returned to work or presurgical baseline activity levels within 2 weeks of the surgery
