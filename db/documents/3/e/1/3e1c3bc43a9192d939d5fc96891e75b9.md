Patients diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have complex needs that require the services of multiple hospital teams to provide optimal treatment and support. Managing the perioperative care of these patients involves extensive cooperation between interprofessional team members. The anesthesia team coordinates closely with the neonatologist ICU, pediatric surgery, and maternal-fetal medicine team regarding medical management and timing of the procedures.

Maintaining open and consistent communication with the surgical and ICU teams is key to ensuring the neonateâ€™s medical condition is fully optimized and the likelihood of a successful procedure is maximized. Many other professional teams also take important roles in caring for these patients, including ICU nursing staff, respiratory therapists, geneticists, other physician specialists, developmental psychologists, social workers, and other allied health professionals.

A cohesive interprofessional team can effectively achieve high-quality medical care for these infants and provide a source of comfort and confidence for the parents of the neonates. Navigating each of the steps from prenatal care through postoperative management can be very challenging. During this time, the interprofessional teams must provide a unified approach to caring for these infants and communicate that plan clearly to the parents.
