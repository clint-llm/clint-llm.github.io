It is not possible to prognosticate in general, the outcome of a particular skin issue amenable to improvement with cosmeceuticals. Every skin has different reactivity, response patterns, and a tendency to develop adverse effects to both pharmaceutical topicals as well as cosmeceuticals. The prognosis after recommended use of cosmeceutical(s) for melasma, e.g., would depend upon the:

(1) Disease characteristics - Depth of melasma, the activity of melanocytes, factors (like hormonal pills) that may antagonize the effect of cosmeceuticals

(2) Patient factors - Skin sensitivity and tolerance to the cosmeceutical, compliance, and adherence to treatment, concomitant meticulous use of sun protection, affordability to maintain the long-term effect, etc.

(3) Cosmeceutical factors - quality, cutaneous bioequivalence of brands, cost, effect, tolerance, the possibility of long-term adverse effects, etc.

Thus, the use of cosmeceuticals requires careful individualization in each patient based on all the above factors.

Aids like dermoscopy may aid inÂ the preferential selection of a particular cosmeceutical based on the findings, e.g., melasma showing brown pigmented structures may be amenable to short term use of moderate-strength cosmeceuticals, while stronger treatment may be necessary for deep melasma.
