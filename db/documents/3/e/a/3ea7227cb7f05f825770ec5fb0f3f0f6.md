There is no intervertebral disc between C1 and C2, which is unique in the spine.

Two major ligaments support the intervertebral discs. The anterior longitudinal ligament is a broad band that covers the anterolateral surface of the spine from the foramen magnum in the skull to the sacrum. This ligament assists the spine in preventing hyperextension and prevents intervertebral disc herniation in the anterolateral direction. The posterior longitudinal ligament covers the posterior aspect of the vertebral bodies, within the vertebral canal, and serves mainly to prevent a posterior herniation of the intervertebral discs, and is responsible for most herniations being in the postero-lateral direction.
