In cases of suspected tarantula-related injuries, symptomatic treatment is generally sufficient with local wound care. Removal of urticating hairs can be attempted with tape in cutaneous exposures. This method can help prevent the hairs from progressing deeper during removal attempts. Systemic antihistamines and steroids may improve symptoms. Anaphylaxis, although rare, should be treated in the same manner as from other etiologies. Antibiotics are not routinely recommended for tarantula bites unless there are clinical signs of secondary infection from the exposure.

Despite their name, “wolf spiders” of the species Lycosa tarantula, are not true tarantulas.
