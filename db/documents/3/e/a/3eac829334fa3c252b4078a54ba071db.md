Dermatoscopy helps to differentiate pityriasis roseaÂ from other conditions. It shows a yellowish background color, a peripheral arrangement of the scales, and a patchy distribution of loosely arranged dotted vessels.

Histopathology shows superficial perivascular dermatitis. Focal parakeratosis in mounds, hyperplasia, and focal spongiosis are observed in the epidermis. The epidermis may show exocytosis of lymphocytes, variable spongiosis, mild acanthosis, and a thinned granular layer. Extravasated red blood cells along with a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils are seen in the dermis.
