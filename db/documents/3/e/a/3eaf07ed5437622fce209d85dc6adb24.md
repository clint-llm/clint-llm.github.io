Interpreting the Weil-Felix test requires knowledge of the disease course and corresponding immune response. The level of IgM necessary for a positive result is not seen until 5-10 days after the onset of illness, and a single negative test cannot exclude disease.

Some confirmed rickettsial infections require CDC notification. These include anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Q fever, and spotted fever rickettsioses. The Weil-Felix test is not definitively diagnostic but can be included in the report as supporting information. The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken two to four weeks later in the convalescent phase), which has a much higher sensitivity and specificity.
