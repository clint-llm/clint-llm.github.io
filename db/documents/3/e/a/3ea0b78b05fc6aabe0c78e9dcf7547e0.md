Good knowledge of clinical/radiological presentations of bone cysts; as well as possible distinguishing features from other bone tumors presenting as lytic lesions of the bone is of utmost importance in appropriate medical planning and management of these lesions. Although orthopedic surgeons play a pivotal role in the management of these patients, appropriate inputs from pediatricians, family physicians, radiologists, pathologist, orthopedic surgeons, and physiotherapists are necessary at different stages of management. Nurse practitioners are involved in home care management when pathological fractures are managed conservatively.

Inter-departmental co-operation and planning of treatment protocols in consultation with patients, physicians, nurses, and social workers enhance team performance and patient care. A majority of our knowledge on this topic has its basis in level IV or V evidence.
