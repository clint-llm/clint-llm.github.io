After placing the patient's chin on the chin rest, the assistant holds the head of the patient to prevent head movements while capturing images. The moment dye is injected, control photographs are taken, which automatically switches on the timer. Pictures are taken at an interval of 1.5 to 2 seconds. After the choroidal arterial and venous system is filled with the dye, photographs are taken at a slower pace. Pictures of the fellow eye also have to be taken.

**Normal ICGA Phases**

-  Early phase - The early phase has three stages:

- Stage 1: Begins 2 seconds after the injection of the dye. It is marked by rapid filling of choroidal arteries and choriocapillaris and early filling of choroidal veins. The choroidal watershed zone and the retinal vasculature remain dark in this stage. 
- Stage 2: Three to five seconds after ICG injection, larger choroidal veins, and retinal arterioles fill the dye.
- Stage 3: (6 seconds to 3 minutes) - The choroidal watershed zone gets filled with the dye, and larger choroidal veins and choroidal arteries begin to fade.

- The middle phase (3 to 15 minutes) is characterized by fading of the retinal and choroidal vessels.

- Late phase (15 to 60 minutes) - Staining of the extrachoroidal tissue is noted. It gives an illusion that choroidal vasculature is hypofluorescent compared to the background tissue. Retinal vessels are not visualized during this phase.
