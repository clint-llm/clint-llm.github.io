The dysfunction of the parathyroid glands is an underlying cause of multiple pathologies. Primary hyperparathyroidism characteristically shows inappropriate PTH secretion from at least one parathyroid gland and is most commonly caused by a single adenoma, but may also be caused by multiple adenomas, hypertrophy of all four parathyroids, or rarely carcinoma.
