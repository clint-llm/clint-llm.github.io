Preventative techniques can be used in patients to prevent atony and PPH, including active management of the third stage of labor with oxytocin administration, uterine massage, and umbilical cord traction. Identifying high-risk patients before delivery is one of the most important factors in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with PPH. This allows for planning appropriate routes and timing of delivery in the appropriate medical resource setting. Patients with previous cesarean delivery should have ultrasound evaluation antepartum to help determine the appropriate route and place of delivery. Treatment of patients with anemia by either oral or parenteral iron supplementation should be considered, especially in patients with hematocrit less than 30%. Additionally, consideration for erythropoietin stimulating agents with hematology consultation should be undertaken in high-risk patients, especially in those who do not accept a blood transfusion.

Standardized, multidisciplinary protocols have been used to help decrease severe maternal morbidity associated with postpartum hemorrhage that involves a focus on unit readiness, recognition and prevention, response, and reporting/systems learning. The nursing and anesthesia teams should be aware of the postpartum hemorrhage and be available to assist. Simulation activities can be utilized in event training in PPH and have been shown to improve outcomes.
