Even though the majority of the pancreatic islet cell cancers are indolent, an aggressive approach is preferred to the “wait-and-see” approach when dealing with them. The aggressive approach includes taking out the primary and metastatic tumors. However, the implementation of the aggressive approach requires a team comprised of multiple specialties to deal with pre and post-surgical management.

The clinical cure for a non-metastatic primary lesion of PNET is surgical removal. If there are metastatic liver lesions of PNET, surgical debulking is an important treatment option to reduce the functional hormone secretion from the lesion as well as to reduce the mass effect of the tumor.

Most patients have residual disease even after surgical and locoregional therapy; they require systemic therapy to deal with residual tumors. Functioning PNETs like VIPoma and glucagonoma are effectively managed with somatostatin analogs at this stage. Octreotide, lanreotide, and pasireotide are somatostatin analogs that are being used for this purpose. The role of somatostatin analogs in the management of nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors is controversial.
