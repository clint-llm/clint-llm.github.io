Congestive heart failure (CHF) can arise from multiple causes, all resulting in decreased perfusion of body tissues. CHF may result from a drug overdose, infection of the myocardium, myocardial infarction, chronic hypertension, and numerous other causes. It may also be acute or chronic. Regardless of either the acute or chronic nature of CHF, it can range from mild symptoms to a serious emergency.
