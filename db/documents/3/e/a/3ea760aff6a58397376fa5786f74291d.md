The adrenal cortex is derived from mesoderm and begins posteromedial to the urogenital ridge. The adrenal medulla is derived from neural crest cells. These neural crest cells originate from the dorsal aorta. Clusters of chromaffin cells become the distinct medulla after birth. The adrenal gland first appears at 28-30 days post-conception. Its development is mediated by steroidogenic factor 1.
