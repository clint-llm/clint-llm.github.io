Carrier screens will come back either negative or positive. A positive result indicates carrier status.

Maternal serum biochemical markers:

- Down syndrome is associated with low MSAFP, low estriol, high hCG, high inhibin A, and low PAPP-A

- Edwards syndrome is associated with low MSAFP, low estriol, low hCG, normal inhibin A, and low PAPP-A

- Patau syndrome is associated with normal MSAFP, normal estriol, normal hCG, normal inhibin A, and low PAPP-A

An increased nuchal translucency is a soft marker for aneuploidy but is not diagnostic. Other anatomical anomalies, such as small or absent nasal bone and cardiac defects, are also indicators of possible aneuploidy.

Cell-free fetal DNA screening results can be reported as either positive or negative, as high risk or low risk. They can also return as no-call. Reports should include the fetal fraction.
