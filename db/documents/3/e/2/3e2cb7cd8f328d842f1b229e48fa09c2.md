The management of second impact syndrome is limited due to the limited understanding of the condition, paucity of research, and the controversial nature of the condition. The management of the condition starts with prompt recognition of a sports-related concussion and protecting the athlete until they recover from the initial injury. The current treatment guidelines consist of relative rest, both cognitive and physical, and then a graded return to play. This should be supervised ideally by the team physician (with experience in managing concussions) and athletic training staff. The athlete should not be cleared to return to full participation until they have completed a return to play protocol, and the medical staff gives clearance.
