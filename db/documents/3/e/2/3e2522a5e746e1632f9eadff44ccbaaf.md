Complications of ankylosing spondylitis include atlantoaxial subluxation and subsequent neurologic impairment, spinal fracture from low impact trauma, advanced hip osteoarthritis with increased rates of total hip arthroplasty, and perioperative complications from a rigid cervical spine or limited chest expansion. Aortic dissection, acute coronary syndromes, and conduction abnormalities may also occur in increased rates compared to the general population. Anterior uveitis is associated with glaucoma, posterior synechiae, band keratopathy, cystoid macular edema, and cataract formation.

Similar to other inflammatory rheumatologic conditions, the risk of ischemic cardiovascular disease increases in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.Â Increased rates of metabolic syndrome have explicitly been seen in psoriatic arthritis. Controlling disease activity may decrease this risk. Attention to modifiable risk factors is critical. Statin initiation has correlated with reduced mortality in ankylosing spondylitis.
