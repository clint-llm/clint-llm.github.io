The cause of symptoms in giardiasis is poorly understood. Trophozoites have a ventral disk that they use to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. Researchers theorize that the protozoa disrupt small intestine epithelial cell junctions as well as brush border enzymes. Affected patients can demonstrate altered gastrointestinal motility. The protozoa release thiol proteinases and lectins that have a cytopathic effect. The combination of these effects increases permeability and decreases the ability to process saccharides.
