The laboratory investigation of a patient with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy includes the assessment of both immunoglobulin levels, B-cell quantitative assessment, antibody testing, immunophenotyping, and T cell function and he and other studies as follows

**Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins**

- IgG

- IgM

- IgA

- IgG1

- IgG2

- IgG3

- IgG4

In THI, IgG is at least two standard deviations below expected controls.

**Antibody Activity**

Detection of isohemagglutinins (IgM)

- Anti-type A blood

- Anti-type B blood

IgG antibodies (post-exposure)

- Rubella

- Measles

- Varicella Zoster

IgG antibodies (post-immunization)

- Tetanus toxoid

- Diphtheria toxoid

- Pneumococcal polysaccharide

- Polio

Most infants with THI produce normal antibodies to vaccines including diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis A and B vaccines, conjugated Haemophilus influenzae type B, measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines. In the U.S., most children receive the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, and they respond well. If a patient fails to respond to an immunization such as tetanus, a thoroughly immunological study should be done to diagnose an early immunodeficiency disorder.

Other assays

- Serum protein electrophoresis

**Blood Lymphocyte T Subpopulations**

- Total lymphocyte count

- T lymphocytes (CD3, CD4, and CD8)

- CD4/CD8 ratio

**B-cell Quantitative Assessment**

- Levels of CD19

- Levels of CD20

- Levels of CD21

- Levels of CD81

- Levels of CD 225

T cell and B cell function reports as normal in most studies.

**Microbiological Studies**

- Cerebrospinal fluid (culture, chemistry, and histopathology)

- Blood culture

- Stool culture

- Sputum examination

**Other Investigations**

- DNA testing

- Complete blood cell count

- Chest x-ray

- Diagnostic ultrasound

- CT scan

Other tests may be necessary as clinically indicated to exclude other causes.
