Cryoglobulin is normally present within healthy individuals at small levels. Academics theorize that these levels indicate the existence of immune complexes that actively work toward clearing this protein by immunoglobulins (Igs) with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity.

The prime risk factor for cryoglobulinemia is drug use, as 90% of cases of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis are associated with Hepatitis C infections. The formation of hepatitis C IgG and IgM rheumatoid factor causes the immune complex formation and complement activation, which leads to inflammation of blood vessels. It is also associated with monoclonal gammopathy (e.g., multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS]), monoclonal gammopathies of renal significance, or connective tissue disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], Sjögren syndrome).
