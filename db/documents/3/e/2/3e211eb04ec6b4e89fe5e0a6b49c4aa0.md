The pathogenesis of tricuspid atresia is not fully understood but is due to the disruption of the normal development of the atrioventricular valves from the endocardial cushion.  In most of these patients, the tricuspid inlet appears as a dimple in the right atrium (muscular form). In rarer forms, there is a fusion of partially delaminated leaflets and the formation of what appears as membranes (Ebstein type).
