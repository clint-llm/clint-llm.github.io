Healthcare workers (nurse practitioners, primary care providers) may see a patient with an incidental finding of a renal oncocytoma or the patient may present with a flank mass and/or hematuria. It is important to refer these patients promptly to a urologist for definitive management.

Renal oncocytomas should be treated with excision, either partial or total nephrectomy.
