Research has uncovered the role of mutation in complement regulatory genes and components in various inflammatory and chronic diseases in the last decade. The advent of next-generation sequencing has helped in these discoveries. But the definitive association of complement cascade is yet to be proved with genetic variants.

The development and approval of eculizumab by the FDA for the treatment of aHUS proves the role of complement cascade involvement in such chronic disorders.

Anti-C5 antibodies have also been found to reduce tissue damage in complement-dependent myocardial infarction and stroke. They are proposed as therapeutic agents in chronic inflammation in, for instance, RA and nephritis.

More research is needed to delineate the complement disease associations further. It will help in the development of more complement-targeted therapeutic agents for diseases like age-related macular disorder.
