A contracted socket is a functional as well as a cosmetically disabling entity. Prevention is always better than cure. Scrupulous tissue handling during the primary procedure, placement of an adequately sized implant, layered closure over the implant, use of customized prosthesis post-operatively, and regular follow-ups may help prevent this debilitating condition. The outcomes are unsatisfactory in severely contracted sockets as the surface is inadequate and is usually accompanied by more than one pathology. An aggressive surgical approach is performed to rehabilitate these sockets, and the results are highly unpredictable.
