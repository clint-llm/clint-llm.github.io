**Indications**

- Moderate to severe pain non-responsive to non-narcotic drugs**(FDA Approved)**

- Detoxification and treatment of opioid use disorder as part of medication-assisted treatment **(FDA Approved)******

- Treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome **(Not FDA Approved, Class C Drug)**

**Indication 1: Moderate to Severe Pain Non-responsive to Non-narcotic Drugs**

Methadone is FDA approved for use in moderate to severe pain that has not responded to non-opioid medications or as an alternative if the pain is unresponsive to other opioid drugs. Methadone is an analgesic used in cancer patients or other terminally ill patients and in chronic pain pathologies. Before starting methadone for noncancer chronic pain, the patient should undergo an evaluation of risk factors that can lead to drug misuse or diversion and establish that benefit of therapy overweighs the harms. The evaluation should include psychosocial reasons for underlying chronic pain like comorbid psychiatric disorders and social support issues.

Methadone is an alternative in treating patients with opioid tolerance as they may not respond to traditional analgesic regimens. In such patients, methadone dosages are adjusted or combined with other opioids as adjuvant treatments to enhance response to analgesic interventions.

Methadone is a commonly prescribed drug to treat severe, cancer-related, or neuropathic pain in pediatric populations.

**Indication 2: Detoxification and Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder as Part of Medication-assisted treatment**

Methadone and buprenorphine are FDA approved to treat opioid use disorder as part of federally regulated opioid treatment programs. Methadone prescriptions are for detoxification and maintenance therapy. Methadone is a useful agent for opioid withdrawal symptoms such as tachycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Abstinence rates from opioid use are better when patients undergo long-term versus short-term methadone treatment. Methadone has been shown to improve retention in treatment and detoxification programs and has shown improvement in mortality rates for opioid abusers.

**Indication 3: Treatment of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome**

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) can be due to a variety of substance abuse during pregnancy, such as alcohol, tobacco, and opioids, all of which can cross the placenta to affect the neonate. Typically treatment is supportive for neonates with milder cases. Pharmacologic intervention is employed when there are moderate to severe signs of withdrawal in neonates (e.g., seizures) and often involves using methadone to treat signs of NAS.

**Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act**

The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act provision updates federal guidelines to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment to address the opioid epidemic. The MAT Act empowers all health care providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD), just as they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act is intended to help destigmatize a standard of care for OUD and will integrate substance use disorder treatment across healthcare settings.

As of December 2022, the MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program. All DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in their practice if permitted by applicable state law, and SAMHSA encourages them to do so. Prescribers who were registered as DATA-Waiver prescribers will receive a new DEA registration certificate reflecting this change; no action is needed on the part of registrants.

There are no longer any limits on the number of patients with OUD that a practitioner may treat with buprenorphine. Separate tracking of patients treated with buprenorphine or prescriptions written is no longer required.

Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescribing authority's DEA number and does not need a DATA 2000 waiver from the prescriber. However, depending on the pharmacy, the dispensing software may still require the X-Waiver information in order to proceed. Practitioners are still required to comply with any applicable state limits regarding the treatment of patients with OUD.  Contact information for State Opioid Treatment Authorities can be found here: https://www.samhsa.gov/medicationassisted-treatment/sota.
