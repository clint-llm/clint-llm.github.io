Obstructive episodes can lead to hypoxemia, hypoventilation, malnutrition, asphyxia, cor pulmonale, or even death. Patients with other anomalies or syndromic PRS have a higher mortality rate. A retrospective review of 181 infants was conducted in one study and found an overall mortality rate of 16.6%, but no deaths in isolated PRS. Mortality was associated with cardiac and central nervous system (CNS) anomalies or anomalies of two or more organ systems.
