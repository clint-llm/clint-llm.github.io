Giardiasis is the most common enteric protozoal infection worldwide, affecting nearly 2% of adults and 8% of children in developed countries. Also, estimates show that almost 33% of the population in developing countries have been infected with giardiasis. The prevalence within the United States is estimated to be roughly 1.2 million, with the majority of cases not identified due to the carrier being asymptomatic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 15,223 cases submitted in 2012. The largest reported affected demographic was children 0 to 4 years of age, with the largest percentage of cases being reported from the northwest United States. Peak incidence occurs in late summer and early fall due to outdoor water activities.

Protozoa are spread through the fecal-oral route, most commonly through the ingestion of contaminated water or food. It can also be spread through person-to-person or, less commonly, animal-to-person. An infected individual can shed nearly 10^8 to 10^10 cysts per day, while the infectious dose can be as low as 10.Â Individuals with a sub-clinical disease can serve as carriers and may infect others. Within the United States, populations at risk include international travelers, wilderness travelers, daycare workers, men who have sex with men, and professions with contact with human waste.
