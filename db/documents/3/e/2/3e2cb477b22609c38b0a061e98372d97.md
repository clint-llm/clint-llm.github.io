Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy: There is a triad of childhood joint contractures, slowly progressive muscle weakness, and initial wasting in humeroperoneal distribution extending to scapular and pelvic girdle muscles. Cardiac involvement can occur after the second decade of life. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy: This is an autosomal recessive or dominant with a defect on genes encoding sarcoglycans

Spinal muscular atrophy: Shows reduced muscle tone, weakness (sparing facial muscles), anterior horn cell involvement manifesting as tongue fasciculations, and absent deep tendon reflexes. Onset is from birth to adolescence

Barth syndrome: This condition is X-linked of theÂ TAZ gene. Cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, prepubertal growth delay occur.
