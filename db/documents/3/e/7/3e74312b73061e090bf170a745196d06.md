In acute cases, symptoms may occur over several hours to several days. A careful external eye exam must be performed. The medial canthus overlying the lacrimal space will appear erythematous, tender, and edematous. It is not uncommon for the bridge of the nose to be involved. It is however uncommon that the superomedial aspect of the orbit is involved. Frequently, the mucopurulent material can be expressed from the superior and inferior puncta. There may also be an increase in tears; in chronic dacryocystitis, tearing may be the only symptom. Mattering can be present due to a tear film. Tear films will typically cause conjunctival injection and a mild decrease in visual acuity. Visual acuity testing is vital. Any acute changes not explained by tear filming should raise concern for extensive involvement. Emergent ophthalmological consultation is warranted in this scenario. Furthermore, erythema involving the whole orbit is not characteristic of dacryocystitis and should lead the examiner to an alternative diagnosis. Any pain with extraocular movement should also raise suspicion for alternative diagnoses.
