Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults accounting for 45.2% of malignant primary brain and CNS tumors. GBM remains an incurable disease with a median survival of 15 months.

Primary GBMs account for 80% of GBMs and occur in older patients with a mean age of 62 yrs while secondary GBMs occur from lower-grade astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma in younger patients with a mean age of 45 years. Secondary GBMs are usually located in the frontal lobe, have a lesser degree of necrosis, and carry a better prognosis than primary GBMs.

The World Health Organization defines GBM as a grade IV cancer characterized as malignant, mitotically active, and predisposed to necrosis. GBM has a very poor prognosis.
