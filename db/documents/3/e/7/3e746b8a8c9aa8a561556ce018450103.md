Branchial cleft cysts are embryologic anomalies and are defined by the internal opening of the branchial sinuses arising from incomplete obliteration in embryogenesis. They may present as fistulae, cysts, sinus tracts, or cartilaginous remnants and clinically encountered on the anterior neck and upper chest. Lesions presenting below the clavicles are more likely epidermoid or dermoid cysts rather than branchial remnants. Branchio-oto-renal (BOR) and branchio-oculofacial (BOF) syndromes should be suspected when a patient presents with preauricular pits or multiple branchial cleft anomalies, including bilateral anomalies. These syndromes are autosomal dominant conditions associated with hearing loss, ear malformations, and renal anomalies in the BOR syndrome. At the same time, BOF includes eye anomalies, such as microphthalmia and obstructed lacrimal ducts, and facial anomalies, such as cleft lip and palate.
