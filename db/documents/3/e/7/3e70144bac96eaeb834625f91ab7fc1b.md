The toxicity of Ringer’s lactate is more associated with volume overload due to IV fluid administration rather than the contents of Ringer’s lactate itself. As previously stated, excessive IV fluid administration can cause fluid overload. Patients may present anywhere on the spectrum from mild peripheral edema to respiratory distress secondary pulmonary edema. Symptomatic patients should be given diuretic therapy and have serum electrolytes monitored closely. In the most severe cases of respiratory distress, patients may require noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or even intubation. Asymptomatic fluid overload can be managed conservatively with fluid restriction and continued monitoring.
