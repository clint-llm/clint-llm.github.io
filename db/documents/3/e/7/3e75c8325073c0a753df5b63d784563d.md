TAVR can be performed in either a hybrid operating room or catheterization laboratory. Fluoroscopy, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), perfusion standby, and appropriate procedure-specific instrumentation (wires, catheters, introducers, surgical instruments) as per institution protocol are required.Â  BAV is generally performed in the catheterization laboratory with fluoroscopy and/or TEE.
