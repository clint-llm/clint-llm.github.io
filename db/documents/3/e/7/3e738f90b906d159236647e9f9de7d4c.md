Congenital cases of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), although rare, usually present at birth with cyanosis, murmur, and congestive heart failure.

The majority of cases often develop by the fourth and sixth decades of life. However, patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) typically develop symptoms by the second decade of life.

The most common complaint in patients with underlying HHT is epistaxis, caused by bleeding from mucosal telangiectasias.

Dyspnea is the second most common symptom, with an incidence of 13%Â to 56%. It is most common among patients that have clubbing or whose PAVMs are large or multiple.

Other features include hypoxemia, exercise intolerance, chest pain, cough, murmurs, bruits, clubbing, and cyanosis.
