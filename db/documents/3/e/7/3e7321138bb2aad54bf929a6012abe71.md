Trauma is sustained in 8% of all pregnancies. Regardless of mechanism, trauma can be life threatening for both the mother and fetus. Rapid evaluation and treatment of the mother in trauma should be even further heightened, as maternal shock is associated with an 80% fetal mortality. Pelvic fracture is the most common maternal injury that results in fetal death. In review of pregnant females with sustained pelvic fracture by Leggon et al, rate of fetal mortality was 35%. Casuses of death included direct fetal injury (20%), placental abruption (32%), and maternal shock (36%). Dilated vasculature due in part to maternal physiologic changes, places mothers at increased risk for hemorrhage following pelvic fractures. With mortality in these mothers being as high as 9%. The most devastating injuries following direct blunt trauma include placental abruption and uterine rupture. Abruption is thought to complicate 1-6% of minor injuries and up to 50% of major injuries. Uterine rupture is overall rare, occurring in less than 1% of pregnant trauma patients, and is most commonly associated with direct impact with sustained force to a previously scarred uterus. In contrast to blunt trauma, maternal mortality is more favorable following penetrating injury as the gravid uterus serves as protection to the maternal internal organs. Conversely, fetal mortality following penetrating injury has been reported to be as high as 73%.
