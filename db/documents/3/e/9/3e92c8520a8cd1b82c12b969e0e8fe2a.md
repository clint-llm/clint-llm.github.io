Every prenatal visit should be an opportunity to evaluate for drug use. Marijuana users are likely to use other drugs of abuse and are likely to have a history of psychiatric disorders like anxiety and depression. For every pregnant woman identified as using marijuana, history should be focused on substance use and mental health disorders along with social and environmental stressors.

Clinical findings depend on the phase of drug use. A patient can have euphoria, anxiety, dry mouth, and tachycardia during the acute intoxication phase, while depression, decreased appetite, restlessness, and irritability are likely during the withdrawal phase. Signs of drug dependency and sleep disturbances may also be seen.

In neonates, marijuana exposure is not linked to any dysmorphic features. Neonates with in utero exposure to marijuana are likely to have low birth weight. Smaller head circumference may be seen, especially if there is co-exposure with tobacco. Marijuana exposure does not cause any withdrawal signs in neonates. But, since these infants are at extremely high risk of multiple drug exposures, the clinical examination findings can be consistent with withdrawal from other drugs such as nicotine or opioids. Prenatal marijuana use will display altered responses to visual stimuli, a high-pitched cry, andÂ increased trembling.
