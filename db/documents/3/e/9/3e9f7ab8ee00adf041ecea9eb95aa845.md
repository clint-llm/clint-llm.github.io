In the acute stages of exudative retinal detachment, loss of photoreceptor outer segments is seen. In chronic disease, RPE proliferation, cysts, excessive leakage into the subretinal space, and retinoschisis are seen.

Circumscribed choroidal hemangiomas are benign hamartomas that typically present in the second to fourth decade of life. They usually occur sporadically in the absence of systemic disease. Histopathology reveals that the tumor is composed of vascular channels lined with endothelium.

Choroidal haemangioma shows well-demarcated "pushing" peripheral margins. It is separated from the normal choroid by a layer of choroidal lamellae and compressed melanocytes. While in some cases, the hemangiomas merge with the choroidal vasculature.

Choroidal osteoma shows dense, bony trabeculae with marrow spaces. These spaces are traversed by pathognomonic dilated thin-walled spider or feeder blood vessels. These vessels connect the choriocapillaris to the larger choroidal vessels.

On histopathology, multiple myeloma exhibits round plasma cells with an eccentric nucleus and prominent nucleolus. Organized chromatin is present with a clear area next to the nucleus known as Hoffa clear zone. It represents the Golgi apparatus involved in immunoglobulin production.
