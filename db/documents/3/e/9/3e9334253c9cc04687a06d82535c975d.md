As it an incapacitating disease, both patient and caretakers should be educated about the disease's genetic nature, its complications, prognosis, and the necessity of early intervention. They should be informed that a team of care providers will be working with them to achieve the best possible outcomes. Genetic testing should also be offered to all parents of children suffering from Krabbe disease to understand the risk of future pregnancies being affected and have options to avoid it.
