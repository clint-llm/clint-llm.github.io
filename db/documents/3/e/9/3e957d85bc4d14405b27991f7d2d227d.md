Visual acuity is the clarity or sharpness of vision. Assessment of visual acuity is a crucial aspect of the ophthalmic examination and can have a significant clinical impact. Vision loss may be due to ocular disease, systemic disease, or diseases of other organ systems, including the central nervous system. Evaluation of visual acuity may be done in the prehospital, outpatient, or inpatient settings and should be included in the assessment of every patient with an eye-related complaint. Both distance and near visual acuity should be assessed; some circumstances may warrant an evaluation of visual acuity for intermediate distances.
This activity reviews the importance of visual acuity testing as part of a routine physical examination, problem-based assessments, testing methods available, materials needed for visual acuity testing, and the clinical significance of visual acuity evaluation.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate the 4 types of visual acuity.
- Choose the appropriate visual acuity testing modality and describe its technique.
- Efficiently and effectively interpret and document the results of visual acuity testing.
- Apply effective interprofessional team processes to improve patient outcomes by utilizing visual acuity testing in the prehospital, outpatient, and inpatient clinical settings.
