Mitral stenosis is one of the common valvular diseases encountered in cardiology clinics, and rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of mitral stenosis, especially in low-middle-income countries. Mitral stenosis, if left untreated results in significant morbidity and mortality and there is no definite medical therapy for severe mitral stenosis. Percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PMBC) is recommended as the first choice of treatment for mitral stenosis if the valve is pliable and there is no evidence of left atrial appendage thrombus. While the surgical valve repair / replacement is limited to patients not deemed candidates for percutaneous intervention. This activity reviews the role of percutaneous intervention in the management of MS. It will also discuss the indications, contraindications, and the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with mitral valve disease.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications and contraindications of the catheter management of mitral stenosis.
- Explain the importance of perioperative echocardiography for successful catheter management of mitral stenosis.
- Describe the different steps of the catheter management of mitral stenosis.
- .Summarise the most common complications associated with the catheter management of mitral stenosis.
