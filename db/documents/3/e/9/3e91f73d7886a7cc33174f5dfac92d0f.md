The etiology of SSADH deficiency is the absence of SSADHÂ due to mutations in the gene ALDH5A1.

Studies analyzing the structural and functional consequences of some of these variants have shown a profound effect on SSADH enzyme activity. The mRNA expression has been identified in the brain, liver, and biliary system, as well as the reproductive system (Leydig cells, testicular interstitium), upper gastrointestinal tract (duodenum), and endocrine system (thyroid gland and parathyroid glands). The brain sites of SSADH expression include the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and lateral ventricles.
