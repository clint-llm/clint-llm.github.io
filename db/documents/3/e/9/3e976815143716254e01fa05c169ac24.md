The possible complications of mechanical backÂ strains depend on the specific etiology, with the most common complication being the persistence of symptoms and the development of lasting disability. Rarer physical complications include cauda equina syndrome and physical deformities. Other health complications may arise as side effects from long-term pharmacologic therapies, such as NSAID use, or more invasive therapeutic procedures, such as injections and surgeries. Many financial and social complications also exist for both the patients with chronic, disabling mechanical back pain and their employers due to lost wages and missed workdays.
