Prenatal care recommendations are well established. Routine prenatal care is performed by family physicians, midwives, and obstetricians. Each clinician provides unique care requested or preferred by the patient and her partner (e.g., doulas, group visits, limited intervention in labor, etc.) It is necessary to have a team approach for evaluating women with high-risk preconception conditions during the preconception period or at the intake in every center. Nursing, educators, and clinicians should be aware of referral services both in the community and at the clinical site. The center or health system should have standardized guidelines and protocols on the core requirements for education, treatment, and management in prenatal care and pregnancy. Family medicine and midwives should have clear lines of communication with high-risk providers for high-risk patients during pregnancy. A collaborative approach improves doctor communication and increases the chance of identifying risks in pregnancy.
