Healthcare professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who prescribe amphotericin B, should be very familiar with its administration and side effects. Close to 80% of the patients will develop either infusion-related or renal toxicity. Consider pretreatment with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or hydrocortisone before the infusion to attenuate side effects. Meperidine treatment may decrease the duration of rigors. Following infusion, the renal function requires monitoring.

Given its interaction and adverse event profile, it is not surprising that amphotericin B use is cautiously used. However, physicians may need to employ it for recalcitrant infections, and consultation with the pharmacist is necessary to ensure there will be no drug-drug interactions, or that a different agent might achieve the desired therapeutic result. Nurses also need to understand the side effect profile of this drug, as well as the potential for infusion reactions; in the event of any concerns, the nursing staff should immediately alert the treating physician. This drug may have been around for many years. Still, its use requires a robust, collaborative interprofessional healthcare team effort to be able to achieve desired patient outcomes with minimal adverse effects. [Level V]
