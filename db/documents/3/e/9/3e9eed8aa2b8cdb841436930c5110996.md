Based on results analyzed in placebo-controlled trials, the most common adverse effects associated with the combination of conjugated estrogens and bazedoxifene include:

- Muscle spasms

- Nausea

- Diarrhea

- Dyspepsia

- Abdominal pain

- Oropharyngeal pain

- Neck pain

- Dizziness

While there were other side effects and complications associated with bazedoxifene/conjugated estrogens, the probability of exhibiting those symptomatic adverse effects was not significantly different from what was seen in the placebo group.
