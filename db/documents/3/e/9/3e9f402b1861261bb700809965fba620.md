Most cases are subclinical or mildly symptomatic with an excellent prognosis. About 15% of symptomatic patients will develop severe disease. Most will recover, but after a bout of yellow fever, full recovery may take weeks or months. In most cases, there is a reversal of the liver and renal dysfunction. Death occurs in 30% to 50% of patients with severe disease. All travelers to endemic areas should be vaccinated if they are candidates for the live attenuated vaccine.

Death often occurs within 2 weeks during the toxic phase of the infection. Unvaccinated travelers to endemic areas are at high risk for developing symptomatic disease compared to the natives, who have acquired immunity. Rare cases of neurologic and viscerotropic disease have been reported following vaccination.
