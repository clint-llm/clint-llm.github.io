Interferon therapy has been shown to have therapeutic value for various diseases, including autoimmune diseases, viral diseases, and various forms of cancer. Interferons have also demonstrated significant immunomodulatory effects, making them beneficial for treating immune-related conditions such as multiple sclerosis and chronic granulomatous disease. However, given the potential for hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, myelosuppression, autoimmune reactions, and other adverse outcomes, it is imperative for health care professionals to routinely monitor their patients through blood work while administering this medication. It is also essential that all interprofessional healthcare team members collaborate to determine the correct dosage and form of interferon therapy, as well as any adjuvant therapies, given there is significant variability in adverse effects. Lastly, medication adherence can be an issue with interferon treatment.
