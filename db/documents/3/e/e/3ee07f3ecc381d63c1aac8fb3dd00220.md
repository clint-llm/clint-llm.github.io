Contention exists around the exact mechanism for commotio cordis.  However, experimental studies have shown that there are several factors involved. First, contact occurs directly over the heart in the anterior chest.

The impact energy must be sufficient to cause ventricular depolarization, estimated to be about 50 joules. This is easily achieved by a thrown baseball, for example, and the risk for commotio cordis appears to peak around 40 miles per hour. At higher speeds (with more energy), there is more likely to be resultant structural damage to the heart and/or chest wall rather than isolated ventricular fibrillation.

The mechanical force resulting from the precordial impact causes a stretch in myocardial cell membranes, which likely activates ion channels (mechanical-electrical coupling).
