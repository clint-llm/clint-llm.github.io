Central pain presents in many chronic pain disorders, including fibromyalgia, interstitial cystitis, temporomandibular disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, the differential diagnosis for central pain syndrome includes rheumatologic conditions such as polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), myopathy or myositis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or lupus.

Furthermore, centralized pain often accompanies chronic back and neck pain. It also correlates with trauma, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, osteoarthritis, and joint hypermobility syndrome. Centralized pain following a stroke or sequella of a neurological disorder such as multiple sclerosis is also part of the differential.
