When considering a minimally invasive surgical mitral repair versus transcatheter mitral valve repair approach, many factors come into play. When compared to a traditional surgical technique, the minimally invasive mini-thoracotomy and robotic surgery show benefit due to less postoperative pain, shorter recovery time, and better cosmetic result.

Many patients are not surgical candidates and would not qualify for a variety of reasons. Although minimally invasive mitral valve surgery via mini-thoracotomy can be conducted in conjunction with atrial fibrillation ablation or right-sided heart procedures, concomitant procedures like coronary artery bypass and aortic valve surgery require a traditional median sternotomy approach. Other contraindications for minimally invasive MV surgery include previous right thoracotomy, significant aortic root dilatation, moderate to severe aortic regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, fixed pulmonary hypertension (>60 mmHg), severe generalized peripheral artery disease, calcification of the aortic root or mitral annulus, symptomatic cerebrovascular disease or recent stroke, significant bleeding disorders, and severe liver dysfunction.

Relative contraindications for roboticÂ mitral valve repair include mild aortic stenosis or regurgitation, limited peripheral artery disease, variable pulmonary hypertension (>50 mmHg), chest deformity (pectus/scoliosis), coronary artery disease, and moderate pulmonary dysfunction.

As mitral valve disease is more prevalent in the elderly population, many patients are not surgical candidates and can be referred for mitral valve repair with the percutaneous edge-to-edge repair. Edge to edge repair has provided a transcutaneous mitral valve repair option for mitral regurgitation. Currently, this procedure is contraindicated in patients who cannot tolerate procedural anticoagulation or post-procedural antiplatelet medication, active endocarditis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, and intracardiac or venous thrombus.
