Prior to performing endometrial ablation, it is important to evaluate the etiology of abnormal uterine bleeding to determine the correct management. There are many different causes of AUB, which can be classified by the acronym PALM-COEIN, a universally accepted nomenclature that was developed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). There are structural causes of abnormal bleeding, including **p**olyp,**a**denomyosis,**l**eiomyoma, or**m**alignancy. The non-structural causes of abnormal bleeding include**c**oagulopathy,**o**vulatory dysfunction,**e**ndometrial,**i**atrogenic, and**n**ot yet classified.

A transvaginal ultrasound, saline infusion sonogram, or hysteroscopy are used to determine structural abnormalities and provide information on the size and position of the uterus. Non-structural causes of AUB can be due to endocrinopathies, underlying bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease, or iatrogenic causes, including various contraceptive methods or medications such as anticoagulants.

The endometrial lining of the uterine cavity is composed of a functional and basal layer. The functional layer performs the physiologic functions of proliferation, maintenance of pregnancy, and menstruation, while the basal layer is implicated in regrowth of the functional layer.
