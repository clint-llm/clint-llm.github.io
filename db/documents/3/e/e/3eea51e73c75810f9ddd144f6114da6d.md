In 2002, Wuerth et al. reported the incidence of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage to be approximately 81 cases per 100,000; this number decreased to 67 cases per 100,000 by 2012. The greatest decline was found to be in the gastritis and peptic ulcer disease population. Their decrease was 55% and 30% respectively and likely attributed to the institution and early use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or histamine blockers.
