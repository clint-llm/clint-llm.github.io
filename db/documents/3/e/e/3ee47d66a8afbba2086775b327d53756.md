A thorough history and physical is for the patient preoperatively to assess individual patient factors that may impact the severity of their postoperative pain and the selection of treatment modalities utilized in their pain management plan. Factors to consider when developing a postoperative pain management strategy include the type of procedure anticipated, patient age, history of chronic opioid use, and other comorbidities.

**Comorbid conditions to consider:**

Obesity presents a challenge in opioid administration as this population is at increased susceptibility to respiratory depression or sleep apnea. Regional anesthetic techniques and the avoidance of sedative analgesics are a preferred analgesic approaches among this population.

Chronic pain patients who rely on opioid treatment for relief will require amounts of opioids that exceed their baseline dose. Emphasis on multimodal therapy involving interventional anesthetic techniques and nonopioid analgesics is of particular importance among this population.

In lieu of the recent opioid epidemic, evaluating patients for risk factors that may predispose a patient to opioid misuse is also an important component of the preoperative exam. Evidence suggests that patients who are female, adolescent, or older than 50 years are at increased risk of persistent opioid use. A pre-existing history of depression or illicit drug, alcohol, antidepressant, or benzodiazepine use are also at increased risk of persistent opioid use.
