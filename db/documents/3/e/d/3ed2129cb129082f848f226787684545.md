Recovery after lip implantation is relatively quick and easy. Adequate pain medication is appropriate, as patients often report mild peri-oral pain for 1 to 2 days postoperatively. To minimize edema and ecchymosis, the patient should place ice packs around the mouth/lips intermittently for the first 24 to 72 hours, sleep with the head elevated for one week,  and avoid vigorous activity for two weeks. A low dose of corticosteroid taper may help lessen bruising and swelling as well. Patients should be instructed to avoid aggressive manipulation of the perioral region for 7 to 14 days to mitigate migration/extrusion of the implant and to decrease inflammation. Patients are asked to return at 1 and 2 weeks for wound assessment and residual suture removal, respectively.  Some authors advocate that "oral exercises" (e.g., wide mouth opening, smiling, puckering lips) be performed daily from 3 weeks to 3 months post-operatively, helping with overall healing and to create a more natural look and feel to the implant. The majority of bruising and swelling should resolve by two weeks, though photographic documentation should potentially wait until around three months postoperatively for cases of residual bruising and swelling.
