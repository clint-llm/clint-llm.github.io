Hemoglobin C trait (HbAC) is clinically silent. Hemoglobin C disease (HbCC) is also a mild disorder, and most people do not have any symptoms. But some patients may experience mild hemolytic anemia and hence may complain of symptoms like fatigue, lightheadedness, weakness, and paleness of the skin. On physical examination, there can be mild to moderate splenomegaly, and occasionally jaundice may occur. A retrospective study which was done in 111 cases of hemoglobin C disease also found out that the most important reason for prescription of hemoglobin analysis in these patients was splenomegaly and anemic syndrome.

Individuals with combined sickle cell hemoglobin C disease (HbSC) present with symptoms that are generally similar to but less severe than hemoglobin SS disease. Since hemoglobin C does not polymerize like hemoglobin S, there is very little sickling in this combination. Thus, an acute vaso-occlusive crisis does occur but less frequently. A cross-sectional study that was done to compare the sickle cell anemia and hemoglobin SC disease from 2013 to 2014 in 200 patients with sickle cell disease patients (141 with SCA and 59 with HbSC) showed HbSC genotype was associated more with blood viscosity while HbSS was associated more with sickling and endothelial dysfunction. Also, the clinical events were more frequent in HbSS patients.
