The pathophysiology of linitis plastica is still unclear, multiple linkages to various genetic mutations have been hypothesized, but as gastric cancer has risk factors like ethnicity, hereditary, diet factors, etc., these are all incriminated as having a possible role in the induction of cancer.

Secondary LP occurs with various types of cancer as a metastasis from primary cancer, for example, breast cancer, and gastric cancer. Still, in some cases, there are rare reports of the primary lesion arising from the colon or ovarian cancer. Also, metastasis for breast carcinoma recurrence could present as LP. The secondary sites of cancer might be in the colon or other gastrointestinal organs but histologically identifiable. The characteristics of submucosal infiltration along with attenuated rigid lumen, occur more commonly in the rectum and sigmoid colon.

E-cadherin protein was implicated 20 years ago as the cause of the diffuse type of gastric cancer and lobular type of breast cancer. E-cadherin causes tumor suppression, and a mutation in its germine gene CDH1 will limit that effect. Risk of acquiring cancer increases with heterozygous CDH1.

Other associated genes include Human epidermal growth factor-2 HER2 gene upregulation or increased expression of its protein.
