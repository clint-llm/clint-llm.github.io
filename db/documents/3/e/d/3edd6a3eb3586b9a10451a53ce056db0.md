Proper diagnosis of the tumor has significant implications in the patient's clinical course and outcome.

Many patients develop hypopituitarism secondary to chemotherapy and radiotherapy; therefore, the endocrinologist has an essential role in documenting and correcting these deficiencies. Collaboration shared decision making and communication are crucial elements for the outcome in these patients. The interprofessional care provided must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach. Prompt recognition of signs and symptoms of the disease can aid in the prognosis and outcome.
