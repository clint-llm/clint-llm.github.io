The diagnosis and treatment of a child with learning disabilities depend on the coordinated and ongoing collaboration of an interprofessional team that can be composed of educators, educational remediation specialists, psychologists, special services, and physicians. Speech therapists can help evaluate and treat any underlying oral language difficulties that are often associated with dyslexia. Occupational and physical therapists will treat fine motor, gross motor, proprioceptive, balance, and sensory-processing disorders that can coexist in some children with learning disabilities. Clinical psychologists can help children better cope with the social challenges associated with learning disabilities. Educational therapists or educators trained in learning disabilities are also part of the multidisciplinary team treating children with LDs.

As with other neurodevelopmental conditions, it is important to monitor developmental progression, inquiring about the child’s academic performance and school behavior. For those with associated behavioral problems, appropriate treatment should be considered as well. Furthermore, several remedial programs work with children who have reading and writing difficulties.[16]

Specific educational strategies in management:

- In children with dyslexia (decoding problems), phonological awareness needs to be increased, which includes the ability to manipulate and hear individual phonemes (the sound structure of words), such as 'k' in kite, or 'b' in bat. Besides phonemic awareness, letter-sound proficiency is remediated. The repeated practice of oral reading may aid in improving fluency.

- Children with dysgraphia can benefit from hand-eye exercises that improve coordination.

- Educational strategies addressing dyscalculia include practicing number syntax
