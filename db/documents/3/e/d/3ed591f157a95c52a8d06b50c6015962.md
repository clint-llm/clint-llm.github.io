Leptomeningeal cysts are scalp swelling occurring primarily in infants and children under three years of age associated with a skull fracture. Post-traumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cysts are a variant in which the fracture involves the inner table with the dural tear. This leads to CSF accumulation in a sac lined by the arachnoid membrane and located within the diploic space. It is not synonymous with an arachnoid cyst. Since most cases occur in infants, it is postulated that the formation of the mass requires the presence of a rapidly growing brain. This condition must be recognized and treated promptly to avoid progressive and potentially permanent neurological complications. This activity discusses the etiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of leptomeningeal cysts and emphasizes the interprofessional team's role in optimizing leptomeningeal cysts outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the clinical presentation of a leptomeningeal cyst.
- Review the pathophysiology of a leptomeningeal cyst.
- Outline the assessment and management of leptomeningeal cyst.
- Outline the multidisciplinary approach to enhance the outcomes of the leptomeningeal cyst.
