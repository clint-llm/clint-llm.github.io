Interprofessional management is required in patients with NF2 including oncologists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, ophthalmologists, geneticists, nurse practitioners, and neurosurgeons. For tumor surveillance, annual brain MRI is recommended. If there is no brain tumor seen on the initial imaging, then MRI can be done every 2 years. If the tumor is seen, then MRI should be done twice in the first year withÂ an annual follow-up after that.
