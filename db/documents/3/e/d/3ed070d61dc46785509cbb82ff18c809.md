Stroke is the result of ischemia in an area of the brain. The Na+/K+ ATPase pumps fail mainly because of the poor production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and failure of the aerobic mechanism. Ischemia leads to depolarization of cells which results in calcium influx into cells, elevated lactic acid, acidosis, and free radicals. Cell death increases glutamate and leads to a cascade of chemicals (excitotoxicity).
