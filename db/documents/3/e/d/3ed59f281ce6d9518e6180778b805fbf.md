Initial management of neurogenic shock is focused on hemodynamic stabilization. Hypotension should be treated first to prevent secondary injury. The first-line treatment for hypotension is intravenous fluid resuscitation. This is to allow appropriate compensation for the vasogenic dilation that occurs. If hypotension persists despite euvolemia, vasopressors and inotropes are the second lines. No single agent is recommended. Phenylephrine is commonly used as it is a pure alpha-1 agonist that causes peripheral vasoconstriction to counteract the loss of sympathetic tone. However, the lack of beta-activity leads to reflex bradycardia, which augments the already unopposed vagal tone. Norepinephrine has both alpha and beta activity, aiding both hypotension and bradycardia, thus the preferred agent. Epinephrine has been cited for refractory cases of hypotension and is rarely needed. Recommend keeping the mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85Â to 90 mmHg for the first 7 days to improve spinal cord perfusion. Caution should be used when using vasopressors as there may be co-existing injuries exacerbated with vasoconstriction.

Treatment for bradycardia is atropine and glycopyrrolate to oppose vagal tone, especially before suctioning. Isoproterenol is considered for a pure chronotropic effect. Methylxanthines such as theophylline and aminophylline have been cited for refractory cases of bradycardia.

Initial c-spine immobilization is important to prevent further spinal cord injury. Miami J or Philadelphia collar should be used. Methylprednisolone and corticosteroids showed promise in animal models. However, this has not been displayed in clinical trials, and steroids raise the risk for complications such as infection and are not recommended by multiple societies. Ultimately, surgical intervention may be required for decompression of spinal injury and improvement of neurogenic shock. Symptoms of neurogenic shock have been reported to persist for as long as 4 to 5 weeks.
