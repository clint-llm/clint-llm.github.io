The proximal portion of the aortic arch derives from a structure known as the aortic sac, which is chronologically the first portion of the aorta to form and appears as a dilation superior to the truncus arteriosus.  This sac then gives rise to two horns

- The Left Horn – Combines with the stem of the aortic sac to form the proximal aortic arch.

- The Right Horn – Gives rise to the innominate artery.

The right horn of the aortic sac (now the innominate artery) fuses with the right-sided third and fourth aortic arches, which give rise to the right common carotid artery and the proximal right subclavian artery respectively.
