Fenofibrate is FDA approved to treat patients with hypertriglyceridemia, primary hypercholesterolemia, or mixed dyslipidemia. It reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in adults. Fenofibrate should be used in conjunction with a restriction of cholesterol and fat intake and exercise if the response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate. Secondary causes of hyperlipidemia should be ruled out before initiating therapy. The therapy should be administered for at least 2 to 3 months before assessing for efficacy. This activity covers the indications, dosing, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fenofibrate so the interprofessional team can optimize its use in therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of fenofibrate.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of fenofibrate.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of fenofibrate.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance fenofibrate and improve outcomes.
