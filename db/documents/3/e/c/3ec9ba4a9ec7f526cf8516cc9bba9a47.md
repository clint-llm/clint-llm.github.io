The prevalence of alkaptonuria and endogenous ochronosis in most ethnic groups is less than 1 in 100,000. Only 22 cases have been definitively diagnosed in the United States for the past five decades. It is a rare disease, in specific populations, it can be orders of magnitude more common (e.g., the Dominican Republic and Slovakia with a known prevalence of 1 in 20,000).

The prevalence of exogenous (acquired) ochronosis appears to be significantly more widespread in sub-Saharan Africa, where culprit phenols such as antimalarials and depigmentation agents are utilized in higher frequencies, concentration, and duration.
