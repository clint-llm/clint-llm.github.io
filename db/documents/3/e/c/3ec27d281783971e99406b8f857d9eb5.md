The diagnosis is made clinically. The timing, dose, and site of the lidocaine injection are the main factors in considering systemic manifestations. It is important to keep in mind that even low doses injected inadvertently into an artery going to the brain can cause CNS symptoms.

For direct local manifestations, such as pain seen in TNS, the concentration and the site of injection will help to make the diagnosis. While imaging the spine with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will not help in making the diagnosis of TNS. However, it will help to rule out other causes that may compress the structures within the spinal canal, which could also cause severe pain after neuraxial blockade and would require urgent surgical decompression. A lidocaine plasma level can be obtained but it will take too long for the results to be meaningful for any treatment decisions.
