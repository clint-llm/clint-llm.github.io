The treatment of thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysms is dictated by several factors including the grade of ALI, patient comorbidities, and the patient’s ability to tolerate surgical intervention.

In grade IIb or III acute limb ischemia patients need urgent revascularization for an attempt at limb salvage.  Several studies have demonstrated that the use of thrombolytics can improve outcomes in patients with poor arterial outflow on intra-operative arteriogram. The use of thrombolytics in severe ALI depends on clinical judgment and patient factors.  The clinician must consider the risks associated with thrombolytics and the patient’s ability to tolerate a delay in revascularization.  Most current data suggests that when inadequate outflow shows on an intraoperative arteriogram, thrombolytics with or without mechanical thrombectomy should be attempted to establish an outflow target vessel for bypass.  Patients who present with non-viable limbs should be placed on therapeutic anticoagulation, and the limb should be allowed to demarcate to determine the level of amputation required.

The use of saphenous vein graft is preferred when available and is associated with increased patency rates and improved outcomes. Additionally, the use of four-compartment fasciotomies should be a consideration in any patient with significant ischemic time (greater than 4 to 6 hours), or in those with signs/symptoms of compartment syndrome.
