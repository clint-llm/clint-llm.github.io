Collecting the stratum corneum layer for additional staining and analysis can be achieved in different ways, determined by the desired functionality of the collected sample. Simple scrapings and smears allow for the collection of the stratum corneum corneocytes but do not preserve tissue architecture. The tape stripping technique can be used to collect the stratum disjunctum layer specifically. In this technique, an adhesive tape strip is applied to the skin with even pressure. The strip is removed, and the stratum disjunctum pulls away with it, captured on the adhesive surface. Finally, the stratum corneum can be visualized in hematoxylin and eosin staining of skin biopsies and excisional samples.
