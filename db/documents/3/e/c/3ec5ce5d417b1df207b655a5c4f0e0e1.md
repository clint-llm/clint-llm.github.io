Common contraindications to Z-plasty transposition include a lack of available healthy tissue to transfer as well as keloid and hypertrophic scarring tendencies. Additionally, surgeons should use caution when considering this technique in patients with conditions that may adversely affect wound healing: vasculopathy, uncontrolled diabetes, prior radiation exposure, active infection, the persistent inflammatory state in burn patients, and patient noncompliance or anticipated noncompliance with perioperative care regimens.
