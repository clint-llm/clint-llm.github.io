In the fourth week of gestation, the fetal skin starts developing from the ectoderm forming a basal cuboidal layer, which later matures into the dermis. Sequentially, in the fifth week, a layer of squamous/cuboidal, non-keratinized cells layer is developed on the top of the basal layer forming the periderm or epitrichium that works as an adherent mechanical isolator for the underlaying epidermal strata of the skin to develop (stratification).

As the epidermal strata are forming and this peridermal layer is going through cyclic keratinization and desquamation, until the third trimester in which this peridermal layer will be replaced by the stratum corneum (cornification). Simultaneously, sebaceous glands will be forming from buds at the epidermal root sheath of hair follicles, working at the production of sebum. The anatomical and physiological combination of the stratum corneum (corneocytes) and sebaceous glands (sebum) forms the fetal vernix caseosa reaching maximal production and formation in the third trimester.
