Healthcare practitioners who evaluate commercial or military divers or are directly involved in commercial or military diving operations must know the decompression procedures used. Surface decompression is a complex procedure that requires a well-trained and experienced dive crew. In addition, practitioners must be aware of potential complications during this procedure, be prepared to consult with dive teams, and treat divers who suffer injury due to those complications.
