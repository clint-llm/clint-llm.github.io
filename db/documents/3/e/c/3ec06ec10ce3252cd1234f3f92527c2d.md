Phenotypic diagnosis requires bacterial culture and identification. Disk diffusion or automated susceptibility testing is done to identify the carbapenem resistance phenotype. By referencing MIC breakpoints, the final diagnosis of carbapenem resistance is possible. The drawbacks of this process include delayed diagnosis and limited information on specific resistance mechanisms.

Molecular identification is much faster (hours instead of days) and can quickly determine the type of resistance mechanism involved. However, this method simply indicates the presence of a resistance gene and may not determine the efficacy of specific antibiotics. Early detection of CRE infections helps improve treatments and decrease the likelihood of spreading the infection. The most common modality of detection is multiplex PCR and microarray technologies. The development of new molecular assays continues.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) is the newest technology applied to the identification of CRE. This technique uses laser ionization of bacterial proteins to create a proteomic profile. Beta-lactamase and metallo-beta-lactamase specific information are then extrapolated from the profile to determine CRE status.
