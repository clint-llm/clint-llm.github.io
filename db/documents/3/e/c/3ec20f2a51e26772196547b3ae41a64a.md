Drug-drug interactions (DDI) are a significant cause of adverse drug events (ADE) in palliative care. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions). It reviews the importance of the interprofessional team in identifying this issue.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs in palliative care. 
- Identify serotonin syndrome using the Hunter criteria.
- Explain the importance of monitoring for drug-drug interactions in palliative care. 
- Summarize the importance of improving drug-drug interactions education in palliative care.
