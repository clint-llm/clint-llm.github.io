Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are relatively common diseases in the adolescent population. All states allow the treatment of adolescents with STIs without parental consent, but there are holes in that policy. These patients may not seek treatment due to fear of their parents finding out. Some states allow providers to notify parents after treatment, billing statements may disclose STI testing and medications provided, and access to the online medical record by parents/guardians all offer opportunities for adolescent privacy to be compromised.

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection that causes almost all cervical cancer cases and genital warts. This disease has a significantly effective vaccination that is administered in a 2 or 3 dose series. A patient who receives their first dose before they turn 15 can only get two doses. Studies have shown that the two doses of the HPV vaccine given between the ages of 9 to 14, at least six months apart, provides equal or superior protection. Patients are still able to receive the 3-dose vaccine from ages 15-26. Despite the effective prevention of HPV, a study in Rhode Island found that 27% of female adolescents have not fully received the vaccination.

Abortions are a controversial topic for many people, especially adolescent abortions. Most states require patients under 18 years old to involve a parent or guardian before the procedure. One study surveyed 20 teenage patients who stated they chose to obtain an abortion because they felt they could not wholly provide for their child, and a child would limit their futures.

Adults can refuse medical treatment, interventions, and care based on faith and religious values. For example, Jehovah’s witnesses tend to deny blood products even if it would be lifesaving. Christian Scientologists may refuse medical treatment also when faced with severe conditions.Prince v Massachusetts that children should receive treatment, despite parental beliefs, when the refusal of treatment would cause significant disability, substantial harm, or death.

Vaccinations have had one of the most significant impacts on health around the world. Most vaccines are scheduled to be given to children as they grow and mount an immune response to the world around them. The administration of these vaccines is with parental consent, and parents may also refuse them. Many states and schools mandate children to be vaccinated to attend public schooling. However, many private schools will educate children despite their vaccines not being up to date. Parents may home school their unvaccinated children, and there are ways for children to be exempt from needing their vaccines. One study found that 54% of parents were concerned about severe adverse effects associated with vaccines and that 31% felt they should be able to refuse vaccines for their children without repercussions at schools.

Current guidelines do not address how to care for transgender minor patients when their parents disagree with the gender-affirming treatment. The Journal of Medical Ethics suggests avenues for providing care through this disagreement, those being legal carve-outs to parental consent, the mature minor doctrine, and state intervention for neglect.

Research is incredibly beneficial for the medical field. Parental consent is required to be able to use patients younger than 18 years old in research. However, this may result in sampling bias.
