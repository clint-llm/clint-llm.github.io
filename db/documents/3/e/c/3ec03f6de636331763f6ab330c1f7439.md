The exact cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) remains unknown, but it is likely multifactorial. There is a genetic predisposition, as 45 to 65% of the variance of OCD is attributable to genetic factors.

An inability to cope with uncertainty, an increased sense of responsibility as well as magical thinking seem to predispose those to obsessive-compulsive habits.

The earlier onset of sudden OCD that is preceded by a Streptococcus infection has been known as PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections). Just as Sydenham chorea can present asÂ a sequela from Streptococcus infections, the theory behind OCD is similar in that the strep infection, through molecular mimicry, causes autoimmune antibodies against the basal ganglia leading to obsessive thoughts and compulsive habits.

OCD does appear to be heritable, confirmed by both twin and family studies. Research has shown the heritability to be as high as 45% to 65% in children and 27% to 45% in adults.
