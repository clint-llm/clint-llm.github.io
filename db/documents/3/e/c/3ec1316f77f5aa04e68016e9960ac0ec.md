Neomycin belongs to a group of antibiotics known as aminoglycosides. Like others in the aminoglycoside family, neomycin works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis leading to its bactericidal effect. This group of medications is particularly effective in killing gram-negative organisms allowing for good coverage of enteric organisms.
