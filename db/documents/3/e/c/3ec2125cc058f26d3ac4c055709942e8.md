Ischemic cardiomyopathy results into dilated ventricles which manifests as decreased left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram and symptoms of heart failure in decompensated patients. However, there are many other medical conditions which can mimic these findings. Patients with a high adrenergic state either via physical/mental stress or ingestion of sympathomimetic drugs can present with abnormal cardiac wall motion abnormality and reduced LVEF. This condition is commonly referred to as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. One can differentiate stress-mediated cardiomyopathy by looking at the demographics of the patient population and cardiac catheterization when indicated. Other differential diagnosis includes thyrotoxicosis, beriberi caused by thiamine deficiency, cardiac tamponade, heavy metal toxicity, late-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and restrictive cardiomyopathy.
