There are no reports of renal failure in patients taking benazepril. The frequency of neutropenia and proteinuria are insignificant (rates of adverse drug reactions in patients treated with benazepril compared to placebo were statistically insignificant in clinical trials). Compared to other ACE inhibitors, benazepril demonstrated a reduced rate of inducing systematic hypotension and the same rate of causing adverse drug reactions such as coughing, hyperkalemia, and serum creatinine elevation.
