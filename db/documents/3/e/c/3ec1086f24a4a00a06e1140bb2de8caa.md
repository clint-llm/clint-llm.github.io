The mortality rate for adult patients with CIPO is approximately 10%. One-third of patients with CIPO will require parenteral nutrition with its associated complications, which are estimated between 45% to 80%.

In children, mortality rates range from 10% to 40%, with parenteral nutrition dependence as high as 60% to 80%.

In ACPO, the prognosis is predicated on the development of bowel ischemia or perforation, which occurs in 3% to 15% of cases. The mortality rate with ischemic bowel or perforation is 40% versus 15% without perforation.
