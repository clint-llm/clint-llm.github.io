Significant complications are rarely associated with cervical strain-counterstrain (SCS). Any complications may be associated with the position of the patient during the technique. It is recommended to avoid positions that cause discomfort, dizziness, panic, or neurogenic pain (such as rapid rotation and extension of the upper cervicals). A minor side effect may include pain in the antagonistic muscles. However, this is usually self-limiting and well-tolerated by patients.
