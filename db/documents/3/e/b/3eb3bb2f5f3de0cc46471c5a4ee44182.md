The pathogenesis of RVT is based on Virchow’s triad which is due to one or more of the following:

- Vascular endothelial damage due to an injury of the vessel wall or in cases of homocystinuria where high levels of homocysteine cause spontaneous microtrauma to the endothelium

- Stasis of blood flow, for example, in severe dehydration/volume depletion in infants

- A hypercoagulable state****such as in patients with a nephrotic syndrome where excessive urinary protein loss, decreased antithrombin III levels, a relative excess of fibrinogen, and changes in other clotting factors; all leads to the propensity of a clot
