Genetic and environmental factors play a central role in neural tube defects. However, there are many other contributing factors like obesity, diabetes, immune dysregulation, folic acid antagonists, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, socioeconomic status, geography, ethnicity, etc., that play a vital role too. Though the role of geography and ethnicity has unknown, neural tube disorders vary by location. Low socioeconomic status is associated with the non-availability of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy. Amniotic bands disrupt neural tube development, nitrosatable drugs, and maternal hyperthermia are possible additional risk factors.Cytomegalovirus, and toxic wastes from landfills within 3 km, also contributes to some extent.
