As a result of the various etiologies responsible for hyperamylasemia, a detailed history will aid in identifying the underlying disease.

Acute pancreatitis should be suspected in patients with serum amylase levels beyond three times the upper limit of normal who present with acute epigastric pain and abdominal tenderness on physical examination.

Parotid duct obstruction should be suspected if patients present with hyperamylasemia in the setting of parotid gland tenderness and history of sialolithiasis.

Patients can present with longstanding symptoms of parotitis if there is an underlying infection with pathogens, such as mycobacterium.

Inquire if the patient has had any recent history of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), trauma, or surgery. In a pediatric patient, assess if the patient is up-to-date with vaccination to rule out mumps infection.

Evaluate if the patient has a prior history of alcohol abuse, inflammatory bowel disease, renal failure, liver disease, or a family history of pancreatitis.
