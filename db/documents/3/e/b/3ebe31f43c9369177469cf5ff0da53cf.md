Bitemporal hemianopsia impairs bilateral peripheral vision; however, the central field of vision from 110 to 120 degrees remains intact.

**Pituitary adenomas**are benign tumors of the pituitary gland and the most common origin of masses near the sella turcica.

**Craniopharyngiomas**, a rare condition that presents most often in childhood (5 to 14 years) or as an adult (50 to 74 years), involves an outgrowth of the developmental remnants of Rathke’s pouch near the sella turcica.

**Meningiomas**, the most prevalent form of intracranial tumors, are generally benign neoplasms of arachnoid cells with an insidious onset.

Although rare, large **anterior communicating artery aneurysms**can potentially manifest with vision abnormalities, such as bitemporal hemianopsia.
