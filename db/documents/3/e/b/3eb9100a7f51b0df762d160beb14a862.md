Nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, internists, and endocrinologists all commonly prescribe glipizide. The drug is useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and relatively safe. However, healthcare workers, including nurses and pharmacists, must warn the patient that the drug can cause mild hypoglycemia and how to manage it. Also, since the medication can cause weight gain, patients should be instructed to exercise and eat a healthy diet. Recommendations are to monitor fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, renal, and liver function tests in patients using this drug.

Glipizide therapy is best when performed by a collaborative interprofessional team approach. The treating physician (MD, DO, NP, or PA) will determine whether to initiate glipizide therapy. Nursing can assist with counseling about medication administration, use of glucose monitors, and answer any patient questions. The pharmacist also can counsel in all these areas, as well as verifying dosing and checking for drug-drug interactions, contacting the prescribing clinician with any concerns. Nursing can monitor treatment effectiveness on followup visits, as well as check for any medication adverse effects, letting the managing physician know about any issues so they can make necessary changes in therapy.

Glipizide therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
