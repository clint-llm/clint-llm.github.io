As a team taking care of the patient with refractory hypoxemia, it is important to remember that oxygenation or oxygen saturation per se appears to be a poor surrogate marker for survival because those patients in the ARDS Network trial who were treated with higher tidal volumes had improved oxygenation but worse mortality overall.****Management of refractory hypoxemia is a team effort involving respiratory therapists, nurses, pulmonologists, intensivists, and surgeons.

Some rescue therapies such as prone positioning require a skilled team of nurses, and respiratory therapists since turning the patient is a labor-intensive process involved with some technical challenges. Communication among the interprofessional teams is critical such as informing the surgeons about possible cannulation early enough if you have a patient with severe refractory hypoxemia. If you are not an ECMO center, you might need to discuss the risk of transfer versus managing the patient at your center and will need a good critical care transport team to transfer these high-risk patients to a specialized ECMO center.
