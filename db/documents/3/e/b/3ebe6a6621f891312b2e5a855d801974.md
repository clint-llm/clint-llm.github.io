Endoscopic anatomical studies were done in the past, showing that cavernous sinuses are easily reachable through the sphenoid sinuses, which provided ways to study brain lesions better. A 3-dimensional atlas offers a means to identify lesions within the brain, including the venous sinuses, and at the same time to describe corresponding disorders for each lesion. Anatomic and scanning electron microscopy studies into the falx cerebri revealed regional differences between a complex structure of falcine venous plexus and its communication with the structures of the venous sinuses. This information is vital, especially to neurosurgeons performing surgical interventions to the brain.
