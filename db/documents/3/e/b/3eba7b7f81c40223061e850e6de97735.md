New and remarkable achievements regarding the strategies employed in oropharyngeal cancer diagnosis and treatment have been developed. These include the use of LASER based technology to detect oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma at the early stages, especially in limited-resource settings, andÂ targeted therapy which detects the mutations in genes that result in cancer and correct them, either inhibiting the growth of the tumor, its metastasis or target vascularity, cell signaling or transduction pathways

In addition, the food and drug administration (FDA) has approved vaccination against HPV to prevent HPV-related infections reducing the incidence of oropharyngeal cancers.
