A keen sense of awareness towards certain distinguishing features in the history and physical examination can raise the index of suspicion for diagnosis. The patients with middle lobe syndrome usually present with a constellation of symptoms such as chronic cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and features consistent with recurrent pneumonia. However, the most important aspect of history is an intrusive, recurrent, difficult to treat pneumonia. Physical exam findings would include wheezing, rhonchi, decreased breath sounds, tachypnea, and possibly diaphoresis during periods of concomitant pneumonia. In rare cases, features such as failure to thrive or cachexia may present as well, depending on the underlying etiology responsible for middle lobe syndrome.
