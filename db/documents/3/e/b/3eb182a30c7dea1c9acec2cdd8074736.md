Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is either a transabdominal or transcervical procedure where clinicians take samples of the placenta at 10 to 13 weeks of gestation for genetic testing. This test is beneficial because it can be done much earlier than amniocentesis and therefore receive screening results earlier. If the results lead to termination of the pregnancy, there are fewer risks than later termination. Earlier gestation also causes less accurate results. The procedure complications can include infection, bleeding, fetal injury, and fetal death.

Amniocentesis is a similar transabdominal procedure where amniotic fluid gets sampled for genetic testing. This procedure can take place at any time after 15 weeks. Amniotic fluid contains cells and substances that are created by the fetus, which can be measured to assess for disorders such as Down syndrome, infection, neural tube defects, fetal blood type determination, and lung development. The risks are similar to CVS, including infection, injury to the fetus or fetal death, and leakage of amniotic fluid.
