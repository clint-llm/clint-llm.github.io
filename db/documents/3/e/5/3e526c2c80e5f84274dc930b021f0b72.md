Many important epidemiological risk factors for ROP were established in the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity study. This randomized, prospective multicenter trial compared the safety of earlier vs. conventionally timed ablation of peripheral retina.

The two strongest known risk factors for ROP are gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW). A multicenter study of over 4000 infants with birthweight ≤1251g found that for each 100g increase in BW, odds of developing threshold ROP decreased by 27%, and for each extra week in GA, the odds of developing threshold ROP decreased by 19%.

Another important risk factor is oxygen. As mentioned above, the use of supplemental oxygen in combination with atmospheric oxygen results in the reversal of physiologic hypoxia, which then contributes to retinal ischemia and subsequent overgrowth of retinal vessels in ROP.  Additionally, the concentration of oxygen delivered is an independent risk factor for ROP, whereby increased concentrations of O2 increase the risk of ROP.
