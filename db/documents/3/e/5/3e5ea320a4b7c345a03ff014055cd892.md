Complications following ankle fractures can occur after both conservative nonoperative management and operative management.

**Nonoperative Management Complications May Include**

- Ankle stiffness

- DVT and pulmonary embolism

- Ankle mortise redislocation and requirement of a further ankle manipulation.

- SkinÂ ulceration due to cast pressure

- Fracture delayed union

- Fracture non-union

- Fracture malunion

- Ankle chronic instability

- Delayed return to functional activity

- Ankle arthritic changes

**Operative Management Complications May Include**

- Infection

- Painful scar

- Wound dehiscence

- Metalwork failure (e.g., broken plate and loose screw )

- Mal positioned metal work (e.g., screw protrusion into the joint)

- Prominent screws

- Fracture non-union

- Fracture delayed union

- Nerves damage

- Vascular damage

Another complication of ankle fracture seen in people with diabetes is Charcot arthropathy, also known as neuropathic arthropathy. This condition occurs when there is a progressive degeneration of the ankle joint, which leads to the destruction of the bone, increased bone resorption, which ultimately leads to deformity. Long-term complications of this may lead to ulceration, infection, or eventual amputation.
