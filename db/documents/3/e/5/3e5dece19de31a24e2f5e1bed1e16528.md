Several complications can occur in TEN patients because of the extensive cutaneous and mucosal membrane involvement. In the early stage, the presence of painful stomatitis may interfere with oral intake with an increased risk of dehydration. Loss of the epithelial barrier increases the risk of infection and septicemia. This may evolve to septic shock and multiorgan failures.

Ocular complications are one of the most common and serious sequelae of TEN. Therefore, early ophthalmological consultation is advisable in such cases. Corneal ulcer, xerophthalmia, meibomian gland dysfunction, panophthamitis, or even blindness are some of the reported complications.
