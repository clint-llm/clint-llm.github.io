One of the vital functions of the nose is to humidify the air before it enters the lungs. Researchers have noted that there are differences in the nose shape among populations, not only because of genetics but also secondary to evolutionary changes of the nose, to adapt to the environment and climate. For example, the width of the nares is highly related to the temperature and absolute humidity, as wider noses are more prevalent in warm and humid climate and vice versa.Â  The alar base width was found to be largest in West Africans and smallest in North Europeans. Both the alar base width and the nares width have progressed among populations because of divergent selection.
