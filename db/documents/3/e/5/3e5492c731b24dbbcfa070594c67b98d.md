The mechanism of action of bronchodilators includes targeting the beta-2 receptor, which is a G-protein coupled receptor, in the lung airways. When the beta-2 receptor is activated, the smooth muscle of the airway relaxes. Subsequently, the patient experiences better airflow for a period. Consistent use of beta-2 agonists for an extended amount of time reduces their efficacy due to the down-regulation of the beta-2 receptor in the airways. As such, a higher dose of medicine is necessary to achieve the same result. Bronchodilator metabolism occurs in the gastrointestinal tract by cytochrome P-450 enzymes. About 80% to 100% is excreted in the urine, and less than 20% is excreted in feces. Short-acting bronchodilators have a half-life of 3 to 6 hours, while longer-acting bronchodilators have a half-life of 18 to 24 hours.

Anticholinergics target parasympathetic nervous system receptors in the airways and inhibit their function. Since the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for increased bronchial secretions and constriction, reversing those should provide bronchodilation and fewer secretions.
