**Visual Acuity**

Thi8s examination is performed using a standardized Snellen visual acuity chart. The unaided, best-corrected, and pinhole visual acuity must be checked. Ectopia lentis results in severe vision loss, and it also rules out amblyopia. When planning a secondary IOL implantation, the +10 D correction should be checked in the aphakic eye.

**Refraction and Retinoscopy**

It is essential to perform retinoscopy to ascertain the type of reflex: myopic, hypermetropic, clear, or dull. Refraction will help document the myopic and astigmatic correction needed while prescribing glasses.

**Keratometry**

To know the amount of corneal astigmatism.

**Genetic Analysis**

To rule out hereditary conditions associated with ectopia lentis.

**Systemic Evaluation**

**Cardiac-**Auscultation, electrocardiogram, and 2D echocardiography to rule out aortic root dilatation, aneurysms of the aorta, and mitral valve prolapse in case of Marfan's syndrome.

**Musculoskeletal-**Orthopaedic examination to rule out skeletal involvement in case of Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, and Weill–Marchesani syndrome.

**Lab Investigations**

Serum and urine levels of homocysteine in case of homocystinuria.

**A-Scan Ultrasonography**

To rule out axial myopia in the case of Marfan syndrome.

**B Scan Ultrasonography**

It is helpful to rule out retinal detachment, nucleus, or IOL drop in the vitreous cavity.
