Patients with cervical radiculopathy commonly complain of neck pain, with radiation to the arm. This is often accompanied by numbness and tingling caused by the impinged sensory nerve's dermatome distribution. If there is motor nerve involvement, patients will also complain of weakness in the involved nerve's myotomal distribution.

On the physical exam, it is essential to test motor strength, sensation, and reflexes bilaterally. On inspection, it is necessary to evaluate muscle atrophy as well. Although not every patient will exhibit the same symptoms for radiculopathies, it is common to see decreased reflexes related to the affected nerve root, weakness in muscles innervated by the affected nerve root, and sensory symptoms in the dermatomal pattern. Diminished reflexes, particularly involving the triceps by a C7 nerve root involvement, are the most common neurological finding.

A thorough understanding of anatomy is essential for radiculopathy evaluation. Spinal nerves are sensory and motor nerves mixed, which form the dorsal and ventral nerve rootlets distal to the dorsal root ganglion in intervertebral foramina. After the nerve exits the foramen, it divides into dorsal and ventral ramus. The ventral ramus forms the cervical and brachial plexuses that supply the extremity. The dorsal ramus innervates the paraspinal muscles and the skin of the neck and back of the neck with an overlapping innervation.
