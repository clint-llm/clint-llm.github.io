Injury to the brachial plexus can occur during the birthing process. Forty percent to 50% of obstetric brachial plexus palsy cases are lesions to C5 and C6 and is more commonly known as Erbâ€™s palsy.

Another pathology related to the brachial plexus is thoracic outlet syndromes (TOS). TOS is caused by the compression of the brachial plexus within the thoracic outlet. Symptoms include neck pain, trapezius pain, shoulder and/or arm pain, and chest pain.
