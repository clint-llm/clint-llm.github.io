Deep neck space infections are almost uniformly polymicrobial, representing their origin from the normal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract. The most common source of deep neck infections among adults are the dental and periodontal structures, with the second most common source being from the tonsils. Tonsil and pharyngeal sources are the most common etiologies in children. Streptococcus viridans,
Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, gram-negative rods, anaerobes, Fusobacterium species are all frequently encountered microorganisms, representing pathologic overgrowth of expected oropharyngeal flora. Actinomyces, Mycobacterium, and fungi are also potential causative organisms but are rarer. The presence of risk factors such as immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, intravenous (IV) drug use, as well as the site of origin of infection, influences the type of causative organism.
