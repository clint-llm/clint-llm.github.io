It is important to obtain a gestational age in all pregnancies to provide the standard of care medical management for both mother and fetus. A combination of history, physical exam, early sonography in the first trimester, and prenatal assessments are all essential to obtaining a more accurate gestational age. Different techniques may be more useful depending onÂ how far along the pregnancy has progressed. Early sonography has been shown to be the most useful predictor of gestational age; however, other late modalities are available to help determine age.
