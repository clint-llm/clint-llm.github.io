PEPs are porcine enzymes and contain mixtures of pancreatic lipase, amylase, and protease. Lipase is a digestive enzyme involved in the hydrolysis and degradation of fats. Impairments in lipase metabolism lead to the malabsorption of fats. Amylase is a digestive enzyme involved in the hydrolysis and digestion of starches. Impairments in amylase metabolism lead to complex carbohydrates malabsorption. Proteases are enzymes involved in the breakdown of proteins and amino acids. Imbalances or insufficiency of proteases can lead to poor absorption of amino acids and breakdown of essential proteins.

PEPs are exogenous versions of these enzymes derived from porcine pancreatic ducts; these enzymes then act locally to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. The main site of action is the duodenum. The duodenum represents the initial part of the small intestine where nutrient absorption and macromolecule degradation co-occurs. The drug has minimal systemic absorption.

Manufacturers developed newer formulations known as enteric-coated microspheres to protect enzymes against breakdown by gastric acid and provide better dispersion of enzymes in the chyme and, therefore, observed to provide consistent symptoms relief in CP compared to the older formulation.
