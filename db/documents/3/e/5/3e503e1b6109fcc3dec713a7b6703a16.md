The scope of practice for emergency management service (EMS) providers over the years have changed with the 2018 National EMS Scope of Practice Model introduced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration further delineates the roles of the prehospital providers.  Due to the advances with CPAP, EMT's have lost some of their skills in relation to intubation and the need to perform invasive airway techniques.  The original 2007 Practice Model for EMS providers had CPAP/BiPAP as paramedic skills.  With the 2018 National EMS Scope of Practice Model, the use of CPAP has been transferred to the level of an emergency medical technician.   Further more, in most states, the emergency management technician (EMT) is allowed to use a CPAP device with appropriate training and approval from their medical director.
