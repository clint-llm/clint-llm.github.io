All brachial plexus blocks are contraindicated if there is active cellulitis or an abscess at the injection site, or a known allergy to the local anesthetic.

Interscalene brachial plexus blocks are contraindicated in certain pulmonary and cardiac diseases. Morbid obesity may be a relative contraindication, as respiratory insufficiency can result from hemidiaphragmatic paralysis.

Superior trunk blocks have the same contraindications as interscalene blocks, although phrenic nerve palsy is felt to occur less frequently. The dorsal scapular nerve travels through the middle scalene near the typical injection site.

Supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks should be used cautiously in patients with poor pulmonary reserve, as any resulting pneumothorax may significantly worsen their respiratory status. An example of this relative contraindication is known pneumonia on the contralateral side.

Axillary brachial plexus blocks should not be performed if there is an inability to visualize the needle path through the highly vascular region.
