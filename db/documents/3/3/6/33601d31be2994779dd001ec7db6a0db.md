The wall of the bladder is comprised of smooth muscle fibers oriented in multiple different directions. These smooth muscle fibers are collectively known as the detrusor muscle. This interwoven orientation provides the bladder with the ability to stretch in response to the presence of urine. The primary function of the detrusor muscle is to contract during urination to push the urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. The detrusor muscle will relax to allow the storage of urine in the urinary bladder.
