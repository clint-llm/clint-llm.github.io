While dealing with renal allograft dysfunction, equal weight should be given to find out the possible etiologies other than the rejection.

The following are the most common reasons for allograft dysfunctions other than allograft rejection.

**A.  Immediate Post Transplant (less than one week)**

1. Postischemic acute tubular necrosis or ischemia-reperfusion injury.

2. Volume depletion leading to pre-renal AKI

3. Surgical complications:

- Fluid collection – urinoma, perinephric hematoma, or lymphocele

- Vascular thrombosis - arterial and venous

- Multiple renal arteries from the donor's kidney - infarction of the part of the allograft or necrosis of the ureter leading to urinary obstruction or urinary leak

- Aeroembolism

- Calcium oxalate crystals deposits in renal allograft

**B. Early (1 week to 3 months) and Late Post Transplant (over three months)**

1. Volume depletion

2. Acute tubular necrosis

3. Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity - manifesting as acute azotemia as well as chronic progressive renal disease.

4. Urinary obstruction

5. Infections

- Bacterial pyelonephritis

- Viral infections - BK polyomavirus and CMV

6. Acute and chronic interstitial nephritis

7. Recurrent primary glomerular diseases

- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)

- Primary membranous nephropathy

- Diabetic nephropathy

- Ig A nephropathy

- C3 Glomerulonephritis (C3 GN)

8. De novo glomerular disease

9. Thrombotic microangiopathy

- In patients with a prior history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome

- Associated with calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity

10. Transplant renal artery stenosis

11. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease
