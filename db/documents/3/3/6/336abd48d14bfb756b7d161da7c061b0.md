Secretin has 3 main functions: regulation of gastric acid, regulation of pancreatic bicarbonate, and osmoregulation.

**Regulation of Gastric Acid Secretion and Pancreatic Bicarbonate**

The major physiological actions of secretin are stimulation of pancreatic fluid and bicarbonate secretion. S cells in the small intestine emit secretin. Gastric acid stimulates secretin release, allowing movement into the duodenal lumen. Secretin causes an increase in pancreatic and biliary bicarbonate secretion and a decrease in gastric H+ secretion. Secretin stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid.

Secretin neutralizes the pH in the duodenum by optimizing the functionality of pancreatic amylase and pancreatic lipase. (1) Via the second messenger action of cAMP, bicarbonate release causes neutralization of the acidic environment, thus establishing a pH favorable for the action of digestive enzymes.

**Osmoregulation**

Water homeostasis is crucial in maintaining the balance between water intake and excretion in the body.

Osmoregulatory functions of secretin in the brain are similar to those of angiotensin II.
