The current thought is that with every depolarization, the influx of calcium ions from voltage-gated channels occur that lead to calcium release from SR. Relaxation of the cell occurs when calcium levels return to their original values mainly via uptake by the SR through SERCA. Calcium further extrudes from the cell via Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and mitochondrial calcium uptake.

SR calcium uptake is enhanced during calcium transient in diastole due to SERCA function acceleration that contributes to ‘frequency-dependent acceleration of relaxation’- causing reuptake of more calcium back into the SR. The SR can lose some Ca during diastole, but increased heart rate can shorten diastolic interval, which limits the loss of SR calcium, accumulating more calcium for the next contraction.
