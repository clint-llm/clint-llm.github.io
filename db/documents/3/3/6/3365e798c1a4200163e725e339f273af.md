**Exogenous Endophthalmitis**

Exogenous endophthalmitis is due to infectious pathogens of the ocular surface or external environment complicating intraocular surgery or from penetrating ocular injury or the contiguous spread from adjacent tissues. The three forms of exogenous fungal endophthalmitis are postoperative, posttraumatic, and fungal keratitis-derived.

In general, postoperative endophthalmitis is the most common type of endophthalmitis, accounting for 40%-80% of cases of endophthalmitis. It is rarely fungal, but Aspergillus and Candida species are the most commonly reported fungal organisms implicated in postoperative endophthalmitis.Aspergillus are the most prevalent fungal cause.

**Endogenous Endophthalmitis**

Endogenous endophthalmitis is rare, compromising only 5%–15% of endophthalmitis. It most often occurs via hematogenous spread secondary to compromised blood–ocular barrier. Patients with endogenous endophthalmitis are primarily immunocompromised or intravenous drug users that develop fungemia. In contrast to other types of endophthalmitis where bacteria are the most prevalent pathogens, the most common cause of endogenous endophthalmitis is fungi. Candida albicans is the leading pathogen for endogenous fungal endophthalmitis. Other Candida species have also been reported, including C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. pelliculosa. Aspergillus and Fusarium are the most common causative molds.
