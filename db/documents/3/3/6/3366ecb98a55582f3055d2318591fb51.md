As always, initial evaluation should include airway assessment to determine that the airway is patent and there is no impending occlusion or compromise. In rare instances, abscess or edema can impede proper maintenance of the airway. Also, determination of hemodynamic stability is important to rule out concomitant splenic injury or rupture in the acute illness of mononucleosis. Laboratory evaluation most commonly will reveal lymphocytosis, with a lymphocyte differential often greater than 50%. Atypical lymphocytosis of greater than 10% can be seen on blood smear. A general leukocytosis and occasionally thrombocytopenia may also be appreciated. Imaging is generally not needed in the evaluation of mononucleosis. The monospot (or heterophile antibody) test for mononucleosis is the diagnostic test of choice and is nearly 100% specific for the disease. The sensitivity of this test is closer to 85%.  If the patient is early in the illness, the test may be falsely negative, and it should be repeated later during the course of the disease. If the diagnosis is unclear, the patient should also undergo evaluation for streptococcal infection by rapid antigen testing or throat culture.
