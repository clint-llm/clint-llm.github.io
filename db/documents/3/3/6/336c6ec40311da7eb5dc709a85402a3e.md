Patients should be aware that regular monitoring and supportive strategies for their exophthalmos will provide symptomatic relief, in addition to the medical or surgical management of the underlying cause. As such, regular lubrication of the eyes, monitoring, and engagement with the treatment plan set by the ophthalmologist, primary care clinician, and hospital care clinician will ensure that patients are appropriately treated.
