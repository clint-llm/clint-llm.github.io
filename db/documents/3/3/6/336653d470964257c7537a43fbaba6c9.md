During hospitalization, patients require instruction on adapting to life after ventral cord syndrome. Follow-up visits also provide an opportunity for support and patient education.  The journey of adjustment to disability is an evolving, dynamic, general process from which the patient progresses to an optimal state of person-environment congruence. The clinical team should focus on instructing and coaching the patient through this process.

Patients must receive training in developing effective coping strategies; literature supports the role of these strategies during the psychological adjustment phase. A study by Kennedy et al. showed that 45 patients who participated in a coping training program showed lower scores for depression and anxiety compared to a control group that received the standard of care.

Psychological resources are inner, health-protecting and health-promoting potentials of a person, which represent a source or means to deal with challenging situations. They may include abilities, skills, knowledge, experience, talents, strengths and behavioral patterns of a person. Clinicians must help the patient strengthen their psychological resources to support a successful adjustment.

The patient must obtain counsel on the importance of sports participation and exercise as a means of improving health. The literature consistently shows that exercise also improves functional performance, enhances psychological well-being and social integration. Before engaging in physical activity, an appropriate screening must be performed to determine the proper exercise prescription, identify precautions and to provide necessary modifications to physical activity.

Education also centers around other social aspects of patient life. Clinicians play a crucial role in facilitating the individual to engage in gainful employment. The medical team needs to assess and provide options and modifications for transportation. Transportation is a vital element of independence and social integration in the spinal cord injury community.

Hospital discharge provides clinicians with an excellent opportunity to educate the patient, family, friends, and caretakers. The medical team must assess the options and equipment available that facilitate the patient's life and integration to society. Discharge planning needs to consider preparing for emergencies and complications, establishing follow-up appointments and support, providing the patient with appropriate medical equipment, and home assessment.
