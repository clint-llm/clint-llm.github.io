Fluconazole is a member of the triazole family, one of the most widely used antifungal agents.Candida infections, including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, pneumonia, and cryptococcal meningitis. Prophylaxis is also known to decrease candidiasis incidence in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Non-FDA-approved uses for fluconazole include blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Recently, there has been an increase in fluconazole administration to treat coccidioidomycosis inflicted bone and joint infection, meningitis, pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, and pneumonia as a primary infection in HIV-positive or severely debilitated patients.

Recent studies have proven that fluconazole is more effective at treating soft tissue and pulmonary infections than other azole antifungal treatments, mainly with infections caused by coccidioidomycosis.

Invasive candidiasis has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Fluconazole or other azoles can be used in combination with echinocandins and liposomal amphotericin B. Similarly, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis has been reported in immunocompromised patients, which requires aggressive treatment with the induction phase for amphotericin B and flucytosine, followed by fluconazole followed by consolidation and secondary prophylaxis with fluconazole.
