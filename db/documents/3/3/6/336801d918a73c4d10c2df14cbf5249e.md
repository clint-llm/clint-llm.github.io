The pathophysiology of NMS is complex and incompletely understood.  Most symptoms are attributed to the sudden reduction in central dopaminergic activity due to a D2 receptor blockade or abrupt withdrawal of D2 receptor stimulation. This accounts for the characteristic muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and mental status changes.  Other neurotransmitters are involved, and NMS has features suggestive of disruption of the sympathetic nervous system. Other theories suggest a calcium-mediated disruption of the musculoskeletal system, pathophysiologically similar to malignant hyperthermia. Familial clusters of patients with NMS and genetic testing suggest a predisposition to the development of NMS in certain individuals.
