Additional important considerations regarding the ophthalmic artery include the following arterial branches:

- Ethmoidal Arteries = The ophthalmic artery turns anteriorly after reaching the medial orbital wall. The anterior ethmoidal artery enters the nose after traversing the anterior ethmoidal canal and brings blood supply to the anterior/middle ethmoidal and the frontal sinuses. This branch subsequently enters the cranium and supplies blood to the meninges. The posterior ethmoidal artery enters the nose through the posterior ethmoidal canal. It provides the blood supply for the posterior ethmoidal sinuses. It also subsequently enters the cranium and supplies the meninges.

- Medial Palpebral Arteries = The ophthalmic artery courses anteriorly toward the trochlea. Here, the superior and inferior medial palpebral arteries originate. This is the blood supply to the eyelids.

- The Supraorbital Artery = Branches from the ophthalmic artery during its course over the optic nerve, passes anteriorly along the medial border of the levator palpebrae and superior rectus, and then through the supraorbital foramen to provide blood supply to the muscles and skin of the forehead.

- The Terminal Branches = There are two terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery. The supratrochlear (frontal) artery and the dorsal nasal artery. Both of theseÂ vessels exit the orbit medially and supply the forehead and scalp.
