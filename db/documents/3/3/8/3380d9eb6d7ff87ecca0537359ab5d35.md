Advanced cases of somatostatinoma with hepatic metastases often require an interprofessional approach inclusive of a gastroenterologist, surgeon, and oncologist to evaluate the prognosis and treatment choices between curative procedures and palliative therapy. Pharmacologists review treatment with somatostatin analogs or chemotherapy. Specialty-trained nurses assist with surgery, monitor patients preoperatively, and administer treatment.
