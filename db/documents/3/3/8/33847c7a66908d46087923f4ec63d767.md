The timely introduction of ART to improved CD4+ counts is the most efficient method of minimizing the risk of opportunistic infections. The use of ART can however lead to IRIS due to inflammatory response once improvement of CD4+ cell count is seen and immune response has been achieved. The presentation of IRIS can be nonspecific and depends on the type of opportunistic infection, location, and severity of inflammatory response. Due to its nonspecific presentation, it can be hard to differentiate it from active infections (e.g hospital-acquired pneumonia), a progression of previously diagnosed opportunistic infections, or drug-related side effects. Continuation of ART and symptomatic management is the cornerstone of managing IRIS. The use of steroids is reserved for severe forms of IRIS.
