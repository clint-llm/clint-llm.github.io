The differential diagnosis is based on the particular substance(s) being used during the pregnancy.

If the medical history, physical examination, validated screening, or biological testing reveals substance use, the next step is to distinguish between occasional or prescription usage and SUD. If a woman is diagnosed with SUD, she should be evaluated for single versus polysubstance use because the consequences and treatment differ, depending on the substances involved. The clinician must search for common comorbid conditions related to SUD, including sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. Individuals with SUD also have higher rates of mental health disorders than the general population. Diagnosing psychiatric conditions may be difficult before initiating SUD treatment due to overlapping symptoms. In addition, poor nutrition and dental hygiene often accompany SUD.

Clinicians who listen carefully, perform a complete physical examination, and screen with a validated instrument are more likely to diagnose SUD early and initiate appropriate treatment. Pregnant women with SUD must be evaluated for coexisting conditions that can adversely impact the pregnancy if not diagnosed and promptly managed. A high index of suspicion for SUD will lead to early treatment and improved outcomes for both mother and her child.
