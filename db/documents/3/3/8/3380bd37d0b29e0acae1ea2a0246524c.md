Petechiae are pinpoint non-blanching spots that measure less than 2 mm in size and affect the skin and mucous membranes. Petechial rashes are common and can be a significant cause for concern for parents and the interprofessional team. Petechial rashes result from areas of hemorrhage into the dermis. The primary pathophysiological causes of petechiae are thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, disorders of coagulation, and loss of vascular integrity. Though there are many causes of a petechial rash in a child, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by Neisseria meningitidis is one of the most concerning reasons. A child with a fever and a petechial rash requires an urgent and comprehensive assessment. This activity reviews the causes of petechiae and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with petechiae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of petechiae.
- Describe the evaluation of petechiae.
- Summarize the treatment options available for petechiae.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of petechiae to improve outcomes.
