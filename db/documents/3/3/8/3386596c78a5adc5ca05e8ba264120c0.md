The most common presenting feature in DTC is either neck swelling (detected by the patient or a clinician) or incidentally detected thyroid nodules on neck imaging. The risk of malignancy of a thyroid nodule in the general population is around 5 to 10%, with the risk being higher in men and extremes of age.

A careful history and physical examination will help to differentiate low-risk vs. high-risk nodules, although these signs and symptoms lack specificity. Aspects in the patient's history that could be concerning for malignancy include a sudden increase in the size of the nodule with pressure symptoms such as hoarseness of voice, dysphagia, dyspnea, or Horner's Syndrome, as well as a family history of thyroid cancer, childhood irradiation to the head and neck region, or the occurrence of systemic effects such as weight loss and fatigue. On physical examination of the neck, firmness of the nodule, immobility, and the presence of neck lymph nodes should trigger suspicion for malignancy and lead to further evaluation.

On the other hand, anaplastic thyroid cancer can present as a rapidly enlarging neck mass and rapid occurrence of compressive symptoms of the aerodigestive tract. Some patients can present with constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and anorexia.
