**Early Menarche**

- **Causes**
- Earlier onset of menarche was seen in those surrounded by stressful family environments, those in foster care, and those living with a stepparent. This is explained through differing lifestyle and psychological factors. Additionally, those raised in urban environments experience menarche at an earlier age when compared to those raised in rural settings.
- Adolescents from families of high socioeconomic status (SES) experience menarche at an earlier age when compared to those from families of a lower SES.
- Studies have shown that those who consumed more animal protein and less vegetable protein between the ages of three to five experienced earlier menarche.
- Multiple studies have shown that having an overweight or obese BMI is a risk factor for early menarche. One such study stated that those with early menarche were 1.7 times more likely to have an overweight or obese BMI.
- Formula feeding during early infancy has also been researched as a potential factor for early menarche.

- **Outcomes**
- Early menarche has been associated with physical and psychosocial problems, including anxiety and depression, earlier sexual intercourse, substance use, and suicidal behavior. These outcomes may be attributed to adolescents associating negative physical and psychological changes with menstruation reflecting misconception, ignorance, and the fear of being different from peers.
- Substantial evidence from multiple countries suggests that females who undergo early menarche are more vulnerable to early pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual violence.
- Early menarche can lead to premature fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates and a final adult height shorter than the potential genetic height.
- Undergoing menarche at an early age leads to an increased prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in adulthood, increasing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Studies have also shown an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
- Higher bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and femoral neck in older age has been seen in females who underwent early menarche, explained by the prolonged lifetime exposure to the protective effects of endogenous estrogens.
- Studies have demonstrated a 23% higher risk of developing breast cancer in patients with early menarche when compared with patients who experience delayed menstruation. This finding is enhanced by the observation that early menarche is accompanied by abdominal-type obesity and, thus, higher circulating levels of insulin, testosterone, and insulin-like growth factor 1, which act as growth factors for mammary tissue proliferation and are likely to promote mammary gland carcinogenesis.

**Late Menarche**

Primary amenorrhea is the term used to describe the absence of menses by age 15 in the setting of normal growth and secondary sexual development or the absence of menses by age 13 in the absence of normal growth or secondary sexual development.

- **Causes**
- Menarche can be delayed in adolescents with very low body mass due to starvation, malabsorption, or an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa. It is estimated that minimum body fat of 17% is necessary for menarche, with 22% body fat required for maintaining regular menses.
- Menarche, on average, occurs later in athletes than in the general population, suggesting that intense exercise of at least two hours per day delays puberty and, therefore, menarche.
- Additional studies have shown that the presence of older sisters in the household is associated with a later onset of menarche.
- Menarche can be delayed in normally developing females due to abnormalities of the female genitourinary tract. Females with an imperforate hymen may present with delayed menarche and often have a history of recurrent cyclic abdominal or pelvic pain. These patients may present with a palpable lower abdominal mass and often have a bulging, bluish-colored hymen.
- The absence of a normal uterus or vagina due to Müllerian agenesis, or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, has an incidence of approximately 1/4500 females and often goes undiagnosed until a patient presents with primary amenorrhea. Other complex hormonal abnormalities, such as androgen insensitivity syndrome, can present with external female development and primary amenorrhea. Abnormal development of female gonads due to Turner syndrome also can lead to ovarian agenesis and absent menses.

- **Outcomes**
- Delayed menarche has been shown to decrease mineral density in the forearm, spine, and proximal femur, resulting in osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures later in life.
- Late menarche may be positively associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer disease.
