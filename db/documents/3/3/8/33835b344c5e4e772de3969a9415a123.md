The prompt collection and dissemination of pertinent patient history can aid the healthcare team in assessing the severity of the laceration. The understanding of how to appropriately aid in hemostasis through direct pressure can significantly aid in the complete assessment of the patient. Nurses also play a vital role in dressing change, wound care, and timely removal of sutures/staples.
