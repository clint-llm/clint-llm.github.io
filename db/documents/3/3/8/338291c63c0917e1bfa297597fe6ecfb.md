There are three types of cell-surface receptors: GPCR, enzyme-linked receptors, ligand-gated ion channels.

G protein-coupled receptors functions depend on the three elements: receptor, G-protein, and the effector molecule. The receptor has seven transmembrane helices and binds to the ligand on the extracellular regions. The intracellular binding domain binds to the G-protein. Activation of G-protein leads to the effector molecules that have various functions. Examples of ligands for GPCR include catecholamines, ACTH, LH, FSH, TSH, vasopressin, dopamine, and glucagon.

The receptor type and their connected G proteins are listed below:

- Sympathetic alpha receptors: alpha1 is Gq and alpha2 is Gi

- Sympathetic beta receptors: beta1, beta2, and beta3 are all Gs

- Parasympathetic muscarinergic: M1 and M3 are Gq, M2 is Gi

- Histamine: H1 is Gq and H2 is Gs

- Dopamine: D1 is Gs, D2 is Gi

- Vasopressin: V1 is Gq, V2 is Gs

Receptor tyrosine kinases are transmembrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity. They are activated when ligand causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain. Ligands for these receptors include insulin and growth factors. Effectors associated with tyrosine kinase receptors are phospholipase C (part of the IP3/DAG pathway,Â which cleaves PIP2 into IP3 and DAG) and Ras. Ras activates other signal transduction pathways like MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase that are needed for cell growth and proliferation.

Non-receptor tyrosine kinases do not have tyrosine kinase activity. Their ligands include growth hormones, interferons, prolactin, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin. Janus kinase (JAK) family are separate tyrosine kinase proteins that are coupled with the receptor. Activation of the receptor leads to activation of STAT proteins that act as transcription factors for JAK-STAT regulated genes.

Receptor serine/threonine kinase bind to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta).
