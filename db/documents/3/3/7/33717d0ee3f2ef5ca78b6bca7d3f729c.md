The peripheral nervous system (PNS), like the central nervous system, arise from the neural plate. The cells at the neural plate margin give rise to neural crest cells. Neural crest cells migrate extensively throughout the embryo, which contributes to the majority of glial cells and neurons in the PNS.Â At the cranial level, the PNS has a dual origin, the ectodermal placode, and cranial neural crest cells. The placodes generate the "sense" organs (ears, nose, the lens of the eye) and cranial sensory ganglia. Caudally, the entire peripheral nervous system derives from the neural crest cells. The neural crest cells contribute to sympathetic ganglia and the dorsal root of the PNS. The dorsal root ganglia form bilaterally beside the developing spinal cord. It is sensory and innervates the skin and organs for proprioception, injury, and temperature. Other neural crest cells migrate ventrally, forming the sympathetic chain ganglia, which innervate various organs along the trunk.
