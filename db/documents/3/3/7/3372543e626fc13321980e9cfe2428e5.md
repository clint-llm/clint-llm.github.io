The most feared complication of all neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, including breast milk jaundice, is acute bilirubin encephalopathy acutely and kernicterus (chronic bilirubin encephalopathy) in the long term. This concern is due to its potential for permanent neurodevelopmental delay. It is a rare complication of breast milk jaundice and occurs in less than 2% of breastfed term infants who have no evidence of hemolytic anemia.
