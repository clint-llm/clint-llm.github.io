The United Nations banned napalm usage against civilian targets in 1980, but this has not stopped its use in many conflicts around the world.  Although the use of traditional napalm has generally ceased, modern variants are deployed, allowing some countries to assert that they do not use “napalm.”

Online instructions for homemade napalm exist and entice some individuals to attempt to make their own napalm for both routine uses (destroying insect colonies or burning tree stumps) and nefarious purposes; this generally requires heating a flammable substance such as gasoline or kerosene and then slowly mixing in various gelatinizing agents such as soap. When performing this operation over an open flame, the entire mixture may inadvertently ignite and cause extensive burns.
