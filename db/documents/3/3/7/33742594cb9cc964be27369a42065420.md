UDCA has been shown to have potentially toxic molecular properties. UDCA breaks down into toxic lithocholic acid. After being absorbed in the small intestine, UDCA undergoes hepatic conjugation.Â  Beyond conjugation, UDCA does not experience further breakdown by the liver or intestinal mucosa. It becomes oxidized or reduced, yielding either 7-keto-lithocholic acid or lithocholic acid. Litcholic acid can be toxic to liver cells and even cause liver failure in those with compromised sulfation. It also leads to segmental bile duct injury, hepatocyte failure, and death.
