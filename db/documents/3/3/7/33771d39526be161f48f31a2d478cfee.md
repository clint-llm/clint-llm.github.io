Epiphrenic diverticula is a complex disorder that requires input from an interprofessional team of healthcare individuals. Because of its myriad of symptoms, these diverticula can be approached in a medical or surgical direction. Therefore, it requires several specialties, from general practitioners to gastroenterologists to general/thoracic surgeons. Strong communication between specialties can help diagnose patients with epiphrenic diverticulum, as well as to rule out other differentials or to rule in underlying pathologies (motility disorders).

Treatment strategies center around a thorough workup that includes esophagograms, EGDs, and manometry, but a physicians' clinical perspective is ultimately combining all the data for an accurate diagnosis. The general practitioner can guarantee that epiphrenic diverticula are diagnosed before major complications by coordinating gastroenterology with surgery early on in the dysphagia workup.
