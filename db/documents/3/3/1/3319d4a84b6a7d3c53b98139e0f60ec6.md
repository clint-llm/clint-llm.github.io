Anterior shoulder dislocations are the most common joint dislocation. When patients present to the emergency room, proper radiographs are necessary for an accurate diagnosis. The direction of the dislocation must be radiographically confirmed while also ruling out concomitant pathology. The acutely dislocated shoulder should be emergently reduced, with referral to a sports medicine physician or orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and possible preoperative planning.
