The recommended intravenous dose for adults is 370-740 mBq/kg (10-20 mCi/Kg) and for children is 5.18-7.4 MBq/kg (0.14 to 20 mCi/Kg).

Image acquisition can be enhanced and non-enhanced. Every study must include a CT tomogram or scout views. Non-enhanced studies are done with low-dose CT followed by PET acquisition. The enhanced protocol requires a whole-body scan with a 45 to 60 second to account for the venous phase in the abdomen, followed by PET acquisition.

Both PET and CT images are necessary for accurate interpretation, especially when images are degraded due to motion. In addition, interpretation of the study must consider normal uptake and infection or inflammatory processes that can decrease avid uptake. Physiological normal uptake can be detected in the brain, myocardium, reticuloendothelial and gastrointestinal system, kidneys, muscle, uterus, ovaries, teste, and brown adipose tissue.
