The etiology of PAVSD is yet unknown. But several risk factors have been linked with the incidence of it. A genetic component has been suggested in literature but the level of evidence is weak.

- History of congenital heart diseases in either father or mother.

- History of intake of teratogenic drugs by mother

- Smoking during or before pregnancy

- Poorly controlled diabetes

- Pregnancy in elderly

These risk factors are not specific to PAVSD and are also found frequently associated with other congenital anomalies.
