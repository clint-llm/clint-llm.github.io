Autoimmune, inflammatory conditions, trauma, and neoplastic disease are the most common differentials that must merit consideration in the differential diagnosis. These include thyroid-associated orbitopathy linked with Graves disease; infectious conditions such as orbital and preseptal cellulitis; vascular malformations including carotid-cavernous fistula; benign and malignant tumors including malignancy including capillary haemangioma, neuroblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, mucocele, pseudotumors, and secondary metastatic tumors that may give rise to metastatic deposits in the orbit. Other rare differentials may include Crouzon syndrome and Apert syndrome. Periorbital fractures due to trauma may result in periorbital hemorrhage that can potentially protrude the globe.
