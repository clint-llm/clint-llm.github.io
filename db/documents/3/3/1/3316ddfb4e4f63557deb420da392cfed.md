Famotidine is contraindicated for use by patients with serious hypersensitivity to famotidine itself or any component of the formulation. Cross-sensitivity of H2RAs has been observed; therefore, famotidine should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to cimetidine. In addition, the over-the-counter tablets should not be used if the patient has trouble and/or pain when swallowing food, vomiting with blood, or bloody or black stools. The over-the-counter tablets should also not be used by patients who are allergic to other acid reducers, have renal impairment, or are currently taking other acid reducers.
