All healthcare personnel should operate as an interprofessional team and understand the risk associated with indomethacin treatment. Prescribers should tailor the regimen adequately at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Clinicians should avoid NSAIDs in patients with peptic ulcers, CABG, and the third trimester of pregnancy. Nurses need to be careful before administering medicines to patients and counsel patients on points to identify therapeutic success or adverse reactions. The prescriber should periodically monitor patients with a history of cardiovascular accidents, serious GI bleeding, hepatotoxicity, and severe renal impairment to prevent potential adverse events. The pharmacist should verify the dose, perform medication reconciliation, check for drug interactions, educate patients, and report any concerns to the clinician.

The critical care team should rapidly stabilize the patient in indomethacin overdose and consult a medical toxicologist if necessary.
