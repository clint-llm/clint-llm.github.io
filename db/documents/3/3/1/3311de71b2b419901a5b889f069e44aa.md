Multiple COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorizations (EUA) to prevent severe COVID-19 illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They have been instrumental in controlling the severity of this pandemic and improving clinical outcomes. Moreover, a novel approach to vaccination was initiated during this pandemic using mRNA vaccines. This activity reviews the indications, administration, and contraindications for COVID-19 vaccines to allow clinical understanding of these agents and their appropriate use. This activity will also highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key elements of the COVID-19 vaccines in the clinical setting for the interprofessional team members when vaccinating individuals to prevent COVID-19 and its related conditions sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of COVID-19 vaccines.
- Describe indications for COVID-19 vaccines.
- Review the adverse effects of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines.
- Outline some interprofessional strategies the healthcare team can employ to optimize SARS-COVID-19 vaccine deployment and improve public health outcomes.
