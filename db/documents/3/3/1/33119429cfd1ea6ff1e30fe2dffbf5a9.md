Diagnosis is based primarily on the history and physical exam, including purely sensory neurological changes without motor involvement in the anatomical location of the upper thigh. Evaluation should include a complete lower extremity neurologic examination. Deficiencies may be noted with pinprick, and light touch over an approximately 10" x 6” oval area over the anterolateral thigh; however, deficiencies may also be noted more anteriorly or medially based on a patient’s specific anatomy. A lower extremity neurologic exam is normal with preserved deep tendon reflexes, motor strength, negative straight leg raise, and without sacroiliac, back, or hip abnormalities.

Plain radiographs are not required in the diagnosis, given a consistent history and physical exam. Electrodiagnostic studies for the LFCN produce variable results, are difficult to perform on overweight patients, and are typically not indicated in the diagnosis unless used to rule out radiculopathy or plexopathy. Nerve blockade via injection of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (in which relief of pain confirms the diagnosis) is rarely used for diagnosis to distinguish from lumbosacral root pain.

The clinician may consider blood tests if a metabolic etiology is suspected. Imaging studies such as a pelvic x-ray may be indicated if a tumor or osteoarthritis is suspected. Likewise, an ultrasound or MRI may be ordered to investigate for a pelvic or retroperitoneal tumor.
