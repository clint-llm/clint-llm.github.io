In patients with suspected primary hyperaldosteronism, it is critical to maintain interprofessional communication between the primary care physician, endocrinologist, nurse practitioner, and laboratory team. The workup of suspected primary hyperaldosteronism involves an initial blood test of aldosterone to plasma renin activity, and this needs to be drawn early in the morning, preferably before 8 am. Discussion between the healthcare provider and lab team should take place if working in the hospital or conversation with the patient if working up is outpatient. Confirmatory tests, including oral sodium loading or saline infusion, require timely blood draws by lab staff and careful instruction to the patient for sodium loading to allow for accurate results. Once diagnosed, especially by an endocrinologist, it is important to thoroughly document the steps of the workup and goals of treatment as this will help the interprofessional communication with the primary care physician, nurse practitioner, or surgeon if the patient is a surgical candidate for adrenalectomy. A thorough explanation of the treatment options should be given to the patient to allow them to be a part of the medical team.
