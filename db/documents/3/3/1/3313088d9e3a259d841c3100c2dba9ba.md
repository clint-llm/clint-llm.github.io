Accurate information regarding the epidemiology regarding the incidence of aplastic anemia is generally not available. Studies suggest the incidence is 0.6 to 6.1 cases per million population; this rate is largely based on data from retrospective reviews of death registries.

The male-to-female ratio is approximately 1:1. Although aplastic anemia occurs in all age groups, a small peak in the incidence is observed in childhood. A second peak is found in the 20 to 25-year-old age group.
