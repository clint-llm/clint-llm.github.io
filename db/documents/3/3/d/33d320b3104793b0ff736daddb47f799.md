Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common ailments that affect people today. Ninety percent of individuals will experience acute back pain sometime in their lives, while 10 % will have chronic low back pain.

MET is an important tool that can be used by trained professionals to aid in the treatment of LBP, which is currently particularly crucial due to the marked potential abuse of opioid medications. Opioids do not address the underlying somatic dysfunction causing LBP and serve to only mask pain. MET provides pain reduction by addressing the root of the problem, which is the misalignment and inappropriate proprioception of the spine, surrounding musculature, and other associated soft tissues. MET is used to realign spinal segments and allow relaxation of musculature and other associated soft tissues. This is accomplished by gently placing spinal segments back intoÂ anatomic alignment using the body's own muscular system. Employing this procedure improves the flexibility of muscles, fascia, and joints. It also decreases pain, increases circulation, and augments lymphatic drainage of the region being treated.

Misalignment of the lumbar spine and the associated spinal tissues is a known cause of non-specific LBP.
