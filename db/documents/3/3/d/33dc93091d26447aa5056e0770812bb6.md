Postoperative management of the child with bladder exstrophy is extremely crucial. Firstly, it includes postoperative analgesia and parenteral medications. The immediate pain is managed by the epidural analgesia. Intravenous analgesia may be required for a longer duration as the child may suffer pain from the traction and immobilization. Enteral feeds can be started as soon as the child is fully awake. Care must be taken to maintain the immobilization of the lower extremities. Secondly, whether an osteotomy is performed or not, immobilization of the lower extremities is generally preferred by most of the pediatric surgeons. For osteotomy, a 4-week period of external fixation is generally recommended.

Thirdly, the postoperative introduction of anticholinergic medications to maintain the relaxed state of the detrusor and to avoid detrusor spasms might help. Finally, care must be taken to maintain the indwelling drains and catheter to ensure optimal outcomes. Following discharge, it is important to ensure a regular follow-up. Follow-up investigations to ensure upper tract preservation, including Ultrasound KUB, micturating cystourethrography (MCUG), and renal scintigraphy studies, must be performed. Lower tract function should be assessed by the urodynamic study.
