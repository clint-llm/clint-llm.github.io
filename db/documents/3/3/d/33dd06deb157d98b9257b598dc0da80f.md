- Rosacea presents as inflammatory papules and pustules, primarily of the central face, including the nose. Patients often have accompanying telangiectatic erythema with flushing. Many authors view perioral dermatitis as a variant of rosacea, as the 2 conditions typically respond to the same therapies. Clinically, this is distinguished from acne vulgaris by the lack of comedones which are characteristic of acne.

- Acne vulgaris presents as inflammatory papules, pustules, cysts, and comedones primarily on the face, but may also affect the chest and back. Patients may have flares of acne secondary to mechanical mechanisms, such as from a helmet chin strap. The distribution of involvement may mimic perioral dermatitis. Adult female acne is characterized by inflammatory papules of the chin and jawline and can have a similar distribution as perioral dermatitis.

- Sarcoidosis can also manifest features similar to rosacea and perioral dermatitis with red-brown papules on periorificial regions of the face. Typically, lesions of sarcoidosis are more widespread and can occur on other locations of the skin, and patients often have symptoms of systemic sarcoidosis. A biopsy is helpful in distinguishing sarcoidosis.

- Seborrheic dermatitis presents as ill-defined erythematous patches with greasy scale distributed on the eyebrows, glabella, paranasal skin, nasolabial folds, beard, scalp, and chest.

- Allergic contact dermatitis can also be considered but tends to present with ill-defined scaling macules, patches, and plaques with possible lichenification. If patients with perioral dermatitis do not improve with conventional treatments, patch testing should be considered to rule out allergic contact dermatitis from skincare or oral care products.

- Irritant cheilitis, such as lip licker's cheilitis, presents with erythema and scaling of the cutaneous lip. This typically also affects the vermillion lip and does not spare the vermillion border. In contrast, the vermillion border is spared in perioral dermatitis.

- Demodex folliculitis presents with scattered erythematous facial papules and pustules. Demodex mites have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rosacea. Unroofing of the pustules followed by microscopy of the purulent material shows numerous Demodex.

- Tinea faciei presents with erythematous scaling papules and annular plaques and can be ruled out by performing a KOH prep and microscopic examination of the scale.

- Syringomas and other cutaneous adnexal neoplasms also can mimic perioral dermatitis as these lesions are flesh-colored to erythematous facial papules. A biopsy is helpful for diagnosis.
