Chronic coronary occlusion has a wide spectrum, ranging from subtotal to total coronary involvement. Management of CTO shouldÂ involve an interprofessional team that includes interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, radiology, primary care, nursing staff, and pharmacists. The diagnosis is made by clinical/laboratory findings and angiography. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of the disease, which includes lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting.
