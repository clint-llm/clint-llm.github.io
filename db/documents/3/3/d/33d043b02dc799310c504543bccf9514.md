The evaluation of immediate hypersensitivity includes complete blood cell count, assessment of immunoglobulins, skin prick test, and detection of autoantibodies.

**Quantitative Serum Immunoglobulins**

- IgG (involved in Type II and III HR)

- IgM (involved in Type II and III HR)

- IgE (elevated in allergic diseases)

**Total Leukocyte Count and Differential**

- Hemoglobin (decreased in autoimmune hemolytic anemia)

- Neutrophils (decreased in autoimmune neutropenia)

- Lymphocytes (decreased in autoimmune lymphopenia)

- Platelets (decreased in immune thrombocytopenia)

**Autoimmunity Studies**

- Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA, present in systemic autoimmune disorders, such as SLE and RA)

- Detection of specific auto-immune antibodies for systemic disorders, e.g., anti-ds DNA, rheumatoid factor, anti-histones, anti-Smith, anti-(SS-A), and anti-(SS-B)

- Detection of anti-RBC, antiplatelet, and anti-neutrophil antibodies

- Testing for organ-specific auto-immune antibodies, e.g., the anti-islet cell autoantibody that is present in diabetes mellitus

- Coombs test (positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemia)

**Allergic Test**

- Skin prick tests using various allergens from animals, plants, foods, pathogens, and environmental pollutants

- Radioallergosorbent test (RAST): Use to determine specific IgE antibodies
