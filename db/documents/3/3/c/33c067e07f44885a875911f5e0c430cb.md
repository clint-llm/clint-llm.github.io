Lateral ankle instability is a complex condition that can, at times, prove difficult to evaluate and treat for general practitioners. The difficulty in evaluation and treatment is due in part to the ankle complex is composed of three joints: talocrural, subtalar, and tibiofibular syndesmosis. All three joints function in conjunction to allow complex motions of the ankle joint. The main contributors to the stability of the ankle joint are the articular surfaces, the ligamentous complex and the musculature - which allows for the dynamic stabilization of the joints. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of lateral ankle instability, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the various possible pathophysiologies and mechanisms of injury leading to lateral ankle instability.
- Review the necessary elements for an examination to assess for lateral ankle instability, including necessary imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for lateral ankle instability, including both conservative and surgical care.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the diagnosis as well as delivery of care for patients with lateral ankle instability.
