To perform the supratrochlear nerve block, the required equipment includes:

- 3 to 10 mL syringe

- 25 to 30 gauge hypodermic needle

- The local anesthetic choice depends on the desired time of anesthesia and patientsâ€™ allergies (i.e., lidocaine, bupivacaine, diphenhydramine, etc.)

- Skin preparing agent, i.e., alcohol or chlorhexidine wipes

- Lipid emulsion for the systemic overdose of local anesthetic (although it is unlikely to be needed as the amount required for the block is orders of magnitude less than what is generally thought to cause overdose)
