There are several ways to ventilate a patient, and the pulmonologist or the intensivist makes that decision. No other healthcare professional should make changes to the ventilator settings without first getting approval from the physician in charge. In most hospitals, the respiratory therapist will be in charge of the ventilator and will be the one to make changes in the ventilator settings when required physically. The nurse monitoring the patient should be familiar with the ventilator settings, the alarms, and what they mean. When a ventilator setting is made, it has to be noted in the chart. Coordination by the interprofessional team will improve outcomes. [Level 5]
