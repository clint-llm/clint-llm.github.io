Caroli disease was first described in 1958 by Dr. Jacques Caroli, a French gastroenterologist who saw "nonobstructive saccular or fusiform multifocal segmental dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts." It is now known as a genetic disorder involving the PKHD1 gene (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1), which affects a protein called fibrocystin. This protein is expressed in multiple organ systems: the renal tubular cells, liver cholangiocytes, and the pancreas. Genetic abnormalities in this protein result in fibrocystic changes in the kidney and liver. Caroli disease is frequently seen with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).
