Teamwork is key in the successful management of brain tumors. Full and detailed education of families and involvement in the decision-making process as appropriate is vital. The treatment protocols are usually discussed at multidisciplinary meetings to explore the best treatment options available and the expected prognosis of the patient. Support and counseling to the family during treatment makes a big difference. Genetic testing and profiling are offered on certain occasions for families to help in prognosis and future family planning.
