Two techniques are described for endometrial ablation: resectoscopic and non-resectoscopic. Both techniques insert a device into the endometrial cavity and use different methods or energy to injury the endometrial lining.

**First Generation Technique**

Resectoscopic Endometrial Ablation

This technique is performed under hysteroscopic guidance using a rollerball, monopolar, or bipolar loop electrode. The endometrium is desiccated to the level of the basalis layer using thermal energy. The major disadvantage to resectoscopic endometrial ablation is operator expertise and safety.

**Second Generation Techniques**

Nonresectoscopic Systems

Many devices that do not require the use of a resectoscope are currently available to accomplish the destruction of the endometrium. The devices used are global and treat the whole endometrial cavity. Second-generation techniques include thermal fluid, microwave or bipolar radiofrequency electrical energy, laser thermotherapy, and cryoablation.
