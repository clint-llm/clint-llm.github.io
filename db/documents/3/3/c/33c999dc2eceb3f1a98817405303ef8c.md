Whenever there is a possible outbreak of avian influenza, the essential way to reduce the severity and population impact are to reduce the spread of the virus. Since human-to-human transmission is uncommon, the focus should be on reinforcing appropriate sanitation habits in the population, especially those that work around birds or that are involved in food preparation.

When an outbreak is identified, it is crucial for public health officials to identify at-risk populations and to inform the public of risk factors and ways to detect infection. Because the presence of deadly diseases in a community can incite fear and panic, announcements should include which populations are at low risk for contracting avian influenza. Those people who work with live or dead birds, including those who may handle poultry at restaurants, should be aware of symptoms of bird flu in themselves and co-workers and should be given directions for contacting local health officials and information for how toÂ undergo evaluation if suspicion of infection is high.
