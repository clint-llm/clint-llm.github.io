The knee has three compartments: medial, lateral, and patellofemoral. The medial compartment is the articulation between the medial condyle of the femur and the medial aspect of the tibial plateau. The lateral compartment is the articulation between the lateral femoral condyle and the lateral aspect of the tibial plateau. The patellofemoral compartment is the articulation between the patella and the trochlear groove of the femur. A patient can develop arthritis in one, two, or all three of these compartments. The alignment of the limb is one factor that can determine the location of osteoarthritis development. Patients with varus (or bow-legged) malalignment will have greater contact stresses in the medial compartment of the knee and be more likely to develop medial compartment arthritis. Patients with valgus (or knock-kneed) malalignment will be more likely to develop arthritis in the lateral compartment.
