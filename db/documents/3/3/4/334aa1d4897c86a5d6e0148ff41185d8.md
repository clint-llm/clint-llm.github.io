Dental caries is a term that refers to both the disease and the resulting lesion. The caries process occurs in the biofilm, which is permanently active with every pH fluctuation

Dental caries occurs when the biofilm microbiota that normally resides in the oral cavity in homeostasis change to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic population due to the frequent consumption of sugars.

Therefore, dental caries is considered a dietary-microbial disease  that requires a cariogenic biofilm and regular exposure to fermentable carbohydrates (glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose) from the diet.

Behavioral, psychological, and social factors also play a significant role in the disease process.
