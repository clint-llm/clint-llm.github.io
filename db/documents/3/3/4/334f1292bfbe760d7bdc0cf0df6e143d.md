Sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia (SANRT) is a rare form of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force defines sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia as a focal atrial tachycardia due to micro-reentry circuits arising from the sinus node. Electrocardiogram features of SANRT include P wave morphology similar to that seen in sinus tachycardia, frequent premature atrial complexes toward the beginning or end of the tachycardia, abrupt onset and termination, and heart rate that is usually between 100 to 150 beats per minute. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia and the role of interprofessional team members in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review epidemiological factors associated with development of sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia.
- Describe the electrocardiogram features of sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia.
- Describe symptoms or signs that should prompt evaluation for sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of sinoatrial nodal reentrant tachycardia and improve outcomes.
