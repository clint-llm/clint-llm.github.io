The following are contraindications to scopolamine:

- Hypersensitivity to the medication or a component of the drug delivery system

- Glaucoma

- Urinary retention

- Pregnancy

Although one study mentions pregnancy as a contraindication for scopolamine in one study, another study indicates that although the scopolamine crosses the placenta, itâ€™s considered nonteratogenic.
