PNIs can result in considerable complications for the patients. These complications may be disabling and long-lasting or even irreversible. The most prominent direct complications include chronic pain, hyperesthesia, cold intolerance, and motor or sensory loss to an extremity, potentially compromising its function. However, the impact of such injuries can go beyond the physical aspect alone. Disabilities caused by PNIs can lead to loss of employment and additional financial obligations (e.g., caregivers). They can also have an adverse psychological impact and decrease the quality of life.
