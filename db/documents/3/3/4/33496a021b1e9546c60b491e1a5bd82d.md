The initial treatment for ulnar nerve compression at the wrist is conservative. Modalities such as rest, anti-inflammatory medication, avoiding pressure on the canal, and splinting can be tried to treat the condition non-surgically. Should symptoms be recalcitrant to conservative management, surgery is indicated. Other instances when surgery might be indicated would be when evidence of moderate-to-severe pathology is present. Examples of this include but are not limited to: extrinsic compression from masses such as a ganglion cyst, tumor, accessory hypothenar muscles, fractures (distal ulna or carpal bones), ulnar muscle atrophy or weakness (indicating denervation), or ulnar artery thrombosis.

When evidence of compression of the ulnar nerve at Guyon canal is present, the goal of surgical intervention is to relieve the compressing factor. Common causes of compression of the ulnar artery in the ulnar tunnel are the volar carpal ligament, palmaris brevis muscle, and accessory fibers from the hypothenar muscles. When a clear cause of pathology can be identified, for example, a fracture or mass, surgical intervention shouldÂ be directed toward reduction, fixation, and/or mass removal.
