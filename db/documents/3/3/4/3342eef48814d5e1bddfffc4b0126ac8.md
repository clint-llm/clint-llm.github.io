The pelvic bones, and the girdle made by them, house nerves from the lumbar and sacral plexuses. Nerves of the lumbar plexus contained in the pelvis include the genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, and femoral nerves. The genitofemoral pierces through the psoas muscle posterior-to-anterior to reach the genital region on the anterior face of the pelvis. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve leaves the spine and transverses the pelvis exiting under the anterior brim of the crest of the ilium to reach the thigh. The obturator nerve descends medially to the psoas to leave the pelvis through the obturator foramen. The femoral nerve runs between the psoas and the iliacus, emerging from the pelvis above the pubis to continue into the anterior thigh.

Sacral plexus nerves of the pelvis include the sciatic, superior, and inferior gluteal, posterior femoral, and pudendal nerves. The first four of these nerves all leave the pelvis traveling under the greater sciatic notch, serving innervations on the posterior gluteal and thigh regions. The superior gluteal nerve gives innervations to the gluteus minimus and medius, while the inferior gluteal innervated the gluteus maximus, which extends the hip.Â The pudendal nerve travels within the pelvic girdle, sending interventions to various sphincters and genitalia structures. This nerve commonly gets injured during the vaginal delivery of children.
