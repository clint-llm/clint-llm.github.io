The definition of a flap is a piece of tissue with a defined blood supply, which differentiates it from a graft, where a piece of tissue is freed from any defined blood supply and re-planted to be absorbed into the native tissue surrounding it. The first flaps were performed in 600 BC by the ancient Indian physician Sushruta who utilized regional flaps for nasal reconstruction after amputation. Unlike skin grafts, or other grafts, which rely on the vascularity of the recipient wound bed for survival, flaps describe a larger amount of tissue with its own blood supply. Through anatomic studies, improved technology, and wartime injuries, flap reconstruction evolved to address complex traumatic and oncologic defects.
