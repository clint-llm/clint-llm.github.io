The differential diagnosis initially is quite broad as patients often present with flank pain but may only have a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Isolated abdominal pain should include an appropriate workup with attention also given to the renal function. In the absence of identified gastrointestinal pathology, a renal cause of the pain may provide an explanation. Certainly, nephrolithiasis, as well as pyelonephritis, should be considered.
