Pathoanatomic components relate to the imbalance between the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles. Weakened intrinsic muscles lead to a loss of MCP flexion and a loss of interphalangeal (IP) extension. Strong extrinsic muscles will lead to an unopposed extension of the MCP joints. The flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles not innervated by the ulnar nerve remain strong and lead to unopposed flexion of the PIP and DIP joints.
