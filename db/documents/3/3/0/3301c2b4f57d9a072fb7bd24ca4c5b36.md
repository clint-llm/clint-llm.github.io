Pericardiocentesis is a life-saving procedure. Failure to perform the procedure when indicated will result in pericardial tamponade and death.

Over the years, several methods have been used to differentiate the fluid from the pericardium and the cardiac cavity. None is perfect, and one must use clinical judgment. If the aspirated fluid forms a lot, then the fluid is from a cardiac chamber, whereas pericardial fluid does not clot. The pericardial fluid should have a lower hematocrit or hemoglobin level compared to the blood. If an intracardiac injection of fluorescein is performed, then one may see the fluorescein in the conjunctiva.

If the heart chamber has been entered with the needle, one should pull out the needle and observe the patient. In most cases, there will be no leakage of blood into the pericardial cavity. However, if the pericardium starts to accumulate blood, a cardiac surgeon should be notified right away. Closing a hole in the myocardium while the heart is beating requires skill, and the most important thing is not to occlude any nearby coronary artery.
