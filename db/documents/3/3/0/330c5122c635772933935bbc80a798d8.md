The basic steps involved in an ultrasound-guided thyroid nodule FNA include the following:

- The transducer is placed over the target nodule in the transverse (axial) plane.

- The patient is directed to remain stationary and refrain from speaking.

- The needle is placed just above the transducer and advanced through the marked skin site, either parallel or perpendicular to the transducer.

- The needle is advanced to the nodule and moved to and fro multiple times through the nodule.

Nonaspiration technique involves performing this maneuver without suction, with capillary action allowing the collection of the specimen within the needle hub. Aspiration technique allows for specimen acquisition via operator application of gentle suction during the to and fro maneuver. Although nonaspiration technique has occasionally been shown to be superior to the aspiration technique, two meta-analysis studies revealed no significant difference between the two.
