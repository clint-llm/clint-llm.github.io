Class 1 dysfunction is the result of nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutation, which leads to premature termination of the mRNA sequence. This fails to translate the genetic information into a protein product with a subsequent total absence of CFTR protein, and approximately 2% to 5% of cystic fibrosis cases result.

Class 2 dysfunction results in abnormal post-translational processing of the CFTR protein. This step in protein processing is essential for the proper intracellular transit of the protein. As a result, CFTR is unable to be moved to the correct cellular location.

Class 3 dysfunction is characterized by diminished protein activity in response to intracellular signaling. The result is a fully formed protein channel in the cellular membrane that is non-functional.

Class 4 dysfunction is when the protein is produced and correctly localized to the cell surface. However, the rate of chloride ion flow and the duration of channel activation after stimulation is decreased from normal.

Class 5 dysfunction is the net decreased concentration of CFTR channels in the cellular membrane as a result of rapid degradation by cellular processes. It includes mutations that alter the stability of mRNA and others that alter the stability of the mature CFTR protein.

The result of all mutations is decreased secretion of chloride and consequently increased resorption of sodium into the cellular space. The increased sodium reabsorption leads to increased water resorption and manifests as thicker mucus secretions on epithelial linings and more viscous secretions from exocrine tissues. Thickened mucus secretions in nearly every organ system involved result in mucous plugging with obstruction pathologies. The most commonly affected organs include the sinuses, lungs, pancreas, biliary and hepatic systems, intestines, and sweat glands.

Sinus disease occurs when secretion viscosity increases which obstruct the sinus ostia. Additional processes often exist here. These include ciliary dysfunction, increased inflammatory mediators, and increased bacterial colonization with pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The result of this syndrome is impaired sinus secretion clearance. Subsequently, chronic sinusitis occurs, and secondary structural damage may occur.

Lung disease occurs as a spectrum obstruction from thickened mucous secretion. It is important to note that the lungs of a CF patient are normal in utero, at birth, and after birth. Disease results as a cascade effect following infection and the subsequent inflammatory process. Mucus plugging in the bronchioles results in an obstructive lung disease clinical picture. As a result of obstruction, an environment optimal for bacterial growth is created within the airways. Bronchiectasis and further thick purulent sputum production occur.  Part of the inflammatory reaction includes the production of the neutrophil interleukin-8 from epithelial cells, which functions as a secretagogue, increasing mucous secretion, thereby creating a positive feedback loop of mucous secretion with persistence of inflammation, infection, and structural damage. The result of this cascade is obstruction of the airways with the resulting failure of ventilation of the lung. Poorly managed pulmonary manifestations are the primary cause of death in patients with CF.

Pancreatic manifestations of CF are due in large part to obstruction of the pancreatic ductules by thickened secretions. On the passage of gastric contents into the proximal duodenum, the pancreatic exocrine glands are triggered to excrete pancreatic enzymes into the luminal space of the small intestines. However, increased viscosity of excretions and obstruction of the pancreatic ductules inhibits this process. The net pH of the secretions lessens due to decreased sodium bicarbonate composition lending to a lesser neutralization of the acidic stomach chyme. The lower pH chyme effectively degrades what pancreatic enzymes reach the intestinal lumen. As a result, intestinal chyme is not enzymatically processed in the intestines resulting in the pathognomonic greasy stools, colicky abdominal pain, and malabsorption of nutrients from foods. Specifically, fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K are notably deficient.

Furthermore, autodigestion of the pancreas may occur as these enzymes target the pancreatic tissues. This results in pancreatitis. In severe, chronic cases, this can lead to endocrine pancreatic failure when the islets of Langerhans begin to be digested by trapped pancreatic enzymes. The lasting impacts of this spectrum of disease mimic type-1 diabetes mellitus.

Increased secretion viscosity does not spare the biliary and hepatic systems. The biliary ductules may be plugged with secretions. Obstructive cirrhosis and post-hepatic hyperbilirubinemia can occur. Secondary to this, esophageal varices, splenomegaly, and hypersplenism may occur as a result of increased hepatic portal vein pressures. Gallbladder disease is more likely to occur as a spectrum of this manifestation of CF, with up to 15% of those with cystic fibrosis having gallstones.

Intestinal involvement is typically seen in children with meconium ileus at birth and intestinal obstruction later in life. The cause of meconium ileus is multifactorial. Likely, it is due to increased fluid absorption as a result of the faulty CFTR channel with dehydration of the intestinal contents leading to constipation coupled with a change in luminal contents from normal secondary to pancreatic insufficiency as discussed above.  Mechanical obstruction chronically leads to inflammation and eventual scarring and stricture formation. This may lead to further intestinal obstruction by fecal impaction or intussusception later in life.

Sweat glands offer an interesting contrast to all other tissues containing CFTR channels in that the flow of chloride is reversed.  Normally, sweat glands move chloride from the extracellular space into the intracellular space. Thus, sodium and water are reabsorbed from the sweat gland tissues into the body. However, failure of the chloride channel to reabsorb chloride leads to a loss of sodium onto the skin surface and a subsequent fluid loss. This causes the pathognomonic salty skin seen with cystic fibrosis. In prolonged or warm environments or more severe cases, this may lead to hyponatremic dehydration.

In addition to acting as a chloride transport protein, other interactions of CFTR have been postulated. In the apical plasma membrane, CFTR is part of a multiprotein assembly where three of its amino acids, threonine, arginine, and leucine, act to root the protein to a region known as PDZ-type receptors. These PDZ regions have been observed to occur in multiple intracellular signaling proteins associated with the plasma membrane as well. This also roots CFTR closely to other transporters, ion channels, receptors, kinases, phosphatases, signaling molecules, and cytoskeletal elements. These interactions between CFTR and its binding proteins have been shown to be critically involved in regulating CFTR-mediated transepithelial ion transport in vitro and in vivo. It seems that these close associations may allow for CFTR to play an essential role in epithelial cells beyond as an ion channel. While not yet fully understood, modulation of CFTR in animal studies proved that inflammatory responses, maturational processing, non-chloride ion transport, and intracellular signaling are related to its function. These other interacting proteins are potential modifiers of the cystic fibrosis phenotype and may help explain the substantial differences in clinical severity between similar genotypic patients with CF.
