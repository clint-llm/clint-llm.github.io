In normal fetal development, melanocytes (derived from neural crest cells) are present in the dermis of the embryo by ten weeks gestational age and migrate to the epidermis between weeks 11 to 14 of gestation. No melanocytes shouldÂ remain in the dermal layer by week 20 of gestation via migration or macrophage clearance. In congenital dermal melanocytosis, melanocytes remain in the dermis and actively produce melanin. The blue-gray color of affected skin can be explained by the Tyndall effect, where dermal melanin scatters the shorter wavelengths of light (blue light), which reflect to the skin surface. An extracellular fibrous sheath protects the dermal melanocytes. However, this sheath becomes gradually lost and destroyed during fetal life and early childhood.
