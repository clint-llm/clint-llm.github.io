A tracheostomy provides a secure, durable airway for prolonged mechanical ventilatory support in patients. It can also provide a means of the pulmonary toilet in individuals unable to clear secretions. Quality of life issues, as well as end-of-life issues, should be addressed preoperatively with the patient or surrogates before proceeding, especially in the terminally ill and elderly. Tracheostomy aerosolizes respiratory particles from the patient to a higher degree than many other surgeries, and in cases of virulent airborne pathogens (tuberculosis, COVID-19, etc.), special precautions should be taken to protect operating room staff.
