Physical therapy is mandatory. In the case of conservative treatment, occupational therapy should begÂ¡n right after cast removal. If ORIF is the preferred method, therapy should begin after a 3-week immobilization protocol. Hook excisions may start early therapy. Rehabilitation protocol should last 4 to 6 weeks.
