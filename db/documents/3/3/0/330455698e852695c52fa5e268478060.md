The international consensus diagnostic criteria (ICDC) for autoimmune pancreatitis include imaging of the pancreas and pancreatic duct, serologic studies including IgG4 levels, histopathology, as well as the presence of other associated conditions.

Imaging of biliary and pancreatic systems can be done with a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which also helps to evaluate for alternate diagnoses. MRI scans along with cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) are generally considered superior to evaluate for size, textures, enhancement with contrast as well as the presence of strictures.
