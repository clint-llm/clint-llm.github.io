Hyperacute lung transplant rejection is mostly caused by preformed antibodies in the recipient against the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) of the donor.

Acute cellular rejection can be caused by both T-lymphocyte mediated (acute cellular rejection), and antibody-mediated reaction directed against major histocompatibility complex antigens in the donor's lung and usually occurs within the first year of transplant.

Chronic lung transplant rejection usually has no clear single identifiable etiology, and experts relate it to multiple processes contributing to each other. Contributing conditions could be recurrent subclinical acute rejection episodes, transplant infection, and aspiration with gastroesophageal reflux disease.

**Probable Risk Factors**

- Acute rejection

- Lymphocytic bronchitis

- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis

- Medication non-compliance

**Potential Risk Factors**

- CMV infection without pneumonitis

- Organizing pneumonia

- Bacterial, fungal, or non-CMV viral infection

- Older donor age

- Large graft ischemic time

- Donor antigen-specific reactivity

**Hypothetical Risk Factors**

- Underlying disease

- HLA-mismatching

- Genotype of recipient

- Gastroesophageal reflux with aspiration
