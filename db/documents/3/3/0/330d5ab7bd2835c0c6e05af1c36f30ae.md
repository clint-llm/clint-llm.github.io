Chlamydia is unique among bacteria, having an infectious cycle and two developmental forms. These include the infectious form called the elementary body (EB) and the reticulate body (RB). The EB is metabolically inactive and is taken up by host cells. Within the host cell, the EB will differentiate into the metabolically active RB. The RB will then use host energy sources and amino acids to replicate and form new EB, which can then infect additional cells. C. trachomatis targets the squamocolumnar epithelial cells of the endocervix and upper genital tract in women, and the conjunctiva, urethra, and rectum in both men and women.

The bacterium is transmitted through direct contact with infected tissue, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex, and can even be passed from an infected mother to the newborn during childbirth.
