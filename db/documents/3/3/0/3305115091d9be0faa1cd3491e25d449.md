Provide resuscitation based on advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols.

- Maintain cervical spine spinal immobilization and minimize neck movement particularly during transport

- Provide adequate pain relief

- Further management depends on the severity of the injury

Minor fractures to the cervical spine without neurological deficits can be treated with conservative management of pain management, brace, and follow-up. If the cervical injury is unstable, surgical intervention may be warranted. The surgical intervention will vary, depending on the injury. The fusion of the cervical vertebrae may be warranted with or without internal fixation with metal plates and screws. Sub-axial fractures are often stabilized with internal fixation, whereas axial fractures often require external fixation with a halo, with external pins stabilizing the vertebrae. For decompression of the spine, surgical removal of a portion may be necessary if there is compression of the spinal cord or nerve. This can be a laminectomy, laminoplasty, foraminotomy, discectomy or other techniques. The main goal of treatment is to decompress the spinal cord and stabilize the spine.
