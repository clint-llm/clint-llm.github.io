Tonsil cancer is the most common form of oropharyngeal malignancy, and its incidence is sharply rising due to the increasing prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers. The presence of HPV can dramatically alter the prognosis of tonsillar cancer, and there have recently been significant changes made to the World Health Organization classification and TNM staging system to reflect this. Tonsil cancer can be managed by both surgical and oncologic approaches, although the optimal treatment regimen remains an area of ongoing research. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tonsil cancer and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify when tonsil cancer should be considered on differential diagnosis. 
- Identify risk factors for tonsil cancer. 
- Outline management strategies for tonsil cancer. 
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of tonsil cancer and improve patient outcomes.
