The underlying mechanism for EGGCT is not entirely understood. Two theories have been proposed explaining the origin of these tumors, but clinical evidence is not sufficient and precise explanation of etiology is still controversial. The first theory states that during embryonic development, aberrant migration of primordial germ cells occurs, leading to their arrest in the midline locations of the body. Another hypothesis argues that reverse migration of germ cells occurs from gonad to other locations with subsequent development of the tumor. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing has identified isochromosome 12p to be more common in testicular seminoma.

Next-generation sequencing has identified several mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of intracranial GCT. Germinoma is found to be associated with the gain of function mutation in the tyrosine kinase receptor gene (c-KIT). Other pertinent findings are mutations in KRAS/ NRAS proteins, which are downstream regulators in the c-Kit receptor pathway. In addition, methylation profiling shows pure germinomas to be hypomethylated, a finding similar to the primordial germ cells, denoting the same origin.
