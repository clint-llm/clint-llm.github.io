Managing traumatic pelvic fractures requires an interprofessional team approach. The emergency medicine and trauma surgery teams should recognize the risk factors for pelvic fractures and involve the orthopedic teams early when fractures are identified. Potential complications should be common knowledge for the teams involved, allowing for early detection. Physical and occupational therapy should be involved early. Pelvic trauma patients truly do require an interprofessional team to achieve the best results.
