QT prolongation increases the risk of torsades de pointes, a potentially lethal arrhythmia. Torsades de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; it is initiated when a premature ventricular contraction occurs in the setting of a prolonged QT interval. This is known as the "R on T" phenomenon.

The clinical feature of this arrhythmia is often syncope. However, it can be asymptomatic. If it degenerates into ventricular fibrillation, death is the likely outcome if there is no intervention.
