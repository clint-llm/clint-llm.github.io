Researchers believe that cognitions and a wide range of emotions might play a major role in having NES. Most symptoms occur at night due to the belief that the individual can not sleep without eating. Patients also will feel a need to control the anxiety associated with that belief through eating.

A study was done by Birketvedt and colleagues on 33 participants, 12 with NES and 21 control subjects. The subjects were fed regular intervals of meals over a 24-hour period and given no food after 8:00 pm.
