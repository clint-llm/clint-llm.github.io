Variation in the SIA anatomy appears when considering both origin and distribution. Though the SIA historically originates from the costocervical trunk, it can also arise from the thyrocervical trunk. Branches of the thyrocervical trunk have also been reported to be the site of origination, including the dorsal scapular artery and the inferior thyroid artery. The SIA has also been described to arise from the aortic arch, axillary artery, second intercostal artery, and vertebral artery. When originating from the vertebral artery, the SIA is described to course through the transverse foramen of the seventh cervical vertebra, after which it courses inferiorly and then posterior to the ribs. In 72% of cases, research shows that the SIA supplies the first and second intercostal spaces, while in 20% of cases, it supplies only the first intercostal space, and in 8% of cases, it supplies both second and third spaces. Reports describe the SIA being minuscule in size when only supplying the first intercostal space.
