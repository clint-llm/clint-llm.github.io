Duodenal trauma is a rare and potentially life-threatening injury. Both the diagnosis and management can be particularly difficult. These injuries are often found in a late stage and can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

The duodenum is the first and smallest segment of the small bowel. The entire length only measures about 20 to 30 cm.duodeni, meaning “twelve each,” in reference to its approximately 12-fingerbreadth length.

The duodenum is composed of four distinct portions.

The duodenum is unique in that it is both a peritoneal and retroperitoneal organ. D1 is primarily intraperitoneal. The distal aspect of D1, D2, and D3 are then retroperitoneal. D4 returns to the peritoneum.

Functionally, the duodenum is the site for mixing the pancreatic and biliary fluids with gastric efflux.
