To determine proper maintenance dosages, the patientâ€™s blood pressure requires daily monitoring. Benazepril efficacy diminishes after 12 to 19 hours, so blood pressure monitoring should be planned accordingly.

The renal function is monitored by regular checkups of serum creatinine, BUN, and potassium. In patients with renal dysfunction, evaluation of baseline kidney function should take place before treatment and afterward at two-week intervals for three months after initiation of treatment.
