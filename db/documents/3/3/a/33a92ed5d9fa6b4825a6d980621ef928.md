There is no specific treatment for Sturge-Weber syndrome. The primary aim is to minimize seizure activity with anticonvulsive medications. Surgery may be considered in patients who fail medical management and continue to have refractory seizures. The surgical procedures for Sturge-Weber syndrome include hemispherectomy or focal resection of the seizure focus. Patients with bilateral involvement are typically not good candidates for surgery.
