Coarctation is found in 6% to 8% of patients with congenital heart disease or approximately 0.06% to 0.08% of the general population. Coarctation of the aorta accounts for a percentage of children diagnosed with systemic hypertension. Patients with Turner syndrome (XO) have an increased risk of left-sided obstructed heart disease that includes isolated coarctation, and karyotype screening is recommended for females with the diagnosis of coarctation. Bicuspid aortic valve is commonly associated with coarctation of the aorta. Offspring and other first-degree relatives diagnosed with an obstructive left-sided cardiac lesion are at ten times the risk of coarctation and other cardiac lesions.
