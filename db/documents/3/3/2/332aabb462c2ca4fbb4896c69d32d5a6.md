There are three primary nerves that the inferior alveolar provides perfusion. These three arteries are:

- Inferior alveolar nerve

- Mental nerve

- Mylohyoid nerve

As the inferior alveolar artery descends toward the mandibular foramen, it gives off a branch called the mylohyoid artery. The mylohyoid artery descends into the mylohyoid fossa and joins the mylohyoid nerve. Both the mylohyoid artery and nerve travels toward the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. While the inferior alveolar artery course through the mandibular foramen, it follows closely with the inferior alveolar nerve. As the inferior alveolar artery and nerve approach the mental foramen. Both the inferior alveolar artery and nerve will become the mental artery and nerve as they exit the mental foramen. These are the primary nerves that mainly receive blood from the inferior alveolar nerve, but the collateral circulation in the face is so vast. That these nerves will also be perfused from other arteries in the face, neck, and head via collateral blood flow.
