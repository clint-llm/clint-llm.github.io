If toxic adenoma or multinodular goiter is causing this disease, then surgical resection and radioactive iodine ablation are the mainstays of treatment. Thyroidectomy is preferred if a patient has compressive symptoms. Patients who refuse ablation or have contraindications to surgery can be treated with long-term antithyroid medicines.

Grave's disease with intrathoracic mass causes severe compressive symptoms, and thyroidectomy is preferred in these cases. Thyroidectomy has other adverse effects, like recurrent laryngeal nerve damage and hypoparathyroidism.
