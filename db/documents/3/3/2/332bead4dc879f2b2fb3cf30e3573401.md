Most cases of serotonin syndrome will resolve completely within 24 to 72 hours without sequelae if recognized and treated with removal of the precipitating agent and appropriate supportive care. Patients who are asymptomatic 6 to 8 hours following an overdose are unlikely to develop significant toxicity. SSRIs are rarely associated with death, even in overdose, when used alone. Most fatalities associated with SSRIs are due to co-ingestion with other drugs. Fatalities, when they occur, tend to happen within the first 24 hours and are more likely in patients on MAOIs than SSRIs.
