To deliver safe and effective patient care in dynamic work environments, healthcare practitioners must employ highly organized, team-based strategies. Crisis resource management consists of a set of teamwork principles that can be utilized to avert and mitigate medical crises. CRM can be summarized through the following eight teamwork behaviors: leadership, communication, anticipation and planning, resource utilization, workload distribution, situational awareness, triage and prioritization, and management of disruptions. It is clear that simulation-based CRM training improves the cognitive and interpersonal behaviors of medical professionals in simulated settings. There is also a growing body of evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of CRM training programs in enhancing team performance and reducing adverse patient outcomes in the real-life clinical workplace. As such, simulation-based CRM training is an essential component of educational initiatives aimed at improving healthcare delivery and patient safety.
