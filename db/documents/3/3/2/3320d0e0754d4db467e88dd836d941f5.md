Patients treated for plasmacytoma need lifelong follow-up. Evaluation is done at a six-week interval for the first six months, and clinical visits are prolonged after that.

NCCN recommends yearly imaging for five years by the same techniques used at diagnosis. Patients with SPB and EMP are also recommended for follow-up evaluation with orthopedics and ear, nose, throat department, respectively.
