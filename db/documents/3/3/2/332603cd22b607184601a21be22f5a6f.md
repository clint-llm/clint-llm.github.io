Venous obstruction is partial or complete occlusion of the lumen of a vein. It can lead to decreased venous flow and increased blood pooling. Venous stasis results in increased viscosity and the formation of microthrombi which may be caused by anything that slows or obstructs the flow of venous blood. One of the most common causes is damage to the intima of the endothelium secondary to intrinsic or external trauma. The most common medically relevant type of venous thrombosis is deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities. Another less common but important presentation of venous obstruction is primary thrombosis of the portal vein. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of venous obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of venous obstruction.
- Describe the common presentation of venous obstruction.
- Describe the management of venous obstruction.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with venous obstruction.
