The spinal cord is about 45 cm shorter than the spinal canal in the adult. It ends at L1 in 50% of the adults and L2 in about 40%. In the newborn, it goes down to L2-L3. Below this level, the lumbar and sacral nerves converge to form the cauda equine. The spinal cord is suspended in Cerebrospinal Fluid and surrounded by the arachnoid membrane. The arachnoid (and subarachnoid space) extends caudally in the adult to S2, to S3 in children, and S4 in the newborn. The arachnoid is close to the dura mater. The dura is attached to the spine by its outer endosteal portion. It envelopes the brain intracranially, the spine, and it also extends out through the foramina intervertebralia to the epineural connective tissues of the spinal nerves. The spinal epidural space contains fatty and connective tissues as well as vessels and lymph channels. These vessels may dilate with gravidity or ascites, which increase the likelihood of bloody puncture. The distance between the skin and the epidural space is variable depending on factors like age or weight. It may be 4 cm in normal-weight adults to 8 cm or more in obese patients. The epidural space has a dorsal limitation by the ligamentum flavum. More superficially, the remaining layers are the ligamentum interspinale (located between the spinous processes), ligamentum supraspinale (located on the surface of the spinous processes), subcutaneous tissue, and skin.
