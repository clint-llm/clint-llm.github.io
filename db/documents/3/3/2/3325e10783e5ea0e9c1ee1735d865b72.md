The therapeutic approach of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is based on several factors, such as the age of patients, the extent of disease, potential toxicities, and survivorship.

**1. Induction Therapy**

**Nasal Disease (Stage I–II)**

Patients with nasal disease (stage I–II) may be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) regimens such as DeVIC (dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) with radiation therapy (RT), or VIPD (etoposide, ifosfamide, cisplatin, dexamethasone) with RT.

**Nasal Disease (Stage IV) and Extranasal Disease (Stage I–IV)**

Pegaspargase-based combination chemotherapy regimens such as AspaMetDex (L-asparaginase, methotrexate, and dexamethasone), modified SMILE, or P-GEMOX, with or without RT may be considered in patients with nasal disease (stage IV) or extranasal disease (stage I–IV).

**2. Response Assessment**

At the end of induction therapy, patients should undergo an evaluation with PET/CT scans, ear, nose, and throat examination, and EBV viral load to establish remission status. Results from PET/CT scans are interpreted using the Deauville criteria.

Patients with nasal disease (stage I–II) with complete remission (disappearance of all disease) may be observed without further treatment.

In patients with nasal disease (stage IV) or extranasal disease (stage I–IV), hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be considered in those with complete remission or partial remission with a negative biopsy.

**3. Relapsed or Refractory Disease**

A diagnosis of relapsed or refractory disease must be confirmed histologically by biopsy.
