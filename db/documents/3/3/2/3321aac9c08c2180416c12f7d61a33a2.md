Though miliaria affects all age groups and both genders equally, infants and children are at a higher risk due to eccrine duct immaturity.

- Occlusion of the skin: Transdermal drug patches and tight clothing have been associated with miliaria.

- Type I pseudohypoaldosteronism: Mineralocorticoid resistance results in loss of sodium through eccrine glands and has been associated with pustular miliaria rubra.

- Strenuous physical activity

- Morvan syndrome: A rare autosomal recessive disease that results in hyperhidrosis, among other abnormalities, which predisposes to miliaria.

- Medications: Drugs that induce sweating such as bethanechol, clonidine, and neostigmine have been linked to miliaria.
