Overall, PCFCL has an excellent prognosis and follows an indolent course, with 5-year survival greater than 95%. Grading is not required because regardless of growth pattern (follicular vs. diffuse), presence or absence of BCL-2 expression and/or t(14;18), multifocal lesions, or several centroblasts, there is no change in prognosis. [1,6] Of note, PCFCL that presents on the legs has shown to be more aggressive and portends a worse prognosis.
