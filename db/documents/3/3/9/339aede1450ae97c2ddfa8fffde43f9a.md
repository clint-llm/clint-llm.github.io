Abdominal aortic aneurysms that have not ruptured are often identified incidentally on imaging studies or a physical exam. It is important for all healthcare workers to refer these patients to a vascular surgeon because not all may require treatment. Healthcare workers in the emergency room including nurse practitioners should be aware that endovascular options are now being offered to patients with an AAA. However, even after the endovascular procedure is completed, the patient needs long-termÂ follow up since leaks are not uncommon. Overall, endovascular repair has much lower morbidity than open surgery and should be the initial recommendation for all elective AAA.
