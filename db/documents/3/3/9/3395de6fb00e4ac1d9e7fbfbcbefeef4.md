The overall prognosis of infants born with congenital varicella syndrome is poor, often fatal in roughly 30% of infected babies within the first month of life. Death in infancy often results from intractable gastrointestinal reflux, severe recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and respiratory failure.

For infants with neonatal varicella infection, if untreated, the mortality rate is as high as 31%. Death typically occurs from varicella pneumonia. The mortality rate decreases to 7% when VZIG is administered.
