A thorough medical history of the patient should be queried all the way back to childhood. Medical records should be obtained if it is still possible to get them. Important questions to ask include when did decreased vision in the suspected eye start and does the patient has any history of refractive correction, ocular trauma, ocular pathology, amblyopia treatment, and ocular surgeries. Sometimes the patient may be unaware of this history, so getting the history from the parents on family members may be of help.

Any patient with suspected amblyopia should have a complete eye exam. The visual acuity of each eye should be checked individually with the patient’s refractive correction. Visual acuity may be overestimated in amblyopic eyes when using individual visual targets, so it may be beneficial to bracket the visual targets for accuracy.
