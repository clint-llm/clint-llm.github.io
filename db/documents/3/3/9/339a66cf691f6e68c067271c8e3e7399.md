The term blindness is a general term that can include those with low vision and legal blindness. Low vision is a term used to describe those whose vision cannot be fully corrected by glasses, contact lenses, refractive surgery, or other surgery. Another term commonly used is a visual impairment to describe those whose decreased visual function interferes with the ability for one to perform their activities of daily living. Visual impairment is defined based on function, instead of using visual acuity or visual field cutoff values. This activity reviews the causes of blindness, the legal interpretation of blindness and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of blindness.
