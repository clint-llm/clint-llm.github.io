An inappropriate dosage of oxytocin can lead to dangerous tachycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia. High dosages of oxytocin can cause uterine rupture, hypertonicity, and spasms. When oxytocin is given to women in the first or second stages of labor or to women to cause induction of labor, uterine rupture, maternal subarachnoid hemorrhages, maternal death, and even fetal death can result. If oxytocin is given in dosages too large or even slowly during 24 hours, the medication can exhibit an antidiuretic effect resulting in extreme water intoxication; this can result in coma, seizures, and even death of the mother. Note that patients who receive fluids orally are at higher risk for water intoxication and antidiuretic effects when given exogenous oxytocin.
