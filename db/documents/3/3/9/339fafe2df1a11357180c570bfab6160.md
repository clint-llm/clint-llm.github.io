In the era of enhanced antenatal ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram programs, the majority of these patients are diagnosed antenatally in the United States of America. The mean gestational age at diagnosis is approximately 22 weeks gestation, although the diagnosis is possible as early as 11 weeks.

Clinicians may pick up on patients not diagnosed antenatally at the time of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) screening with hypoxemia or the presence of a heart murmur. Chest X-ray (CXR) may show decreased pulmonary vascular markings, which would signify pulmonary oligemia. The right heart border may also be prominent signifying right atrial dilation. The electrocardiogram (ECG) in this lesion is notable for a left superior axis (QRS axis -30 to -90), which a very characteristic finding. The right ventricular forces become diminished, and there may be evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy.
