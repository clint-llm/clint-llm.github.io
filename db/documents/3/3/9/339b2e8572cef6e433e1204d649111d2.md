Protriptyline’s initial dose is 15 mg per day divided into 3 or 4 doses per day, with a max dose of 60 mg per day. However, taking more than recommended or taking the daily dose at one time can have significant consequences which can manifest in cardiac arrhythmias or EKG changes, especially QRS-widening hypotension, confusion, visual hallucinations, delusions, ataxia, tremors, syndrome of inappropriate ADH, tinnitus, hyperactive reflexes, muscle rigidity stupor, convulsions, coma, and even death.

ECG is a recommendation and close monitoring for patients over the age of 50, especially in those taking more than 20 mg per day, due to sensitivity to anticholinergic, cardiovascular, hypotensive, and sedative effects.

Like other antidepressants, protriptyline increases suicidal ideation and attempts in children, adolescents, and young adults. It is not recommended in patients under the age of 12 or intended for those under the age of 6.
