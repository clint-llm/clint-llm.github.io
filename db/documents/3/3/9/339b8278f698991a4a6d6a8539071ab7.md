Martin proposed a 4-stage system.

- Stage I - Vegetating tumor limited to the epithelium with no involvement of the sphincter of Oddi

- Stage II - Tumor localized in the duodenal submucosa without the involvement of the duodenal muscularis propria but possible involvement of the sphincter of Oddi

- Stage III - Tumor of the duodenal muscularis propria

- Stage IV - Tumor of the periduodenal area or pancreas, with proximal or distal lymph node involvement
