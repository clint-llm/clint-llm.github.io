As with other allergic contact dermatitides, identification of nickel allergy can be challenging. It may be helpful for patients to create a list of daily exposures, including soaps, medications, lotions, etc., starting with the most recent additions. Unfortunately, often an underlying cause of symptoms is never identified. Nickel allergy is likely one of the more identifiable causes as it tends to be more localized to common areas of exposure - low midline abdomen due to belt buckles, wrists due to watches, and ears due to earrings.
