Conservative therapy for iliopsoas snapping includes physiotherapeutic procedures.

In the acute phase, the main approach is rest and anti-inflammatory drugs. When the treating clinician approves physiotherapy, several exercises will be demonstrated for the patient, including stretching the iliopsoas complex, active and passive hip joint mobilization, and exercises that improve the lumbar lordosis posture.

The iliopsoas muscle could cause compression of the femoral nerve and cause knee pain. Before deciding on the surgical treatment to release the femoral nerve, the patient should learn stretching exercises to reduce the tension generated by the muscle. Generally, surgery can be avoided if the patient can follow the physiotherapy indications. According to the British Medical Acupuncture Society, an alternative treatment can be acupuncture for iliopsoas muscle, which has proved to be effective.

The osteopathic manual approach can intervene to support physiotherapy, particularly in the post-surgical phases, to reduce pain or act on deep muscle-articular areas with soft techniques and without side effects.
