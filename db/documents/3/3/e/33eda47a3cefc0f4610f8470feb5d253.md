Histologic confirmation of candida in the esophagus is the gold standard for diagnosis. Hematoxylin and eosin stain of biopsies or brushing of esophageal candidiasis almost always show pseudohyphae which isÂ diagnostic for esophageal candidiasis. The mucosa involved may exhibit desquamated parakeratosis which characteristically has groups of squamous cells that have detached or are in the process of detaching from the main squamous-lined tissue. This finding is not however specific to esophageal candidiasis. Pathology may demonstrate acute inflammation and/or intraepithelial lymphocytosis.
