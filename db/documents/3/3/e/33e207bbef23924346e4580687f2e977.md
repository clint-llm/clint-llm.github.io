Capnography (ETCO2) provides a way to monitor both ventilatory and intravascular CO2 retention in real time.  Capnography monitors and tubing should be used in general during conscious sedation cases according to national guidelines.

Whatever equipment setup is chosen must allow passive unidirectional flow (via a series of valves) of CO2 from a high pressure cylinder into a series of syringes, tubing, and/or reservoir bags. This process must allow CO2 to expand until it equalizes with room atmospheric pressure while also purging room air from the system, as room air injected into the patient will not dissolve quickly in blood and will potentially form a clinically significant air embolus.

There is presently only one FDA-approved medical CO2 delivery system, which is comprised of two main components: a CO2 high pressure reservoir/delivery device called the AngiAssist and a low pressure valve/stopcock system called the K-valve. The AngiAssist CO2 reservoir holds 10,000 mL of CO2, which is enough to distribute over hundreds of procedures. The valve/stopcock system, which the manufacturer calls a K-valve because of its resemblance to that letter, has:

- Valves directing gas in a single direction from the CO2 source toward the patient that prevents contamination of CO2 by room air,

- A 60-mL reservoir syringe that helps the CO2 depressurize, and

- A 30-mL injection syringe that helps deliver the CO2 in a nonexplosive fashion into an angiographic catheter.

Large (e.g. >2 feet tall) medical grade CO2 cylinders have been used for decades as a source of CO2 for angiography but are not FDA-approved. Similar to a medical O2 cylinder, a medical grade CO2 cylinder has a metal diaphragm to keep the gas inside the cylinder pure, a release valve, and a pressure gauge and pressure regulator. Single cylinders for medical use are typically sold in quantities of pounds of compressed CO2 and contain millions of milliliters of CO2 set to around 18 PSI. Use of such CO2 cylinders requires a separately "home made" or purchased simulation of the K valve system via a network of tubes, bags, syringes, and stopcocks in order to depressurize the CO2 while keeping it pure on its way into the patient. The entry and exit points of the system must be sealed until the physician is ready to connect the system to a catheter.

CO2 injection systems can also be used in conjunction with

- An additional gas purifying filter

- A digital injector

- A Y-shaped connector to perform angiography without having to remove the guidewire from the catheter.
