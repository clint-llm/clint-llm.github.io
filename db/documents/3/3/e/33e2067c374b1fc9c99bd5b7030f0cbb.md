The Infectious Disease team, Infection Prevention Committee, and Antimicrobial Stewardship Program play a crucial role in tackling enterococcus and VREÂ infections and putting preventive measures in place to limit hospital-related outbreaks. Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists form an important interprofessional team to treat enterococcal infections.

- The CDC recommends prompt active screening via rectal and perirectal swabs or stool samples, with subsequent reporting of VRE in high-risk patients such as those in the ICU, transplant or oncology wards, hemodialysis or immunocompromised patients, prolonged hospitalizations, and admissions from LTC, as it has shown to be cost-effective for preventing colonization, infections, and deaths.

- Specific environmental cleaning modalities, such as the non-touch automated mobile ultraviolet units, and routine chlorhexidine bathing, especially in the ICU, are recommended for reducing the VRE burden.

- HCW training on hand hygiene is associated with a 47% decline in acquiring VRE in hospitals.

- Contact isolation for VRE patients is used in most hospitals; however, there is no consistent data to support it.

- Antibiotic stewardship programs that limit the use of cephalosporins, antibiotics against anaerobes, vancomycin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, play an essential role in preventing the emergence and spread of this pathogen.
