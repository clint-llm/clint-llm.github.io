The stylohyoid muscle receives its vascular supply from branches of the external carotid artery, and the occipital branch of the external carotid artery gives branches to the stylohyoid. Lymphatic drainage from this part of the neck goes into the submental and submandibular group of lymph nodes, and then it drains into the deep cervical group of lymph nodes.
