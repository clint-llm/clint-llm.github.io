There are no specific drug monitoring requirements for intravenous phenylephrine; however, vasoactive medications should not be given outside of the perioperative or intensive care settings, or in environments where heart rate/rhythm, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry monitoring are unavailable. Many traditional texts recommend the administration of all vasoactive medications through a central line; however, phenylephrine is routinely given peripherally in the operative setting and has been shown to be safe even in prolonged infusions in 18 to 20 g IV in large veins with frequent site inspections.

Despite the widespread use of peripherally administered intravenous phenylephrine, a systematic review of published articles involving peripherally administered vasoactive medications and reports of extravasation showed only two cases of skin necrosis in high-risk patients receiving peripherally administered phenylephrine.

Topical, ophthalmic, and nasal administrations of phenylephrine are typically well-tolerated, but there is always the concern for systemic absorption. Although there have been case reports of hemodynamic instability following the administration of higher concentrations (10%) of ophthalmic phenylephrine, 2.5% concentrations lead to no statistically significant difference in heart rate or blood pressure.
