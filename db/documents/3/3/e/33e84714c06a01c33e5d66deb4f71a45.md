Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the main cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in developed countries, including the United States. It is considered a microvascular complication and occurs in both diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM). Reliable tests for diagnosis and monitoring include urine albuminuria and the estimated GFR (eGFR). Optimizing glycemia and good blood pressure control are pivotal in halting the progression of DKD. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of diabetic nephropathy.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with diabetic nephropathy.
- Summarize the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.
- Outline modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by diabetic nephropathy.
