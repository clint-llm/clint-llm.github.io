Nabothian cysts (also called mucinous retention cysts or epithelial cysts) are a common and benign gynecological condition located at the uterine cervix. They are usually asymptomatic, of no clinical significance, and require no treatment. However, if symptomatic or they become complicated, further evaluation and therapy are needed. This activity reviews the evaluation, complications, and treatment of nabothian cysts, both symptomatic and asymptomatic ones, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of nabothian cysts. 
- Review the history and physical exam findings of nabothian cysts.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with nabothian cysts and how to manage them.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by nabothian cyst complications and of their diagnosis uncertainty.
