Complete blood count (CBC), type and screen, and if deemed necessary, coagulation screening should be performed. If there is a likelihood of the need for a blood transfusion, blood should also be taken for cross-matching.

Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis can be done to evaluate the size, site, and growth of the hematoma. MRI angiography of the pelvis may help in the detection of any aneurysms. Transperineal sonography is also a simple, non-invasive technique that can be useful for the follow-up and monitoring of patients undergoing expectant management of a vulvar hematoma.

In addition, further investigations can be done to evaluate for causes of hematoma formation, such as the presence of connective tissue disorders or coagulopathies. In cases associated with severe trauma or sexual assault, the extent of injury to the perineum and pelvis must also be assessed adequately. Additional investigations, such as a pelvic X-ray for pelvic bone fractures in cases of pelvic trauma, should be done.
