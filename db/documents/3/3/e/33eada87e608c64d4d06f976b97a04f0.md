The anatomic location of the gracile nucleus is on the floor of the fourth ventricle. The gracile nucleus gives rise to second-order neurons, which contain six different types of neurons. It is situated medially to the cuneate nucleus. Together they form the medial lemniscus. The gracile nucleus, which forms part of the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway, is a three-order neuron system:

- **First-order neurons**- These are the neurons fibers that start from the ipsilateral side of the body and go through the gracile fasciculus and cuneate fasciculus, into the gracile nucleus, and into the cuneate nucleus respectively.

- **Second-order neurons**- These neurons are in the gracile and the cuneate nucleus. After receiving input from the fasciculi, these nuclei give rise to the internal arcuate fibers. The fibers of both the nuclei decussate and then combine to form the medial lemniscus. The medial lemniscus then travels from the nuclei into the Ventral Posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus.

- **Third-order neurons**- The third-order neuron fibers relay the information from the thalamus to the primary somatosensory cortex of the cerebrum.

The medial lemniscus and the dorsal column pathway function to carry sensations from the body, first to the thalamus and subsequently to the brain. The sensory signals transmitted are:

- Fine touch

- Vibration

- Visceral pain

- Conscious proprioception

- 2-point discrimination
