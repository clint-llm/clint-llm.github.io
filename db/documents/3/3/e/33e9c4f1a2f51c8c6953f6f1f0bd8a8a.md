In addition to using antiepileptic medications, the treatment of seizures aims at correcting any identifiable causative process. Care is needed to prevent any secondary brain injury, which may include advanced respiratory and cardiovascular support. Monitoring is necessary to detect hypotension and hypoxia and steps taken to correct those conditions when recognized.

Common complications may include traumatic injuries such as tongue lacerations or scalp lacerations.

Convulsive status epilepticus leads to brain damage on the cellular level and may itself be epileptogenic. Transformed or subtle generalized convulsive status epilepticus or nonconvulsive seizures detected by EEG monitoring in critically ill patients may also contribute to brain injury.
