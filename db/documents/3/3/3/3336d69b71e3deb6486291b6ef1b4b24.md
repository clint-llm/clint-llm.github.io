Due to the ability to increase vagal tone through activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, caution is necessary when administering cholinesterase inhibitors to individuals who have bradycardia or cardiac conduction diseases such as sick sinus syndrome. These individuals are at risk for syncope and falls. Caution is also advised in patients on antihypertensive medications due to the possibility of developing severe hypotension.

Moreover, cholinesterase inhibitors are also contraindicated in patients with gastric ulcers due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with urinary retention should also not receive cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of increased retention. This effect is especially notable in patients undergoing treatment for dementia and Alzheimer disease as urinary incontinence is a frequent clinical feature in these patients.

Administration to patients with previous allergies or hypersensitivities to cholinesterase inhibitors and their derivatives is also contraindicated.
