Once a patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS), the role of the primary care provider and the nurse practitioner cannot be overstated. These professionals need to educate the patient on atherosclerosis and reduce the modifiableÂ risk factors for coronary disease. Patients should be counseled to modify risk factors that can precipitate CAVS such as smoking, and monitored for sustained medication use to prevent future CAVS attacks. Due to patients having recurrent symptoms resulting from CAVS further research needs to be implemented to better understand the pathogenesis and impact of treatment options. Close monitoring is required because the recurrence of coronary vasospasm is common, which in some patients can prove fatal. (Level V)
