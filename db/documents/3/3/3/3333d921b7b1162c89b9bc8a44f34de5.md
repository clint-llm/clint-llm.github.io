EDTA is contraindicated in patients with renal disease or anuria, as the kidneys eliminate the drug. This may lead to excessive levels of EDTA building up, resulting in further nephrotoxic effects. Additionally, the administration should be avoided in patients with hepatitis. EDTA is classified as a Category B drug and should only be used in pregnant patients if needed. One study showed that EDTA did not produce any teratogenic effects in rats, even at extremely high doses.
