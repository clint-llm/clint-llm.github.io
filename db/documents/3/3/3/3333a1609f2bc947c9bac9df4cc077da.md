The processes that lead to brain death are in order of frequency: cardiopulmonary arrest, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage.

For extracranial causes of brain death, in patients with cardiopulmonary arrest, 8.9% of those initially resuscitated will progress to brain death. In patients presenting with traumatic brain injury, 2.8 to 6.1% will die of brain death.

Among the intracranial etiologies of brain death, 8.5 to 10.7% of patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage will progress to brain death, compared to 6.1 to 9.6% of those with intracerebral hemorrhage.

By definition, brain death carries 100% mortality.
