**Initial Management**

- Surgical resection is the only curative option in a minority of cases where the tumor is localized at the time of diagnosis

- Nutritional support includes total parenteral nutrition, supplementation of amino acids and zinc supplementation to reverse the effects of malnutrition and catabolic effects of weight loss from the glucagon.

- Antibiotics, zinc replacement, and steroids may help with the improvement of NME.

- Somatostatin analogs like octreotide and lanreotide help to reverse the effects of glucagon excess as well as inhibit secretion of glucagon

- Prophylactic anticoagulant therapy, for example, heparin to prevent deep venous thrombosis is mandatory for all patients during the perioperative period.

**Management of progressive/Metastatic Disease**

The most common site of metastasis is liver. Hepatic resection has been recommended in patients without widespread liver involvement, diffuse extrahepatic metastases, and decreased liver function

Hepatic arterial embolization with or without selective hepatic artery infusion of chemotherapy is a palliative method used in patients with symptomatic hepatic metastases and are not candidates for hepatic resection

Radiofrequency ablation applies to smaller lesions (typically smaller than 3 cm) and is less invasive than hepatic resection or hepatic arterial embolization. It can be used as in conjunction with surgical resection, or as a primary treatment technique for the hepatic metastases

Combination chemotherapy with streptozocin, 5-fluorouracil or Temozolomide containing regimens, often in combination with a somatostatin analog have been used in patients with large tumors and enlarging metastases. The use of systemic chemotherapy is limited to patients with advanced disease

Molecular targeted agents such as sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor are approved in the United States for treatment of advanced, well-differentiated, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors including glucagonomas

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), also known as radioisotope therapy, is a novel method being used for the management of neuroendocrine tumors. The high expression of somatostatin receptors in glucagonoma provides an opportunity for the use of PRRT
