Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency is a common primary immunodeficiency characterized by undetectable serum IgA, a concomitant lack of secretory IgA, and normal levels of other immunoglobulins. IgA deficiency should be distinguished from any other cause of hypogammaglobulinemia or T lymphocyte defect. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of IgA deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiologies of immunoglobulin A deficiency.
- Review the evaluation that should be considered in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency.
- Describe the management of immunoglobulin A deficiency.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency.
