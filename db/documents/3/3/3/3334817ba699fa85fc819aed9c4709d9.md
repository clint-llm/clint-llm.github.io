Rich innervation and muscularity of coronary vessels predisposed them to vasoactive effects of catecholamines as well as neuro-humoral system activation. As a result, inducement of coronary vasospasm can occur whenever there is a surge in circulatory catecholamines or when there is activation of the neurohumoral system.

Microembolization leads to increased resistance to flow across the coronary bed, which raises intracoronary pressures by vasoconstriction and impairs nutrient exchange as well asÂ causing endothelial dysfunction, which results in ischemia.
