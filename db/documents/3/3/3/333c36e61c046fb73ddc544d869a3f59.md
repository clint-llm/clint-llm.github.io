Complications can arise due to the spread from the primary site of infection. This is especially true of pulmonary nocardiosis that has spread locally. This can result in pericarditis and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome depending upon the location and extent of spread. Additionally, the risk of spread to the CNS results in a multitude of possible complications, including focal neurologic deficits and meningitis. Delay in the diagnosis of an immunosuppressed patient with nocardiosis has been implicated in treatment failure and poor prognosis.Nocardia, it is imperative to notify the laboratory so that steps can be taken by the laboratory to identify the species and antibiotic sensitivity pattern as quickly as possible. Additionally, the advent of PCR and 16S rDNA sequencing to identify Nocardia species may allow for faster identification and sequencing.
