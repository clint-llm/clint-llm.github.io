**Spine and Vertebra**

Five vertebral segments and their respective nerve roots exit under the respective vertebrae in the lumbar spine. For instance, the L3 nerve leaves the foramen of L3 and L4. When a patient experiences pain radiating down a given dermatome, therapies focused on nerve fibers, including associated spinal segments, might be viable to adjust to that area.

Small joints, such as zygapophyseal joints, have synovial joints on the upper and lower surfaces of the vertebrae. The upper facets are centered on the back and medial joint surface and interface with the contiguous vertebras' related joint surface. This structure results in flexion and contraction in contrast with rotation or horizontal bending of the vertebral motion's remainder. This reduced flexibility for lateral stretching guides the vertebrae to be manipulated in lumbar HVLA. Spinal therapy is the most common method of manual care used to correct musculoskeletal disease.

This process is very clearly separated from spinal mobilization by an external thrust. Hence, it is fair to assume that these two modes of therapy can have an equal impact and should thus be investigated separately, either clinically or through their modes of action. Usage results show that comparatively high speed and low amplitude manual procedure occurs for most patients who undergo spinal manipulation. The health care worker immediately transmits a thrust to the target vertebra by a small lever arm following preloading of the vertebra tissues by physically touching the skin that is overlaid by the lamina, spiny, transverse, or laminar mechanism to move the vertebra, gap its facet joints and produce mechanical, physiological, biological results.

An analysis of clinical evidence showed that spinal manipulation could help respond to back pain, migraine, pain in the spine, upper and lower extremities, and whiplash-related disorders for many conditions. In specific adaptations, the whole spine or significant parts of it are controlled as a unit; others are small motions intended to impact a particular joint.

**Biomechanics**

HVLA strategies aim to re-establish normal joint operations. They use a thrust force that hits a height from 220 to 889 N in a range of 75 to 225 mm that moves the vertebral, separates the facet joints, and causes mechanical, neurological, and biological effects. Up to 10 mm from the initially planned location is the initial point of contact. However, it is uncertain what significance these improvements have on the pathways underlying the efficacy of HVLA.

**Neurophysiology**

A physiological barrier is a point at which soft tissue stress restricts the voluntary range of movement in an articulation. If the joint crosses a physiological barrier, it may cause additional movement to the anatomical barrier. The anatomical barrier is when the bone curvature or body tissues (notably cartilage) become restricted to the passive range of motion. The anatomical barrier is the final limit of motion in the joint. Tissue damage can result from movement outside the anatomical barrier.

An increasing body of reviewed literature indicates that neurophysiological changes occur after spinal stimulation, including neural plastic changes, motor neuron excitability alteration, and cortical drive increase. One hypothesis is that the dispersion of carbon dioxide and nitrogen restores mutual function. In its liquid form, carbon dioxide displaces a joint from its regular location. During a manipulative motion, the velocity created a guided force-the absorption of nitrogen, turning them from a liquid into a gaseous state and allowing the joint to return to normal articulation; this indicates that the range of motion is increased by cavitation.

Carbon dioxide is dispersed by cavitation, which leads to audible joint pop. The vasodilatory effects of carbon dioxide promote increased blood flow, chemotaxis, and cell-attaining nutrients. The joint's popping often follows a manipulative motion. Crack noise or joint cavitation results from a gaseous bubble in the synovial fluid producing or collapsing. Cineradiographic studies have documented increased joint space and production/breakdown of carbon dioxide gas after thrust manipulation. Since carbon dioxide is the gas with the highest miscibility in the synovial fluid, this rise in carbon dioxide levels has been suggested as the mechanism for raising the range of motion after manipulation in the joint.

It has also been hypothesized that any reflex relaxation of the periarticular musculature will initiate the cavitation. After the manipulation, the joint takes about 15 minutes to rearrange the gas particles and make another cavitation sound. Some people believe that nothing has changed because there is no noise; this assumption is often incorrect. Recent findings indicate no correlation between the presence of an audible pop in patients with non-radicular low back pain during joint manipulation and improvement in pain, ROM, and impairment.

There are several hypotheses from a physiological perspective as to why HVLA is an efficient method of care. First, an HVLA thrust tends to stretch a contracted muscle, which, in turn, creates many afferent impulses to the central nervous system from the muscle spindles. The central nervous system then reflexively sends an inhibitory impulsion to the muscle spindle to relax the muscle. An alternative hypothesis suggests that the Golgi tendon receptors become activated instead of the muscle spindle, eventually relaxing the muscle.
