Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EDKA) is an uncommon diabetic complication associated with several risk factors such as fasting, surgery, pregnancy, and now the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. EDKA is primarily related to an imbalance between insulin and counter-regulatory hormones, with an elevated glucagon/insulin ratio. EDKA can lead to serious complications, including significant dehydration, if not recognized early and treated appropriately with fluids, dextrose, and insulin. This educational activity reviews the diagnosis and treatment of EDKA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the diagnostic criteria for euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology involved in euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Identify the associated risk factors for patients relative to euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Outline and explain the important therapeutic interprofessional team interventions for euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis.
