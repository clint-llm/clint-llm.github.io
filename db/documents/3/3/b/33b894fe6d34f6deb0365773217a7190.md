In all metabolic, neurological, and visceral diseases where one of the symptoms is a cramp, in the rehabilitation field it is customary to perform stretching. This is to try to keep the district or the muscular districts softer, preserving physiological length. When a muscle tends to persist in its shortening, the sarcomeres of the most distal fibers tend to disappear, with the increase of fat and connective tissue. In this way, the muscle will be more tense, worsening its electromyographic spectrum. A muscle in chronic shortening will have electrical disturbances, as the electric efference will struggle to excite the muscle fiber properly.
