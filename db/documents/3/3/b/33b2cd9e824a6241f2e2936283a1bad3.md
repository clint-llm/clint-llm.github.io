Laboratory findings in ehrlichiosis may include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild to moderately elevated transaminases. Hyponatremia may also be a finding. In some cases, morulae may be present in the peripheral blood or other body fluids of a patient with ehrlichiosis. However, this is not considered a diagnostic of ehrlichiosis. Cerebrospinal leukocytosis and mildly elevated protein levels may also occur. In most centers, diagnosis of ehrlichiosis occurs via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is particularly useful in these infections given their predilection for infecting circulating leukocytes. Treatment with doxycycline can decrease the sensitivity of PCR, so samples should be collected before initiation of treatment if possible without significantly delaying therapy. Serology may also be an option; however, culture is not a routine test performed to diagnose ehrlichiosis.
