Mechanical back strain is a prevalent disease in the medical field. Most patients who develop a mechanical back strain have a benign course; however, some will continue to have chronic, disabling symptoms. While evaluation and management are usually conservative for mechanical back strains, healthcare providers must differentiate between other causes of back pain and be aware of when to search for the other life-threatening etiologies. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, differential diagnoses, and treatment of mechanical back strains. It highlights the role of an interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with a mechanical back strain.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of mechanical back strain.
- Outline the appropriate history, physical, and diagnostic evaluation of mechanical back strain.
- Summarize the current recommendations for pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic, and invasive treatment options available for mechanical back strain.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to advance the management and improve outcomes in patients with a mechanical back strain.
