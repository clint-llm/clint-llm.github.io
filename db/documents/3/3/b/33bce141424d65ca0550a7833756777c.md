SPECT imaging perfusion images are more prone to artifacts. Examples of artifacts that can interfere with SPECT imaging include patient motion during the study, interference from extra-cardiac activity, photon attenuation (e.x. from breast tissue or diaphragm), and attenuation map misalignment. Before quantitative analysis of the images, correction of motion and attenuation could minimize artifact. Other methods of minimizing artifact include supine and prone positioning.

PET perfusion imaging techniques have better spatial resolution than SPECT. Therefore attenuation correction can occur more accurately.
