Hereditary elliptocytosis presentation is vague and ranges from asymptomatic to severe hemolysis. A high degree of suspicion for hereditary elliptocytosis is needed for a patient with normocytic normochromic anemia and a family history of anemia. An interprofessional team should be involved in the management of the patient diagnosed with hereditary elliptocytosis to improve outcomes.
