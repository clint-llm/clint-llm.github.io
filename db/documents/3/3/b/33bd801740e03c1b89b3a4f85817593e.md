If Entamoeba coli are found in stool samples, it may persist for days to years. Treatment is typically not needed. Patients can reduce the chances of getting parasitic infections such as Entamoeba coli by maintaining proper hand hygiene and avoiding contaminated food and water. Entamoeba coli is found globally and more prevalent in areas with poor sanitation.

When traveling to areasÂ with a high prevalence of low sanitation:

- Avoid drinking tap or well water. Avoid ice cubes, which are commonly made from tap water.

- Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables that are cleaned with tap or well water.

- Avoid street vendors.

- Drink bottled beverages and use bottled water to brush your teeth.

- Wash hands with soap and water frequently, particularly after touching animals, before eating, and after using the restroom.

- Boil water before drinking.

- Use gloves if you need to touch feces.
