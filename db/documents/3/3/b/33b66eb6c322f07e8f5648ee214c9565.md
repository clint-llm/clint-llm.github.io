In patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, certain conditions should be avoided such as pregnancy, dehydration, isometric exercise, iron deficiency anemia, and significant time spent at high altitudes.

When prescribing antihypertensives, caution should be exercised when using peripheral vasodilating agents, which may cause worsening of the right-left shunt.

Due to in-situ thrombosis and reactive erythrocytosis, patients with Eisenmenger syndrome are likely to exhibit evidence of both a bleeding diathesis and a hypercoagulable state. Patients are at higher risks for paradoxical emboli, in which a clot may theoretically pass through a septal defect from the right heart, bypass the lungs, and instead enter the systemic or cerebrovascular circulation. This may result in devastating cerebrovascular accidents.
