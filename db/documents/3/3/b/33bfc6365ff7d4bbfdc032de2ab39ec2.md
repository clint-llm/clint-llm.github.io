**Location of Bursa**

**Subcutaneous**

The subcutaneous bursae can be classified as adventitious when they become abnormal and develop a distinct wall. These bursae appear between the subcutaneous tissue and deep fasciae junction, or bony prominences.

**Submuscular**

The submuscular bursae exist between adjacent muscles or muscles and bony prominences.

Bursa naming is according to the location within the human body: bursae of the upper body include subacromial, subscapular, and olecranon;  bursae of the hip include ischiogluteal, iliopsoas, and trochanteric; bursae of the knee include medial collateral ligament, pes anserinus, prepatellar, infrapatellar, popliteal bursa; and the ankle bursa is Retrocalcaneal.

**Upper Body Bursae**

The subacromial bursa lies between the acromion and the rotator cuff. This bursa protrudes laterally from below the acromion when the arm is at rest and moves medially below the bone when the person lifts their arm away from the center of the body.

The subscapular bursa lies between the frontward facing scapula surface and the backward-facing chest wall.

There are two olecranon bursae with the first bursa lying between the tricep tendons, the posterior elbow ligament, and the olecranon, while the second bursa lies more superficially between where the triceps attaches to the olecranon and the skin.

**Hip Bursae**

The ischiogluteal bursa lies deep within the gluteus maximus and surfaces the ischial tuberosity.

The iliopsoas bursa is known for being the largest bursa in the human body, which extends into the iliac fossa and lies between the lesser trochanter and the iliopsoas tendon.

The trochanteric bursa extends superficially between the tensor fascia latae and the skin while also lying deeply between the tensor fasciae latae and the greater trochanter.

**Knee Bursae**

The medial collateral ligament bursa lies between the superficial and deep medial collateral ligament in the knee.

The pes anserinus bursa lies between the hamstring tendons and the superficial collateral ligament.

The prepatellar bursa is located anteriorly over the knee’s patella and below the skin.

The infrapatellar bursa contains a superficial component, as well as a deep component. The superficial bursa is between the patellar ligament and the skin, while the deep bursa is between the patellar ligament and the proximal aspect of the anterior tibia.

The popliteal bursae are known as baker cysts and lie in the posterior joint capsule of the knee.

**Ankle Bursae**

The retrocalcaneal bursa is at the back of the heel and lies deep to the Achilles tendon and above the calcaneus bone. Occasionally you can see bursa over the medial malleolus, the subcutaneous medial bursa, and a bursa behind the heel called the subcutaneous calcaneal bursa.
