Axial flaps can provide a low complexity, one-step method for reconstruction for defects which are larger in area. They can obviate the need for multistep procedures and provide patients with durable skin and a better cosmetic result. They offer an efficient, less complicated means to repair defects that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to repair.
