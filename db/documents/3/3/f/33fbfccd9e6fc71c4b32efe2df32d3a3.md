The anterior choroidal artery is the preterminal branch of the internal carotid and provides blood supply to the amygdala, and it is drained by the posterior choroidal vein which ends eventually to form the great cerebral vein that drains into the straight sinus.

Astroglia podocytes form the blood-brain barrier by wrapping podocytes around capillaries. These cells protect the brain from toxins in the blood and facilitate nutrient transport to the neurons. Astroglia also forms a system of microscopic perivascular channels permeating the brain that transmit a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-like lymphatic vessels. The system enables CSF to clear the metabolic waste and distribute glucose, amino acids, lipids, and neurotransmitters. This system is most active during sleep, contributing to its restoration function. Arterial pulsation drives lymphatic flow, suggesting that exercise may also enhance it: aging, brain trauma, and ischemia decrease that CSF flow. Also, larger lymphatic vessels in the meninges help absorb interstitial fluid into the dural venous sinuses.
