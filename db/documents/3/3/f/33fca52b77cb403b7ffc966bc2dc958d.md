Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects 3 to 5% adult population older than 40 years old.

Non-invasive measures are utilized for both diagnosis and post-intervention follow-up purposes.

Duplex testing results are primarily interpreted in conjunction with limb-pressure measurements. The combination of Duplex results and limb pressure measurements optimally categorizes arterial hemodynamics and functional impairment.

Diagnosis of PAD relies on non-invasive arterial tests, which can provide physiological and morphological information. Physiological tests include segmental pressures, ankle and toe-brachial index, pulse volume recordings, exercise tests, segmental volume plethysmography, transcutaneous oxygen assessments, and photoplethysmography. Morphological tests like CT Angiography, MR Angiography, and catheter-based angiography are ideal for evaluating preprocedural anatomic configuration in individuals with already established vascular disease. Peripheral arterial duplex evaluation provides a unique spectrum of details, including the anatomical location of the lesion, accompanied by further information about flow velocity and volume.

Duplex ultrasonography combines conventional B-mode imaging with pulsed doppler techniques for spectral analysis.

The accurate and precise interpretation of velocity spectra measures by duplex scanning is essential to successfully applying the Duplex technique.
