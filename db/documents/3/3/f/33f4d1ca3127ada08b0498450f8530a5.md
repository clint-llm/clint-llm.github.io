Treatment of overdose varies with the amount taken, duration since ingestion, age and, co-morbidities of the patient. Initial assessment involves securing airway, breathing, circulation, appropriate blood work, including testing for coingestants. Early consultation with poison control/ toxicology should be a priority.

An overdose of nifedipine can lead to systemic vasodilation, severe hypotension, and reflex tachycardia. Prolonged systemic hypotension can progress to shock and even death. Activated charcoal at a dose of 1 g/kg is useful if the patient presents within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion. Whole bowel irrigation should be a consideration with extended-release preparations or large quantity ingestion. Nasogastric lavage is usually ineffective. Intravenous fluid resuscitation, calcium salts, and vasopressor therapy with dopamine or norepinephrine usually alleviate the hypotension. Administration of high-dose insulin is an option as it has been shown to lower mortality and improve hemodynamics. Electrocardiographic results, vital signs, kidney function, urine output, and electrolytes require continuous monitoring. For intentional ingestion, psychiatric consultation is also necessary. Patients presenting with an overdose of immediate-release preparations need observation for 4 to 7 hours. For extended-release preparations, 24 hours of telemetry observation is ideal.
