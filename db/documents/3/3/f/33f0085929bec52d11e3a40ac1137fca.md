Healthcare professionals should educate patients about breast cancer and other breast lesions. The nurse is in a prime position to teach the patient about breast exams, which may help detect any breast abnormalities early. Also, the nurse should encourage women to undergo screeningÂ mammograms. At the same time, the patient should be encouraged to follow up with regular breast exams by the primary care provider.

**Outcomes**

For women who undergo excision of the intraductal papilloma, the outcomes are excellent. All women should be encouraged to undergo screening mammograms. The American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging recommends annual screening mammograms beginning at age 40 for women of average risk.
