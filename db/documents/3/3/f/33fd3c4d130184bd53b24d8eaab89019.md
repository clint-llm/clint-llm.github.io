Coronary guidewires are designed to navigate blood vessels to reach the segment of a vessel or the lesion in the vessel. Coronary wires are generallyÂ 0.014 mm in diameter and introduced to the coronary tree via a guiding catheter. Multiple different coronary wires exist described as "workhorse," "extra supportive," or "hydrophilic."
