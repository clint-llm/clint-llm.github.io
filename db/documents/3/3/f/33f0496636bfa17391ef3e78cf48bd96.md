Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder characterized by the abnormal increase of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Unchecked, the excess production of these plasma cells can ultimately lead to specific end-organ damage. Most commonly, this is seen when at least one of the following clinical manifestations are present: hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone pain accompanied by lytic lesions. Obviously, the differential is broad with any of these symptoms and/or findings, but it is imperative MM be kept in mind as part of the differential as management is unique and improved outcomes are available with timely intervention is made.
