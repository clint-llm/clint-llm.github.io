Risk factors for altered B6 may include excessive or inadequate ingestion. Specifics causes of B6 deficiency have been attributed to insufficient gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, hepatic dysfunction, protein-energy malnutrition, and drug interaction or antagonism.

The human body cannot store B6, and thus a daily source is required. There appears to be a bioavailability preference for meat over plant source B6. This may be important to those who favor a plant-based diet exclusively. These individuals may need added supplementation. The major supplement in multivitamins is pyridoxine hydrochloride. Dietary intake and the bioavailability of ingested B6 may vary, as well as the urinary excretion.

RDA or recommended dietary allowance forÂ  B6 in adults is 1 mg to 1.7 mg per day. Children ages 1 to 3 are recommended to have 0.5 mg per day, and those 3 to 13 are recommended to have 1 mg per day. During pregnancy and lactation, the recommendations are 1.9 mg and 2 mg per day.

The average diet for adults is estimated to include 6 mg to 10 mg of Pyridoxine vitamers. Excessive amounts exceed 250 mg per day and, on a chronic basis, may result in toxicity leading to untoward effects on the skin, GI, and the neurologic system.
