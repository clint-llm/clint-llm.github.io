The adaptive mechanisms that may be adequate to maintain the overall contractile performance of the heart at relatively normal levels become maladaptive when trying to sustain adequate cardiac performance.

In the initial stages of congestive heart failure, cardiac physiology attempts to adapt via several compensatory mechanisms to maintain cardiac output and meet the systemic demands. These include the Frank-Starling mechanism, changes in myocyte regeneration, myocardial hypertrophy, and myocardial hypercontractility. With increased wall stress, the myocardium attempts to compensate via eccentric remodeling, which further worsens the loading conditions and wall stress.

A decrease in cardiac output stimulates the neuroendocrine system with a release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and vasopressin. They cause vasoconstriction leading to increased afterload. There is an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which causes an increase in cytosolic calcium in the myocytes. This increases myocardial contractility and further prevents myocardial relaxation.

An increase in afterload and myocardial contractility with impaired myocardial relaxation leads to increased myocardial oxygen demand. This paradoxical need for increased cardiac output to meet myocardial demand eventually leads to myocardial cell death and apoptosis. As apoptosis continues, a decrease in cardiac output with increased demand leads to a perpetuating cycle of increased neurohumoral stimulation and maladaptive hemodynamic and myocardial responses.

A decrease in cardiac output also stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to increased salt and water retention, along with increased vasoconstriction. This further fuels the maladaptive mechanisms in the heart and cause progressive heart failure. In addition to this, the RAAS system releases angiotensin II, which has been shown to increase myocardial cellular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. This maladaptive function of angiotensin II has been shown to increase myocardial remodeling.

In HFpEF, there is a decrease in myocardial relaxation and an increase in the stiffness of the ventricle due to an increase in ventricular afterload. This perpetuates a similar maladaptive hemodynamic compensation and leads to progressive heart failure.
