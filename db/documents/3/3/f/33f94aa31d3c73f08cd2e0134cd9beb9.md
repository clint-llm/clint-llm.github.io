The intracranial portion of the nerve is vascularized from the proximal, distal, and recurrent branches of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The spinal roots of the nerve are affected by the musculospiral artery of the ascending pharyngeal artery and collaterals of the anterior spinal artery.

The extracranial portion is vascularized from the occipital artery and the branches of the lingual artery.

The extracranial path of the nerve, at the level of the posterior triangle of the neck, is followed by lymphatic nodes; the venous system follows the entire path of the nerve with small veins, affecting the external jugular vein.
