Before prescribing penicillin to a patient, the clinician and healthcare team should confirm that the underlying infection is likely the result of a bacteria that is sensitive to penicillin. The clinician, pharmacist, and/or nurse should also tell the patient of any side effects of the drug that should prompt a return visit, such as prolonged diarrhea or serious rash. In an outpatient setting, communication between the clinician and the pharmacist will allow the drug to be dispensed appropriately to the patient. The pharmacist should consult the patient on how best to administer the penicillin and remind them that they should complete the entire course of the antibiotic. This interprofessional approach will optimize therapeutic results while minimizing adverse effects. [Level 5]

Should a patient have difficulty obtaining drugs for either financial or logistical reasons, a social worker may help assure that the patient receives their medications. In an inpatient setting, communication between the clinician and the nurse will allow the patient to receive the drug. The healthcare team can work together to confirm that the patient does not have any contraindications to penicillin use. If any immediate serious adverse effects occur after administering penicillin, such as anaphylaxis, the healthcare team should receive notification and treat the acute condition immediately. A board-certified infectious disease pharmacist can also consult on the case to confirm if penicillin is the best choice given the patient's diagnosis and any other medications that the patient might be taking. Furthermore, a flattened hierarchy approach should be in place to ensure that reporting mistakes to a superior can take place without resistance. Utilization of the entire healthcare team is critical to ensure that the patient is comfortable and has the best medical outcome with the lowest chance of complications.
