A diagnostic or therapeutic intervention involving fluoroscopy involves a team of professionals ranging from the surgeon to the anesthetist, the radiographer, and the theatre staff. Interprofessional communication is essential to improve the efficient use of fluoroscopy with decreased exposure to all team members. Proper coordination with physicians, nurses, and X-ray technicians will lead to less radiation and shorter surgeries. Evidence shows a common language between surgeon and operator, and knowledge of terms during C-arm usage can go a long way in decreasing radiation exposure and surgery time.

Diagnostic and intraoperative fluoroscopy in special situations such as in pregnancy and young children should utilize an interdisciplinary team to ensure safety from ionizing radiation to the mother and the fetus. Fluoroscopy in acute polytrauma patients can be challenging as it is difficult to maintain adequate positioning. Pre-planning with the intensivists and the radiology team helps better interpret images, decreases surgical time, and minimizes radiation exposure.
