Acromegaly is a disorder caused by excessive growth hormone production from the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in excessive growth of body tissues and other metabolic dysfunctions. The causes of acromegaly can be divided into primary GH excess, ectopic or iatrogenic GH excess, and excess growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). Adult patients with acromegaly have the characteristic facial features of a large lower jaw, a prominent forehead, and large hands and feet. This occurs after the growth plates are fused, distinguishing acromegaly from gigantism, which occurs before the fusion of growth plates. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acromegaly and highlights the interprofessional team's role in providing care to patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Contrast the two major etiologies of acromegaly.
- Identify signs and symptoms of acromegaly.
- Describe how to evaluate a patient with acromegaly.
- Outline a well-coordinated, interprofessional team approach to provide optimal care to patients with acromegaly.
