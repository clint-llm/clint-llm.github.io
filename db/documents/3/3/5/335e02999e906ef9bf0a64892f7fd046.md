The pathophysiology depends on the etiology of the ALF. Most cases of ALF (except acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye syndrome) will have massive hepatocyte necrosis and/or apoptosis leading to liver failure. Hepatocyte necrosis occurs due to ATP depletion causing cellular swelling and cell membrane disruption. The pathophysiology of cerebral edema and hepatic encephalopathy is seen in ALF is multi-factorial and includes altered blood-brain barrier (BBB) secondary to inflammatory mediators leading to microglial activation, accumulation of glutamine secondary to ammonia crossing the BBB and subsequent oxidative stress leading to depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). This ultimately leads to astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema.
