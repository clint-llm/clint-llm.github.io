Complications of anteroseptal myocardial infection will include the complications of any myocardial infarction including:

**1. Myocardial Dysfunction**

**2. Heart Failure**

**3. Mechanical Complication:**Septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture, free wall rupture.

Septal rupture: Apical septum rupture is a rare complication but can occur with anteroseptal MI involving LAD lesion. Prompt diagnosis is necessary, and the treatment of choice is the definitive surgery.

Papillary muscle rupture and free wall rupture are very uncommon with anteroseptal infarction. These complications are more related to the multivessel disease.

**4. Conduction Abnormalities**

Conduction disturbances are associated with anteroseptal MI. One study showed that right bundle branch block was the most common conduction abnormality in anteroseptal MI and it progressed to completeÂ AV block in one-third of the patients.

**5. Post-infarction Pericarditis**
