History and physical exam are essential in the pursuit of a source of hemorrhage. Information regarding the history of present illness, including mechanism of injury if traumatic, may help the health care provider start to narrow in on a site(s) of hemorrhage. The traditional teaching in the evaluation of a trauma patient includes the primary and secondary survey. One of the key components of the initial survey is "C," which stands for circulation. This evaluation includes both an assessment, and where feasible, an attempt to control significant hemorrhage. When evaluating after trauma, the health care provider should remember there are five areas where a patient can have a potentially life-threatening hemorrhage: externally, the thorax, the abdomen, retroperitoneum, the pelvis, and the thighs.

Important history to obtain in a patient with concerns for hemorrhage include the use of any anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, history of any bleeding diathesis, or recent trauma or procedures. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage may be difficult to identify a source without further imaging or procedure, but a good history is essential, and a thorough physical exam can lead to clues as to the source of hemorrhage.

Intracranial hemorrhage evaluation should also start with a thorough history and physical exam. Often this can lead a provider to suspect a specific etiology or type of bleed, but imaging is often necessary to confirm these suspicions.
