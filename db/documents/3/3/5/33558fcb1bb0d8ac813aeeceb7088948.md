An auricular hematoma can present itself in many different circumstances for evaluation by healthcare specialists. Appropriate diagnosis and/or referral to otolaryngology or plastic surgery is imperative post procedure to help improve patient cosmesis and decrease the chances of the patient requiring a more invasive procedure, such as otoplasty, in the future.  It is also important to recognize the difference between auricular hematomas and other high-risk diagnoses. A thorough ear exam is imperative to complete a full evaluation to rule out damage to other structures of the ear.
