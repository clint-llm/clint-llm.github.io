Nevus sebaceus is a clinical diagnosis; additional workup is typically unnecessary. The exception would be a child with nevus sebaceus syndrome that presents with a large or multifocal lesion that may be associated with extracutaneous involvement of the ocular, skeletal, or central nervous systems. In this case, referral to neurology and other specialists may be indicated if other physical anomalies are present.
