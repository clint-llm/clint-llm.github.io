DPP-4 inhibitors have minimal to no interactions with other drugs because of their pharmacokinetic properties, the exception being saxagliptin. Saxagliptin is metabolized to its active form by CYP3A4/5; hence the levels of the drug and its active metabolite might be modified when administered along with drugs affecting CYP3A4/5 isoforms such as ketoconazole, diltiazem (inhibitors of CYP3A4/5), or rifampicin (inducer of CYP3A4/5). Dose adjustments of saxagliptin may be necessary for such instances.

The package insert of sitagliptin mentions the need for close monitoring when using in conjunction with digoxin as the former causes a small increase (11%) in the area under the curve (AUC) and plasma Cmax (18%) of digoxin. However, dose adjustment is not a recommendation.Â The patient's renal function requires monitoring after initiating therapy with either sitagliptin or saxagliptin in addition to glycemic control.
