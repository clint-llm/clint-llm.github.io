Cardiac risk stratification is an essential evaluation among health professionals. In today's world, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally and a significant cause of morbidity. Individuals at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease should be identified so that preventative efforts can be made. Early recognition of patients that have already developed cardiovascular disease will allow for the implementation of risk factor modifying therapies that have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality. This activity reviews evidence-based cardiovascular risk assessment and perioperative cardiovascular risk assessment. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in coordinating care to assess cardiovascular risk and improve patient outcomes properly.

**Objectives:**
- Describe modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors used in determining a patient's risk of cardiovascular disease.
- Review the importance of proper evaluation of a patient's cardiac risk in both general and perioperative settings.
- Outline the therapies used to optimize care for high-risk patients in both general and perioperative settings.
- Describe the importance of well-integrated teamwork and strong communication to assess patients for cardiovascular risk and improve outcomes properly.
