The etiology ofÂ linitis plastica is not fully understood, and a lot of research is done to uncover the exact cause of the disease. Gastric cancer in general and LP as a subcategory are more prevalent in the American and Asian populations, especially in Japan, Korea, and China. This could be related to the type of food, mainly low fiber diet, or the ethnicity of the population.

On the other hand, LP is not associated with H.pylori infection or chronic active gastritis.
