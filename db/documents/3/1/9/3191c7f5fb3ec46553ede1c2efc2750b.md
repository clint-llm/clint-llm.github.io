Age-standardized rate of incidence of gliomas was 4.7/100,000 person-years.

**Mortality/Morbidity**

Typical survival ranges are:

- WHO grade I (pilocytic astrocytomas) - more than 10 years

- WHO grade II (low-grade diffuse astrocytomas) - more than 5 years

- WHO grade III (anaplastic astrocytomas) - about 2 to 5 years

- WHO grade IV (glioblastoma) - about 1 year

**Race**

Minimal racial differences have been found

**Gender**

No gender dominance in pilocytic astrocytomas. A male: female ratio 1.18:1 in low-grade astrocytomas is there. In anaplastic astrocytoma, there is a substantial male dominance, with a male: female incidence being 1.87:1.

**Age**

The likelihood of pilocytic astrocytoma is increased in the first 2 decades. Whereas in the age group of 30-40, lowgrade astrocytomas are predominant, which comprise about one-fourth of adult cases.

The distribution of lowgrade astrocytomas is as follows:

- 10%: less than 20 years

- 60%: 20 to 45 years

- 30%: greater than 45 years

Anaplastic astrocytoma has a mean age of about 40 years.
