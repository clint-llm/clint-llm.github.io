The clinician carries out fogging at three points during the refraction process, which includes the following:

- Before retinoscopy.

- At the beginning of the subjective refraction process during the initial MPMVA (Maximum plus to maximum visual acuity step).

- At the point of the binocularÂ MPMVA step.

Note that the above steps ii and iii fall under subjective refraction.

The equipment used should be adequately cleaned and disinfected before this procedure is started. This takes special relevance in the current post-covid environment. The risk of cross infection has caused some clinicians to develop alternative techniques to the fogging process.

The examiner should explain to the patient what to expect during the procedure. For example, the examiner may say, " I am going to put in some lenses that will make your vision blur, then I will attempt to clear it." This ensures the patient does not get worried that the examiner is off track whenever a fogging lens is introduced.
