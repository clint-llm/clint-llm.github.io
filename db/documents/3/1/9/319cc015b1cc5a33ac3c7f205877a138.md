The main goal of the ERACS guidelines is to facilitate the widespread adoption of ERAS-based protocols within cardiac surgery. In building an ERACS program, Noss et al. recommend identifying target events of particular interest, such as complications or length of stay. After ascertaining the events of interest, he advocates for identifying the incidence of these events and developing a standardized, evidence-based care pathway. Finally, data must be gathered to assess the efficacy of the implemented pathway.

For example, Fleming et al. implemented an ERACS protocol for elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve surgery. The protocol included ERAS-based strategies such as reducing preoperative fasting, minimizing long-acting opioids, early enteral feeding, and early mobilization. After its implementation, the length of stay was no different from that prior to its implementation. They found a statistically significant decrease in several complications such as infection, renal injury, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and death.
