The median duration ofÂ post-injury to diagnosis is 9-15 years. Pain is the most commonly reported symptom and present as localized to the zone of injury or diffusely below the injury level. It is neuropathic and can be aching, burning, stabbing, and may be tender to light touch or pressure.

Neurologic examination is critical as these can reveal increased numbness, weakness, changes in tone or spasticity, or autonomic changes (hyperhidrosis, heart rate, or blood pressure instability). Selective loss of pain and temperature with relative preservation of dorsal column function (touch and pressure) are classic findings. This is known as "sensory dissociation". Motor weakness may occur early but it is more often a late finding. Some patients may retain motor function despite very large syrinx cavities.
