There are no reported oral melanoacanthoma complications. However, difficulties are mostly secondary to surgical excisions, such as scarring and post-operative pain.

Not biopsying an oral pigmented lesion may cause a missed diagnosis of a malignancy, so it behooves the oral surgeon to biopsy all pigmented lesions unless there is a clear component of the patient's history to ascertain the etiology.
