There exist multiple scales or instruments for the evaluation of IADLs. These include, but are not limited to, Lawton and Brody IADL, Health and Retirement Study Care Questionnaire, and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire. Each instrument includes its definition of IADL disability. Therefore, in analyzing cognitive impairment, the results differ depending on which instrument the evaluator used.

One of the significant limitations that all these instruments have in common is that they are often self-reported. A person is biased toward his or her abilities to perform specific tasks. Thus, they may either overestimate or underestimate their abilities.

Another major issue arises when examiners use IADL instruments to detect the probability of dementia in mildly cognitive impaired (MCI) individuals. Studies have shown that there is no difference in performing certain IADLs between MCI individuals with dementia and MCI individuals without dementia, which may be because current instruments are not sensitive to subtle changes. For example, an individual may have no issues with driving but have trouble adhering to traffic laws. On the Lawton and Brody IADL questionnaire, this individual would receive full points in evaluating the mode of transportation. Although current IADL instruments are widely helpful, they may still require a few refinements.
