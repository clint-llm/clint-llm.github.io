**Contraindications**

Known allergy to TXA, intracranial bleeding, known defective color vision, history of venous or arterial thromboembolism, or active thromboembolic disease. Greater than 3 hours from traumatic injury.

**Cautions**

TXA is not well studied in the renally impaired. It is 95% excreted in the urine, so renal dosing is recommended and judicious administration in patients with severe renal impairment.

No adjustments are required in the hepatic impaired patient.

TXA is a pregnancy category B. No harm or small risk has been noted in animal studies, but no risk seen in human studies.

Exposure to the infant via breast milk: A prospective, controlled observational study showed that while the infant is likely exposed to some TXA via the mother's breast milk, it is in such low concentrations that they recommended continued usage of TXA in a lactating mother.
