Most patients are asymptomatic. The underlying pathologies contribute to symptoms.

The clinician should check for features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO).

The ensuing hyperphosphatemia may induce potentially symptomatic hypocalcemia due to calcium-phosphate precipitation in the tissues. Calcifications can also be present in skin, soft tissue, and periarticular regions. Prolonged bone demineralization can lead to bone fractures.

CNS features include delirium, coma, seizures, neuromuscular hyperexcitability, (Chvostek’s sign and Trousseau’s phenomenon), hyperreflexia, muscle cramping (e.g., carpopedal spasm), or tetany.

Cardiovascular changes include hypotension and heart failure.

Hyperphosphatemia results in deposits of calcium-phosphate complexes throughout the body; this results in vascular calcification and arteriosclerosis, producing systolic hypertension, widened pulse pressure, and subsequent left ventricular hypertrophy.

Ocular manifestations include band-shaped keratopathy, cataracts, red-eye, or conjunctivitis.
