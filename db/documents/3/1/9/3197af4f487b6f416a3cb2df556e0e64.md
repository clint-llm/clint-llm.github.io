Pectus carinatum is a diagnosis that can be made on visual inspection by health care professionals at every level.  Pediatricians, primary care providers, and nurse practitioners are often the first to evaluate these patients and determine if further assessment or treatment is needed.  Coordination with team members in radiology, surgery, nursing, and psychiatry can provide patients a means to treat, monitor, and cope with the condition.

Management of pectus carinatum is best with an interprofessional team comprised of physicians, surgeons, specialty-trained nursing, and therapists working and communicating collaboratively to achieve the best patient outcomes. {level V]
