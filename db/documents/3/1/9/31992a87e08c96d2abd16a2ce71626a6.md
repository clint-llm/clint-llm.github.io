Causes of urinary retention and conditions that may mimic it include but are not limited to obstruction at any point along the lower genitourinary tract or nerve dysfunction. A blockage may result from pelvic masses, constipation, urethral stone, infection-causing urethral inflammation, stenosis, strictures, urethral diverticulum, and neurological dysfunction.
