Any non-healing oral lesion of more than two weeks old requires obtaining an excellent medical history and examining the oral cavity, its contiguous structures, and associated lymph nodes. Obtaining radiographs searching for possible hard tissue abnormalities is also required.

**Syphilis **

Syphilis can be screened via nontreponemal serological tests, such as the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests. If these are positive, then further testing is mandatory.

Spirochetes can be detected in chancres in primary syphilis or condylomata lata in secondary syphilis using dark-field microscopy. However, dark-field microscopy should be avoided for oral lesions because the treponemal organism is part of the normal oral flora and could lead to false-positive results.

The FTA-ABS test is more reliable during the tertiary phase because the nontreponemal tests may give false negatives. The FTA-ABS test may persist as positive even after adequate therapy.

Everyone presenting with signs and symptoms of syphilis should also be tested for other sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, to prevent congenital syphilis, pregnant women should be screened during their first trimester.

**Gonorrhea**

Laboratory assays directly detect the gonococcal pathogen in urogenital, anorectal, or oropharyngeal swabs and should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms and history that point towards gonorrhea.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can detect N. gonorrhoeae in genitals or extragenital samples such as the pharynx. The development of multiplex NAATs now allows for the simultaneous screening of extensive sexually transmitted diseases.

**Tuberculosis**

If tuberculosis is suspected, different tests are available, including tissue histology, tuberculin skin test, acid-fast bacillus microbial staining, and culture or polymerase chain reaction.

A biopsy of any unresolved ulcer is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis and rule out carcinoma. If the tuberculin skin test returns positive, a confirming chest X-ray is required because patients who received the BCG vaccine (tuberculosis vaccine) can have a false positive tuberculin skin test.

**Scarlet Fever**

Scarlet fever is sometimes clinically diagnosed through history and physical examination, although this may be challenging because of its earlier stages' wide variety in severity. Throat cultures and rapid strep tests can be performed to identify group A strep (GAS). A rapid strep test is fast but less specific; if this test is positive for GAS, treatment is initiated immediately. However, if the test is negative and the suspicion of scarlet fever still exists, a throat culture is the following step. A rapid strep test is usually not recommended in older patients (above 45 years of age) because of the low prevalence in this age group.

A throat culture, although time-consuming, is more specific and can detect the bacteria that the rapid strep test may miss; the latter is recommended in young patients with a CENTOR score of 2 and above. The CENTOR score estimates the possibility that the pharyngitis is streptococcal and includes parameters such as range of age groups, tonsillar exudate and inflammation, tenderness of cervical lymph nodes, fever, and the presence or absence of cough.
