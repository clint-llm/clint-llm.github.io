Neonates presenting with severe protein C deficiency have a poor prognosis. Complications from frequent infusions of plasma, such as fluid overload contribute to a high rate of infant death. There is limited data available regarding the long-term outcome of patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency.

Patients with mild protein C deficiency are prone to recurrent episodes of VTEs, including DVT. These events may lead to post-thrombotic syndrome and conditions such as venous stasis ulcers. The development of recurrent thrombotic events in individuals with thrombophilia can come under the influence of factors such as family history, obesity, underlying inflammatory disorders, and the presence of multiple thrombophilia qualities.
