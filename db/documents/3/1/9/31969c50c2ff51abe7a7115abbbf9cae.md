Spina Bifida is a generalized term for the neurologic condition resulting from the failure of neural tube closure of varying degrees during fetal development. It can lead to significant neurologic dysfunction and can cause functional limitations in adulthood affecting the quality of life. Spina bifida is associated with several complications and sequelae involving various organ systems so it is important to diagnose early and take a multidisciplinary approach to prevent severe morbidity. This activity reviews the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of spina bifida and the importance of interprofessional collaboration to avoid catastrophic outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of spina bifida and associated conditions and emergencies.
- Recall, analyze, and select appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of spina bifida.
- List the treatment and management options available for spina bifida.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance spina bifida and improve outcomes.
