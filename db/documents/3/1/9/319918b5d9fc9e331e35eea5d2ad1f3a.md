The trochlea is a spine-like structure present at the medial angle of the orbit; the trochlea is a part of the orbitalÂ surface of the frontal bone. The orbital part of the frontal bone forms roof of the orbit and ethmoidal sinus.

The supratrochlear nerve and tendon of the superior oblique muscle pass through the trochlea, while the supratrochlear artery passes posterior to the trochlea.
