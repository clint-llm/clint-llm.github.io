An ulnar nerve block is usually done by an anesthesiologist, but outside of the operating room, it may also be done by the emergency physician, hand surgeon, plastic surgeon, and orthopedic surgeon.  Once the procedure is completed, the monitoring of the patient is done by a nurse. The nurse will monitor the patient for pain, paresthesias, capillary refill, hand warmth, and pulse oximetry. The nurse will also monitor for the immediate complications of the procedure that include a hematoma, bleeding at the puncture site, and paresthesias. (Level V)

**Outcomes**

Most series report that ulnar block is a useful technique when dealing with hand and finger lacerations. The amount of local anesthetic required is much less than that required after a brachial plexus block. Further, the rate of complications is low. For short procedures less than 2-3 hours, an ulnar nerve block is a useful method of managing lacerations both in the emergency and operating room. Complications do occur after an ulnar nerve block, but the rates are less than 1-3%. One of the most common complications is the failure to obtain a satisfactory block of the ulnar nerve.
