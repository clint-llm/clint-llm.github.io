The leptomeningeal cyst (LMC) is an encapsulated mass occurring commonly in infants associated with skull fractures. The first description of the entity was made by Howship in 1816, as he described it as parietal bone absorption.

- Traumatic ventricular cysts.

- Cranio-cerebral erosions.

- Cranial malacia.

- Diploic cyst.

- Growing skull fracture.

- Cerebrocranial erosion.

However, the term leptomeningeal cyst itself appears as a misnomer as the pathology is an encephalocele consisting of brain parenchyma with CSF and leptomeningeal layers and not an actual cyst.
