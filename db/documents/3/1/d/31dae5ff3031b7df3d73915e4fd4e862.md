Patient evaluation should focus on signs and symptoms of decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Vital signs may show tachycardia and hypotension. The patientâ€™s mental status may be altered; cerebral infarcts may occur secondary to decreased oxygen delivery to the brain. Ischemic changes may be present on electrocardiography, and decreased urine output may be due to hypoperfusion. Laboratory studies may reveal metabolic acidosis, abnormal cardiac enzymes, or a base deficit.
