Hemorrhoids are cushions of nonpathological vascular tissue in the anal canal. Microscopically, they have been described as sinusoids because they lack muscle, as do veins.

The anal canal is roughly 4 cm long in adults, with the dentate line marking its midpoint. Internal hemorrhoids develop above the dentate line and are painless due to their visceral innervation. They are covered by columnar epithelium and are classified based on the degree of prolapse. Prominent vessels and no prolapse characterize grade 1 hemorrhoids. Grade 2 hemorrhoids prolapse with Valsalva but spontaneously reduce. Grade 3 hemorrhoids also prolapse with Valsalva but need to be manually reduced. Grade 4 hemorrhoids are chronically prolapsed and cannot undergo manual reduction.
