Lanugo, like all types of hair, is derived from the ectoderm. The cell types present in the hair follicle of lanugo hair include hair follicle stem cells (present in the bulge and matrix of the hair follicle), germinal matrix cells (form the hair shaft), mesenchymal cells (form the hair papilla), keratinocytes (form keratin in the epidermis), and fibroblasts (form collagen). While about 20 different cell types comprise the hair follicle of a lanugo hair, the cells mentioned above are the most relevant ones to clinical practice.
