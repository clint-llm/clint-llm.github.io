Temperature is one of the most important vital signs for all patients, including intensive care units (ICU). Fever or hypothermia often necessitates further physical evaluations, investigations, and changes in treatment in the ICU. Fever in ICU is defined as a temperature of = 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C ). It can be either infectious or non-infectious in origin. The fever in the ICU could merely be a continued manifestation of the disease/disorder that prompted the ICU admission or could result from certain unique etiologies in the ICU. Prompt evaluation, source identification, and treatment are crucial. This activity describes the pathways in the assessment and treatment of fever in ICU and highlights the importance of close interaction and coordination between various healthcare professional team members in ensuring a positive outcome.
