Routine screening for patent foramen ovale in divers is not recommended; however, it is reasonable to screen high-risk individuals such as those who suffer from a migraine with aura or congenital heart disease, or who have a family history of patent foramen ovale

Echocardiography with bubble contrast is the standard detection method for patent foramen ovale. Studies should be performed at rest and with provocative maneuvers, e.g., Valsalva. Transcranial Doppler is an inexpensive and non-invasive screening tool for patients with a suspected right-to-left shunt, but it cannot determine intracardiac shunt morphology
