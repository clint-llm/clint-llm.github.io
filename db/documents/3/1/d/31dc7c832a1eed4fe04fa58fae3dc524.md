Poromas are often misdiagnosed as other skin neoplasms because their clinical presentations are nonspecific and variable. In the study of Chen et al., the preoperative diagnoses of eccrine poroma were: pyogenic granuloma (five cases), soft fibroma (four cases), verruca vulgaris (three cases), hemangioma (two cases), pigmented nevus (one case), and basal cell carcinoma (one case). Other differentials may include squamous cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, hidradenomas, trichilemmoma, and other adnexal tumors.

The long-standing or chronic tumors of the limbs and head, namely squamous cell carcinoma, Paget’s disease, basal cell carcinoma, hidradenocarcinoma melanoma, can mimic inflamed poroma and metastatic cancer porocarcinoma.

Histologically, recognizing apocrine poroma may be sometimes difficult as it manifests a mixture of apocrine, sebaceous, and follicular differentiation in otherwise typical poroid tumors. A typical case of apocrine poroma was reported by Kamiya et al. and discussed the coexistence of basal-cell epithelioma and apocrine poroma, eccrine poroma, in association with trichoblastoma and also basal-cell epithelioma having sweat gland differentiation.
