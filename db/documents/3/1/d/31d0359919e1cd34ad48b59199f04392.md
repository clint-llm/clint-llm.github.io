Vasculitis is a heterogeneous group of pathologies characterized by inflammation of vessels. They share common links of clinical, laboratory, and pathophysiologic features. The clinical and pathological features are variable and depend on the site and type of blood vessels affected. Vasculitis may occur as a primary process or may also be secondary to another underlying disease. Diseases in which vasculitis is a primary process are called primary systemic vasculitides. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of vasculitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiologies of vasculitis medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate process for examination and evaluation of vasculitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for vasculitis.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance vasculitis and improve outcomes.
