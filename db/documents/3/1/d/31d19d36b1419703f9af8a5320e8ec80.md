There are no true medical contraindications to the cesarean section. A cesarean is an option if the pregnant patient is dead or dying or if the fetus is dead or dying. While there are ideal conditions for cesarean, such as the availability of anesthesia and antibiotics, and appropriate equipment, the absence of these is not a contraindication if the clinical scenario dictates.

Ethically, a cesarean is contraindicated if the pregnant patient refuses. Adequate education and counseling are crucial for informed consent. However, if the pregnant patient does not consent to have surgery performed upon her body, ultimately, it is her right as an autonomous patient.

There are some clinical scenarios in which a cesarean delivery may not be the preferred option. One could consider these relative contraindications. For example, a pregnant patient may have severe coagulopathy, which makes surgery extremely dangerous. In that case, vaginal delivery may be preferable. Alternatively, a patient with an extensive history of abdominal surgery may also be a poor surgical candidate. In the event of fetal demise, performing a cesarean exposes the pregnant patient to the risks of cesarean without any fetal benefit. The same considerations apply if the fetus has severe anomalies that are incompatible with life.
