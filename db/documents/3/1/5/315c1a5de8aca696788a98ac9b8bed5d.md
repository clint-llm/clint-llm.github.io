An interprofessional team approach is preferred in the management of patients with pituitary hyperplasia secondary to primary hypothyroidism. There may be a primary clinician involved, an endocrinologist, a neurosurgeon, and an ophthalmologist. Communication between the teams can improve patient outcomes by avoiding unnecessary surgery when thyroid hormone replacement is the primary modality of treatment, or perform a sight-saving surgery should an ophthalmologist feel this is necessary. The goal of the team is to overall provide the patient with optimal care in the most timely fashion. [Level 5]
