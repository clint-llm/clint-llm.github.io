The solubility of cystine in urine is about 250 mg/L at a pH of 7. This solubility increases as the urine becomes more alkaline, especially above pH 7. For example, 500 mg of cystine will dissolve in a liter of urine at a pH of 7.5. Cystine solubility goes up to 750 mg/L at a pH of 8, but it sometimes becomes challenging to achieve and maintain a urinary pH above 7.5 in clinical practice. There is also an increased risk of calcium phosphate precipitation in very alkaline urines.

The actual solubility of cystine in urine is actually somewhat greater than the standard solubility guidelines would suggest. This is due to the actions of various electrolytes, ions, and macromolecules. So while standard solubility estimates can be a guide, the actual solubility in an individual patient's urine can only be roughly estimated from the published data.
