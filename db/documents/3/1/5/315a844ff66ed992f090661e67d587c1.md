Surgical access to the trachea has been in practice since ancient times, but the modern era of tracheostomy started with Armand Trousseau, who used it to treat children suffering from diphtheria associated dyspnea in the mid-1800s.

Previously,Â the most common indication for tracheostomy was upper airway obstruction due to infectious diseases, but now, most of the pediatric tracheostomies are being done for prolonged ventilation, laryngotracheal stenosis, trauma, neurological disorders and airway obstruction due to craniofacial abnormalities. Many clinicians still consider pediatric tracheostomy to be a high-risk procedure, but recent evidence suggests that the inherent risk associated with it is not as high as previously perceived.
