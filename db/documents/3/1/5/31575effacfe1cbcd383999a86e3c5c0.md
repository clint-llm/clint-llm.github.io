Depending on the number of nasal optic nerve fibers affected, the extent of bitemporal hemianopsia can range from partial to complete. Complete bitemporal hemianopsia is more common, and patients with this condition have noted additional issues with binocular vision.Â The absence of any overlap between the intact nasal and impaired temporal visual fields leads to hemi-sliding, a phenomenon where the left and right nasal fields slide respective to each other instead of merging as a fused image.

The inferior nasal fibers which carry fibers from the retinal ganglion cells responsible for seeing objects in the contralateral superior temporal visual field, pass forward slightly in the contralateral optic nerve before they travel backward towards the lateral geniculate body. A compressive lesion here will result in an anterior chiasmal syndrome as described below.
