EKG, cardiac enzymes, CBC, and urinalysis (to check for myoglobin due to rhabdomyolysis) should be obtained.  Any patient that was in contact with a high voltage source should have continuous cardiac monitoring during evaluation.  One may also consider CT imaging of the head if the patient has altered mental status or associated head trauma from a fall or being thrown in a blast.
