**Atypical bone fractures**: Although the incidence remains low, an association with atypical bone fractures exists with prolonged bisphosphonate therapy. However, clinicians have also observed these fractures in those receiving denosumab for osteoporosis or metastatic bone disease. These fractures are usually located in the subtrochanteric region or along the shaft of the femur. Patients tend to feel prodromal pain from weeks to months leading up to the fracture. Fractures commonly occur with little to no trauma in the area. Experts are unsure at this time if the atypical fractures occur secondary to denosumab toxicity or the patient’s underlying osteoporosis. Patients should receive counseling regarding the potential for new hip or thigh pain and the contralateral limb examined if an atypical fracture is suspected. Upon diagnosis of an atypical fracture, possible discontinuation of denosumab is an option. If discontinued, consider initiating a different osteoporosis therapy due to increased fracture risk.

**Hypersensitivity**: Reports exist of clinically severe and anaphylactic reactions. Symptoms may include rash, pruritus, urticaria, facial edema, airway edema, and possibly hypotension. If these symptoms occur, initiate appropriate treatment and subsequently discontinue denosumab.

**Hypocalcemia**: Due to its anti-resorptive effects, denosumab has the potential to cause hypocalcemia. There is documentation of severe, even fatal, cases of denosumab-induced hypocalcemia. Those with severe renal dysfunction may have an increased risk of developing hypocalcemia. Clinicians should obtain serum calcium and preexisting hypocalcemia corrected at the initiation of treatment. In patients with preexisting hypocalcemia, serum calcium requires frequent monitoring. Use denosumab with caution in those who have predisposing conditions to hypocalcemia.

**Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)**: Reports of ONJ have been observed in those receiving denosumab. Symptoms may include jaw pain, tooth infection, bone, gingival erosion, and toothache. An increased risk of being diagnosed with ONJ correlates directly to the duration of denosumab exposure. Those with predisposing factors, such as poor dentition and recent tooth extraction, have a higher risk. If osteonecrosis of the jaw is suspected, make arrangements for a thorough dental exam. The risk of ONJ is considerably higher in patients with malignancy receiving denosumab than in patients with osteoporosis receiving denosumab. Denosumab should not be initiated until dental health is optimized. While on denosumab for cancer therapy, dental procedures are contraindicated. If ONJ is suspected, discontinue denosumab.

**Dermatologic reactions**: Reports of dermatitis, eczema, and rash have been observed. If symptoms are severe, consider discontinuation of denosumab.
