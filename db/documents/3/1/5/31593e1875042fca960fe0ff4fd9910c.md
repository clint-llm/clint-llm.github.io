Dialysis disequilibrium has been recognized for more than a half-decade, but the pathogenesis is not clearly understood. Below are the two commonly proposed theories:

- The reverse urea effect: Small solutes like urea are rapidly removed during hemodialysis, particularly in the setting of marked azotemia. Urea is usually considered an “ineffective” osmole because of its free diffusion across cell membranes. However, its natural diffusion lags behind the rapid removal of urea from the serum during hemodialysis, creating a transient osmotic gradient between plasma and brain cells. This leads to water shift into brain cells producing cerebral edema. Cerebral edema is further enhanced by the adaptive increase of brain aquaporin channels and the decrease of urea channels in advanced chronic kidney disease.

- Intracerebral acidosis: Studies have shown that there is a fall of intracellular pH in brain cells with concomitant carbon dioxide (PCO2) retention among patients after initiation of dialysis. The fall in pH causes sodium and potassium that are bound to proteins to disassociate, making them osmotically active.
