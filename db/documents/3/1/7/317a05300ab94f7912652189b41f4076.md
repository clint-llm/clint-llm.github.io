Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe disease that affects babies who are born early and need to be in the NICU. ItÂ causes breathing problems in babies and occurs because their lungs are not well developed and ready to do the work of breathing. These babies often need to have a breathing tube and are connected to a breathing machine to help them breathe. They may need several medications during their hospital stay to help with this lung disease. Some babies may also require home oxygen and may need to return to the hospital if they develop respiratory infections. Babies with BPD also need more energy and may require extra nutrition.

Babies who have BPD may develop other problems such as:

- Increased blood pressure

- Eye and ear problems

- Development problems

- Heart problems.

While in the NICU the doctors must be vigilant for these problems. Even after discharge, the baby may require followup for with doctors and developmental specialists.
