Commercially available EMG and NCS machines are available and typically contain the following components:

- Computer- for processing and graphing of electrical signals.

- Speakers- produce audible feedback directly related to levels of electrical activity.

- Printer- for graphical read-outs

- Amplifier- amplifies minute electrical activity to a level that can be recorded and interpreted.

- Stimulator- produces the applied electrical stimulus.

- Surface electrodes- for stimulation and recording of electrical impulses along skin during NCS.

- Disposable needle electrodes- for recording electrical impulses during EMG.
