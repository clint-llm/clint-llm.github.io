- Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder causing endothelial dysfunction resulting in corneal opacification.

- Pathognomonic findings include bilateral, symmetric corneal opacification presenting in the immediate neonatal period with increased corneal thickness, corneal edema, and thickening of the Descemet’s membrane.

- Current treatment requires grafting, either by PK or EK. DSAEK is associated with decreased postoperative complications and faster corneal recovery.

- New studies have shown certain Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatories such as glafenine, diclofenac, and nepafenac, to be highly effective at restoring water-flux activity in certain mutational types of patients with CHED and are promising potential treatments

- Early treatment avoids amblyopia but may increase surgical risk and postoperative complications.
