Although work has been done to create mosquito extracts for diagnostic testing, currently available extracts have limited use and a varying amount of antigen. At this point, the standard for clinical trials is the mosquito bite test. However, the limitation of this technique is the availability of disease-free laboratory-raised mosquitoes.

Most reactions are mild and self-limiting, making testing unnecessary. Also, by the time someone has an evaluation for possible mosquito-borne illness, their skin findings would have likely already resolved.
