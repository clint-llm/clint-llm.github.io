The patient begins sitting up, and their head is oriented 45 degrees toward the ear to be tested. The clinician then lies the patient down quickly with their head past the end of the bed and extends their neck 20 degrees below the horizontal, maintaining the initial rotation of the head. The clinician then watches the patient's eyes for torsional and up-beating nystagmus, which should start after a brief delay and persist for no more than one minute. This would indicate a positive test. If the test is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, the patient should be given a chance to recover for at least one minute, and then testing of the other ear can be undertaken. Lateral canal pathology may not be detected by this method, and a supine roll test may be done if this is suspected.
