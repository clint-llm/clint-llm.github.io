Blistering distal dactylitis (BDD) is a bacterial infection of the fingers presenting as multiple fluid-filled lesions. This condition is common in children and is localized to the volar fat pad of the distal phalanx of the digits. This activity describes the evaluation and management of blistering distal dactylitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the role of group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus in the etiology of blistering distal dactylitis.
- Describe the typical presentation of bullae in blistering distal dactylitis.
- Review the use of incision and drainage, wet dressing and systemic antibiotics in the management of blistering distal dactylitis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by blistering distal dactylitis.
