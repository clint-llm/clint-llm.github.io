TTH is among the most common reasons to see a primary care physician. Their primary care physicians diagnose most of these patients. They are referred to a neurologist when they have mixed features of other primary disorders or are treatment unresponsive. Along with pharmacological treatment, many patients require physical therapy and psychotherapy. Effective communication between various healthcare providers can lead to more favorable outcomes.
