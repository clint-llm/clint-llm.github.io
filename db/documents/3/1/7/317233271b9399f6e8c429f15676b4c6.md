A patient presenting with significant trauma to the face requires extensive evaluation and should be managed in accordance with the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines.

After addressing acute life threats, a secondary head-to-toe trauma evaluation should be completed. The head should be examined for scalp hematomas, lacerations, and depressed skull fractures. Assess for signs of a basilar skull fracture, including peri-orbital ecchymosis, known as "raccoon eyes," and retro-auricular ecchymosis, also known as "Battle sign" and hemotympanum.

Attempt to obtain all available history from the patient, medics, family, and bystanders. Determine the mechanism of injury and the patient's past medical history. In cases of a motor vehicle collision, determine seat belt use, airbag deployment, steering wheel deformity, and condition of the vehicle. Perform a review of systems in patients that are responsive. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and alterations in consciousness are concerning for acute intracranial injury.

Stable patients with a cribriform plate fracture will likely present with post-traumatic midface pain and epistaxis. All such patients require thorough exams of the head, neck, face, ears, nose, and throat. If the epistaxis resolves but clear rhinorrhea persists, this is highly concerning for a post-traumatic CSF leak.
