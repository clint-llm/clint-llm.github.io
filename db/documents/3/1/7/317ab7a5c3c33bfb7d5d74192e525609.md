There are no known overdose reports of eplerenone, but the most likely manifestations of overdose would be hypotension or hyperkalemia.  Researchers have not observed any lethality in overdose studies in mice, rats, or dogs, but dogs demonstrated emesis, salivations, and tremors at a concentration 41 times the human therapeutic concentration of eplerenone. These progressed to sedation and convulsions at higher exposures.

Should toxicity occur, eplerenone binds extensively to charcoal but is not removable by hemodialysis. There is no specific antidote to eplerenone; thus, supportive treatment for hypotension or hyperkalemia would be necessary. Eplerenone is not dialyzable.
