The role of guanylyl cyclase is prominent in congestive heart failure, as ANP is elevated. The ventricles and the atria release atrial natriuretic peptide and B-type brain natriuretic peptide in response to increased stretch. The guanylyl cyclase also mediates penile erection through binding of nitric oxide to soluble guanylyl cyclase, as the soluble guanylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of guanosine 5’ triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine 3’, 5’ monophosphate (cGMP).
