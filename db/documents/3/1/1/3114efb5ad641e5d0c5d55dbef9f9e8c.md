**Photoreceptors (rods and cones)**: Rods and cones contain both an outer and inner segment, and their structural distinction are visible via an electron microscope. The outer segments of rod include a set of membranous discs that resemble a stack of coins.

**Bipolar cells**: Bipolar cells are unique in that they have both a dendritic process above and an axon terminal below.

**Retinal ganglion cells**: These cells present as having a large cell body with a dendritic tree.

**Amacrine cells**: The processes of these cells have characteristics of both axons and dendrites, allowing for pre- and postsynaptic transmission.

**Muller cells**: These are unique looking cells as they can be characterized by their length, extending from the outer nuclear layer to the most inner retina.
