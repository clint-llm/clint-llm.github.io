PICCs are generally inserted safely, but complications may arise relating to device insertion, functionality, or post-procedure infection. The most common complications tend to be vascular in nature.

In addition to arterial injury, peripheral nerves and brachial nerve plexuses present in the upper extremity may be damaged.

Mechanical catheter occlusions can occur by either intraluminal or extraluminal causes.Â Intraluminal obstruction most commonly occurs from coagulated blood or products of infusion that have precipitated. Extraluminal obstruction usually results from fibrin sheath formation, thrombus at the tip, or incorrect catheter positioning.

Catheter-related infections are a fairly common occurrence. A study by Nasia et al. concluded that the PICC-associated bloodstream infection rate was 2.4% or 2 to 5 per 1000 catheter days.
