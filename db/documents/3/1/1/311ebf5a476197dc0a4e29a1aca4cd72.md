In trauma centers, a trauma team is developed to provide a safe and efficient evaluation of the trauma patient. These members should be available within minutes of a trauma team activation. This interprofessional team should have the following members who have pre-assigned roles.

- Team leader (physician)

- Anesthesiologist

- Trauma surgeon

- Emergency department physician

- Two nurses (at least)

- Radiographer

- Scribe

Other staff may not necessarily be involved in every trauma call but should be available readily if needed:

- Neurosurgeon

- Thoracic surgeon

- Plastic surgeon

- Radiologist
