The development of the circadian system occurs in mammals postnatally. The fetus is not subjected to external stimuli while in the womb, and thus neonates are born with an immature functioning system. The establishment of the 24-hour circadian rhythms occurs during the first 4 months of life as the newborn experiences rapid physiological changes and adapts to the environment. Since core body temperature is one of the most tightly regulated systems, deviations, among other things, reveal the establishment of circadian rhythm.Â  Minimal deviations occur in the womb, but in the first few weeks of life, the perception of day and night differences begin. Spikes in core body temperature also begin to manifest just before the onset and first few hours of sleep. Melatonin, critical to the permanent establishment of circadian rhythms, emerges around 3 months of age. The production of cortisol, a key indicator of a properly functioning circadian rhythm, can occur as early as 8 weeks up to 9 months of age. As infants experience rapid physiological changes just after birth, deviations in core body temperature, as well as the production of melatonin and cortisol allow an infant to establish a stable circadian rhythm.
