Psychiatric disorders are a huge problem in the United States and internationally. According to the American Psychiatric Association, about 25% of United States adults are diagnosed with a mental health disorder each year. Disability caused by psychiatric disorders are overwhelming for patients, and the financial burden on the economy is immense. Based on a 2002 publication, the cost of schizophrenia treatment alone was about $63 billion.

Before introducing pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders, approximately 10,000 leucotomies were done in the United States and the United Kingdom.
