Anytime a foreign body is introduced into a patient even on a superficial level, there is no risk of bleeding, local irritation, or infection.Â Complications of acupuncture were briefly mentioned previously under contraindications; they are the same as with any procedure that involves needles: infection, disease transmission, trauma, nerve injury, and bleeding. Also, dependent upon where the acupuncture is being performed, there is a risk of pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum or even organ puncture.

Overall, complications from acupuncture are infrequent and are generally associated with less qualified or experienced practitioners.
