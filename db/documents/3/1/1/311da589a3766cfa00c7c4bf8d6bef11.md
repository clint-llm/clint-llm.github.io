Given the asymptomatic or mild presentation and a wide range of symptoms for adult tapeworm infections, the diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion based on the patient's travel or exposure history of endemic regions. Patients in endemic regions who present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or constipation merit stool microscopy. Given the low sensitivity of stool microscopy, negative results should not eliminate tapeworm infection from the differential; however, a broad differential for abdominal pain should be maintained to include other infectious etiologies (bacterial diarrhea, viral syndromes) or chronic inflammatory disorders. Repeat testing or empiric treatment may be necessary.

In most cases, stool microscopy can correctly diagnose the genus of tapeworm; however, there has been misidentifications given the similar shape, size or appearance of various parasitic eggs.Taenia species as T. solium is at risk for causing neurocysticercosis while T. saginata is not.

As stated above for NCC, this diagnosis requires imaging and serology interpretation. The differential for multiple ring-enhancing lesions of the brain is broad, to include bacterial (abscess, tuberculosis, syphilis), fungal (coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis), parasitic (toxoplasmosis, echinococcosis), neoplastic (metastasis, CNS lymphoma), and inflammatory (multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis).
