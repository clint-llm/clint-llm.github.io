As these tumors arise in the medullary portion of the bone, their expansile properties may ultimately result in pathologic fracture as the cartilaginous tumor encroaches on the cortical bone. If surgery is delayed until fractionÂ union has occurred, the patient may be exposed to extended periods of immobilization. Hospital costs are also higher for patients treated with primary surgery for their pathologic fracture. Patients treated with primary surgery of the pathologic fracture had a shorter time to return to work than the delayed surgical candidates whose procedure was held until fracture union.

Malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma usually occurs following skeletal maturity. Transformation of a singular enchondromatous lesion is rare, less than 1%.
