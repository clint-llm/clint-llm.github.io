Blood investigations can show lymphocytosis or eosinophilia.S. hominis and 11 to 13 days for S. suihominis. Oocyst/sporocyst excretion may last for around a month.

Fecal studies can include different flotation techniques, modified Kato thick smear, formalin-ether technique, or direct smear.

Accurate and sensitive diagnostic tests do not currently exist for Sarcocyst infections. Immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and serological methods such as antibodies to Sarcocystis have been tried in the past but are not widely available.
