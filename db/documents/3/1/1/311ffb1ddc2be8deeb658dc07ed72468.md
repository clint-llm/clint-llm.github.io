The Lahey, Mortons, and Van Overbeek staging systems are used for evaluation of a Zenker's diverticulum. These staging systems are used to describe the degree of the Zenker's diverticulum, usually in the sense of pouch size. Barium swallow with videofluoroscopy is the radiographic methods used for staging.

The LaheyÂ classification is often used to stage Zenker diverticulum and includes the following:

- Stage 1: Small mucosal protrusion is visible

- Stage ll: A definite sac is seen bu the esophagus and hypopharynx are in line

- Stage lll: The hypopharynx is seen in line with the diverticulum and the esophagus is pushed anteriorly and appears indented.
