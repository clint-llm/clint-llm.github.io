Parent education is essential for ensuring the successful treatment of children diagnosed with SAD. Parents benefit from learning reinforcement techniques that lessen anxiety in children and deter avoidance behaviors. Some parents may also benefit from treatment for their anxiety or mental health issues contributing to their child’s psychopathology.

Parents and caregivers should be educated regarding the expected treatment duration, the length of time before effect onset, and the potential adverse effects of psychopharmacological treatment. Finally, parents should be heavily involved in CBT and be educated regarding the principles of positive and negative reinforcement patterns so behavioral improvement can continue at home.

Although the condition cannot be prevented per se, patients can significantly benefit from early diagnosis. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening of children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 years for anxiety disorders using validated screening tools such as SCARED.
