It isÂ critical to differentiate intracerebral hemorrhage from lacunar hemorrhages. Intracerebral hemorrhages occur due to microaneurysm formation in the LSAs versus lacunar hemorrhages that occur secondary to ischemia and reperfusion injuries. Although they both have systemic hypertension as an important predisposing risk factor, patients with lacunar hemorrhage are more likely to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and a higher body mass index.
