Symptoms include fever and signs of meningism (nuchal rigidity, headache, photophobia, decreased mental status, seizures, or moribund).

With ventriculitis secondary to catheters, trauma, or neurosurgery, the onset is more subtle, and often there is a relative lack of fever and severe presenting symptoms, reflecting the predilection for immunocompromised patients.

Patients can present with features of obstructive hydrocephalus, particularly in infants with inflammatory aqueduct obstruction.
