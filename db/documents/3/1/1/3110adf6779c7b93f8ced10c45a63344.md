Pudendal nerve entrapment is a potentially challenging condition to diagnose because there are no specific diagnostic tests. The clinician needs to realize that it is exceedingly mandatory to get a thorough history and perform a detailed physical examination to reach a diagnosis.

If the patient fulfills all the "Nantes" criteria, no further investigation is generally needed to make the diagnosis. However, if the patient lacks any of the criteria, further evaluation should be pursued.

**The "Nantes" Criteria**

Inclusion criteria:

- Pain co-relates with the anatomical distribution of the pudendal nerve. (The pudendal nerve supplies the external genitalia and perineum. The pain can be superficial or deep in the vulvovaginal and anorectal areas as well as in the distal urethra.)

- Pain is predominantly in the sitting position. This symptom favors nerve compression because a decrease in nerve mobility makes it vulnerable to compressive trauma when pressed against hard ligamentous structures. This aspect of pain is dynamic as the pain results from compression and not from a sitting position alone.

- The patient does not get up at night due to pain, although many patients may experience difficulty going to sleep because of pain.

- There is no identifiable sensory loss. The presence of superficial perineal sensory impairment indicates a sacral root-lesion rather than pudendal nerve entrapment.

- Relief of pain occurs with a pudendal nerve block. This essential criterion is not specific, as any perineal disease other than entrapment can cause pain in the anatomic region of the pudendal nerve. A negative block also doesn't necessarily exclude the diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment if the block is placed incorrectly or performed too distally.

**Complementary Diagnostic Criteria**

- Pain is described as burning, shooting, or stabbing in nature and is associated with numbness

- Allodynia or hyperpathia

- Foreign body sensation or heaviness in the rectum or vagina

- The pain progressively increases and peaks in the evening but stops when the patient lies down and sleeps

- Pain is more on one side

- Pain is more prominent posteriorly and is triggered minutes or hours after defecation

- Tenderness felt around the ischial spine during a digital vaginal or rectal examination

- An abnormal result on neurophysiological tests

**Exclusion Criteria**

- Pain exclusively in the territory not served by the pudendal nerve, such as the hypogastrium, coccyx, pubis, or gluteus areas

- Pain is associated with pruritus (more suggestive of a skin lesion)

- Pain that is entirely paroxysmal in nature

- An imaging abnormality that identifies the cause of the pain

**Associated Signs**

- Pain in the buttock

- Referred sciatic pain

- Pain in the medial thigh (indicates obturator nerve involvement)

- Pain in the suprapubic region

- Increased frequency of urination or pain with a full bladder

- Pain after ejaculation

- Pain worsens hours after sexual intercourse

- Erectile dysfunction

- A normal result on electrophysiological tests

**Diagnostic Tests**

The following tests can help in the diagnosis:

- Quantitative warm sensory threshold testing works on the principle that compressed nerves cannot efficiently detect and transmit changes in vibration and temperature sensation. Thus patients with nerve injuries are unable to detect gradual temperature changes.

- Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency testing is a neurophysiological examination that measures the time it takes for a nerve signal to travel from the ischial spine to the anal sphincter. It is more invasive, challenging to perform, and uncomfortable for the patient than warm sensory threshold testing.

- High-frequency ultrasonography is helpful in the detection of the site of compression. Compressed nerves and associated veins appear flat, whereas inflamed nerves appear edematous.

- Doppler ultrasound has a role in the diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment. As the pudendal nerve and vessels course together in a neurovascular bundle, it can be assumed that if there is nerve compression, venous compression will also occur, which is diagnosable with a doppler ultrasound.

- MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the pelvis is recommended as it can help rule out other causes of chronic pain. The advancement of MRI techniques in evaluating peripheral nerves provides a detailed description of the anatomy, fascicular details, the blood supply of the nerve, and detailed 3-D anatomy.

- Functional MRI assesses nerve integrity based on its biological properties. Currently, it is considered experimental and not considered definitive.

- Diagnostic nerve blocks: In females, an unguided block can be performed vaginally, and in males, transperineally. If there is pain relief immediately following the procedure, it indicates that pudendal nerve pathology is the likely cause of pain. The absence of pain relief doesn't necessarily mean that the patient doesn't have pudendal entrapment, as there may be a technical or operative error as well. Image guidance (using fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or CT scan imaging) significantly increases the reliability of the nerve blocks.

- Pudendal nerve block injections with a local anesthetic have been recommended to help confirm the diagnosis of pudendal nerve entrapment, especially if the injection is done directly into Alcock's canal using image guidance. This is often used as an indicator of which patients are most likely to benefit from decompressive surgery.
