Two types of bacteria can cause rat-bite fever and cause two separate types of illness.

**Spirillosis**

Rat-bite fever transmitted by the gram-negative coiled rod (Spirillum minus) is very rare and is found in Asia. It is also called Sodoku.

**Streptobacillosis**

Streptobacillosis is a more common form of rat-bite fever, and it is also known as epidemic arthritic erythema. It is caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis and is transmitted by rat bite or ingestion of contaminated products usually milk (Haverhill fever).
