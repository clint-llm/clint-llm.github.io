All studies have shown that numerous factors were beyond the scope and control of the research, which invariably affects the rate of development of post-mortem changes in real-life scenarios; this requires the use of multiple methods of estimating PMI to help establish a reliable timeline.

This is further complicated by slight variations in sample collection and processing, combined with the individual variations in the temperatures at the time of death (body and ambient), clothing worn by the deceased, circumstances of death (including the cause of death, preservation after death, exposure to the elements, etc.), methods of retrieval as well as storage and preservation of samples before analysis all affect the estimation of PMI in a deceased.
