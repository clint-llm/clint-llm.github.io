Children affected by HLH will invariably die if left untreated, whereas adults can have spontaneous remission without recurrence. Admittedly, it is more difficult to obtain accurate estimates of adult fatality rates since it is often unclear whether deaths are the direct results of HLH or the underlying trigger (infection or malignancy). Retrospective studies have demonstrated a 3-year survival rate of 55% in children who received treatment with HLH-94. In children who survived to undergo BMT, 3-year survival rates reached 62%.
