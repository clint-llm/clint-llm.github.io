Acute occlusion of the basilar artery is potentially life-threatening. All patients should be admitted to a stroke unit when available. Recanalization of the basilar artery is key to the successful treatment of basilar artery thrombosis and to improving prognosis. This can be accomplished by systemic thrombolysis (IVT), intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT), or mechanical endovascular thrombectomy. Recanalization occurs in more than half of basilar artery occlusion patients treated with IAT or IVT. Treatment is time-sensitive; the earlier the intervention, the better the functional outcomes. There is no good large-scale study to define the treatment window for basilar thrombosis. It is clearly much longer than the accepted window of 6 to 8 hours recommended for large vessel occlusion in anterior circulation infarct. The commonly accepted time window is at least 12 hours and potentially up to 24 hours.  In some situations, if the patient is having symptoms and minimal stroke on the MRI brain it is reasonable to consider for mechanical endovascular thrombectomy up to 2-3 days. Subsequent therapy for secondary prevention focuses on treating the underlying causes and modifying risk factors.
