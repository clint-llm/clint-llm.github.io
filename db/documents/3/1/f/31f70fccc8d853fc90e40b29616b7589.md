**Take-home points**

- One of the most important considerations in the treatment of lactational mastitis is the need to continue to empty the breasts – encourage patients to continue to breastfeed if desired, and if not, encourage the use of a breast pump or hand expression.

- Lactational mastitis can be managed conservatively with supportive measures for the first 12 to 24 hours. If symptoms do not improve after this period, antibiotics should be started.

- If symptoms of lactational mastitis do not improve in 24 to 28 hours, consider the possibility of a breast abscess, and obtain an ultrasound.

- Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare condition that is often mistaken for breast carcinoma. A biopsy must be done to diagnose this condition and to rule out more serious pathology.

- The majority of patients with mastitis can be managed as outpatients. Examples of scenarios in which a patient may require hospitalization include the following: hemodynamic instability, intolerance to oral intake, severe dehydration, and recurrent infection that has failed outpatient management.
