Contraindications of penicillin include a previous history of severe allergic reactions or penicillin and its derivatives. Penicillin is also contraindicated in patients who have had Stevens-Johnson syndrome after administering penicillin or a penicillin derivative. The penicillins are safe to use during pregnancy and nursing, as the drug appears at a low concentration in breastmilk. Penicillin has an antagonistic effect with tetracycline and reportedly can lead to 2.6 times greater risk for mortality when treating pneumococcal meningitis than using penicillin alone.

Nearly all antibacterial agents have been linked to Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD), including penicillin, with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. The use of antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, causing the overgrowth of C. difficile. This strain produces toxins A and B that contribute to the development of CDAD. During infections caused by hyper toxin-producing strains of C. difficile, the rate of morbidity and mortality can be increased since these infections are often resistant to antimicrobial treatments and may require colectomy. When C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic treatment is recommended to stop. Depending on clinical need, protein supplementation, fluid and electrolyte management, antibiotic treatment, and surgical evaluation should be implemented.
