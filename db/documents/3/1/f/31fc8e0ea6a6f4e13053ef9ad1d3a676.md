ManagingÂ Lp-X-induced hyperlipidemia could create a dilemma that requires a team of clinicians to come up with proper treatment. There should be interprofessional communication between specialists from gastroenterology and endocrinology regarding the management of severe hyperlipidemia caused by obstructive liver dysfunction. The gastroenterologist helps relieve the obstruction via ERCP, and the endocrinologist helps decide when to initiate lipid-lowering medications. Nursing staff in all specialties can counsel the patient, coordinate activities between specialists, and ensure the patient is following their treatment plan. Good coordination of care between these physicians will improve outcomes and patient safety. [Level 5]
