The trachea is a tube-like structure beginning at the base of the cricoid cartilage and extending to the carina. It has cervical and thoracic portions, separated at the level of the thoracic inlet above and below respectively. It includes 18 to 22 D-shaped rings which are cartilaginous anteriorly and laterally and membranous posteriorly. Blood supply to the cervical portions of the trachea comes from branches of the subclavian artery where they enter laterally and anastomose superiorly, inferiorly, and anteriorly. Thoracic portions receive their blood supply from the bronchial arteries which branch off the aorta. The trachea is near the esophagus, vagus nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerves, thyroid, carotid arteries, jugular veins, innominate arteries and veins, the pulmonary trunk, the azygos vein, and the aorta with the vertebra and spinal cord posteriorly.

With so many vital structures adjacent to the trachea, the majority of patients with tracheal injuries may expire before arrival at an emergency department. The major causes of tracheal injury include iatrogenic, blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, inhalation and aspiration of liquids or objects.

One of the most crucial factors for reducing morbidity and mortality is early detection.
