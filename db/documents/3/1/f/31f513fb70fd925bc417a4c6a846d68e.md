Diagnosis of ESES is by demonstrating bilateral (rarely unilateral) continuous or near-continuous slow (1.5 to 3 Hz), diffuse, or bilateral, spike-wave discharges during NREM-sleep. During wakefulness and REM sleep, only intermittent focal or multifocal epileptiform discharges or slow waves are present; an inadequate sampling of EEG during NREM sleep may entirely miss the diagnosis. Sporadic frontotemporal or centrotemporal interictal epileptiform discharges during wakefulness become significantly activated during sleep with disruption of typical sleep background. There is controversy concerning the minimum threshold of spike-wave activity during NREM sleep for a formal diagnosis of ESES. Different studies quoted a widely variable range of 25 to 85%, but most commonly 85% or 50 % spike-wave index thresholds have been accepted for diagnosis of ESES.
