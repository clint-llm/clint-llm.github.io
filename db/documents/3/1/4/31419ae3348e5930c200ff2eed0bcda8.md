There are three main histological patterns of gastrointestinal stromal tumors: spindle cell type (70%), epithelioid cell type (20%), and mixed type (10%).

In addition to the appropriate morphologic findings, the immunohistochemical analysis represents the basis for the diagnosis of GIST. The most common markers are KIT and anoctamin 1. Approximately 95% of GISTs stain positive for KIT. For the remaining 5%, anoctamin 1, otherwise known as diagnosed on GIST 1 (DOG1), along with CD34, is considered diagnostic with the appropriate morphologic features.
