Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused many pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. These include:

- Spontaneous pneumomediastinum was reported in about 12% of cases in one study

- Renal and hepatic impairment

- Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia

- Diastolic cardiac dysfunction

- Pulmonary hypertension

- Neurologic disorders

- Rhabdomyolysis

- Nosocomial infections, including bacteremia, catheter-related sepsis, and pneumonia

- Corticosteroid treatment was trialed in the early phase of the SARS epidemic before proving not to be beneficial. Complications of prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy such as avascular necrosis and disseminated fungal infection were identified in SARS patients on these therapies.
