The risk of missed injuries. This risk may be higher for the following injuries:

- Abdominal Trauma; hollow viscus injury and retroperitoneal injuries may be missed

- Blunt Trauma: Bowel injury, pancreatic and duodenal injuries, diaphragmatic rupture

- Penetrating Trauma: Rectal injuries

- Thoracic Trauma: Aortic injuries, pericardial tamponade, esophageal perforation

- Extremity Trauma: distal extremity fractures, compartment syndrome

- Blood loss in the pelvis may be under-estimated

Note that to avoid the risk of any missed injuries a tertiary survey should be required in patients with multisystem trauma.

Frequent evaluation is needed in order to recognize any complication such as compartment syndrome.  High index of suspicion and frequent revealuation are important to avoid missing injuries.

Transfer to a trauma center is required when injuries exceed institutional capabilities.  Transfer should not be delayed for specilaized diagnostic tests. Transfer process should be initiated once stablized.
