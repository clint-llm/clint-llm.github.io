The creation of the first blood gas apparatus can be attributed to John Severinghaus, Leland Clark, and multiple other inventors with their respective contributions. This adjunct to standard care practices revolutionized the assessment of critical patients. Contemporary devices have evolved from the apparatus originally used by Severinghaus, but the techniques underlying blood gas detection are largely unchanged. Notably, modern devices reach temperatures of approximately 37 degrees centigrade. In many cases, this temperature is within the margin of error for an approximation of the patient’s temperature. However, in cases of hyperthermic or hypothermic patients, there must be consideration of the influence of temperature upon the detected partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), and pH. In this article, arterial blood gas detection will be described with attention to methods of management as they relate to the temperature correction.
