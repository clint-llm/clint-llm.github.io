The cavernous sinuses (one on each side of the sella turcica, above and lateral to the sphenoid sinuses, anteriorly superior orbital fissure and posteriorly petrous part of the temporal lobe) are trabeculated cavernous spaces created by the layers of dura mater and filled with venous blood. This blood drains the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins and superficial cortical veins anteriorly and then drains into the basilar plexus posteriorly via the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses.

The cavernous sinus has been coined the “anatomic jewel box” because it shares an intimate relationship with several important structures. Within the lumen of the cavernous sinuses pass the horizontal segment of the internal carotid artery, the sympathetic plexus and cranial nerve VI (abducens) medially. Whereas the outer layers of the lateral wall of the carotid sinus are traversed by cranial nerves III (oculomotor), V (the first and second branches, ophthalmic and maxillary, of the trigeminal) and IV (trochlear).

Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis occurs from the following:

- Local spread, often from valveless facial and ophthalmic veins

- Adjacent infections, such as sinusitis (possibly the most common cause), especially sphenoiditis and ethmoiditis (Press)

- Facial cellulitis or abscess (especially within the danger triangle of the face, formed by the corners of mouth and bridge of the nose)

- Periorbital and orbital cellulitis

- Pharyngitis

- Tonsillitis

- Otitis media

- Mastoiditis

- Dental infections

The mechanism is due to

1. Embolization of bacteria and other infectious organisms which trigger thrombosis which then can trap infection within the cavernous sinus.

2. Cavernous sinus thrombosis leads to decreased drainage from the facial vein and superior and inferior ophthalmic veins resulting in facial and periorbital edema, ptosis, proptosis, chemosis, discomfort and pain with eye muscle movement, papilledema, retinal venous distention, and loss of vision. Lack of valves in the dural sinus system allows flow through the emissary veins into and out of the cavernous sinus and thrombus can propagate into the dural system. Also, communication between the right and left cavernous sinuses via the intercavernous sinuses, anterior and posterior to the sella, allows the spread of thrombus and infection from one side to the other.

Local compression and inflammation of cranial nerves can lead to several partial or complete cranial neuropathies including:

- Diplopia from partial or complete external ophthalmoplegia due to compression of the sixth (abducens), third (oculomotor) and fourth (trochlear) nerves. Limited eye abduction from abducens palsy is most common early finding, often progressing to inability to move the eye in any direction when III, IV and VI are involved

- Internal ophthalmoplegia (non-reactive pupil) occurs from loss of sympathetic fibers from the short ciliary nerves (resulting in miosis) and/or from loss of parasympathetic fibers from cranial nerve III (resulting in mydriasis)

- Numbness or paresthesias (around the eyes, nose, forehead) and loss of corneal blink reflex from the ophthalmic nerve, a branch of the trigeminal nerve (V)

- Facial pain, paresthesias or numbness from compression of the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve.

Septic cavernous venous thrombosis can result in the central nervous system or infectious pulmonary complications. Because the dural venous and cavernous system is valveless, this venous blood can communicate with the dural sinuses and cerebral and emissary veins leading to meningitis, dural empyema or brain abscess. Infection can spread via the jugular vein to the pulmonary vasculature resulting in septic emboli or abscess, pneumonia or empyema.

Stroke can occur following carotid artery narrowing, vasculitis, or hemorrhagic infarction following progression to cortical vein thrombosis.

Hypopituitarism can occur due to ischemia or the direct spread of infection.
