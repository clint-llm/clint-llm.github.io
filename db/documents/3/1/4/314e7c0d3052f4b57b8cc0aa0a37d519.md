Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication, first approved for use in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993. The FDA-approved indications for oral risperidone (tablets, oral solution, and M-TABs) include the treatment of:

- Schizophrenia (in adults and children aged 13 and up)

- Bipolar I acute manic or mixed episodes as monotherapy (in adults and children aged ten and up)

- Bipolar I acute manic or mixed episodes adjunctive with lithium or valproate (in adults)

- Autism-associated irritability (in children aged five and up)

The long-acting risperidone injection has received FDA approval in the treatment of schizophrenia and maintenance of bipolar disorder (as monotherapy or adjunctive to valproate or lithium) in adults.

There are many varied non-FDA-approved uses for risperidone. It has been used to treat psychotic symptoms when they are present. It has also been used for borderline personality, delusional disorder, delirium, depression, brain injury, pedophilia, PTSD, bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, Lesch-Nyhan, Tourette, trichotillomania, stuttering, movement disorders, and developmental disorders.
