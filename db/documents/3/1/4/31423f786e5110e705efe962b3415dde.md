NORSE and its subtype FIRES are relatively uncommon disorders, with most epidemiological data coming from case series. NORSE and FIRES have been reported in previously healthy young adults and school-aged children. However, adults â‰¥ 60 years have also been affected. It has been observed that females are affected more than males amongst adults, whereas boys are more frequently affected than girls in the pediatric population.

Due to the lack of a clear definition of NORSE previously, it is possible that some of the cases were not diagnosed as NORSE. Hence, an accurate incidence of NORSE cannot be estimated reliably. However, it is estimated that NORSE represents approximately 20% of cases of RSE.
