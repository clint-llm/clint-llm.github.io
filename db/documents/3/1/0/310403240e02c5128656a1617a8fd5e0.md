Universal precautions and aseptic techniques should be followed for all procedures. Site selection is the key first step before scalp vein catheterization. After eliminating sites that meet potential contraindications criteria, it is necessary to choose a vein that is visible, of adequate caliber to fit the catheter, and that follows a relatively straight path--tortuous veins make the advancement of the catheter challenging.

Ultrasound guidance by trained personnel may become necessary and may enhance the success of scalp vein catheterization. Utilize an elastic constricting band (like a rubber band) around the scalp. The ideal placement is caudal to the location of the vein being catheterized. Gentle pressure at that site can also be applied with your or an assistantâ€™s hands. If using a circumferential band, it should be placed distal to the catheterization site but superior to the ears and eyes, which should not be compressed. The compression and/or tourniquet will distend veins and improve visualization.

If the scalp vein site identified is within the hair, clipping hair short (or shaving) is indicated to allow for maximal visualization. When possible, a location within the hairline will reduce the risk of visible scars. Once identified, prepare the skin by disinfecting the overlaying area with alcohol or chlorhexidine. If blood cultures are to be obtained, the skin should be prepared according to aseptic protocols at your institution.
