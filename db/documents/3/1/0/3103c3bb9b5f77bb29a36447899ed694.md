The thoracic wall receives vascular supply from branches of the subclavian artery and the thoracic aorta. These larger vessels give off smaller tributaries such as the internal thoracic arteries, posterior intercostal, and subcostal arteries. The latissimus dorsi muscle gets its supply from the thoracodorsal artery, the trapezius by the transverse muscular branches, the teres major by the subscapular and circumflex scapular arteries, and the infraspinatus by the suprascapular and circumflex scapular arteries. Inside the thorax lies the heart, the ascending thoracic aorta, the aortic arch, and its branches, and the descending thoracic aorta; this is important relative to performing resuscitative thoracotomies in response to severe thoracic or abdominal trauma where the patient has entered into some form of cardiac arrest. Â Clinicians can control thoracic hemorrhage, relieve tamponade, and repair injuries to underlying organs.
