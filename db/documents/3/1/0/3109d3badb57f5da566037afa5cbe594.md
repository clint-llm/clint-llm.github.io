Electron microscopy of lymphocytes shows many prominent polyribosomes. Some note that it is possible to differentiate between T and B cells under EM, with T cells having an electron-dense cytoplasm and euchromatin nucleus. Some studies have also noted that on surface examination, T cells have a smoother surface than B cells. There is no way to differentiate the types of T cells.
