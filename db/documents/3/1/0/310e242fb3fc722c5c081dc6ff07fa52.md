Distal clavicular osteolysis is almost exclusively a diagnosis of young athletes and weight lifters, particularly those engaging in repetitive pressing or overhead activities. However, there is no limit to the age at which DCO can occur physiologically. Historically, DCO was exclusively a disease of young male weightlifters and athletes, but it is now known to appear in females engaged in similar provoking activities.

A retrospective study of 1,432 MRI results of 13Â to 19-year-olds with shoulder pain attributed 6.5% of the cases to DCO based on imaging findings, 24% of whom were female.
