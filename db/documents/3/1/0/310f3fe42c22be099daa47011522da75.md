Lesions in Broca area in the inferior frontal lobe can lead to loss of verbal fluency. Whereas, lesions in the Wernicke area lead to impaired comprehension.  Patients with lesions in either Broca or Wernicke area will have impaired repetition. However, there is a group of patients with relatively intact comprehension and verbal fluency but will display severely impaired repetition. A lesion such as a stroke or a tumor affecting the arcuate fasciculus which connects Broca and Wernicke areas can lead to this condition. More recent evidence suggests that lesions of the left superior temporal gyrus, the left supramarginal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobe (Brodmann area 40), the left primary auditory cortices (Brodmann area 41 and 42), and the insula, can all lead to this condition.
