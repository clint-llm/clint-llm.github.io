The semitendinosus muscle is a member of the posterior component of the thigh, which also includes the biceps femoris and the semimembranosus muscles. These three muscles together are collectively referred to as the hamstring muscle complex, which serves as hip extensors and knee flexors that are integral to gait and running.
