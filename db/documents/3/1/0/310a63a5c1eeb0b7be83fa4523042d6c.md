The overall prognosis of hypocalcemia is good as it can be easily corrected. In rare cases, patients with complete parathyroidectomy require very high doses of calcium and vitamin D supplements to maintain calcium in the normal range. Patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery usually have malabsorption and may also require very high doses of calcium and vitamin D to correct hypocalcemia.
