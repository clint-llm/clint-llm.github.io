Potential vision testing allows the clinician to better determine the cause of vision loss when media opacities are present in combination with other possible visual system disorders.  These other disorders include:

- Macular disease

- Optic nerve disease

- A brain disorder affecting the visual tracts and the visual cortex

- Amblyopia

- Malingering

- A patient that is unable to respond or cooperate with a regular vision test

- A patient with non-organic vision loss

Media opacities that can be distinguished include:

- Cataract

- Posterior capsular opacity

- Corneal opacity

- Corneal irregularity

- Vitreous opacities such as hemorrhage

Thorough knowledge of tests of potential vision allows the healthcare team to determine the most appropriate medical intervention, weigh the benefits and risks of surgery, and allow for appropriate counseling of patients.
