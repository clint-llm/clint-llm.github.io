At the 6-mm embryologic stage, the umbilical artery gives rise to the sciatic artery which becomes the dominant blood supply to the developing lower limb. Subsequently, the iliofemoral system begins to form as the sciatic artery regresses during the 6-33 mm stage.[12] If the sciatic artery fails to regress, it can lead to complications later in life such as early atherosclerotic disease, thromboembolic events or aneurysm formation.[11]

The vasculature establishes its adult pattern by the 8th week of embryologic development. Another rare vascular anomaly associated with abnormal embryological development is a duplicated superficial femoral artery.[12]
