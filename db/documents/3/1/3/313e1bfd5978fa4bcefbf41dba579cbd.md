During ECT, a seizure is induced by an external electrical device while the patient is under general anesthesia. This results in a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with a duration that is variable. Seizures cause profound autonomic nervous system activity. First, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, resulting in possible bradycardia and even asystole. The bradycardia is typically short-lived and followed by a sympathetic surge that causes hypertension and tachycardia. This sympathetic stimulation can last for anywhere from 5 to 10 min after the seizure has been induced.

The effect of a seizure causing a parasympathetic surge increases the risk of myocardial ischemia if the bradycardia is severe enough for too long. Glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic medication, can be given to counteract the parasympathetic response such as increased salivation and bradycardia. Unfortunately, the administration of anticholinergic medications causes the opposite effect of producing tachycardia, which is exacerbated during the sympathetic response.

During the sympathetic discharge, prolonged tachycardia and hypertension increase the risk of cardiovascular events due to increased myocardial demand and oxygen consumption. Sympathetic stimulation and the seizure itself cause an increase in cerebral blood flow and an increase in cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, resulting in increased intracranial pressure. Increases in intraocular and intragastric pressure occur as well. Esmolol can be used to blunt the sympathetic response.
