Microscopic examination of the brain tissue in the autopsies shows ischemic changes due to a thrombus or an embolus. The histopathology examination of the thrombus shows an increased amount of aggregated platelets consistent with atherosclerotic disease. In contrast, an increased amount of fibrinogen in the emboli extracted from basilar arteries is consistent with the cardioembolic etiology.
