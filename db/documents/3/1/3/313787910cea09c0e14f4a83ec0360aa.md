Mammillary bodies have three large direct connection: hippocampus, thalamus, and tegmental nuclei (Figure 1C). The hippocampus projects to the mammillary bodies through afferent fibers in the fornix (orange line, Figure 1C). The mammillary bodies then process information about memory and then relay it up to the thalamus for additional processing through the mammillothalamic tract. This tract terminates within the anterior thalamic nuclei. (red line, Figure 1C). Both the hippocampal projections to the mammillary bodies as well as the projections from the mammillary bodies to the thalamus are uni-directional. These circuits are a part of the Papez circuit (Figure 1B).

Mammillary bodies also have bi-directional connections with the tegmental nuclei through the mammillotegmental tract (blue line, Figure 1C). Because the tegmentum has numerous connections to several limbic structures, mammillary body input to this region can influence a variety of limbic functions (see above).
