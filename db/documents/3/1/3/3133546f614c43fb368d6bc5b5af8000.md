**Hypothyroidism**

Overt hypothyroidism warrants treatment with thyroid hormone replacement with the goal to keep TSH level in trimester specific range. There is ample research demonstrating the detrimental effects of untreated overt hypothyroidism on maternal and fetal health. On the other hand, there is insufficient evidence about the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy. ATA guidelines recommend subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated in females with positive TPO antibodies and TSH greater than 2.5 mU/L.

**Hyperthyroidism**

The treatment goals for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is to maintain mild maternal hyperthyroidism while avoiding fetal hypothyroidism.

**Graves disease**is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy. The management of Graves disease complicating pregnancy is as follow:

- Antithyroid drugs: The thionamides – methimazole (MMI) and propylthiouracil (PTU) – are most commonly used for the treatment of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.

- Beta blockers: Short-term treatment with beta-blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol can be used for symptomatic control. However, long-term treatment with beta-blockers should be avoided due to the risk of intrauterine fetal growth retardation.

- Surgery: Thyroidectomy is rarely needed and only reserved for the patients who cannot tolerate thionamides due to severe side effects or when euthyroidism cannot be achieved despite using large doses of thionamides. When indicated, it should be performed during the second trimester.

Radioactive iodine ablation is contraindicated during pregnancy.

**Subclinical hyperthyroidism,**as well as**gestational thyrotoxicosis**, do not require treatment during pregnancy and rather observation is recommended with periodic monitoring of thyroid function tests every 4 to 6 weeks.
