Breast cancer ranks among the leading causes of female cancer-related deaths in the world.

These results received confirmation in multiple studies, including a 20-year follow-up of the NSABP B-06 trial, where partial mastectomy followed by breast radiation continues to be appropriate in the management for smaller invasive breast cancer tumors.

Identified advantages to breast conservation therapy include reduced operative time, diminished psychological burden when compared with mastectomy, improved cosmetic outcomes, and limited side effects.

Proper staging is critical for determining the appropriate clinical treatment course and surgical planning. In 2018, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) released the eighth edition of the Cancer Staging Manual for Breast Cancer. This staging includes the T (tumor), N (node), and M (metastases) staging, but incorporated biologic markers into the traditional staging system. Factors including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), tumor grade, and multigene assays were included to aid in determining prognosis and therapy as determined by a Clinical and Pathologic Prognostic Stage Group.
