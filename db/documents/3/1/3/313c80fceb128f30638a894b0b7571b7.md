Chlorthalidone exerts its therapeutic action by antagonizing sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. It is similar to a thiazide diuretic in its mechanism of action, although it has a mildly altered chemical structure. Both thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics contain a sulfonamide group that also works to inhibit carbonic anhydrase and its antagonistic action at the distal convoluted tubule.

Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption at the level of the distal convoluted tubule and thus chloride via inhibition of the Na/Cl symporter. By removing sodium reabsorption at this location, the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron retains a higher sodium content. This lack of reabsorption alters the osmotic gradient and shifts fluid distribution from the outside of the tubule to the inside of the tubule. The increased osmotic load from its increased sodium concentration leads to elevated intratubular volume, thus promoting its diuretic effect. The increased excretion of sodium and extracellular fluid decreases intravascular water and solute concentration. By lowering the intravascular volume and osmotic gradient, the patient has reduced hydrostatic pressure leading to a clinical reduction in blood pressure.
