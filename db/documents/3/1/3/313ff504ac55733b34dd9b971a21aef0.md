Bivalirudin has proven an effective anticoagulant used by interventional cardiologists during PCI in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It is also an ideal anticoagulant in patients with a history of HIT and has predictable pharmacologic effects. As its use increases, its applications have broadened to include patients who require anticoagulation on cardiopulmonary bypass, ECMO, and deep venous prophylaxis. Given that patients receiving bivalirudin will be in the hospital setting, overdose is rare. Despite this, a multidisciplinary approach to monitoring such patients is necessary.

Interprofessional team communication and coordination of monitoring and prescribing activity between proceduralists, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses are necessary to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Evaluation begins with the appropriate monitoring of patients, including careful assessment at the bedside. A high degree of clinical suspicion should be maintained for bleeding, as the clinical manifestations may be confounded by other comorbidities in the typical patient requiring bivalirudin. Patients should be monitored for hypotension, tachycardia, oozing at IV sites should be sought out, with suspicion for hemorrhage. Laboratory evaluation and imaging studies may be warranted. As a guideline for therapeutic response, the aPTT is the most commonly used metric. Dosing regimens should then be adjusted accordingly by a pharmacist. Dosing protocols have been developed for monitoring bivalirudin therapy and are usually specific to the institution. With interprofessional care coordination, the patient is more likely to achieve the best outcomes with the fewest adverse reactions. [Level 5]
