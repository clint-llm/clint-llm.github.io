The therapeutic index of beta-2 agonists is different for each chemical, and both therapeutic and adverse effects of similar doses can be different among individuals according to multiple factors, such as the severity of the condition and the length of the drugâ€™s use, as well as other medications taken by the patient.

The plasma concentration of B2 agonists correlates with the severity of the toxicity. Direct monitoring of B2 agonists is not a regular procedure in clinical practice, as their efficacy and toxicity can be measured clinically or by using indirect tests. Nevertheless, there are some recognized tests for measuring drug concentration in the bloodstream, such as gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, fluorimetric detectors, and electrochemical detectors. Monitoring techniques are primarily used before athletic competitions to check for their use as anabolic agents.
