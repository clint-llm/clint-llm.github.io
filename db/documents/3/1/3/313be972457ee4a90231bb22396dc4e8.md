Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that can negatively affect various organ systems.

Available data supports an interprofessional team approach in diabetes care. An interprofessional healthcare team model for diabetes care may include clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, diabetes educators, dietitians, and pharmacists. Providers from different professions complement each other to improve patient outcomes and decrease healthcare costs.

A clinician-pharmacist collaborative practice is beneficial to patients with diabetes.

Evidence supports implementing nurse champion models, including nurses, certified diabetes educators, and clinical mentors for diabetes care.

Dietitians serve as an invaluable resource for patients with diabetes. The evidence-based practice guideline by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics strongly supports dietitians in providing medical nutrition therapy to improve patient outcomes.

The healthcare team should follow a patient-centered approach and tailor diabetes therapy to the patient’s needs.

The healthcare team should realize that food insecurity might complicate diabetes. Patients who do not have access to nutritious, healthy food may experience hyperglycemia, and patients who are unable to obtain food may experience hypoglycemia.

As mentioned before, hypoglycemia is a common adverse effect associated with sulfonylureas. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to serious consequences, including seizure, coma, or death. To minimize the risk of hypoglycemic events, the healthcare team should identify patients at risk of hypoglycemia and consider less stringent HbA1c goals.

While newer and potentially safer alternatives are now available, sulfonylureas can be a useful adjunct in diabetes management, especially when the cost of therapy is an issue. Successful therapy requires a collaborative interprofessional effort to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of sulfonylureas while minimizing potential adverse events. [Level 5]
