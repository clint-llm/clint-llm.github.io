Primary mucosal melanomas are aggressive tumors that are exceedingly rare but rapidly lethal. This disease is particularly hard to treat because it is usually discovered at an advanced stage. Dentists have a unique opportunity to diagnose this lesion promptly and improve the patient’s prognosis. Other healthcare professionals, including dermatologists and general practitioners, should add an oral examination to their regular appointments and be familiar with the aspect of this carcinoma. Asymptomatic irregular melanotic lesions should raise concern and be further investigated,

Patients need should be instructed to implement self-examinations for early detection. Trained primary care nurses can educate the patient in this regard. They also need to inform the patient on what constitutes a high-risk lesion and communicate these findings to the clinician as soon as they arise. Despite the low incidence of oral melanoma, a collaborative interprofessional team can help reduce morbidity and mortality associated with it. [Level 5]
