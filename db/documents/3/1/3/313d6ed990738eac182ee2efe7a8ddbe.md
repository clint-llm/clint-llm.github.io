The most common complications of a SMAS plication include: hematoma, earlobe anesthesia/hypesthesia due to greater auricular nerve injury, lower lip asymmetry, delayed wound healing, scar hypertrophy, areas of transient alopecia in the incision, surface irregularities that may require fat transfer, skin flap necrosis, infection, and inferior malposition of the earlobe (pixie ear deformity).

Motor nerve dysfunction may be permanent but is much more commonly transient and is most likely toÂ result in lower lip asymmetry or brow ptosis (see image).
