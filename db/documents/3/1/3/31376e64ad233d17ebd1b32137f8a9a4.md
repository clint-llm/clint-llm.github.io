Progesterone plays a significant role during the normal menstruation cycle. The menstrual cycle is broadly divided into two sequential phases, beginning with the follicular phase, also known as the proliferative phase, and followed by the luteal phase. Each phase of menstruation requires a distinct set of hormones to allow for normal progression through a given cycle. The increase of progesterone, specifically in the menstrual cycle, occurs due to the initiation of a mid-cycle luteinizing hormone (LH) surge near the end of the follicular phase. This mid-cycle rise of progesterone also allows for an increase in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).

At the end of the LH and FSH surge, the menstrual cycle begins the luteal phase, during which progesterone prepares the endometrium in a woman’s uterus to receive and nourish the fertilized egg, also known as implantation during the luteal phase.

However, if implantation does occur, then progesterone levels will remain elevated, resulting in the inhibition of endometrial sloughing and the subsequent transitioning into the role of pregnancy maintenance. During pregnancy, progesterone plays two key roles in inhibiting lactation and decreasing the ability of the myometrium to contract through metabolites which act via GABA receptors.
