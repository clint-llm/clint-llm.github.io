Typically, a patient with acute diarrhea will have a self-limited course and will not require labs or imaging. A stool culture is warranted in a patient with bloody diarrhea or severe illness to rule out bacterial causes. Bloody stools require additional testing for Shiga toxin and lactoferrin. A patient with recent antibiotic use or hospitalization will require testing for Clostridium difficile infection. Imaging is not ordered routinely in a patient with acute diarrhea. However, an abdominal CT may be required when a patient presents with significant peritoneal signs.

A thorough history is important to determine what labs and imaging need to be ordered to distinguish the cause of chronic diarrhea.

In diarrhea, a stool pH of under 5.5 or the abundance of reducing substances signifies carbohydrate intolerance usually secondary to viral illnesses.E coli, Vibrio, and viruses.

If the stool sample can not be cultured within two hours of specimen collection it should be refrigerated at 4°C or placed in a transport medium. The yield of stool cultures is low; however, it is helpful when the culture is positive. Stool should always be cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, C Difficile, and Yersinia enterocolitica if there are signs of colitis or if there is fecal leucocytosis.

Looking for Clostridium difficile is advisable in the presence of colitis and/or blood in stools. An important point of note is that acute-onset diarrhea secondary to C difficile infection may also occur with no history of antibiotic use. In diarrheal cases where there is a history of ground beef ingestion and enterohemorrhagic E coli is present in the stool, one should determine the type of E coli. As hemolytic uremic syndrome can be a consequence of infection with E coli O157:H7.

Rotavirus antigen is tested by enzyme immunoassay and latex agglutination of the stool. Enzyme immunoassay can be used to detect adenovirus antigens. Stool examination for ova and parasites is the best way to find parasites. The stool examination should be performed every three days or on alternate days.
