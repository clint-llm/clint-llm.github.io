The most common symptoms typically presented by patients include pruritus, rashes, stinging, or formication with symptoms lasting six months or longer and having no physical findings present.  Patients may have had previous trials of topical dermatologic medications and/or antibiotics in attempts to treat the illness.  Patients may also have their pets evaluated to rule out fleas or mites with concerns that the pets may have transferred those to the patient.  Patients can provide exhaustive histories revolving around false descriptions of parasites, the timing of infestations, and even prior trials of attempting to have pest control treatment of their homes.  Other studies also demonstrated that patients might draw family members or friends into their delusions in 15 to 25 percent of cases resulting in a folie à deux.

Physical findings in patients with delusions of parasitosis can be helpful in some cases.  Patients may present with excoriations or scars from previous attempts that patients undertook to remove “organisms” using various objects or their own fingernails. Patients can also present with irritant dermatitis as they will sometimes turn to alternative treatments and home products in an attempt to remove the “organism.”
