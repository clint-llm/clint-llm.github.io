The history provided for SI joint pain may look very similar to mechanical back pain, with a few exceptions. Pain is usually localized to the buttock region and may occur with the sensations of numbness, tingling, weakness, pelvic pain, leg instability, and groin pain. The patient often points to the area between their gluteal folds and posterior iliac crests.

Radiation is pervasive in SI joint injury seen in up to 50% of cases, the majority into the lower extremity.

The history of SI joint injury may suggest S1 radiculopathy classically seen in sciatica. Symptoms are reproducible in an SI joint neuropathy of the S1 nerve root. In cases of neuropathic pain, the patient may endorse numbness, tingling burning pain of the posterior leg extending below the knee into the plantar aspect of the foot. The patient may support sensation changes or muscle weakness, depending on the nerve root involved.

A physical exam includes a full musculoskeletal and neurologic exam of the lumbar spine, and bilateral lower extremities are a part of the SI joint injury evaluation. A complete neurological and musculoskeletal exam of the lower extremity should be mostly normal, with muscle strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes intact. However, Pelvic asymmetry may be appreciated on the exam. The range of motion testing of the lower extremity is a must for the assessment of SI joint dysfunction. A rectal exam may also be indicated in specific cases. On physical exam, there can be tenderness to the pelvic floor muscles.

Sacroiliac joint mobility has been studied, along with the symmetry of the pelvis. Both tests are unreliable in the diagnosis of SI joint dysfunction. The compression of the iliac crest on the side of the patient's pain may reproduce symptoms.

Special tests are often utilized in cases of suspected SI joint injury. The Gaenslen test is a special test that can be used to isolate the sacroiliac joint. The patient should be placed in the supine position; their hip flexed to their chest. The provider applies a force to the knee of the flexed hip anteriorly on the ipsilateral side of pain. Simultaneously, the contralateral knee is pushed downward; their opposite leg is allowed to fall off the table. Both SI joints are tested simultaneously. Gaenslen is considered a provocative test, reproducing the patient's symptoms.
