Indications for GABA-positive allosteric modulators include a wide variety of clinical settings, and as such, require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians should pay careful attention to their patients when utilizing these medications due to their potential for abuse, dependence, and serious multisystem organ failure. Clinicians must be well-versed in GABA-positive allosteric modulator dosing, adverse effects, contraindications, and clinical indications. Nursing staff should monitor the patient carefully once therapy has been initiated, answer questions, and alert the prescriber to any concerns. Pharmacists should verify dosing, monitor for signs of potential misuse, perform medication reconciliation, and contact the prescriber should they notice any issues that may necessitate intervention by the clinician. These interprofessional examples demonstrate how this approach can help optimize therapy with these agents.
