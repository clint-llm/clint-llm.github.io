There are many potential causes of secondary amenorrhea. Hormonal causes include pregnancy, lactation, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, hyperandrogenism (including polycystic ovarian syndrome), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction), and suppression of the endometrium by hormonal birth control. Structural causes include damage to the endometrium (Asherman syndrome) and obstruction of the outflow tract (cervical stenosis).
