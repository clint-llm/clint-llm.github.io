The overall prognosis of infectious causes cervicitis is good. Recovery is within a week, or two and a test of cure is not required.

In the case of treatment failure and recurrent infection, the first step is to confirm the eradication of the causative organisms by repeat testing. A thorough history is taken for an assessment of re-exposure (e.g., new or untreated sexual partner) and for non-infectious causes (e.g., chemical irritants and systemic diseases). Once the infection has been ruled out, there are no clear options for further management. Persistent antibiotic therapy is also not recommended due to lack of evidence of benefit and concerns for antibiotic resistance.

The term chronic cervicitis is used for women with persistent discharge for three months despite the resolution/exclusion of infection. Usually, it is caused by non-infectious sources, and there is no standard approach to these cases. This cervicitis of unknown etiology may respond to antibiotics, silver nitrate, or loop electrosurgical excision procedure.
