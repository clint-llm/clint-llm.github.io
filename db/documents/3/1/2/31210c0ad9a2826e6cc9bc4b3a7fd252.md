The cornerstone of the treatment of neuroleptic-mediated EPS is the discontinuation of the offending medication. For the acute management of dystonic reactions, which may be distressing to the patient, anticholinergic medications such as benztropine or diphenhydramine, can be used.

Management of NMS is prompt discontinuation of the offending agent as well as aggressive support of the cardiopulmonary system, maintenance of normothermia and euvolemia, and prevention of complications such as deep venous thrombosis, acute renal failure, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In severe cases of muscular rigidity, intravenous dantrolene sodium or oral bromocriptine mesylate may be helpful.

Although the spectrum of neuroleptic toxicity is broad, certain universal principles should be applied to their management.
