**Operation**

The surgical site is prepared and then cleaned and draped under aseptic precautions. An inverted U-shaped scalp incision slightly larger than the diameter of the Ommaya reservoir (3.4 cm) is made over the entry point. The center of the incision overlies the Kocher point, located 3 cms lateral to the midline at the mid pupillary line and 1 cm anterior to the coronal suture.

**Reservoir Aspiration**

The scalp is prepared with antiseptic scrub.
