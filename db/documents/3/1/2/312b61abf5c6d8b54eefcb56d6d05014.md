**Oral Complications of Radiation Therapy in The Head and Neck**

**Oral Mucositis**

Oral mucositis is a frequent complication of head and neck radiation therapy (RT), occurring in up to 91% of patients.

Oral lesions include erythema, atrophy, swelling, and ulcerations that may be covered by pseudomembranes. Patients report debilitating pain, loss of taste, eating, drinking, and speaking difficulties, which may require parental nutrition.

**Xerostomia**

Xerostomia is an expected side effect of radiotherapy on the head and neck, which starts soon after initiating treatment and may be irreversible in some cases.

Salivary gland damage results in hyposalivation (decreased salivary flow) and thickening of the saliva, perceived as xerostomia. This causes speaking, eating, and swallowing difficulties and affects taste perception. Also, a decreased salivary flow makes the oral cavity more vulnerable to candidiasis, gingivitis, and dental caries.

**Oropharyngeal Candidiasis**

Patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer are at an increased risk of developing fungal infections. This may be a consequence of the salivary flow reduction experienced during radiation therapy

Clinically, radiation-related oropharyngeal candidiasis may present as pseudomembranous, erythematous, or angular cheilitis.

**Dysgeusia**

Dysgeusia is an unpleasant or abnormal alteration of taste, frequently described as metallic.

Altered taste perception is reported by about 70% of patients receiving radiotherapy, which is also linked to loss of appetite and weight. Symptoms appear after the second or third week of treatment, and taste perception usually goes back to normal 60 to 120 days after finishing radiotherapy.

**Radiation-related Caries**

Radiation-related caries is a very aggressive type of tooth decay that develops in dental surfaces normally refractive to caries.

Radiation caries are generalized and precipitate about six to twelve months after head and neck radiation treatment. Lesions usually begin as enamel cracks and fractures and evolve into brown-black enamel discoloration.

**Osteoradionecrosis (ORN)**

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the jaws is a late complication of radiation therapy of the head and neck, where exposed irradiated bone becomes necrotic and fails to heal for at least three months with no signs of tumor recurrence.

Risk factors include poor oral health and hygiene, pre-head and neck radiation surgery, dental surgery, and tobacco and alcohol consumption.
