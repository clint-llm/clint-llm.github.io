Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were introduced in the late 1950s for the treatment of depression. With the advent of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new antidepressants, the use of TCAs has decreased, although they are still used to treat depression that has not responded to treatment with less toxic agents. In adults, TCAs are also used for migraine headache prophylaxis, treatment of neuralgic pain, including the pain associated with Ciguatera poisoning, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In children, TCAs have been used to treat nocturnal enuresis. Despite the current limited use of TCAs, TCA-overdose-associated hospitalizations and fatalities are on the rise. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
- Review the history and physical exam of a patient with tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options for tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by tricyclic antidepressant toxicity.
