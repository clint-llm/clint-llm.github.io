The clinical examination of the lungs is part of almost any physical examination. Due to the close relationship with nearby structures such as the heart, great vessels, esophagus, and diaphragm, a careful examination of the lungs can provide clues towards a diagnosis.

The airway is derived from the embryonic foregut and is divided into the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs.Â Although humans have two lungs they are not symmetrical: the right lung is bigger than the left. The right lung is composed of three lobes, and ten segments and the left lung consists of two lobes and nine segments. The segmental division of the lungs is based on their airway supply.

The physical examination of the chest is composed of inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. Although it is not unheard of clinicians skipping the first three steps of the chest auscultation important information can be derived from a complete lung examination.
