In surgery, the knowledge of the alveolar nerves is crucial. The alveolar nerves are important in providing sensory innervation to the teeth, gingivae, lower lip, and chin. If the alveolar nerves are damaged, there may be a permanent loss of sensation in those areas.

In both plastic and oral and maxillofacial surgery, the jaw may require reconstruction, or the implantation of teeth may be necessary. It is important to reconstruct the jaw without damaging the alveolar nerves. In some dental implantations, the alveolar nervesÂ may become translocated during the procedure.
