Staphylococcus epidermidis is a coagulase-negative, gram-positive cocci bacteria that form clusters. It is also a catalase-positive and facultative anaerobe. They are the most common coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species that live on the human skin. In its natural environments such as the human skin or mucosa, they are usually harmless.

The belief is that Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infection, with infection rates as high as those of Staphylococcus aureus.
