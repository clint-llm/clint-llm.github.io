A negative test is one in which the pain elicited is localized to the neck, or when no symptoms can be reproduced. Muscle spasms and neck stiffness are common to many cervical injuries and are non-specific findings that are routinely encountered, and do not constitute a positive test.

The result of a positive Spurling test is a reproduction of cervical radiculopathy symptoms. Cervical radiculopathy can involve the neck, shoulder, or arm. It may also present as muscle weakness, sensory symptoms, or diminished deep tendon reflexes. Any, or all, of these symptoms, may be present in a patient, and any of them may be elicited in response to provocative testing.

Passive cervical flexion resulting in electric shock-like paresthesia (L’hermitte’s sign) is considered a critical finding. This may indicate multiple sclerosis plaques or other intramedullary pathology.
