Practitioners should evaluate for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, including alcohol use, metabolic syndrome, endocrine disorders, and medications. Patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia should be assessed for other cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and tobacco use. The family history of lipid disorders such as dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease should be sought. In patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, pathognomonic palmar xanthomas (orange, yellow deposits along the palmar creases), and eruptive xanthomas at pressure sites on the elbows, buttocks, and knees are seen. Chylomicronemia syndrome can present with epigastric abdominal pain, cutaneous eruptive xanthomas on the buttocks, and the extensor surfaces of the upper limb, hepatosplenomegaly, acute pancreatitis, transient memory loss, lipemia retinalis, and rarely, focal neurologic deficits.
