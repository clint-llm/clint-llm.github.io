The peri-operative nurse will monitor the patient during placement of the Pecs block. ContinuousÂ ECG, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure require monitoring during the entire peri-procedural period. If using sedation for the procedure, the peri-operative nurse can also help to monitor the patient's level of consciousness and breathing. Post-operatively, the peri-operative nurse will monitor the patient with continuous ECG, pulse oximetry, and blood pressure (at 5-minute intervals at least), but will monitor the patient's post-operative pain scores as well. If pain is severe, the anesthesiologist can give local anesthetic solution through the catheter (if catheter placed) with the local anesthetic solution as needed, or the decision can be made to give intravenous medications to manage the patient's post-operative pain.
