Hyperkalemia is an absolute contraindication for potassium replacement. Inadequate or absent urine output and severe renal impairment are relative contraindications. Systemic acidosis and states of dehydration require correction before potassium administration. Potassium administration requires caution in states of significant tissue breakdown (e.g., burns or post-operative conditions), adrenal insufficiency, and concomitant administration of potassium-sparing diuretics. Oral forms of potassium supplements should be used cautiously in patients who have delayed gastrointestinal transit due to structural or functional causes.

Potassium iodide is not for use in patients with known sensitivity to iodides.
