Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a rare autoimmune disease that is almost always associated with confirmed or occult malignancy. Patients typically present with painful and extensive mucosal and cutaneous involvement, with an overall poor prognosis. No formal diagnostic or treatment protocols currently exist for PNP. This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management of patients with PNP while emphasizing the role of an interprofessional team in improving care for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with paraneoplastic pemphigus, reviewing the five major clinical subtypes that can present and the most common early presenting symptom.

- Identify the potential complications of paraneoplastic pemphigus.
- Summarize histopathological, clinical, and immunological criteria used to diagnose paraneoplastic pemphigus.
- Review the importance of coordination of care among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by paraneoplastic pemphigus.
