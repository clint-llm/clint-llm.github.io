Consultation with a neurologist is the gold standard. If the underlying cause is difficult to ascertain, further consultations with cardiology, endocrine, and neurosurgery may prove beneficial.

Neuropsychiatric consultation can help diagnose the underlying cause; furthermore, this consultation serves a greater purpose as the prevalence of depression, or other concurrent psychiatric illnesses, is higher in patients suffering from chronic diseases like epilepsy.
