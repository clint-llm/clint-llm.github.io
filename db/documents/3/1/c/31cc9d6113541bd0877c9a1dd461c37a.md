TS history should be routinely obtained from the patient during the admission assessment. Subjective and objective assessment of tobacco use should be included in every focused assessment. Pack-year history provides an estimate the amount cigarettes a patient has consumed over a lifetime and is calculated as packs smoked per day multiplied by the total number of years smoked. Obtaining a pack-year history has shown to be of some value when determining the presence and severity of smoking-related illnesses such as CAD and COPD, as smoking-related cancers have all been linked to increased pack-year history.

Many assessment findings can be directly or indirectly related to tobacco smoking. Upon admission and with every aseesment be sure to assess the mouth, teeth, and mucous membranes. The scent of tobacco smoke often lingers on the patient's breath and clothing. Auscultation of the lungs may reveal decreased or asynchronous breath sounds. Cardiac exam often reveals an increased resting heart rate when compared to that of non-smokers. Tobacco stains may be present on the skin of the face and fingers. There may be decreased peripheral pulses due to smoking-related peripheral vascular disease.  Chronic smoking can cause voice changes, including a lower pitch and hoarseness.  Fine wrinkles in the face and around the mouth can also be noted in smokers.
