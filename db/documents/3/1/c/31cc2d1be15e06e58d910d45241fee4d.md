Approximately 90% of all spinal injuries involve the thoracolumbar region (T10-L2), 50% of which can be unstable and lead to a neurological deficit.

The thoracic spine has a relatively narrow vertebral canal, which predisposes it to spinal cord damage and neurological deficit. However, the thoracic spine is functionally rigid due to the orientation of the facet joints, the thin intervertebral discs, and the ribcage. Therefore, it requires a greater amount of energy (force of trauma) to produce fractures and dislocations.

As T12 has characteristics of both thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, it is subject to transitional stresses. These transitional forcesÂ result from the change from the rigid thoracic spine to the relatively mobile lumbar spine. This causes it to be the most commonly fractured vertebra.

The valve-less vertebral venous plexuses allow the metastasis of cancer from the pelvis, such as that of the prostatic, to the vertebral column.
