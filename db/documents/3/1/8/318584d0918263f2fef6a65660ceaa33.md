Perform excisional biopsy on suggestive lesions so that a pathologist can confirm the diagnosis. Shave biopsies and electrodesiccation are inadequate; a full thickness of the skin is essential for proper histologic diagnosis and classification.

The following laboratory studies are indicated:

- Complete blood count

- Complete chemistry panel (including alkaline phosphatase, hepatic transaminases, total protein, and albumin)

- Lactate dehydrogenase

The following imaging modalities may be considered:

- Chest radiography

- MRI of the brain

- Ultrasonography (possibly the best imaging study for diagnosing lymph node involvement)

- CT of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis

- Positron emission tomography (PET; PET-CT may be the best imaging study for identifying other sites of metastasis)
