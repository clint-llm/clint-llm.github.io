The earliest written description of a brachial plexus injury (BPI) is attributed to Homer circa 800 BC in his depiction of a battle during which Hector struck Teucer over the clavicle with a rock, rendering him incapable of wielding his bow in The Iliad. In the simplest terms, the brachial plexus can be thought of as 5 nerve roots (C5 through T1), which originate in the posterior triangle of the neck and extend into the axilla and terminate in five nerves: musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, median, and ulnar. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, causes, presentation and diagnosis of brachial plexus injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of brachial plexus injuries.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with brachial plexus injury.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with brachial plexus injury.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by brachial plexus injury
