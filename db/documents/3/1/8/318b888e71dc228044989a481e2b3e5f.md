Over the past decade, Acinetobacter infections have become common in hospitalized patients. Since this organism can infect almost any organ system an interprofessional approach to diagnosis and management is essential. Often the organism is difficult to isolate because of colonization and hence an infectious disease consult should be made. Infection control teams should be involved earlier on to prevent out-breaks and utilize ways to prevent nosocomial transmission by eradication of bacteria and strict isolation techniques. The outcomes for most patients with Acinetobacter infection is excellent as long as there is no other comorbidity. However, those with immunosuppression may have a guarded prognosis.

Management should involve a coordinated effort of nurses, pharmacists, and clinicians.
