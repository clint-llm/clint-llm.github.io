To date, no identified intervention successfully prevents progression to CFRD in individuals with cystic fibrosis. However, with routine annual screening, many patients are diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance before the development of frank diabetes. This screening approach allows for patient and family education about diabetes before the time that insulin therapy is necessary. After the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes has been established, a referral to an endocrinologist should be made to initiate insulin therapy. Routine self-monitoring of blood glucose, generally a minimum of three times a day, is required by the patient and/or patient's family. Insulin injections may be necessary as infrequently as once daily or as frequently as four to six times daily, depending on the patient's blood glucose pattern. CFRD is a condition that cannot receive optimal therapy without extensive education and effective engagement of the patient and/or parents.
