**Mammography:**

On mammography, circumscribed and lobulated breast lesions are common findings for a mucinous carcinoma. A circumscribed margin would favor the diagnosis of a pure mucinous carcinoma

**Ultrasonography:**

On ultrasonography, mucinous carcinoma is usually a complex mass with cystic and solid components microlobulation, vascularity, and distal enhancement. The histologic subtype of mucinous carcinoma can be predicted based on the echogenicity. Isoechoic masses are found in pure mucinous carcinoma, whereas hypoechoic masses are found in mixed mucinous carcinoma

**Magnetic resonance imaging:**

On an MRI, mucinous carcinoma has a lobular shape, rim or heterogeneous enhancement, a persistent pattern on the time-intensity curve, and homogeneous strongly high signal intensity on T2-weighted images

**Tissue biopsy:**

Tissue biopsy is mandatory in the evaluation of mucinous breast carcinoma. Tissue specimens can be obtained by core biopsy, fine needle aspiration cytology, and incisional or excisional biopsy.
