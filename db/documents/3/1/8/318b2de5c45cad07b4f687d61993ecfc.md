Capsule endoscopy does have a role in the detection of some gastrointestinal disorders but it is rarely the first test of choice. It is most useful for detecting superficial or occult lesions that are not detected by other imaging studies. In patients with obscure recurrent bleeding or those with chronic intestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease, capsule endoscopy provides a thorough yet minimally invasive evaluation. However, due to the potential for retention, this diagnostic test needs to be administered judiciously. The clinician needs to review the indications and limitations of this procedure with the patient to ensure efficacy. The nurse plays a crucial role in educating the patient about the possible signs of complications and adverse outcomes. The nurse will also help assess the medical team in reviewing past medical history for contraindications for the procedure as well as the patient's capacity to undergo the procedure in the first place. If adverse events should occur, the nurse should communicate with the providers to minimize patient harm. A collaborative interprofessional team can help the efficacy and efficiency of capsule endoscopy and improve patient outcomes. (Level V)
