Early detection of brain tumors and prompt referral to pediatric neurosurgery and pediatric neuro-oncology teams is vital. This usually starts with the pediatrician, nurse practitioner, family physician or emergency physician. The optimum care of patients with brain tumors occurs through an interprofessional collaboration including oncology, diagnostic imaging, pathology, radiotherapy, nursing, rehabilitation, and social workers.
