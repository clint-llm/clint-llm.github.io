Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most significant adverse effects of parenteral acyclovir administration. The incidence of AKI is comparable to other nephrotoxic medications such as aminoglycosides. Patients with CKD are at higher risk. Dose adjustment of acyclovir for ideal body weight and baseline renal function is imperative.

Also, a recent retrospective case-control study over 4 years showed a statistically significant association between obesity and nephrotoxicity (odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.19 to 8.67). Similarly, and not surprisingly, researchers observed a similar association between those receiving concomitant vancomycin (odds ratio 4.73, 95% CI, 1.57 to 14.25). Appropriate cautions are necessary when administering intravenous acyclovir to such higher-risk patients.

Acyclovir treatment can cause acute kidney injury because of acyclovir crystal formation in the renal tubules. Yalçinkaya R. et al studied risk factors for acyclovir-induced acute kidney injury in children.
