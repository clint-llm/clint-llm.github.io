Managing migraine in the pediatric population requires an interprofessional team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. It is imperative to do a thorough neurological and physical examination to rule out secondary headaches. If the child has migraine headaches, the non-pharmacological approach is considered the first line of treatment. Pharmacological therapy is the next step if avoiding triggers and non-pharmacological approaches do not resolve the headaches. Clinicians can coordinate with nurses on the initial non-pharmacological approach and then consult the pharmacist if drug therapy is deemed necessary; the pharmacist can assist in agent selection and dosing, perform medication reconciliation, and report any concerns that arise to the prescriber. In extreme cases, a headache specialist can also consult on the case. Interprofessional care will yield the best patient results. [Level 5]

There is insufficient evidence in the literature on interventional procedures such as botulinum toxin or nerve blocks in the pediatric migraine population.
