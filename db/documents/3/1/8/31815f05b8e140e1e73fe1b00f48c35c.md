Polymyositis (PM), an autoimmune disorder, develops due to abnormal activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8 cells) and macrophages against muscular antigens as well as the strong extrafusal muscular expression of major histocompatibility complex 1 causing damage to the endomysium of skeletal muscles.

Different cytokines, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), etc. play an important role in causing rhabdomyolysis. It mostly affects individuals already suffering from some kind of systematic disease due to viral infections, malignancies, or other autoimmune disorders. The commonly responsible viruses for polymyositis are the retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HTLV1, and hepatitis C virus that possibly cause this inflammatory muscle degeneration by causing endomysial damage leading to edematous swelling and nodular mass formation in the myocytes.

Coxsackievirus is another reason for this autoimmune disorder due to the abnormal functioning of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) secondary to the release of the cytokines after damaging the intima and endothelium of blood vessels.

Other causes include the presence of certain HLA variants (A1, B8, DR3), the presence of another autoimmune disease such as celiac disease,
