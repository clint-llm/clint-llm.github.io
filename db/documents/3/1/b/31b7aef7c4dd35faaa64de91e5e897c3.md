Fetal echogenic bowel is an uncommon but significant finding in second-trimester ultrasound and requires further sonographic screening. A well-structured grading system suggested by Slotnick et al. should be used while reporting the finding to reduce the diagnostic subjectivity.

Pathophysiology of the fetal echogenic bowel is speculative and depends on the underlying etiology. Examination of the meconium and histologic evaluation of the small bowel from the terminated fetuses with fetal echogenic bowel may provide further answers to the underlying pathophysiology.

Given theÂ broad differential diagnosis, further screening should be offered to identify the underlying etiology. Providers must counsel parents counseling should be done promptly to understand the implications of this finding. A shared decision-making framework between the medical team and the parent is necessary while considering further screening and diagnostic tests.

In fetuses with normal screening, the finding of echogenic bowel may pose a significant dilemma for antenatal counseling. Fetal MRI may be a consideration in high-risk cases.
