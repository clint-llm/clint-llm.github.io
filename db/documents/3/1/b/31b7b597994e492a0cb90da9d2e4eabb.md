The prognosis of craniopharyngiomas is dependent on the size, histologic type of tumor, surgical methodology, and the degree of hypothalamus and endocrine deficiencies. The overall survival rate of craniopharyngiomas is 80 to 95% at 5 years. The prognosis is good in young individuals and poor for individuals over the age of 65. Females tend to have additional morbidity that includes stroke, adverse cardiac events, and psychosocial deficits.
