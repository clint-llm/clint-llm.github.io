- In classic form, ataxia-telangiectasia patients present at an early age with ataxia (gait impairment, hand incoordination, and eye movement dysfunction) and conjunctival telangiectasias occur during school age.****Recurrent sinopulmonary infections are secondary to the reduction of immunoglobulins and the reduction of newly produced B and T cells.

- Bloom syndrome patients can present with a variable combination of symptoms that include disproportionately short stature, microcephaly, immunodeficiency, sinopulmonary infections, decreased intellectual ability, facial anomalies, an erythematous rash associated with sun exposure, café-au-lait spot/hypopigmented skin lesions, infertility, a predisposition to hematological malignancies, solid carcinomas and insulin resistance. The most striking early symptom that usually drives patients to medical attention is short stature.

- Fanconi anemia is an inherited bone marrow failure condition characterized by pancytopenia, cancer predisposition, short stature, microcephaly, developmental delay, and variable anomalies. Anomalies in FA include
- Skin hyper- or hypopigmentation
- Thumb or other radial ray abnormalities
- Hand abnormalities such as clinodactyly
- Axial skeletal abnormalities such as short/webbed neck and vertebral anomalies
- Eye malformations
- Renal and urinary tract malformations
- Gonadal/genital malformations
- Ear abnormalities such as middle ear anomalies or atretic ear canal
- Congenital heart disease, including patent ductus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect
- Gastrointestinal anomalies and central nervous system abnormalities

- Nijmegen breakage syndrome shows progressive symptoms that include microcephaly, facial deformities with "bird-like" face, intrauterine growth retardation, intellectual disability, immunodeficiency with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, a predisposition to lymphoid malignancies, primary ovarian insufficiency, and radiosensitivity.
