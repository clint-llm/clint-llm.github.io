Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening condition caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii affecting immunocompromised individuals. Patients at high risk of developing this condition should be treated prophylactically with adequate antibiotics to decrease mortality and improve quality of life. This activity describes the management of patients in an immunocompromised state requiring prophylaxis for this pathogen and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing Pneumocystis pneumonia and which patients require prophylaxis for this pathogen.
- Outline the medications for Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis in order of preference.
- Describe the most common and life-threatening side effects of the drugs preferred for PCP prophylaxis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care when initiating PCP prophylaxis to improve patient outcomes and response to treatment.
