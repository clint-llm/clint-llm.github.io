IPL treatments, like many laser treatments, are typically provided in the outpatient clinic setting. A physician or surgeon may perform IPL treatments, but it is frequently a mid-level healthcare provider, such as a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner, providing the treatments. In some areas, registered nurses are permitted to provide laser and IPL treatments as well. Regardless, having a physician, such as a plastic surgeon or dermatologist, involved in the care team ensures that an experienced clinician can manage complications should they arise.
