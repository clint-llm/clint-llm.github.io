All patients with posterior nasal packs require hospital admission and should be monitored with telemetry and continuous pulse oximetry, ideally in intensive care. Posterior nasal packs obstruct nasal airflow and, if malpositioned or dislodged, risk airway obstruction.

Packing can also result in aspiration of blood, overuse of sedatives, or hypoxemia, which is worsened in patients with pre-existing respiratory problems. Furthermore, serious cardiopulmonary events have been reported immediately after posterior nasal packing.

These events may be sequelae of the so-called "nasopulmonary reflex." This reflex, also called the "trigeminocardiac reflex," is poorly understood but has been historically reported to result in fatal complications.
