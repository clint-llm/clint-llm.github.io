Since the disease presents with a great variety of manifestations, the management of patients with A-T requires an interprofessional team that includes a geneticist, pediatrician, neurologist, oncologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, and an infectious disease expert.

In these patients, the overall survival is greatly affected by the attentive care and careful screening, which allow prevention of recurrent infections and identifying tumors early. Usually, patients affected by the classical form of A-T can reach early adulthood. Milder forms and adult-onset variants have a significantly longer life expectancy. The atypical forms of the disease usually present with a milder phenotype and a much longer life expectancy.
