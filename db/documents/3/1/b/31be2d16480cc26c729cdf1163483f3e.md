An important injury that can be mistaken for an ankle sprain is the Maisonneuve fracture. This injury typically occurs with an eversion injury that results in a tear of the deltoid ligament or medial malleolar fracture. The forced eversion causes a complete disruption of the tibiofibular syndesmosis and fracture of the proximal fibula. This injury, therefore, involves the complete disruption of the ligamentous stability of the ankle thus necessitating surgical fixation. In the absence of a medial malleolar fracture, the associated disruption of the ankle mortise may not be evident on the x-ray and ankle films may be completely normal. Weight-bearing views of the injured foot should demonstrate a widened ankle mortise but often are not obtained unless a high index of suspicion is maintained. Tenderness of the proximal calf should also raise suspicion of this injury. When suspected, x-rays of the tibia and fibula should be obtained.
