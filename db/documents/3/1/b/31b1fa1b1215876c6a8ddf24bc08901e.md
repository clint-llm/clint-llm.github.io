**Micrognathia**

This is a clinical diagnosis of the underdeveloped mandible. This typically includes a shorter mandibular body length and a greater mandibular angle. Defined indexes for diagnosing micrognathia have been developed in the past. However, none have been useful in predicting patients who will experience respiratory problems.

**Glossoptosis**

This is defined by the displacement of the base of the tongue towards the pharynx. There is a wide range of severity and therefore associated respiratory distress. There is no standard for diagnosing glossoptosis, but endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) imaging may be helpful in quantifying the level of obstruction present.

**Airway Obstruction**

There is a wide range of clinical severity of airway obstruction, ranging from severe ventilatory compromise requiring intubation immediately after birth, to mild dysfunction not requiring any intervention. Clinical signs of airway obstruction may include abnormal breathing sounds, increased respiratory accessory muscle use, desaturations, difficulty feeding/swallowing, reflux, and aspiration. Long term signs of airway obstruction may include reduced weight gain, difficulty speaking, neurological deficits, and ultimately pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.

**Cleft Palate**

While not one of the required triad of PRS, cleft palate is present in most cases. The most common type is a U-shaped cleft palate, though V-shaped have also been reported.
