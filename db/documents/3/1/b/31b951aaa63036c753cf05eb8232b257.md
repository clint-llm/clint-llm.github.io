Thyroid releasing hormone (TRH) is released from the hypothalamus in response to low T3/T4, which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to produce thyroid-stimulatingÂ hormone (TSH), where it is also stored. TSH stimulates the thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4, which creates a metabolic effect throughout the body (see below for examples of metabolic effects). T3 and T4 negatively feedback and inhibit the release of additional TRH and TSH from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, respectively. Meaning, increased T3/T4 in the blood normally inhibits the release of TRH and subsequently TSH.

Hyperthyroidism: Diagnosed by a decreased TSH and increased T4. Objective findings on the exam would include but are not limited to tachycardia and hyperreflexia. Subjective findings, as described by the patient, would include palpitations, diarrhea, weight loss, anxiety, and heat intolerance.

Hypothyroidism: Diagnosed by the presence of increased TSH and decreased T4. Objective findings on the exam would include but are not limited to bradycardia, decreased deep tendon reflexes, and a lethargic appearing patient. Subjective findings, as described by the patient, would include constipation, weight gain, fatigue, cold intolerance, and hair loss.

The findings listed above are not an all-inclusive list but rather signs and symptoms most often found and reported.
