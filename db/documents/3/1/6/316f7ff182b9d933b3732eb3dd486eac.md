Causes of a nocturnal cough can be categorized as respiratory, non-respiratory, and systemic.

- The most common respiratory causes of a chronic cough include postnasal drip, postinfectious, and asthma.

- Environmental factors include smoking, both active and passive; this is the most frequent environmental factor.

- Drugs include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-blockers, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

- Drugs causing pulmonary fibrosis are bleomycin, busulphan, methotrexate, carmustine, amiodarone, cyclophosphamide, and hydralazine.

- Other respiratory causes include bronchiectasis, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), primary or secondary lung tumors, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis.

- Other upper airway conditions to be ruled out are chronic tonsillar enlargement, obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), laryngeal problems, and foreign bodies in the large airways.

- Non-respiratory causes are GERD, recurrent aspiration, left ventricular failure, mitral stenosis, pulmonary infarction, and psychogenic cough, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.

- Very rare conditions include cardiac arrhythmias, aortic aneurysm, cough only when supine (due to a collapse of large airways), following complex involuntary tics (Tourette syndrome), and vitamin B12 deficiency (probably due to sensory neuropathy).

- Of all these conditions, cough variant asthma, GERD, and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) are called the pathogenic triad, and they constitute 90% of cases.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could result in long-standing symptoms, most importantly cough.
