- Sodium oxybate comes as an oral solution (0.5 g/ml), with two equal doses administered daily. Before ingestion, each dose of sodium oxybate should be diluted with approximately ¼ cup (about 60 mL) of water in the empty pharmacy containers provided. Patients should take both doses while in bed and lie down immediately after dosing as sodium oxybate may cause them to fall asleep abruptly without first feeling drowsy.

- Initially, patients can begin taking 4.5 g/night, the patient should take the first dose of 2.25 g before bed, and the patient should take the second dose consisting of another 2.5 g 2.25 to 4 hours after the first dose. After that, the dosage can increase based on the tolerability and efficacy response of the patient; the maximum dose is 9 g/ night. If the second dose is missed, skip the dose and resume the usual dosing schedule the next day. Do not administer two doses at the same time.

- A placebo-controlled study showed that improvements of symptoms with sodium oxybate occur in a dose-dependent manner at 4.5 g, 6 g, and 9 g per night; patients report a decrease in cataplexy attacks as well as diminished excessive daytime sleepiness.

**Pregnancy Considerations**

- There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with sodium oxybate in pregnant women. Oral administration of sodium oxybate to pregnant rats (150, 350, or 1,000 mg/kg/day) or rabbits (300, 600, or 1,200 mg/kg/day) throughout organogenesis produced no clear evidence of developmental toxicity; however, oral administration to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in increased stillbirths and decreased offspring postnatal viability and growth, at a clinically relevant dose.

- In obstetric anesthesia using an injectable sodium oxybate, newborns had stable cardiovascular and respiratory functions but demonstrated drowsiness, causing a slight decrease in Apgar scores. In addition, there was a fall in the rate of uterine contractions 20 minutes after injection. The placental transfer is rapid, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) has been detected in newborns at delivery after intravenous administration of GHB to mothers.

- Based on animal data, sodium oxybate may cause fetal harm. (Class B)

**Breastfeeding Considerations**

- Infants have been successfully breastfed by mothers taking sodium oxybate therapeutically for narcolepsy. With the typical two doses per night treatment regimen, nursing should usually be withheld from the first dose to 4 to 6 hours after the second dose, and breastfeeding can be continued during the day.

- For lactating mothers, it is essential to note that gamma-hydroxybutyrate(GHB) is excreted in breast milk. It is crucial to monitor the health of their infants. A 2016 case report study presented a 27-year-old primigravida patient who was taking sodium oxybate for symptom control. The patient was seeking lactation advice; health experts advised her to avoid breastfeeding 4 hours after taking a dose. Using follow-up phone interviews, the mother explained that she did not experience any difficulties with breastfeeding. There were no noted adverse effects on the infant. Based on the pediatrics chart record, the infant showed appropriate milestones.

**Renal Impairment**

- Sodium oxybate has a high salt content. Therefore, in patients sensitive to salt intake (e.g., those with heart failure, hypertension, or renal impairment), count the daily sodium intake in each dosage of sodium oxybate. Consider using lower-sodium oxybate(92% less sodium compared to conventional sodium oxybate).

**Hepatic Impairment**

- Product labeling suggests that the recommended starting dosage in patients with hepatic impairment is one-half of the original dosage per night, administered orally divided into two doses.

- Sodium oxybate is unlikely to cause clinically apparent liver injury. Likelihood score: E.
