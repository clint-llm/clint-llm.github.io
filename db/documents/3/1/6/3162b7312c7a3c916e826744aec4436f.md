One prospective study looked at 50 patients who underwent a sural nerve biopsy. Their findings were that the biopsy changed the diagnosis in 14% of cases, and altered management in 60% of cases.

Reduced sensation in the sural nerve distribution occurred in 18.4% of patients who underwent a whole nerve biopsy (n=717).
