Ivabradine is available as tablets to be taken by mouth.

- The initial dose should be 5 mg, twice a day.

- The dose can be adjusted after 2 weeks based on the heart rate.

- The maximum dose is 7.5 mg, twice a day.

- Patients with conduction defects or bradycardia can be initiated on 2.5 mg, twice a day.

- The reduction in heart rate depends on the baseline heart rate and the ivabradine dose.

**Dose Adjustment**

- If the heart rate is more than 60, increase the dose by 2.5 mg, twice a day, up to 7.5 mg twice a day.

- If the heart rate is 50-60 bpm, continue the current dose.

- If the heart rate is less than 50 or the patient is experiencing symptoms of bradycardia, decrease the dose by 2.5 mg twice a day. If the dose is 2.5 mg twice daily, stop therapy.

**Clinical Evidence**

The SHIFT trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with symptomatic heart failure, ejection fraction (EF) less than or equal to 35%, in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of at least 70 beats per minute, who had been admitted for heart failure within the past year and were on stable heart failure treatment including beta-blockers. Patients received ivabradine titrated to 7.5 mg twice a day or placebo. The goal was to determine if ivabradine would decrease hospitalizations and/or mortality due to heart failure. Ivabradine reduced the primary endpoint, which was a composite of hospital admissions due to heart failure and mortality. Bradycardia and visual adverse effects (phosphenes) occurred more in patients receiving ivabradine than those in the placebo group.

The BEAUTIFUL trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational trial to test whether reducing heart rate with ivabradine affected cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and EF less than 40%. Patients had a resting heart rate of at least 60 beats per minute. Patients received ivabradine 5 mg twice a day with a goal of 7.5 mg twice a day versus placebo. Most patients were also on beta-blocker therapy. Ivabradine did not affect the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality, hospital admissions for myocardial infarctions, or worsening heart failure. In patients with heartbeats of 70 or greater, ivabradine reduced hospital admissions due to fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction.

SIGNIFY was a randomized trial that tested the addition of ivabradine to standard therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease but no heart failure. Patients had to be at least 55 years old with a heart rate of 70 beats or more. The goal heart rate was 55 to 60 beats per minute. Patients received 10 mg of ivabradine twice a day or a placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. After 28 months, there was no significant difference between ivabradine and placebo. Bradycardia occurred more with ivabradine compared to placebo. The primary endpoint was higher in patients in the ivabradine group who initially had angina that limited activity.
