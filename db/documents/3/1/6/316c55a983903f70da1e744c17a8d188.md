As further research is conducted, significant harmful effects of hearing loss have been revealed. When diagnosed early, interventions can be put into place to optimize one’s chance for normal hearing and development. Primary interventions include conventional hearing aids, bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA) with softband for children under age 5, contralateral routing of signals (CROS) hearing aids, and remote microphone systems. When hearing loss is severe enough, the patient should be evaluated for cochlear implantation.

Hearing aids have been shown to reduce hearing thresholds by up to 25 dB hearing loss (HL); however, in the setting of severe to profound hearing loss, hearing aids perform much worse than cochlear implantation.

If screening is not performed or if careful attention is not paid to following up on abnormal results, patients may not have hearing loss diagnosed until a later age when the brain is less plastic. The ability to integrate a hearing intervention is made more difficult. Data from the 2018 Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Hearing Screening and Follow-Up Survey indicate loss of follow-up in greater than 1 in 4 patients nationwide.

These patients are at much higher risk for social, developmental, and intellectual delays. While significant progress has been accomplished since the initiation of newborn hearing screening in 2001, continued efforts must be made to close the gap between diagnostic completion and initiation of therapy. Genetic testing and imaging may play a role in evaluating some patients with hearing loss; however, these should not be ordered routinely for every patient. With proper implementation of the 1-3-6 month guidelines at a minimum and 1-2-3 month guidelines where possible, children with hearing loss can most often usually develop and attain a high quality of life.
