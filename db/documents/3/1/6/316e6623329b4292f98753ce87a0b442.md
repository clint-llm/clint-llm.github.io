Some relative contraindications to opioid analgesics include an increased risk of prescription misuse. Several risk factors exist. These include:

- Family or personal history of substance abuse

- Young age

- History of legal problems

- Frequent contact with high-risk individuals or environments

- History of previous problems with employers, family, and friends

- History of risk-taking and thrill-seeking behavior

- Smoking cigarettes and regularly using other substances that lead to dependence

- History of major depression or anxiety

- Multiple psychosocial stressors

- History of childhood abuse

- Previous drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation.

Also, other opioid-specific toxicities exist, which may preclude their use in specific populations. For example, as mentioned above, opioids with serotonergic activity have the potential to lower the seizure threshold and should, therefore, be used cautiously or avoided entirely in patients with a history of seizure disorder to avoid causing or worsening seizures. Opioids such as methadone, which have the potential to prolong QTc interval, should be used cautiously or avoided entirely in patients with long QT syndrome.
