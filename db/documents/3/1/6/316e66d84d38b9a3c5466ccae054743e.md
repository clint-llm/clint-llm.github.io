PRK employs a 193 nm argon fluoride excimer laser to ablate the anterior corneal stroma. At 193 nm, a single photon can break the carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds that form the peptide backbone of the corneal collagen molecules. With each pulse, the collagen polymer is broken into smaller fragments, and a discrete amount of corneal tissue is expelled from the surface.
