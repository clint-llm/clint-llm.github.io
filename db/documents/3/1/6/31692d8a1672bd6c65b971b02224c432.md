An interprofessional team approach involving clinicians, mid-level practitioners, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists is essential in managing HIV-2 infection, given it can be complex and lifelong. The clinical care team should involve an infectious disease specialist with expertise in HIV care, social worker, pharmacist, and involve other specialist care if needed. Central to the care team is the patient, and focus should be paid to ensuring the HIV care team provides strong, unified communication, clear disease understanding, and a supportive environment. Providing an interprofessional care team has been shown among HIV-1 patients to improve important outcomes such as virologic suppression and patient retention.

Similar outcomes could be expected for those living with HIV-2, given the significant overlap in clinical services and support required to manage patients successfully. The role of long-acting injectable agents and uptake of telemedicine may present both new opportunities and challenges for multidisciplinary teams caring for those with HIV. However, as HIV clinical care continues to evolve, multidisciplinary teams must continue working synergistically to maximize patient engagement, retention, and virologic suppression.
