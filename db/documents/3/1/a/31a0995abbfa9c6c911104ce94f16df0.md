Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as "statins," are used adjunctively to diet and exercise to treat hypercholesterolemia by lowering total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) concentrations while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. The approved FDA indications vary slightly between each statin but generally are indicated for the treatment and/or prevention of primary and secondary prevention clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) (e.g., myocardial infarction or stroke).  The choice of agent should have its basis on patient-specific characteristics, the pharmacokinetic profiles of each medication, and the 2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol

**Primary prevention (age 40 to 75 years):**In patients without clinically significant cardiovascular disease, statins in addition to heart-healthy lifestyle measures are indicated in the following conditions to reduce the risk of developing myocardial infarction, stroke, or undergoing revascularization procedures.

- **LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dL:**Initiate high-intensity statin therapy with an aim towards achieving over 50% reduction in LDL-C concentration. If LDL-C is greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL; add ezetimibe +/- PCSK9 inhibitor

- **LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL:**
- **With diabetes mellitus:**Initiate moderate-intensity statin with an aim towards achieving a 30 to 49% reduction in LDL-C concentration. If multiple ASCVD risk factors, age 50 to 77 years, initiate high-intensity aim to achieve over 50% reduction in LDL-C concentration.
- **Without diabetes mellitus and 10-year ASCVD risk greater than 20% (high risk):**Initiate high-intensity statin therapy with an aim towards achieving over 50% reduction in LDL-C concentration
- **Without diabetes mellitus and 10-year ASCVD risk greater than or equal to 7.5% to less than 20% (intermediate risk):**With the evaluation of risk enhancers (e.g., family history, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory disease, ethnicity factors, condition-specific to women, persistently elevated LDL-C greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL) and coronary artery calcium score if uncertain. Initiate moderate-intensity statin with an aim towards achieving a 30 to 49% reduction in LDL-C concentration.
- **Without diabetes mellitus and 10-year ASCVD risk 5 to less than 7.5% (borderline risk):**Initiate lifestyle, select moderate intensity with the presence of risk enhancers (risk discussion indicated)
- **Without diabetes mellitus and 10-year ASCVD risk less than 5% (low risk):**Initiate lifestyle and risk discussion

**Secondary prevention (age over 18 years):**History of multiple major ASCVD events (recent acute coronary syndrome within the past 12 months, history of MI, history of ischemic stroke, symptomatic peripheral artery disease) or one major ASCVD event with multiple high-risk conditions (age greater than or equal to 65 years, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, current smoking, history of heart failure, history of PCI or CABG, persistently elevated LDL-C greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL).

- **Very high-risk ASCVD:**Initiate maximally tolerated statin. If LDL-C greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL add ezetimibe +/- PCSK9 inhibitor (with LDL-C greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL and non-HDL-C higher than 100 mg/dL)

- **Stable ASCVD:**Initiate high to moderate-intensity statin with the aim towards achieving LDL-C lowering as described above

Additionally, statins are useful in the management of the following dyslipidemias:

- Familial hypercholesterolemia (type II a hyperlipoproteinemia), characterized by LDL receptor deficiency

- Familial combined hyperlipidemia (type II b hyperlipoproteinemia), characterized by decreased LDL receptor and increased apo B lipoprotein

- Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia), characterized by abnormal function of apo E receptor that is necessary for the clearance of chylomicron remnants

- Familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV hyperlipoproteinemia), characterized by increased VLDL production
