Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition in which a patient experiences cyclical nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain after using cannabis. This disorder is characterized by 1) several years of preceding cannabis use, predating the onset of illness; 2) a cyclical pattern of hyperemesis every few weeks to months, at which time the patient is still using cannabis and 3) resolution of the symptoms after cessation of cannabis use, confirmed by a negative urine drug screen. The almost pathognomic aspect of a patient's presenting history is that their symptoms are relieved by hot baths or shower. This activity introduces the pathophysiology, clinical manifestation, and management of cannabis hyperemesis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. 
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. 
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of cyclic vomiting syndrome and improve outcomes.
