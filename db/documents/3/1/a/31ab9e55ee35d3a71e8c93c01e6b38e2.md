Because ritonavir use correlates with hepatotoxicity, monitoring liver function tests before initiation of therapy, 2 to 8 weeks after starting treatment, and subsequently every 3 to 6 months is recommended. Ritonavir has also demonstrated associations with hypercholesterolemia, so a lipid profile is recommended at baseline and every 6 to 12 months. Because a rise in lipids increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, lipid-lowering agents may be required. Patients on ritonavir are also susceptible to diabetes mellitus, so recommendations include baseline fasting glucose levels followed by screening every 12 months. Although there is weak evidence of QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes in patients on ritonavir, the measurement of electrolyte levels, including magnesium, should occur at baseline, 2 to 8 weeks after starting treatment, and every 3 to 6 months after that.

The oral solution of lopinavir/ritonavir contains alcohol, so it should be avoided in neonates less than 42 weeks postmenstrual age and less than 14 days old. Infants, particularly premature infants, are at increased risk of central nervous system complications.
