The diagnosis of bursitis is primarily clinical. Routine lab work is not likely to be beneficial. However, imaging may be a useful adjunct to a thorough history and physical examination to help narrow the differential diagnosis. Plain film x-rays may be considered when acute trauma produces a concern for fracture or foreign body. Ultrasound may be helpful in differentiating between an inflamed bursa and the presence of cobblestoning in cellulitis. It is also likely to be useful to observe changes with range of motion, which help to rule out tendonous injury, and provides an added benefit when obtaining needle aspirates.

Needle aspiration of bursal fluid is crucial in differentiating between causes. Aspirated bursal fluid should be sent for cell count, gram stain and culture, glucose, and analysis for crystals. The presence of negatively-birefringent crystals rules in gout, whereas positively-birefringent crystals suggest pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease). A predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes suggests septic causes, while a predominance of mononuclear cells suggests non-infectious etiologies. While fluid leukocytes are non-specific, bursal leukocytosis >2000/mm had a sensitivity and specificity for septic bursitis of 94% and 79%, respectively.
