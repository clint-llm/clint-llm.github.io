The close differentials ofÂ vernal keratoconjunctivitis include all types of allergic conjunctivitis, including seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, perennial allergic conjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, giant papillary conjunctivitis. Most of these are IgE mediated responses except giant papillary conjunctivitis. None have gender predilection, except AKC and VKC, which are more prevalent among males. History and physical examination often help in distinguishing between these clinical entities.

The closest differential of VKC is AKC. The differentiating features include early age of onset in VKC in early teens compared to 20-50 years in AKC. AKC is more commonly associated with asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis. AKC is more chronic and often results in conjunctival cicatrization, whereas VKC episodes are usually self-limiting and do not result in severe vision-threatening sequelae.
