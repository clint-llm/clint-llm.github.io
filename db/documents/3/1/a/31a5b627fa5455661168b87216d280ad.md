It's been estimated that half of all symptomatic kidney stones could be prevented with proper diagnosis and prophylactic treatment of underlying chemical nephrolithiasis risk factors.

Direct and indirect costs are estimated at over $10 billion yearly, which is predicted to exceed $15 billion by 2030. This is due to the increasing incidence of stone disease from other associated disorders that contribute to nephrolithiasis, such as diabetes and obesity, general population growth, and global warming.

Low urinary citrate excretion (hypocitraturia) is one of the most common, treatable causes of kidney stones. Boothby and Adams first reported this in 1934 and later confirmed by Kissin and Locks in 1941. This information was largely ignored or attributed to the bacterial consumption of citrate until 1962, when Hodgkinson first suggested hypocitraturia as a unique urinary chemical disorder in nephrolithiasis patients.

Hypocitraturia is officially defined as less than 320 mg of urinary citrate excretion a day, but this definition has been questioned by many experts as it is based on statistical analyses of large numbers of 24-hour urine tests from the general population and not on saturation ratios, supersaturation, pH, crystallization points, stone chemical composition or the minimal concentrations necessary to prevent urinary stones.

It is estimated that hypocitraturia isÂ found in about 30% (10% to 60%) of all stone formers, but this will vary according to the particular definition of hypocitraturia used and the stone type.

Long-term optimization of potassium citrate supplementation can reduce calcium nephrolithiasis by 80%.
