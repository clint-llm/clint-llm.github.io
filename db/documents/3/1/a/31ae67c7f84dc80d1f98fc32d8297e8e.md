Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney and constitutes over 90 percent of all renal malignancies. RCC may be sporadic (~96%) or familial (4%) and is a heterogeneous group of disorders that are sub-classified into several distinct sub-types associated with distinct genetic abnormalities. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of renal cell carcinoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients of renal cell carcinoma.

**Objectives:**
- Review the imaging findings associated with management considerations for patients with renal cell carcinoma.
- Describe the patient physical exam findings associated with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
- Explain the staging system and its application to management options available for renal cell carcinoma. 
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate follow-up during initial management and follow-up to enhance postoperative management and care.
