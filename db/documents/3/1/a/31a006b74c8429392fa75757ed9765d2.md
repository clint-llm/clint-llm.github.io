LGGs grow slowly and can be followed over the years without treatment unless they cause symptoms and grow. Multiple acquired genetic mutations are found in gliomas. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors. p53 is the "guardian of the genome" and ensures the DNA is copied correctly; it destroys the cell if it is mutated. p53 usually mutates early in the disease, and other mutations can survive. EGFR normally stimulates cells to divide, but if it gets amplified, it stimulates cells to divide too much. Together these mutations cause uncontrollable cell division, a hallmark of cancer.

The most common presenting symptom in LGGs is a headache. Tumors are abnormal growths, and when they increase in size cause pressure effects in surroundings. The pathophysiology behind the headache is due to the increased pressure in the microvasculature due to obstruction, which leads to hydrocephalus. Other symptoms due to obstructive hydrocephalus are changes in vision, nausea, and vomiting.
