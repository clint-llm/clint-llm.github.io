Treatment for antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitides starts with induction of remission to avoid or slow down organ involvement. The definition of remission has been standardized by the European Vasculitis Society/European League against Rheumatism (EUVAS/EULAR) group, which is a no detectable disease activity using a recognized scoring tool such as BVAS.

Induction of remission is usually done by cyclophosphamide in addition to high-dose steroids. Sometimes with a life-threatening disease or severe kidney involvement, plasma exchange is used along with induction treatment.
