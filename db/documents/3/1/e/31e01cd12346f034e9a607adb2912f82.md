The structure of eye arteries is similar to that of arteries throughout the body. Arteries are considered rigid vessels in comparison to veins. The arterial wall consists of a tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Arteries in the eye are also susceptible to damage by glycosylation reactions and plaque deposition in patients with diabetes and hypertension which are two common risk factors for ocular pathology.
