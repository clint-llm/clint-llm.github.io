The prognosis of unconscious patients is variable and highly dependent on the etiology, the severity of brain injury, and individual patient factors. The GCS is used to evaluate outcomes for research purposes.

TBI has been the most studied etiology of coma, likely due to its high prevalence and highly variable outcomes. Estimated mortality in patients in a coma from TBI ranges from 40 to 50%.

Patients with non-traumatic etiologies that do not recover quickly have an even worse prognosis than the TBI cohort. The mortality rate of non-traumatic coma varied from 25 to 87%.
