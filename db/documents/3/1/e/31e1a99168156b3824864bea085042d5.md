- Upon exposure, glycol ethers are metabolized to their respective alkoxyacetic acids, which orchestrate systemic toxicity.

- Alcohol dehydrogenase is the primary means of metabolism, and excretion is primarily by the kidneys.

- Although the half-life is relatively short, evaluating for co-ingestions that can prolong clearance through competitive enzyme inhibition is paramount.

- Acute toxicity is generally mild to moderate and can result in skin irritation, metabolic derangements, central nervous system depression, hemolytic anemia, and spermatogenesis defects.

- Chronic toxicity can result in hematological side effects (anemia, bone marrow suppression), hepatic histologic changes in the liver, and reproductive and developmental damage.

- Managing glycol ether toxicity, like most toxic alcohol ingestions, begins with assessing the airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by supportive measures.

- The two primary avenues for treatment are fomepizole and hemodialysis for managing acute toxicity, which may provide the most benefit if given early.
