The differential diagnosis for the causesÂ of unconsciousness is broad.

Some etiologies are straightforward, such as anoxic brain injury, cerebrovascular accidents, seizures, and poisonings, but some categories have a wide differential in and of themselves. For example, metabolic causes of coma may include hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, electrolyte abnormalities, and endocrine disorders. Infections, shock, disorders of temperature regulation, respiratory failure, and trauma can also cause a coma.

When examining an unconscious patient, it is crucial to differentiate organic causes of coma from disorders that cause psychiatric unresponsiveness, such as catatonia, severe depression, conversion disorder, and malingering.
