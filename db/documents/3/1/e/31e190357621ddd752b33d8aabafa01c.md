Afferent loop syndrome occurs as a result of partial or complete obstruction of the afferent limb along its course or at the anastomosis. Symptoms are related to both the distention of the bowel as secretions accumulate and the obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary tree.

Chronic afferent loop syndrome is usually related to partial obstruction. The bowel can partially decompress; however, ascending cholangitis and pancreatitis may still be seen. Additionally, stagnant secretions allow for bacterial overgrowth within the afferent limb (blind loop syndrome), presenting with symptoms of malnutrition, vitamin B12 deficiency, and steatorrhea.
