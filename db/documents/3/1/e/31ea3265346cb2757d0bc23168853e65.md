- Osteochondroma

- Ossified hair follicle (for example, in the case of a melanocytic nevus)

- Osteosarcoma in its extraskeletal form located in the dermis or in the subcutaneous tissue

- Calcified phleboliths

- Calcified nodules resulting from surgical clips, wires, or sutures may radiologically mimick osteoma cutis.
