H. pylori is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium that can infect humans. It is often found in the stomach of affected individuals and causes inflammation and ulceration. Patients harboring the bacteria are asymptomatic with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia developing only after gastritis and peptic ulcer disease have set in. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of H. pylori and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
