Sciatica is a debilitating condition that is a result of the sciatic nerve or sciatic nerve root pathology. Affected patients experience pain and paresthesias in the sciatic nerve distribution or an associated lumbosacral nerve root. Sciatica pain often is worsened with twisting, bending, or coughing. This is often a chronic condition that is managed through the use of analgesics to control the pain and NSAIDs to decrease inflammation. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of sciatica and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of sciatica.
- Outline the expected presentation of sciatica.
- Summarize the treatment options for a patient with sciatica.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to educate the patient on the importance of lifestyle changes and physical therapy, which will improve outcomes for those with sciatica.
