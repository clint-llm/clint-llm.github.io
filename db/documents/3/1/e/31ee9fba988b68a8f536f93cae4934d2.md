There are no absolute contraindications for excimer laser coronary angioplasty (ELCA). Relative contraindicationsÂ include:

- Acute angulation (> 45 degrees)

- Coronary dissection

- Unprotected left main coronary artery

ELCA is also currently not recommended for poorly visualized/heavily calcified lesions and those with a diameter of less than the smallest catheter size available (0.9 mm).
