Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently increased in use for the pregnant and pediatric populations due to the lack of ionizing radiation. It has a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 96% in evaluating for appendicitis, though it has been shown to be slightly more effective in identifying the appendix in adults versus children.

Another primary use for MRI is in staging appendiceal neoplasms, as it is more accurate than CT. The accuracy increases by adding diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which helps identify highly cellular tumor implants. Solid tumors will demonstrate restricted diffusion, delineating them from the adjacent organs. When included with delayed gadolinium-enhanced imaging with oral and rectal contrast, the sensitivity is 95% and specificity 70%.
