Deterioration in LUTS/increasingly problematic voiding symptoms is the most common indicator of disease progression. In addition to this, patients may present with complications, including acute retention, infections, or haematuria.

Observational studies have demonstrated that when left without treatment, clinical progression of BPH increased over a 48 month period, with 31% of the cohort requiring presentation at 48 months and 5% developing acute retention in the 48 month period.

The risk of acute urinary retention also increased with age, in the Olmsted County study, the incidence of retention in men increased over ten-fold, from 3/1000 (40-49yrs) to 34.7/1000 (70-79yrs).
