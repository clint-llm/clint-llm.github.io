**Immediate Treatment Options**

- Risk of soft tissue compromise or neurovascular injury: emergent skeletal stabilization

- Options: traction via placement of a traction pin or application of external fixator

- Stable fracture with no soft tissue or neurovascular concern:

- Immobilization, weight-bearing restrictions, skeletal immobilization (splint application, knee immobilizer).

**Postoperative Periprosthetic Fractures**

- Nonoperative management

- Indications: rare (medically unfit surgical candidates).
- Restriction: non-weight bearing to involved extremity until callus present
- Pearls: increase soft tissue surveillance in bed-bound patients (increase turns in bed, offload fracture with additional padding).
- Education: crucial to educate patient and patient's family risk of complications (nonunion, malunion, skin compromise)

- Vancouver A fractures (operative fixation):

- Indications: Marsland et al. argue that displacement of the greater trochanter more than 2 cm significantly compromised the abductor complex and should be an indication for operative fixation.
- Fixation options: Ricci et al. described the use of trochanteric claw plates for additional fixation for displaced greater trochanter fractures.
- Pearls: a unique subset of fractures with a lack in the literature regarding the treatment of isolated Vancouver Ag fractures exist.
- Postoperative weight-bearing: Ricci et al. recommend partial weight-bearing with or without abduction brace for up to 3 months or until fracture callus is present.
- Other: If the greater trochanter is significantly stress shielded or damaged secondary to osteolysis, the fragment may not be amenable to stabilization with a plate and screw construct.

- Vancouver B fractures (operative fixations):

- Location: occur at or just distal to the tip of the femoral stem.

- Vancouver B1 fractures

- Stability: occur around a well-fixed prosthesis.
- Bone stock: adequate bone stock surrounding the femoral implant.
- Treatment:

- Open reduction and internal fixation with a plate construct is the standard method of fixation.
- Ricci et al. described the number of screws used in a locking plate proximal and distal depend on the location of the fracture. In general, four cortices proximal and eight cortices distal provide sufficient fixation.
- Augmentation with cerclage wiring and allograft or autograft struts may be indicated in a very proximal or distal location, existing intramedullary hardware, or adequate bone stock.
- If a stemmed total knee component is close to the proximal femoral component, overlapping the plate over the femoral prosthesis lessens the stress riser between the components.


- Postoperative care: non-weight bearing on operative extremity until fracture callus is present
- Complications:

- Fredin et al. found that immobilization and weight-bearing restrictions pose a significant medical concern for this patient population increased the length of hospital stay an average of 91 days.
- Lindahl et al. found a high rate of failure when open reduction with internal fixation was performed alone, citing a 34% failure rate attributed to a misdiagnosed loose femoral component (missed Vancouver B2 type fracture).
- Must compare the immediate postoperative image of primary THA with preoperative X-rays taken in the emergency room prior to fixation.




- Vancouver B2 fractures

- Stability: unstable femoral component.
- Bone stock: adequate proximal bone stock
- Treatment:

- Revision THA with a fracture bypassing diaphyseal fit stem and open reduction with internal fixation of the fracture is the recommended treatment for Vancouver B2 fractures.
- Lewallen et al. describe the use of cerclage wire fixation distal to the fracture to prevent the propagation of the fracture when reaming or broaching for the revision stem. Additional fixation is utilized proximal and distal to the fracture site to maintain fracture reduction.


- Postoperative care:

- Mulay et al. recommend the patients to be restricted to toe-touch weight-bearing for six weeks on the postoperative extremity with progression to full weight-bearing by three months.




- Vancouver B3 fractures

- Stability: Unstable femoral component.
- Bone stock: Adequate proximal bone stock
- Treatment:

- Options: revision THA with a diaphyseal fit prosthesis, tumor (mega) prostheses, and allograft prosthesis
- Proximal fixation of the fracture with plate fixation with or without cerclage wire construct.
- Rayan et al. found that fully coated uncemented femoral stems have an excellent clinical outcome with a union rate of 86 to 100%.

- Vancouver C fractures

- Location: occur distal to the femoral prosthesis.
- Stability: stable femoral component.
- Bone stock: adequate proximal bone stock
- Treatment:

- Open reduction with internal fixation using locked, nonlocked, or compression plate technology with or without cerclage wire fixation.
- O'Toole et al. highlighted the importance of plate length. They recommended the plate length should be long enough to overlap the distal aspect of the femoral prosthesis and amenable to four to six cortices distal. Unicortical screws at the level of the femoral stem offer additional support and can be combined with cerclage wire fixation if needed.

**Intraoperative Periprosthetic Femur Fractures**

Vancouver A1 and A2 fractures involve a cortical perforation and nondisplaced fracture of the proximal metaphysis, respectively. Vancouver A1 fractures are amenable to autograft bone graft from the acetabulum or femoral head and continuation of hip arthroplasty. Vancouver A2 fractures are fixed with a cerclage wire construct to prevent the fracture propagation and then insertion of the femoral component in a standard fashion. Displaced A3 fractures may require provisional fixation with a plate or cerclage wire prior to placing a fully porous-coated stem. Vancouver B1 to B3 fractures involve diaphysis. Lewallen et al. found that provisional fixation with cerclage wire is sufficient to stabilize the fracture and allow a fully porous-coated stem to be inserted distal to the fracture by a minimum of 2 to 3 cortices.
