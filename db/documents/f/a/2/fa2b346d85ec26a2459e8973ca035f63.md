The pectinate or dentate lineÂ is the junction between the superior and inferior anal canal. There are many differences between these two regions, including their embryological origins, innervation, venous and arterial supply, and lymphatic supply. Above the pectinate line, the anal canal has an endodermal origin and is lined by simple columnar epithelia. Blood supply is from the superior rectal artery, which originates from the inferior mesenteric artery and returns via the superior rectal veins into the inferior mesenteric vein.

Below the pectinate line, the anal canal has an ectodermal origin and is predominantly lined by stratified squamous epithelium. The inferior rectal canal obtains its blood supply from the inferior rectal artery, which originates from the internal iliac artery. Blood returns via the inferior rectal vein, which ultimately drains into the inferior vena cava.
