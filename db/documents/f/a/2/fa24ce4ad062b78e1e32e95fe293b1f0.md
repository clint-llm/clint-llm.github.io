It is essential to determine the triggers for a patient with atopic dermatitis. Reduction or elimination of these triggers is an important step in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Patients may see an improvement in their skin and reduced flare-ups if they avoid allergens (commonly dust mites, egg, peanuts, milk, fish, soy, rice, and wheat) and irritants (particularly chemicals, heat, soaps, humidity, acrylic, and wool).
