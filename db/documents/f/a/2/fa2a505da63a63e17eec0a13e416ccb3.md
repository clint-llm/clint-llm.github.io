It is estimated that 1 in 5 adults living in the United Kingdom and the United States suffer from mental illness.

In response to this rising need, there have been recent efforts to integrate behavioral health and primary care—an interprofessional care strategy will result in the best outcomes. The Collaborative Care Model employs a team-based approach emphasizing collaboration between different providers and has demonstrated improvement in depression outcomes compared to the usual care that persists for at least 24 months.

Compared to other forms of psychotherapy, person-centered therapy has the advantage of being more readily available and more easily implemented in other healthcare roles.

In a small randomized controlled trial comparing various psychotherapeutic interventions of PTSD in a low-resource setting, all participants experienced symptom reduction regardless of the intervention. Importantly, nurses felt that supportive counseling was the most transferable to their respective work environments.

Non-directive supportive counseling has a broader application beyond behavioral health. Healthcare providers can employ these principles to help patients make informed decisions about their physical health; however, more research is necessary to assess the impact of this approach on healthcare outcomes.
