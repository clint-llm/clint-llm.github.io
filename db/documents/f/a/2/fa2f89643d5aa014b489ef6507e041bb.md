Lipomas are composed of adipose/fat tissue, are mobile, soft to the touch, typically painless, and present subcutaneously. These are surrounded by a thin, fibrous capsule that is not attached to the underlying muscle fascia. In their typical form, they rarely present a diagnostic challenge.

**Adenolipoma of Skin**

- They are superficially located
