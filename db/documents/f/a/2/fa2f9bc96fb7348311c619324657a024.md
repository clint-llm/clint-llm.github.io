The diagnosis is clinical. While some lab abnormalities, such as increased histamine in the blood during attacks, and anatomical changes found in a morphology study, are not useful in a clinical setting. A questionnaire asking about headache duration (less than 180 minutes) and autonomic symptoms (conjunctival injection or lacrimation) has a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 100%. Clinicians must have a degree of suspicion, as cluster headaches are usually misdiagnosed, and patients do not receive a clinical diagnosis for up to five years.

According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3 edition (ICHD-3), diagnostic criteria for cluster headaches require all of a set of criteria.

- At least five attacks

- Attacks characterized by severe supraorbital, unilateral orbital, and/or temporal pain lasting 15 to 180 minutes when untreated; during part (but less than half) of the time-course of cluster headache, attacks may be less severe and/or of shorter or longer in duration

- Either one or both of the following: 

- At least one of the following signs/symptoms ipsilateral to the headache:

- Conjunctival injection and/or lacrimation
- Forehead and facial sweating
- Nasal congestion and/or rhinorrhea
- Eyelid edema
- Miosis and/or ptosis


- A sense of agitation or restlessness

- Attacks have a frequency between one every other day and eight per day; during part (but less than half) of the active time-course of headache, attacks may be less frequent

- Not better explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

Diagnostic criteria for **episodic**cluster headache:

- Attacks fulfill the criteria for cluster headache (as above) and occur in bouts (cluster periods)

- At least two cluster periods last from 7 days to one year (when untreated), separated by pain-free remission intervals of at least three months

Diagnostic criteria for **chronic**cluster headache:

- Attacks fulfill the criteria for cluster headache

- Attacks occur without a remission period, or with remissions lasting less than three months, for a minimum of 1 year

**Neuroimaging**

Patients should have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT) of the head with contrast as an alternative, to rule out any structural abnormality.
