The presence of the Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern is typically detected or suspected by utilizing an electrocardiogram (EKG) with a characteristic pattern of a short PR interval and normal QRS complex. These findings may also represent the presence of enhanced AV nodal conduction (EAVNC). While the LGL pattern is typically a clinical diagnosis utilizing an EKG in conjunction with history and physical, the diagnosis of EAVNC usually requires electrophysiologic (EP) evaluation. The finding of a short PR interval and the normal QRS complex is thought to be the result of a perinodal accessory pathway utilizing the bundle of James. Routine laboratory evaluation, including hormone levels (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and electrolytes (potassium or magnesium), may require monitoring; however, replacement in deficiency has not at this time been shown to affect the Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern. Vagal maneuvers have previously demonstrated accentuation of a variety of arrhythmias and may be an option; their use in the identification of LGL patterns has not been studied at this time. In most other suspected arrhythmias, Holter monitors or implantable loop recorders may be utilized to evaluate for the presence of conduction abnormalities. While use has not previously been a target of research in the evaluation of LGL, outpatient ambulatory monitoring with Holter monitors of loop recorders should be a decision left to the discretion of the treating physician.
