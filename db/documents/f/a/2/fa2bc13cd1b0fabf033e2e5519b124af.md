As a result of the aberrant development of the posterior division of the primitive foregut during embryogenesis, esophageal cysts can occur anywhere along the esophagus. Approximately 60 percent of the cysts occur in the lower third of the esophagus, which results in compressive dysphagia being the most common presenting symptom. Posterior cysts, located in the lower third of the esophagus, have also been seen to cause cardiac arrhythmias.

Approximately 90 percent of esophageal cysts do not communicate with the esophageal lumen; the others tend to run parallel to and communicate with the esophageal lumen.
