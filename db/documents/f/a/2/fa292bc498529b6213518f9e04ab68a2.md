After an external stimulus triggers the body’s stress response, the pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system are activated. Glucocorticoids production increases in the adrenal cortex, and acetylcholine (Ach) is released from sympathetic splanchnic nerves. Ach binds to nicotinic receptors located on the membrane of chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. These receptors promote exocytosis of catecholamine-filled vesicles for transport in the bloodstream. In the blood, catecholamines target alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors, a family of g protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These alpha and beta receptors can be further subdivided and subtyped with alphanumeric designation based on their cellular localization. The adrenergic receptors utilize either cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or phosphoinositol second messenger systems to activate ion channels that ultimately mediate the body’s sympathetic response.
