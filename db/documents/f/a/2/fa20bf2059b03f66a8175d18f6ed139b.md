Some limitations of the western blot technique are listed below:

- Western blot is a very delicate and time-consuming process. A minute imbalance at any level of the procedure can skew the results of the entire process.

- The secondary antibody can sometimes react with a non-intended protein, and this can cause the labeling of an incorrect protein.

- Insufficient transfer time can result in the larger proteins not transferring correctly. This can cause erroneous bands or no bands at all.

- Well-trained technicians are a must for this technique.

- Western blot is semi-quantitative at best. Only an approximate estimation and not a precise measurement of the molecular weight of the protein is possible.

- Primary antibody availability is crucial. If a primary antibody is not available for a specific protein, western blotting cannot be used to detect that protein.
