One must understand the androgenic steroid synthesis pathway to understand the mechanism of action of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. The gonads, and adrenal glands, to a lesser extent, produce androgens via several steps originating with the membrane substance, cholesterol. Testosterone, once formed, binds intracellular androgen receptors throughout the body, where it can exert its effects. A more potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), arises via conversion from testosterone, which is catalyzed by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. While testosterone and DHT are both androgenic steroids, they have different effects throughout the body. Testosterone is largely responsible for the growth seen at puberty, increased muscle mass, and even increased hematocrit in males versus females. DHT, on the other hand, has roles in fetal differentiation of external male genitalia, male hair patterns and lack thereof, and also prostatic growth.

Medications such as finasteride and dutasteride are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors designed to decrease the production of DHT. The utility of these drugs lies in their ability to decrease male pattern hair loss and also prostatic growth that would otherwise be uncontrolled in androgenic alopecia and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
