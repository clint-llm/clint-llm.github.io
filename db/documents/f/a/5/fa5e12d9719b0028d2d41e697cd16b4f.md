Carcinoid crisis can occur due to excessive release of neuropeptides during stress and can present with hemodynamic instability, shock, arrhythmia, hyperthermia, bronchospasm, or flushing. It can also occur pre-op, intra-procedural or post-op due to manipulation of the tumor. Patients with carcinoid syndrome and large bulky tumors or metastatic carcinoid may be at higher risk of carcinoid crisis and should be given perioperative continuous intravenous octreotide. Adrenergic blocking agents like clonidine, chlorpromazine (kinin antagonist), corticosteroids (blocks kallikrein release) and aprotinin (a kallikrein inhibitor) have also been used in carcinoid crisis. Before surgery, patients should undergo echocardiography for carcinoid valve disease, valve repair considered, and be given prophylaxis with somatostatin analogues.
