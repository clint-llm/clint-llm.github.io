Recognizing the varying causative factors directly associated with sensory neuropathy is paramount to providing prompt and effective treatment as a clinician. To gain a more comprehensive stance relative to potential underlying etiologies, one must contemplate the following processes, which include, but are not limited to:

- Immune-mediated

- Sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease

- Metabolic

- Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia

- Nutritional deficiencies

- Vitamin B12, copper, vitamin E, folic acid

- Toxic

- Chemotherapy, drug-induced, alcohol

- Hereditary

- Hemochromatosis, Fabry disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Friedreich ataxia

- Infectious

- Syphilis, leprosy, HIV, hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia

- Other

- Idiopathic, fibromyalgia, vasculitis

When generating differential diagnoses, a direct causative factor may not be readily apparent, and a diagnosis of exclusion (idiopathic sensory neuropathy) must merit consideration, as this constitutes a significant proportion of cases (20 to 30%).
