The use of angiography in imaging studies of skull lesions is extremely limited. The most common application area of angiography in skull lesions is for preoperative embolization of the brain tumors affecting the skull, especially meningiomas. Preoperative embolization is applied to reduce intraoperative blood loss, facilitate tumor resection, and shorten the operation time. It is especially useful in skull base tumors and tumors with very high vascularity.
