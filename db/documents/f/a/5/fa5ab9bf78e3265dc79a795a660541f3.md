The infections caused by E. coli O157:H7 range from asymptomatic to severe. Few individuals can develop potentially fatal complications like hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Chronic renal pathology may persist at times among those that survive. Humans are known to acquire E. coli O157:H7 in multiple ways, for example, contaminated food and water and direct contact with infected animals and humans. Consumption of contaminated food like ground beef, dairy products, and fresh produce is responsible for the majority of the outbreaks.

Cattle are considered as the principal reservoirs for E.coli O157:H7; contamination takes place through their use as food, their manure used as a fertilizer, and through water supplies contaminated by runoff from cattle farms. Although variation has been reported in fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 has been ranging from 0 to 80% among the cattle population, a seasonal pattern has also been shown, with prevalence increasing during summer months. Elevated temperature in summers might be responsible for favoring bacterial proliferation and survival.
