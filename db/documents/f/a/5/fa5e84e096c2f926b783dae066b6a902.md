Providers need to discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure and document informed consent from the patient or alternative decision-maker/authority (i.e., the patientâ€™s parent or guardian). Proper preparation includes having all necessary equipment and medication at the bedside. Providers, especially those new to this technique, may also find it helpful to review and map out or even mark the appropriate landmarks prior to infiltrating the anesthetic agent.
