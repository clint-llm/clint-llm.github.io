All healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, are responsible for the prevention of infectious disorders. In 1996, the CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals, prepared by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), combined the major features for Universal Precaution and Body Substance Isolation into what is now referred to as Standard Precautions. These guidelines also introduced three transmission-based precautions: airborne, droplet, and contact. All transmission-based precautions are to be used in conjunction with standard precautions. Every hospital has an interprofessional team that ensures proper adoption of the universal guidelines. Audits should randomly be performed, and healthcare workers who do not follow the guidelines should be reprimanded and sent for remedial education on infection prevention.
