Valve selection for the small aortic root is dependent on many variants. Considerations include age, body surface area (BSA), size of the aortic root, size of the prosthesis after excision of the native valve, its EOA, and valvular outflow tract of each patient. Choosing the appropriate valve for a specific patient requires calculating the indexed EOA (EOA/BSA). An indexed EOA <0.85 leads to an increased gradient over the prosthetic valve leading to PPM. When iEOA is >0.85, it leads to improved left ventricular remodeling and decreased long-term risk of morbidity including arrhythmias, heart failure, and mortality.

Small aortic root and its management by aortic root enlargement are directed to provide the patient with improved hemodynamics postoperatively. In cases of small aortic valve prostheses, a high gradient across it will lead to symptoms mimicking those of aortic stenosis and patient prosthesis mismatch. PPM is associated with increased perioperative and overall mortality. Its impact on mortality is directly proportional to the severity of PPM, hence making the operation useless and sometimes harmful in the first place.
