Isotretinoin is administered orally in the form of a capsule. The drug has low bioavailability and is highly lipophilic. The patient can maximize the oral absorption of isotretinoin by taking the drug with a meal. Isotretinoin should be taken with a full glass of water to avoid esophageal irritation.

Initial dosing of isotretinoin is commonly at 0.5 mg/kg per day and then gradually increased to a dose of 1.0 mg/kg per day according to patient tolerance. Typical therapy requires a 15- to 20-week course of daily isotretinoin administration to achieve complete prolonged remission of the disease.
