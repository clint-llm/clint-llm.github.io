Aspergillus is a ubiquitous saprophyte in nature found in air, soil and organic matter. Humans normally inhale the spore form of the fungi. However, the disease is usually seen in immunocompromised patients. The immune system plays an important role not only in recognizing inhaled mold and controlling growth but also in regulating the body's allergic and inflammatory response to the infection. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of aspergillus and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of aspergillus infection.
- Explain the work up of a patient with aspergillus.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for aspergillus.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with aspergillus.
