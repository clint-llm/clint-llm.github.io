Genital warts may occur separately or in clusters. They may be found in the anal or genital area, including the penile shaft, scrotum, vagina, or labia majora. They can also be found on internal surfaces of the vagina and the anus. They can be small (5 mm or less in diameter) or spread into large masses in the genital or anal area. Their color is variable but tends to be skin-colored or darker, and they may occasionally bleed spontaneously.

Sometimes warts may cause itching, redness, or discomfort. An outbreak of genital warts may also cause psychological distress. In most cases, the only identifiable symptoms of an HPV infection are warts.
