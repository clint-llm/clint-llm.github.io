The sternum is innervated by the intercostal nerves of the somatic nervous system, which arise from the anterior rami of spinal nerves of the thoracic spine. More specifically, the anterior branches of intercostal nerves of T2-T6 largely innervate much of the sternum.

In terms of musculature, the anterior chest wall consists of the external, internal, and innermost intercostal muscles, the transversus thoracis muscles, and the subcostales muscles. The transversus thoracis is a thin muscle that lies in the same plane as the innermost intercostal and subcostal muscles.

The TTMPB is intended to provide analgesic coverage to these same corresponding thoracic dermatomal levels. There is some variability in these attachments between individuals and even between the contralateral side of the same individual.Â The transversus thoracis functions to depress the ribs and aids in forced exhalation.
