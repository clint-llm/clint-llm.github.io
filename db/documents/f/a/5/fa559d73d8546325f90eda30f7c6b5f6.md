Overall, serous cystadenomas are considered benign with a small malignant potential (<3%). During long term follow-up in a clinical study of 18 patients with serous cystadenomas, the following morphologic changes were seen in three tumors (17%); microcystic serous cystadenoma changed to macrocystic serous cystadenoma and was associated with tumor enlargement in one patient, macrocystic serous cystadenoma changed to micro and macrocystic serous cystadenoma resulting in a mixed type with tumor enlargement in the second patient, and in the third patient, the macrocystic serous cystadenoma changed to a microcystic serous cystadenoma with associated tumor shrinkage from 30 to 25 mm. So of the total 18 patients, 9 cases (50%) had an enlargement of the tumor, and in the remaining 9 cases (50%), there was no change in size. The median growth rate was 0.29 cm per year.

The prognosis for patients with serous cystadenomas is excellent. Even in the rare cases of serous cystadenocarcinoma, there are reports of long-term survival after resection. Studies also conclude that any serous cystadenoma has the potential to grow with time regardless of the tumor subtype, size, or location, that's why all SCNs should be followed up regularly.
