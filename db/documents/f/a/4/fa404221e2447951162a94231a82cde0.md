SSRIs are prescribed by many healthcare workers including the primary care provider, psychiatrist, pain specialist, and the nurse practitioner. Unlike their predecessors, the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs are much safer in overdose.

Clear, closed-loop communication between pre-hospital, regional poison control center, emergency department, and intensive care staff is essential to make sure that patients prescribed SSRI receive the appropriateÂ level of care while safely allocating resources.
