As previously mentioned, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is caused by double (cis) mutations in the TEK gene (otherwise known as TIE2). The TEK gene encodes a protein called TEK receptor tyrosine kinase. TEK receptor tyrosine kinase is a transmembrane receptor involved in multiple steps of angiogenesis, including destabilization of existing vessels, endothelial cell migration, tube formation, and stabilization of newly formed tubes by mesenchymal cells. When the TEK receptor is activated, it triggers a release of chemical signals that facilitates cell-cell communication between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. This communication leads to new blood vessel formation and safeguards the structure and integrity of these blood vessels. The TEK receptor is constitutively active in blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome due to somatic activating mutations. This leads to unregulated angiogenesis.
