Complications are generally cyst wall rupture and hemorrhage into the cyst, both of which are rare. This may intensify pre-existing or produce new symptoms such as radiculopathy or even mimicking cauda equina syndrome.

In perhaps exceedingly rare circumstances, a sacral fracture following trauma may leak intra-medullary contents through a Tarlov cyst and produce acute cerebral fat embolism.

The appearance of a hemorrhage within a Tarlov cyst may re-present features of intradural carcinomatosis, which may lead to unnecessary investigations and management for the patient.
