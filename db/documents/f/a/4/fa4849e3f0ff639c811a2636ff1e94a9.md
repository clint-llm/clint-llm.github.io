Indications for testing to confirm pregnancy, either through urine or serum sample, include a female of child-bearing age with amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, abdominal pain, syncope, lightheadedness, dizziness, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea or vomiting, vaginal discharge, or urinary symptoms. Levels of hCG in a viable intrauterine pregnancy double approximately every 48 hours in early pregnancy. Levels peak around 10 to 12 weeks gestation, then decline to a steady state after 15 weeks.

Confirmation of a viable pregnancy occurs with an ultrasound, which shows a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound at five weeks or with an hCG level of 1,500 to 2,000 mIU/mL. Fetal heart motion is visible on transvaginal ultrasound at six weeks or with hCG levels starting at 5,000 to 6,000 mIU/mL.
