Pulmonary artery sling is a specific type of anatomical vascular anomaly that can compress nearby structures. Instead of arising from the main pulmonary artery, the left pulmonary artery arises from the right pulmonary artery and runs posteriorly between the esophagus and trachea. This compression can cause a variety of symptoms. Patients require a full work-up, including imaging and surgery planning. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, anatomy, and technique involved in performing surgical repair of a pulmonary artery sling and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre-operative and post-operative care of patients to help improve outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in a pulmonary artery sling.
- Describe the surgical technique involved in performing pulmonary artery sling repair.
- Review potential post-operative complications of pulmonary artery sling repair.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among an interprofessional healthcare team to ensure the appropriate selection of patients with pulmonary artery sling and to improve post-operative care and outcomes after repair.
