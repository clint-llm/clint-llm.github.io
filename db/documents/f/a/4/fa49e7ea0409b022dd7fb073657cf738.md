In recent times, advances in regional anesthesia, accelerated by the advent of the ultrasonogram (USG), have revolutionized perioperative pain management. A number of plane blocks and deep blocks that were non-existent previously have been made possible by the USG. But the utilization of regional blocks in pediatrics is much lower than in adult anesthesia due to the fear of adverse events fueled by misunderstandings and misconceptions.

AÂ large body of high-quality evidence is being published testifying towards the safety of regional practice in children. This has the potential to enhance, fasten recovery in children, and as a result, decrease health care costs. Regional anesthesia also holds significance in the current era of the opioid epidemic. This review will provide an overview of the principles and practices of pediatric regional anesthesia.
