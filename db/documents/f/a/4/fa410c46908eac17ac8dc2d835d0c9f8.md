Prior to 2000, beta-thalassemia major had a poor prognosis. The median survival was approximately 17 years in the US between 1965 to 1975. The median age was 12 years for the cohort born in Italy in the 1960s. But now, life expectancy has dramatically improved due to an interprofessional team approach among health care providers. Furthermore, the introduction of iron chelation therapy ICT (oral & injectable), awareness among patients and health care providers, management of complications, and utilization of standard techniques in the screening of blood products has contributed to improved outcomes. The life span of the affected patients in Palestine has increased from 7 to 8 years in 1996 to 19 to 20 years in 2015. Similarly, in the UK, the mortality rate significantly dropped to 4.7/1000 in the years 2000 to 2003 from 12.7/1000 in the years 1990 to 1999.
