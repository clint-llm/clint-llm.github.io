Infantile polycystic kidney disease treatment is mostly supportive, with dialysis and transplant, but overall patients tend to have a poor prognosis. Multicystic dysplastic kidney disease has a controversial treatment of nephrectomy of the affected side. If nephrectomy is not performed follow-up is recommended because there is a low risk of malignant transformation. The patients will have a normal life expectancy as long as the contralateral kidney has normal function. Adult polycystic kidney disease is the leading inherited cause of end-stage kidney disease and results in the requirement of dialysis and transplant in the vast majority of cases by middle age through the early 60s. Removal of the obstruction treats obstructive cystic renal dysplasia. Acquired lesions classified as Bosniak I and II require no further evaluation. A Bosniak IIF recommends follow-up with ultrasound or CT. A Bosniak III recommends surgical intervention with biopsy and partial nephrectomy or ablation. A Bosniak IV recommends partial or total nephrectomy.
