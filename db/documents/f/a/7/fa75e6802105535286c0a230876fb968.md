Hereditary fructose intolerance is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the absence of the enzyme aldolase B. Aldolase B is an essential enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. In the absence of this enzyme, a buildup of fructose-1-phosphate occurs, which is toxic to the liver. Phosphate is utilized in the synthesis of fructose-1-phosphate by the enzyme fructokinase. As fructose-1-phosphate accumulates, intracellular phosphate stores are depleted. The combined effect of this change inhibits phosphorylase A, leading to the cessation of glycogenolysis. Aldolase B deficiency also causes impaired gluconeogenesis since DHAP and G3P cannot be condensed to form fructose 1,6- bisphosphate. Hyperuricemia is a common finding and is due to the increased turnover and breakdown of adenosine. Other metabolic abnormalities commonly seen are hypermagnesemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperalaninemia.
