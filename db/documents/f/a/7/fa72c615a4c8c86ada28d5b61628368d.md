Right bundle branch block (RBB) is an electrocardiogram finding resulting in a widened QRS and electrocardiographic vector changes. Although usually benign, this finding can represent underlying myocardial disease and is a predictor of mortality in certain patient populations. This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology and EKG changes seen in right bundle branch block.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of a right bundle branch block. 
- Summarize the characteristic electrocardiogram findings for right bundle branch block.
- Describe physical examination findings potentially associated with right bundle branch blocks.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance detection and proper management of right bundle branch blocks.
