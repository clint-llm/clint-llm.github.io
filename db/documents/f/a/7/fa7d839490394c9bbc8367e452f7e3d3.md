During embryonic development, the prosencephalon (forebrain) gives rise to the telencephalon and diencephalon at around week 6. The telencephalon differentiates into the two cerebral hemispheres, which include the cingulate gyrus on their medial surface.

During early life and adolescent development, the functional connectivity of the cingulate cortex undergoes significant adaptive change. Interestingly, it appears that different functions ascribed to this anatomical area mature at different rates, with motor control and simple cognitive controls (e.g., inhibition and attention) maturing in early childhood, in contrast to more complex emotional behaviors such as social cognition, which may mature as late as adolescence.
