In 2009, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that women begin having pap smears at the age of 21. ACOG also recommends women ages 21 to 29 should have Pap smear testing every three years. The organization noted that women ages 30 to 65 should have pap smears with HPV testing every 5 years, and screening should stop after age 65. There are special populations of women who should be screened more frequently for cervical cancer than the general population. They include women infected with HIV, immunocompromised women (such as organ transplant patients), women exposed to diethylstilbestrol while in utero, and women previously treated for CIN 2, CIN 3, or cervical cancer.

In 2018 the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) revised its recommendations. The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing combined with cytology (co-testing) in women aged 30 to 65 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women younger than 21 years. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not otherwise at high risk of cervical cancer. (D recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.
