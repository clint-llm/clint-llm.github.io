An unsuccessful pit and fissure sealant placement may be due to:

- Contamination may resultÂ from either saliva or calcium phosphate products

- Inadequate surface preparation

- Incomplete or slow photopolymerization

- Air entrapment

- Overextension of the material beyond conditioned tooth surface

**Toxicity**

According to a few studies, the release of significant sealant components, like bisphenol A (BPA), impairs the development, health, and reproductive system in animals. However, the American Association of Pediatric Dentistry Guidelines, the US Drug and Food Administration (FDA), and the American Dental Association (ADA) have concluded that the low-level of BPA exposure from dental sealants poses no known health risks.
