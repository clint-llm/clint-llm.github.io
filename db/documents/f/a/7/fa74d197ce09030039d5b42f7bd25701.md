Evaluation of TE/TB begins with obtaining patient history and completing a thorough physical exam. Histopathologic examination via skin biopsy is critical due to their clinical similarities to BCC and other adnexal tumors. Due to overlapping histopathologic features, IHC evaluation may be needed. Dermoscopy is unlikely to be of further help, as these lesions demonstrate dermoscopic findings such as arborizing vessels and gray ovoid nests and globules.

A genetic workup may be necessary for patients with multiple or recurrent lesions, including an evaluation of chromosome 9q21 (for MFT) or the CYLD gene (for Brooke Spiegler syndrome).
