Topical injuries will likely heal with no permanent damage. However, if there are severe chemical burns, the patient should be treated as any other burn patient. They will also be at risk for any of the complications seen in other burn patients, such as scarring, dehydration due to fluid losses, and infections. Ophthalmic injuries may cause severe burns and lead to temporary or permanent vision loss.

Ingestion can lead to scarring of the esophagus or throat, which may lead to strictures and other similar complications.
