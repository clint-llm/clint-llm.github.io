In addition to the pathophysiology, a few ideas to keep in mind when you have a patient withÂ clotting mechanism disorders:

Patients with:

- Primary hemostasis defects typically present with small bleeds in the skin or mucosal membranes. This includes petechiae and/or purpura.

- Secondary hemostasis defects typically present with bleeds into soft tissue (muscle) or joints (hemarthrosis).

- Direct defects in small blood vessels typically present with palpable purpura and ecchymosis. These may collect and become larger to develop a hematoma.

Also, laboratory testing involving PTT or PT/INR can be divided by the physiological mechanisms:

- Disorders exclusively effecting primary hemostasis do not affect the PT/INR or PTT, they only increase bleeding time

- Disorders that affect the extrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis affect the PT/INR

- Disorders that affect the intrinsic pathway of secondary hemostasis affect the PTT
