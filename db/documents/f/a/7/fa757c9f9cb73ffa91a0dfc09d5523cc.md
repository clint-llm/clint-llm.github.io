Although tetanus affects people of all ages; however, the highest prevalence is seen in newborns and young persons.

The incidence of neonatal tetanus is decreasing due to routine vaccination worldwide, which is combined with other vaccines, pertussis, and diphtheria (DPT). The occurrence of tetanus among neonates is mostly due to incomplete vaccination of the infant. In 2013, approximately 84% of children less than 12 months of age had coverage of tetanus worldwide.

In high-resource countries, such as the United States, cases of tetanus occur in the unimmunized or in the elderly who have decreased immunity over time. Intravenous drug users are also at risk owing to contaminated needles or drugs.

Tetanus is a disease of the underdeveloped world. It is more commonly found in areas where the soil is cultivated, in warm climates, and among males. It is also more frequently seen in neonates and children in countries where there is no immunization program in place.
