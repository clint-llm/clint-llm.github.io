The subclavian veins are valveless, and the anatomical path of the right and left subclavian veins are not symmetrical. The right subclavian vein forms an angled arc as it merges with the right internal jugular vein, to form the right brachiocephalic vein to enter the superior vena cava. The left subclavian vein is located posterior to the clavicle after crossing the first rib; this region is the only area where the subclavian vein directly is in communication with the clavicle. The subclavian veins both end by joining the internal jugular veins to form the brachiocephalic veins. The angle at which both meets is termed the venous angle. The right subclavian vein is joined by the right lymphatic duct at the right venous angle, which drains lymph from the right upper quadrant of the body (right side of the head, neck, thorax, right upper extremity). The left subclavian vein is joined by the lymphatic duct at the left venous angle, which drains the rest of the body's lymph fluid. The subclavian veins carry deoxygenated venous blood from the axillary vein to the brachiocephalic vein to ultimately return to the right atrium.
