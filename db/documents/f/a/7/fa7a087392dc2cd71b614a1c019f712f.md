The face is one of the most variable structures in humans. The face represents the identity of each person. Unfortunately, some individuals are born with congenital defects that alter the appearance of their face. And others suffer injuries or diseases that affect the way their face appears. And others alter the appearance of their faces with cosmetics products and procedures. The human face can also change over time as a person ages. The environment and lifestyle of an individual can manifest in changes in the face. For instance, a person exposed to UV light will have darkening of the skin, while an individual that consumes an excessive amount of calories may gain fat content in their face. For this reason, the human face is extremely variable, but the standard features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth are consistently present in most individuals.
