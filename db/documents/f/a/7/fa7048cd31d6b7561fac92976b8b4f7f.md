It is unclear why some patients with pleural inflammation heal without any sequela while others develop a restrictive fibrous visceral peel leading to the trapped lung. The exact incidence of trapped lung is poorly documented, but it is expected to be higher than is generally recognized. A study by Dresler et al suggests that among patients who undergo thoracentesis, approximately 10% have non-expandable lung, 20% of patients who undergo therapeutic thoracentesis and 30% of those who undergo therapeutic thoracentesis for malignant pleural effusion have non-expandable lung.
