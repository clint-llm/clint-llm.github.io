In addition to history and physical examination, evaluation of sialadenitis requires lab investigations, radiography, biopsy, if indicated, and other tests to rule out autoimmune etiology.

- Culture and sensitivity of exudate from duct: It should be conducted before the initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy. After the results come, antibiotic is tailored according to sensitivity.

- Complete blood count: to rule out infections

- Imaging studies
- Xray: It can be useful to detect sialolith in chronic sialadenitis. Around 70 to 80% of submandibular stones are radioopaque.
- Ultrasonography: Can demonstrate sialolith (>1 mm) and abscess cavity if present.
- CT scan: This is indicated if conventional plain films are negative or when the clinical presentation is severe. It can demonstrate sialolith. In chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, the salivary gland may be enlarged or atrophic.
- DSA sialography: Acute inflammation is a relative contraindication. It can detect sialolith, ductal stricture, loss of parenchymal integrity if present in chronic sialadenitis.
- MRI: if neoplasia is suspected

-  SSA/anti-Ro, SSB/anti-La, ANA, RF: if sialadenitis secondary to connective tissue disorders are suspected

- FNA cytology of affected gland: Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis can present similarly to a tumor; FNA is useful to exclude the presence of a neoplasm.
