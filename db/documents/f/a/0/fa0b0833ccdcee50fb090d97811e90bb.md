Indications for a polysomnogram (PSG) in adults include the following:

- Diagnosis of sleep-related breathing disorders

- Patients with neuromuscular disorders and sleep complaints

- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) titration

- Evaluation of response to positive airway pressure (PAP), oral appliance, or positional therapy

- Evaluation before upper airway surgery for snoring or OSA

- Evaluating response after surgery for OSA

- Follow-up PSG if the response to treatment for OSA is not adequate or symptoms are not adequately controlled despite compliance with appropriate therapy

- 10% change in weight in patients treated with CPAP to verify the continued need for CPAP in those who have lost weight and optimize therapy settings in those who have gained weight

- Patients with congestive heart failure and symptoms of SRBD or persistent symptoms after optimal medical management of congestive heart failure

- Diagnosis of narcolepsy (in this case, PSG is followed by multiple sleep latency test the next day)

- Diagnosis of nocturnal epilepsy

- Diagnosis of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)

- Diagnosis of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) in which the patient has significant daytime fatigue or bed partner complaints

- Insomnia only if there is a suspected comorbid sleep disorder as above or after a failure of adequate treatment.

PSG is not indicated for the following:

- Patients adequately treated with CPAP

- Parasomnias (excluding when nocturnal seizures and RBD are considerations in the differential)

- Seizure disorders that are prominent during the day

- Restless legs syndrome

- Insomnia when there is a low concern of secondary cause for insomnia such as OSA or periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) significant enough to cause PLMD

- Circadian rhythm disorders

- Other common events of sleep such as bruxism, nightmares, and sleep talking
