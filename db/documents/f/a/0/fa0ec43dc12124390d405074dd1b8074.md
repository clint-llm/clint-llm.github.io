Tourette syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a psychiatry nurse, pediatrician, primary care provider, psychiatrist, school teacher, and a social worker. The diagnosis is clinical and children with Tourette syndrome do not routinely need brain MRI. Only consider getting this test if the child has an abnormal neurologic exam or there are red flags in the history that may point toward a different diagnosis.

The provider should take a holistic approach to the treatment of children with GTS, considering comorbid neurobehavioral conditions. Families should be provided with extensive education, reassurance, and support.

Studies show that the school teacher can have a significant impact on the psychosocial experience of a child with Tourette syndrome, positive or negative. Taking time to educate the teacher about the condition and encouraging the education of the students in the child's classroom can significantly change a child’s life.
