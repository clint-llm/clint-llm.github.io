Opioids have an extensive diversity of durations and intensities of effect. For example, alfentanil has a half-life of around 1.5 hours, whereas methadone has a half-life of between 8 to 60 hours. Opioid uptake and effect can also vary by administration route. For example, fentanyl can be delivered by patch, and there are long-acting oral formulations of oxycodone and morphine. Some, such as diphenoxylate and loperamide, have almost no effect other than suppression of bowel motility. Opioids such as methadone can significantly prolong the QT interval. Some opioids have serotonergic activity and can precipitate serotonin syndrome, especially when given to patients already taking various psychoactive medications (notably antidepressant medications like SSRIs). There is an evolving body of knowledge that the intensity and quality of response to opioids can vary significantly between patients, which can be unrelated to tolerance. This is likely related to genetics but is not well characterized at this time.
