The female external genitalia varies greatly. The shape, size, andÂ color of the mons pubis, clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and the vagina orifice are different from female to female. The reason for the variations is due to the amount of estrogen influence during development. If there is more estrogen, these structures tend to be larger and thicker. While the lack of estrogen can lead to the external genitalia being thinner and smaller. For instance, the mons pubis is heavy influenced by estrogen. The mons pubis is larger in females with more estrogen as compared to a less prominent mons pubis in females with less estrogen. As for the structure with the most variations in the female external genitalia, is the labia majora and the labia minora. The labia majora and labia minora tend to be the structures that vary greatly in size, color, and length when comparing females. Some females have more prominent labial folds visually. In some females, the clitoris and the clitoris hood may be larger and more prominent visually. While many of these structures can vary greatly. In general, the functionality of these structures is unchanged.

These variations in the female external genitalia can be due to aging and the lack of estrogen also. During menopause, women start to have a decrease in the production of estrogen. This decrease in estrogen causes the female external genitalia to atrophy.
