TXA is a synthetic reversible competitive inhibitor to the lysine receptor found on plasminogen. The binding of this receptor prevents plasmin (activated form of plasminogen) from binding to and ultimately stabilizingÂ the fibrin matrix.

TXA used for hereditary angioedema works by its indirect effect of reducing complement activation. By reducing plasmin activity, it reduces the consumption of C1 esterase inhibitors.
