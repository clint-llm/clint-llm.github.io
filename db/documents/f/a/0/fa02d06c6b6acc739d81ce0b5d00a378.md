Persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn can occur due to several reasons. Lung parenchymal conditions such as meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and sepsis contribute to persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.

Other etiological factors include oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, infants of diabetic mothers, in utero closure of ductus arteriosus, small and large for gestational age status.

Maternal risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, pre-eclampsia, chorioamnionitis, smoking, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), and NSAID use during pregnancy can also contribute to persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn.

Congenital anomalies such as transposition of great arteries (TGA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) are also associated with persistent fetal circulation in the immediate neonatal period.
