Different specialists use different types of surgical incisions to get access to the organs. However, prior to making an incision, a time out should be called by the operating room nurses to confirm first the type of surgery and secondly the site of the incision. The key is to avoid wrong-site surgery. For abdominal surgery, the midline incision is versatile and allows access to most organs; for chest surgery, the median sternotomy and thoracotomy afford access to most thoracic organs. When performing laparoscopic or thoracoscopic surgery, patients should be informed that there is a small risk of conversion to an open procedure.
