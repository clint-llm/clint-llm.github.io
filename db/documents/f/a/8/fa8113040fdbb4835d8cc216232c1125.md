Meningococcemia is a serious life-threatening infection that is best managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes ICU nurses. The treatment should be started even if there is low suspicion of the infection; even a delay of a few hours can prove to be fatal. The pharmacist should educate patients on the benefit of the meningococcal vaccine, especially in the elderly- as it can be life-saving.

The outlook for patients with meningococcemia is guarded; most patients, unfortunately, die despite adequate treatment.
