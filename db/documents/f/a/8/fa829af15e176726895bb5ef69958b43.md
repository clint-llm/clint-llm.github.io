Methocarbamol is a medication used in the management and treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. It is in the skeletal muscle relaxant class of medications. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, and contraindications for methocarbamol as an option in the multimodal treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. This activity will also underscore critical factors to consider when prescribing methocarbamol: adverse event profile, evidence of efficacy, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic considerations, and recommendations for monitoring in managing patients with musculoskeletal pain and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for the use of methocarbamol in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain.
- Identify populations at risk for adverse effects of methocarbamol.
- Summarize different approaches for the use of anti-spastic and anti-spasmodic classes of skeletal muscle relaxants.
- Describe common adverse effects of skeletal muscle relaxants, and review methods of educating patients on how to avoid harm.
