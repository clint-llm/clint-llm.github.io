Pulmonary hypoplasia is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by incomplete development of the lung tissue. There are impaired gaseous exchange and respiratory insufficiency due to a decrease in the number of airways and alveoli.

Primary forms of idiopathic lung hypoplasia are rare, with the vast majority of cases occurring due to other developmental fetal abnormalities. In 1912, Schneider classified abnormal development of lung into three types, modified by Boyden in 1955 as:

- Type 1 (Agenesis): The complete absence of pulmonary parenchyma, bronchus, and vessels.

- Type 2 (Aplasia): The complete absence of pulmonary parenchyma but the presence of a rudimentary bronchus on the affected side.

- Type 3 (Hypoplasia): The presence of variable amounts of pulmonary parenchyma with a decrease in the number of lung cells, airways, and alveoli.

The extent of hypoplastic pulmonary tissue depends on the timing of the insult during the stages of fetal lung maturation. The maturation arrest happens during the pseudo glandular stage between 5 to 17 weeks of gestation. During this stage, lung development depends on mechanical stimuli. An imbalance of the pressure between the extraluminal space and intraluminal airway results in compression of the lung(s) tissue and resultant hypoplastic lung tissue. The clinical course ranges from fatal respiratory insufficiency in neonates (severe form) to chronic lung disease with recurrent respiratory infections (mild form) in adulthood.
