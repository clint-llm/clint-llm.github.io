Estimates are that 4 to 6% of the population has a degree of lumbosacral spondylolisthesis. The majority of cases are asymptomatic.

Most of the symptomatic high-grade slips occur in the pediatric/adolescent population participating in sports involving repetitive hyperextension, while adults tend to present with milder and more chronic onset of symptoms.

The most commonly affected adolescent groups are female dancers or gymnasts with hyperlordosis and hyper flexibility, male football players, or weight lifters with limited motion at lumbar spine undergoing a growth spurt, or novice athletes vigorously training while having poor core strength.

There are reports of familial association and congenital abnormalities, including spina bifida occulta, thoracic hyperkyphosis (Shauerman disease) as predisposing factors as well as general ligamentous laxity.

Several anatomical factors described below predispose to spondylolisthesis.
