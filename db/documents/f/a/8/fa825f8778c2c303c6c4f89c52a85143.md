The primary indication for tubal ligation is the desire for permanent sterilization. Those who have completed childbearing and desire a non-reversible contraceptive option are candidates for tubal ligation. Removal of the Fallopian tubes, or salpingectomy, has been advocated as a method for the prevention of ovarian cancer. The surgeon can perform salpingectomy opportunistically as a method of tubal ligation at the time of hysterectomy.
