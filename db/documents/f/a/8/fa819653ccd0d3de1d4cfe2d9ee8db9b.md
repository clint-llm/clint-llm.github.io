While renal lymphoma has autopsy incidence of 30% to 60% in lymphoma patients, actual CT diagnosis incidence is approximately 5%. The kidneys are the most common abdominal organ affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Â Involvement of the kidneys in primary renal lymphoma is rare (less than 1%). It is mostly seen in middle to advanced age. It forms about 0.7% of the extranodal lymphomas in North America. The bilateral presentation is seen in 10% to 20% of the cases.
