Located within the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), the pterygopalatine ganglion comprises the largest parasympathetic ganglion and is one of four ganglia located within the head region. The pterygopalatine ganglion includes an assortment of parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatosensory nerve fibers.

The pterygopalatine ganglion houses post-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons that receive synaptic transmissions from pre-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers that arise from the superior salivatory nucleus, located within the pons of the brainstem.

The source of the sympathetic neurons associated with the pterygopalatine ganglion originates from pre-ganglionic sympathetic neurons located in the intermediolateral cell column at the level of the first thoracic vertebra.

Somatic sensory fibers, primarily from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, are another set of axons that run through the pterygopalatine ganglion without synapsing at the pterygopalatine ganglion itself. Following the maxillary nerve distal to its branches from the trigeminal nerve, it enters the posterior region of the pterygopalatine fossa via the foramen rotundum. Within the pterygopalatine fossa, the maxillary nerve gives off somatic sensory branches that pass through the pterygopalatine ganglion to predominantly form the greater and lesser palatine nerves.
