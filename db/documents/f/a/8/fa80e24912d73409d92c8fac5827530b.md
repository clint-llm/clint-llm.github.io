CT scan is required in patients with head trauma

- Moderate (GCS score 9 to 12)

- Severe (GCS score < 8)

For patients who are at low risk for intracranial injuries, there are two externally validated rules for when to obtain a head CT scan after TBI.

It is important to understand that no individual history and physical examination finding can eliminate the possibility of intracranial injury in head trauma patients.

**New Orleans Criteria**

- Headache

- Vomiting (any)

- Age > 60 years

- Drug or alcohol intoxication

- Seizure

- Trauma visible above clavicles

- Short-term memory deficits

**Canadian CT Head Rule**

- Dangerous mechanism of injury

- Vomiting = two times

- Age > 65 years

- GCS score < 15, 2-hours post-injury

- Any sign of basal skull fracture

- Possible open or depressed skull fracture

- Amnesia for events 30 minutes before injury

**Level A Recommendation**

With the loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia only if one or more of the following symptoms are present:

- Headache

- Vomiting

- Age > 60 years

- Drug or alcohol intoxication

- Deficits in short-term memory

- Physical findings suggestive of trauma above the clavicle

- Posttraumatic seizure

- GCS score < 15

- Focal neurologic deficit

- Coagulopathy

**Level B Recommendation**

Without loss of consciousness or posttraumatic amnesia if one of the following specific symptoms presents:

- Focal neurologic deficit

- Vomiting

- Severe headache

- Age > 65 years

- Physical signs of a basilar skull fracture

- GCS score < 15

- Coagulopathy

- Dangerous mechanism of injury

- Ejection from a motor vehicle (such as Pedestrian struck or a fall from a height > three feet or five stairs)

The risk of intracranial injury when clinical decision rule results are negative is less than 1%.

For children, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) decision rules exist to rule out the presence of clinically important traumatic brain injuries. However, this rule applies only to children with GCS > 14.
