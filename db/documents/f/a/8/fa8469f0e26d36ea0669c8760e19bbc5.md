As noted, patients with near syncope are as likely as those with syncope to experience critical interventions or adverse outcomes; however, presyncope patients are less likely to be admitted

Most near syncope diagnoses are presumptive, cannot be confirmed by standard criteria and may not be able to exclude cardiac conduction causes that have potentially life-threatening consequences. The need for prompt risk stratification and concern for cardiac etiology may be a factor influencing emergency department physicians to pursue extensive evaluations for many patients who present to the emergency department with presyncope.

The Boston Syncope Criteria has accurately screened patients with presyncope for risk of adverse outcomes at 30 days

Finally, a patient’s social situation, coping capacity and ability to return home safely must be considered for any patient who presents to the emergency department with presyncope. If a patient is discharged from the emergency department, regardless of etiology, they should have close follow-up with their primary care physician or cardiologist, ideally scheduled before discharge.
