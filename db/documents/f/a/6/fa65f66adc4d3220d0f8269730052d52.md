Essential evaluation when suspecting nocardiosis should include bacterial cultures of the infectious sites, skin biopsy, purulent discharge, sputum, deep abscess or pleural aspirates, and others. Nocardia is notoriously slow-growing, so suspicion should be shared with the laboratory to allow for ample growth time of up to 3 to 5 days. Additionally, blood cultures should be collected whenever a disseminated or pulmonary infection is suspected.

Imaging studies should include plain film chest radiography and CT chest for pulmonary infection. While there are no classical findings on radiography, they may show irregular nodules, cavitation, diffuse alveolar pulmonary infiltrates, lung abscess, or pleural effusion.Â  Additional imaging should include CT or MRI of the brain to evaluate for disseminated Nocardia to the CNS. If meningeal signs are present, lumbar puncture with an evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be performed.
