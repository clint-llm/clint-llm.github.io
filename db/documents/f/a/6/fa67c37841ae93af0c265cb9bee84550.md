Epistaxis (nosebleed) is one of the most common ear, nose, and throat (ENT) emergencies that present to the emergency department or the primary care clinic. There are two types of nosebleeds: anterior (more common), and posterior (less common, but more likely to require medical attention). The source of 90% of anterior nosebleeds is within Kiesselbach's plexus (also known as Littleâ€™s area) on the anterior nasal septum. There are five named vessels whose terminal branches supply the nasal cavity:

1) Anterior ethmoidal artery

2) Posterior ethmoidal artery

3) Sphenopalatine artery

4) Greater palatine artery

5) Superior labial artery

The watershed area of these five vessels is in the anterior nasal septum, comprising Kiesselbach's plexus. This lies at the entrance to the nasal cavity and so is subject to extremes of heat and cold, and of high and low moisture, and is easily traumatized. The mucosa over the septum in this area is especially thin, making this the site of the majority of epistaxis. More rarely, vessels in the posterior or superior nasal cavity will bleed, leading to the so-called "posterior" epistaxis. This is more common in patients on anticoagulants, patients who are hypertensive, and patients with underlying blood dyscrasia or vascular abnormalities. Management will depend on the severity of the bleeding and the patient's concomitant medical problems.
