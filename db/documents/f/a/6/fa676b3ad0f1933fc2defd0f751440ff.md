The functional and cognitive decline associated with frontotemporal dementia spawn predictable somatic, psychological, and social complications for patients and their caregivers. Dysphagia is likely responsible for the increased incidence of pneumonia and respiratory failure, a significant cause of mortality in frontotemporal dementia.

Cardiac disease, attributed to patient's sedentary and bedridden immobility status, is implicated in the most significant number of frontotemporal dementia deaths.
