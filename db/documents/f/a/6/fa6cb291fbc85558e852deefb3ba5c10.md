Fluorescein is a diagnostic contrast agent particularly used in various ophthalmic procedures, such as checking for any corneal or vessel abnormalities. The application of fluorescein also extends to bioimaging whole anatomic structures and even further to cellular components in immunohistological staining. This article outlines the indications, mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and contraindications for fluorescein to guide the healthcare team in evaluating ophthalmic abnormalities, infection, and pathophysiology, among other conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of fluorescein.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of fluorescein.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving fluorescein.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance fluorescein and improve outcomes.
