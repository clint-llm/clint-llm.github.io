Brain histology of individuals with viral encephalitis shows dead neurons with nuclear dissolution and hypereosinophilia within the cytoplasm on light microscopy. Because encephalitis is an inflammatory process, perivascular inflammatory cells such as microglia, macrophages, and lymphocytes are also seen. Virions within neurons can be visualized with electron microscopy, which allows for much greater magnification than light microscopy.
