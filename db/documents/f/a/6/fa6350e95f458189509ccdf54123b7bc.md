Traumatic hematomas are generally managed conservatively, especially in patients who are not currently receiving treatment with anticoagulants. In these patients, bleeding will usually stop spontaneously.  In contrast, spontaneous muscular hematomas are often the site of active bleeding. A CT-angiogram may be warranted to evaluate better the hematoma and the source and from which vascular structure it originates.

If possible, discontinuation of anticoagulants is the first step in management and may be sufficient to allow for hemostasis to occur and resolution of the muscular hematoma. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma is necessary when there is compression of neurological structures or if the hematoma is causing local ischemia. Of note, the recurrence of these hematomas is common, and careful monitoring is important to identify relapse.

Arterial embolization is sometimes proposed as a treatment option for the management of spontaneous muscular hemorrhages and has the advantage of being less invasive than surgical evacuation while maintaining a clinical success rate of 57 to 69%.
