**Key Fundamental Points:**

- Glycogen has implications in glucose homeostasis.

- Glycogen is highly concentrated in the liver, although skeletal muscle contains the most glycogen by weight. Glycogen does not exist in plant tissue.

- Skeletal muscle is unable to release glycogen into the bloodstream due to a lack of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)

- Glycogen is composed of two major bonds, which are alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds - these bonds give rise to linear chains and branching points, respectively.

- Glycogen branching is essential because it allows for increased water solubility and several sites to break it down; this allows for easy and quick glycogen utilization when it is broken down.

- Glycogen synthesis and breakdown correlate with high and low energy states, respectively.

- Insulin and glucagon are peptide hormones that orchestrate glycogen metabolic regulation as they signal high and low energy states, respectively.
