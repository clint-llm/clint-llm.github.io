Patients should be discouraged from returning too early to contact sports before they have undergone sufficient physiotherapy to aid the strengthening of surrounding muscles and the core. Slip-on knee braces may be of benefit in the early rehabilitative phase. The importance of adherence to a physiotherapy plan after initial dislocation should be a point of emphasis, because good compliance may minimize the risk of further dislocation and the need for operative intervention.
