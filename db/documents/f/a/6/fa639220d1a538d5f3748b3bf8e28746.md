Failure to timely identify and treat diphtheria leads to the dissemination of diphtheria toxin (DT) into circulation, which eventually gains access to the heart, CNS, kidneys, and other organs, leading to various complications. The cardiac complications can present as myocarditis, constrictive pericarditis, endocarditis, conduction defect leading to complete heart block, and in severe cases as heart failure.

Neurological complications occur due to demyelination of the nerve and the resulting neuropathy, which can range from mild weakness to complete paralysis. Some Guillain Barre syndrome-like presentation has also been reported in the past.
