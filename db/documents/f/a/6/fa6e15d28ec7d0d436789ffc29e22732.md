Hurthle cell tumors can be benign in the form of Hurthle cell adenomas. Malignant Hurthle cell carcinomas are characterized by capsular invasion, vascular invasion, infiltration of the thyroid gland and/or distant lymph nodes, and metastatic spread.

Germline polymorphisms of the ATPase 6 gene, which helps maintain mitochondrial DNA integrity, are believed to have a role in the pathogenesis of Hurthle cell tumors. Hurthle cell tumors characteristically have been found to have an increased prevalence of mitochondrial DNA common deletions.
