Complications of NSTEMI are secondary to the systemic effects of the disease rather than structural complications of STEMI. Cardiomyopathy with diffuse hypokinesis may be seen but left ventricular aneurysms or papillary muscle dysfunction is rare. Pulmonary edema due to poor cardiac output may be seen in severe cases. Other complications of poor cardiac output such as renal dysfunction may be seen as well.
