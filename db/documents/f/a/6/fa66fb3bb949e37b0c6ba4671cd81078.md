The clinician conducts iontophoresis of pilocarpine on the patient's skin.Â In the original Gibson-Cooke method, two electrodes, one covered in gauze soaked with pilocarpine and the other with deionized water, are placed on the patient's arm or leg. A small, painless, electrical current is then applied for 5 minutes; referred to as iontophoresis. Afterward, a collecting source, such as gauze, filter paper, or a Macroduct coil is used to collect the sweat. The allotted time for sweat collection should not exceed 30 minutes. Using the Gibson-Cooke method for QPIT, a minimum of 75mg of sweat is required adequate testing. However, most centers in the US utilize collection via macroduct coil, which requires only 15 microliters of sweat for analysis. Sweat should not be collected from multiple sites for the same test as the rate of sweating determines the chloride content. The collected source then goes to the lab for quantification of chloride.
