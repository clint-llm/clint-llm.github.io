In clinical practice, plasma or urine amino acids undergo testing to evaluate patients with possible inborn metabolism problems. They can also assess many diseases, such as liver diseases, endocrine disorders, muscular diseases, neurological disorders, neoplastic diseases, renal failure, burns, and nutritional disturbances. Both high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) have been used to quantitatively identify the plasma or urine amino acids in clinical settings.
