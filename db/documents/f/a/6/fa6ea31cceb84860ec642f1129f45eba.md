Treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma is based on clinical staging of the disease. The modified Ann Arbor staging system is the most common. The staging system for Hodgkin lymphoma is based on the location of lymphadenopathy, the number and size of the lymph node, and whether the extranodal lymph node involvement is shown systemic. Commonly used staging system divides the disease into four stages:

- Stage I: Involvement of single lymph node regions or lymphoid structure

- Stage II: Involvement of 2 or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm; the number of anatomic sites should be indicated in a suffix (e.g., II2)

- Stage III: Involvement of lymph nodes or structures on both sides of the diaphragm

- III1: With or without splenic, hilar, celiac or portal nodes

- III2: With paraaortic, iliac or mesenteric nodes

- Stage IV: Involvement of extranodal sites beyond those designated as E (E: single extranodal site, or contiguous or proximal to the known nodal site of disease)
