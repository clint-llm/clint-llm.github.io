Olmesartan is an antihypertensive agent that is administered orally as olmesartan-medoxomil.

**Specific Patient Populations**

**Renal Dysfunction**

- CrCl greater than equal to 40 mL/min: Dose adjustment is unnecessary

- CrCl 20 mL/min to less than 40 mL/min: Adjustment not needed upon initiation; consider lowering dose-dependent on patient response

- CrCl less than 20 mL/min: Consider lowering the dose due to impaired excretion (less than 20mg/day)

**Hepatic Impairment**

- Mild impairment: No dosing adjustment is needed

- Moderate to severe: There is no need for initial dose modification; it may depend on patient response.

**Pregnancy Considerations**

- Olmesartan contraindications include pregnancy due to teratogenicity. Olmesartan is especially teratogenic during second and third trimesters as it can cause anuria and oligohydramnios, leading to limb defects, pulmonary hypoplasia, and craniofacial abnormalities.

- Under its prior pregnancy classification system, the FDA classified olmesartan as a pregnancy class C medication during the first semester and as Class D medication during the second and third trimester, respectively.

**Breastfeeding Considerations**

- As no information is available on the use of olmesartan during breastfeeding, an alternate drug should be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.
