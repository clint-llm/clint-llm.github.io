Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage is a potential adverse event of mechanical thrombectomy resulting from instrument manipulation. Despite this complication, the risk of symptomatic intracerebral bleeding is not significantly different from the medical standard of care.

- Dislodging of embolic material distal to the occlusion.

- Stenosis at the thrombectomy site can also occur as complications from thrombectomy.

- Vessel perforation and dissection can occur.

- Groin and retroperitoneal hematomas can occur at the puncture site.

- Reocclusion secondary to a high platelet count on admission, pre-existing stenosis, or embolic material around the thrombectomy site.

Although these acute complications are not common, they indicate a poor prognosis.
