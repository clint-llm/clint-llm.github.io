With the rise in patients taking naturalistic approaches to healthcare, it is crucial to be aware of kratom and the risks associated with its ingestion.Mitragyna speciosa) is a plant indigenous to southeastern Asia, typically consumed as tea or powder, with physiologic effects similar to opioids and stimulants. The use of kratom in southeastern Asia has been common for the past few centuries, but it is gaining popularity in the West.

Traditional use of kratom consisted ofÂ remedies for treating symptoms of opiate addiction and withdrawal. Also, it is popular among laborers in rural southeastern Asia for pain relief and fighting off fatigue.

The primary motivation for kratom use varies, but some patients with opioid dependence resort to other methods of self-medication, with kratom being an inexpensive alternative. The Drug Enforcement Administration does not recognize kratom as a controlled substance. Thus, it is not subject to the United States Controlled Substances Act, so there is little regulatory oversight regarding the substance's purity, potency, and safety.
