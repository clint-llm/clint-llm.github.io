**Acute Toxicity**

Toxicity from nickel can occur through various routes of exposure, including inhalation, ingestion, injection, and dermal absorption.

In the occupational setting, nickel carbonyl, a colorless liquid formed in the Mond process, poses a significant risk. Absorption of nickel carbonyl through the skin or inhalation can be lethal. It is characterized by a distinct odor described as musty and sooty. The toxic effects of nickel carbonyl are believed to occur through oxidative stress pathways.

The symptoms can occur immediately after exposure or be delayed. Inhalation can cause respiratory, neurologic, and hepatic dysfunction. Pulmonary findings include pneumonitis and acute lung injury. Other findings include cerebral edema, myocarditis, altered mental status, and seizures.

The ingestion of nickel salts will acutely manifest toxicity. Gastrointestinal symptoms are prominent, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This is believed to be caused by lipid peroxidation leading to cell membrane disruption with calcium influx and cell death.

Parenteral toxicity can occur from hemodialysis if the stored water is kept in a nickel container. Their symptoms are similar to those of nickel carbonyl toxicity.

Dermal absorption can lead to type IV skin sensitivity causing pruritis and erythematous papules.

**Chronic Toxicity**

Exposure can occur in the form of nickel dust or aerosols. Inhalation can result in changes in the nasopharynx and the epithelium of the respiratory tract. Chronic changes can include rhinitis, polyps, rhinitis, asthma, or pulmonary fibrosis. Of note, an increased incidence of nasal and pulmonary cancer has been observed.

Occupational exposure to nickel has been associated with an increased risk of sino-nasal cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Additionally, increased handling of nickel has been linked to the development of dermatitis. These findings highlight the importance of proper safety measures and protective equipment in occupational settings where nickel exposure is expected.
