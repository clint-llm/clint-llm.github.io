Patients with hypoxic brain injury benefit from coordinated care from an interprofessional team. In addition to physicians experienced in dealing with brain injury, patients require skilled nursing staff who are trained to recognize neurological complications such as seizures, herniation syndromes, etc. Furthermore, nursing care is instrumental in preventing complications of immobility, including aspiration, skin breakdown, and deep venous thrombosis. Clinical pharmacists can be helpful, especially for patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, because of the impact that low body temperature can have on glucose management, drug absorption, and pharmacokinetics. Consultation with rehabilitation specialists, including physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists, is important for stable patients to maximize the potential for recovery. Finally, case management and social work personnel play an important role in discharge planning and care transitions.
