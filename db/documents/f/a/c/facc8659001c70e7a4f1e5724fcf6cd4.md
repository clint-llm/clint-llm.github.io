The overall prognosis hinges on the underlying cause of the thrombus. If a patient has a hereditary hypercoagulable disease, they are predisposed to the development of thrombi. However, if they are compliant with their anticoagulation therapy, their prognosis will be favorable. Alternatively, if the patient is diagnosed with progressive cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, that has extended and compressed the IVC, their prognosis is likely poor.

Children who have had catheterization have gone on to develop unilateral leg swelling and chronic pain. Finally, there is the potential of pulmonary embolus if the inferior vena cava has a floating embolus.
