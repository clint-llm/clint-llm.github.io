Cleft hand, otherwise referred to as ectrodactyly or colloquially as "split hand," is defined as a central longitudinal deficiency expressed as suppression of bone and soft tissues in the central elements of the hand, including the index, middle, and ring fingers.

These central ray deformities typically divide into "typical" and "atypical" cleft hands. Typical cleft hands are generally of a genetic origin and bilateral with the classic "v-shaped" defect. Furthermore, typical cleft hands are often associated with "cleft foot" deformities as well. Atypical cleft hands, in contrast, are a form of symbrachydactyly involving the index, long, and ring fingers, often involving an absence of the digits, syndactyly of the digits, or hypoplasia of the digits. Atypical cleft hands generally appear as more of a "u-shaped" deformity compared to the classic "v-shape." Because atypical cleft hands are generally the result of a spontaneous mutation, there are rarely associated syndromes or deformities, and the disorder is not inherited.
