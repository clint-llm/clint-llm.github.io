People affected by a crisis can potentially harm themselves and others, which is a significant concern as to why crisis intervention is needed as it mitigates those risks. For example, family members of a patient in a vegetative state reported having high levels of stress and anxiety that negatively impacted their own physical and mental health

In these cases, psychological crisis intervention is necessary to prevent traumatized victims from developing illnesses. It also alleviates stress upon healthcare workers so that they can continue helping others. Another major concern is what coping strategies are most effective. Social support and problem-solving planning are effective coping mechanisms that are frequently used by school staff following a crisis.
