The nodes of Ranvier are characterized by short (1um), specialized regions in the axonal membrane that are not insulated by myelin.  Although it is bare of myelin at the node, the axon is in direct contact with the microvilli of the Schwann cells in the PNS, or with processes of astrocytes in the CNS (Figure 1).

The long, myelin-covered section of axon between nodes is the internode.  The purpose of the myelin sheath is to increase the speed of transmission by acting as an electrical insulator.  In non-myelinated axons, the action potential must propagate continuously along the plasma membrane.  Under myelin, there is increased resistance to movement of charges across the membrane, resulting in rapid propagation of the voltage signal within the axonal cytoplasm to the next node.  The action potential must be ‘amplified’ at each node by the influx of sodium ions as the voltage signal dissipates along the length of the myelinated axon.

The nodes of Ranvier, including adjacent regions, contain a high concentration of the structural proteins ankyrins, which are responsible for the anchoring of proteins to the axonal cytoskeleton.
