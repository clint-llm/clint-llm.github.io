An in-depth history can be essential in raising suspicion for hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Emphasis should be placed on identifying any events that may have led to fetomaternal hemorrhage. These include previous pregnancies with HDFN or hydrops fetalis, miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, early pregnancy terminations, blood transfusions in the mother, chorionic villous sampling, amniocentesis, or documentation of bleeding in pregnancy.

Early in the first trimester, blood typing should be done on all pregnant women. Those with blood type O naturally express antibodies to A and B blood types; thus, they should be monitored for the development of HDFN, especially at delivery and directly postpartum. The antibodies expressed in mothers with O blood type are typically immunoglobulin G (IgG) and can cross the placenta. Conversely, mothers with blood type A have antibodies against blood type B, which are predominantly immunoglobulin M (IgM) and do not cross the placenta.

The main signs of hemolytic disease in the newborn (HDN) are anemia and hyperbilirubinemia, which may present as lethargy, jaundice, conjunctival icterus, pallor, hepatosplenomegaly, tachycardia or bradycardia, increased oxygen requirement, and/or apnea.
