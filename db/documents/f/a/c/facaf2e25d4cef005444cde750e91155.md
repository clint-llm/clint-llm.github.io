Lower eyelid ectropion leads to an abnormally positioned lower eyelid. On examination, the lower eyelid margin may appear low, with visualization of the lower cornea. Typically, the lower eyelid sits 1 mm to 2 mm above the inferior corneal limbus. With ectropion, the lower eyelid may also visually be outward. In extreme cases, the tarsal conjunctiva may be visible and may have signs of chronic conjunctivitis with keratinization of the conjunctiva. The eye may be injected, and in extreme cases leading to exposure keratopathy, the cornea may be dry with punctate epithelial erosions and possible ulceration.Â Eyelid laxity would also typically be apparent. One may check the distractibility of the lower eyelid by pulling the lower lid down and out to see how far the lid could be pulled. A snap-back test is performed by pulling the lid down and out and counting the number of seconds until the lid snaps back into position against the ocular surface. In extreme cases, blinking of the eyelids may be required to bring the eyelid back into position. During an examination, one would also thoroughly examine the periorbital region to rule out other causes such as cicatricial changes, such as chronic skin changes, or a mass. Examining the contralateral eyelid is also important since the etiology of the offended ectropic eyelid may also be leading to ectropion of the contralateral eyelid.
