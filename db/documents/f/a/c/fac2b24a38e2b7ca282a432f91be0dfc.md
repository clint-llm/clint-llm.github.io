A critical care evaluation and consultation are needed in these patients as many of them will present with hypotension, altered mental status, and cardiovascular collapse. The severity of their presentation will often necessitate a higher level of care and monitoring, whichÂ may include vasopressors, fluids, antibiotics, and further management depending on the precipitating etiology of the adrenal crisis. Once the diagnosis of adrenal crisis is suspected, an emergent endocrinology consultation should be obtained to help confirm the diagnosis and to tailor the proper administration of corticosteroids further, as well as to manage any underlying endocrine disorders in the long-term both as an inpatient and outpatient.
