Diaper dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical examination findings. Overall, there is no need to perform any laboratory testing. However, when considering infection by Candida albicans, confirmation of the diagnosis by examination with KOH can be useful, although not necessary. If there is suspicion of bacterial infection, Gram staining can be performed.
