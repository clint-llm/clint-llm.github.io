Kleine–Levin syndrome (KLS), also known as "Sleeping beauty syndrome," is a rare yet devastating parasomnia that includes recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, along with behavioral or cognitive abnormalities, coupled with compulsive eating and hypersexuality.

Critchley and Hoffman actually defined the syndrome in 1942 and gave it its name after the publication of the classic paper, “The Syndrome of Periodic Somnolence and Morbid Hunger (Kleine–Levin syndrome)."
