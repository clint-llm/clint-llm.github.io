Heart failure is a serious disorder best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the primary care physician, emergency department physician, cardiologist, radiologist, cardiac nurses, internist, and cardiac surgeons. It is imperative to treat the cause of heart failure. Healthcare workers who look after these patients must be familiar with current guidelines on treatment. The risk factors for heart disease must be modified, and the clinical nurse should educate the patient on the importance of medication compliance and lifestyle modifications. When the condition is not managed appropriately, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality, including poor quality of life.
