Hirsutism is a common disorder encountered in clinical practice. While not life-threatening, it has significant morbidity because of cosmetic issues. In some women, it may a sign of an underlying malignancy. Thus, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team.

The approach to hirsutism requires a systemic approach coupled with a focussed treatment plan. The primary care providers, including the nurse practitioner, must educate the patient about compliance with treatment and the time consuming diagnostic procedures. Mental health consultation may be appropriate. Dermatology nurses can provide patient education and monitor treatment. The pharmacist should educate the patient on pharmacological treatment and their limitations, as well as checking for drugs that may contribute to the condition. Finally, the clinician should provide options for other treatments and only initiate therapy after obtaining informed consent. [Level 5]

The outcomes for many patients with hirsutism are not satisfactory. Recurrence of hair growth is common, and repeated treatments to remove hair are also costly, creating a financial burden on the patients.
