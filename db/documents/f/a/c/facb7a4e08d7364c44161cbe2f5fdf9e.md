The initial presentation is classically unilateral and presents as a macular-papular scarlatiniform eruption that starts in one axillary fold, but it can also begin in other flexures, such as the thigh, flank, or inguinal fold. Subsequently, after 10 to 15 days, the rash may spread to involve the thorax, the corresponding arm and the contralateral side in 70% of cases but it generally maintains its asymmetrical nature.
