Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disease characterized by repeated episodes of a diffuse alveolar hemorrhage resulting in the accumulation of hemosiderin inside pulmonary macrophages. Early recognition and prompt diagnosis can help reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of IPH and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.
- Describe the most common presentation of idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.
- Explain the treatment options available for idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.
- Summarize the importance of coordination and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.
