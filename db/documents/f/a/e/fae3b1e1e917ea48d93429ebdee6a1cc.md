The thyroid cancer death rate has remained steady despite the increase in incidence. It is one of the lowest mortality cancers in the United States.

Even though follicular thyroid cancers have distant metastasis, metastasis to lymph nodes is uncommon, and occurrence is estimated to be fewer than 10%.

The overall 10-year survival of follicular cancer depends on the level of invasiveness. For minimally invasive cancers, 10-year survival is reported to be 98%, and for invasive follicular cancer, it is 80%.
