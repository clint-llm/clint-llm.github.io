Lesions at multiple levels can affect the chain of neurons and synapses that transmit the sensations of touch from the skin to the central nervous system. The peripheral nerves can get severed due to trauma or demyelinated in several autoimmune diseases; these nerves can regrow as long as the cell body of the nerve is intact. These nerves can regrow at 2 mm/day in small nerves or 5 mm/day in large nerves. As previously discussed, the dorsal horn relays sensation to light touch and vibration while the lateral spinothalamic tract relays pain sensations. If a spinal cord lesion occurs in either of these tracts, the spinal nerve levels below the lesions will lose sensation.
