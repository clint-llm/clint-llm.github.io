It is important to note that the physical signs of an obturator hernia are operator dependent and may not be immediately evident. In these cases, it would be prudent to perform computed tomography (CT) scan to achieve an adequate diagnosis, with a reported diagnostic accuracy of up to 90%.

The patient would also require general labs to be worked up for a possible operative procedure as per local protocol.
