The previously sterile space formed between the crown of a tooth and the dental follicle is exposed to intraoral microflora as the tooth erupts into the oral cavity. This small pocket that is surrounded by the soft tissue overlying the erupting tooth is difficult to clean. This forms an excellent environment for obligatory and facultative anaerobic bacteria to dwell. In addition, food can easily get impacted into this space, promoting bacterial growth and causing infection of the surrounding soft tissue, so-called pericoronitis. The microflora of pericoronitis is diverse and differs from pathogens that cause periodontitis. In a study of microbiota of pericoronitis, Actinomyces
oris, Eikenella
corrodens, Eubacterium
nodatum, Fusobacterium
nucleatum, Treponema
denticola, and Eubacterium
saburreum were present in high levels.

A factor that can exacerbate pericoronitis is mechanical trauma from the opposing dentition. As maxillary third molars erupt, they can occlude onto the operculum overlaying the erupting mandibular third molars. Such repeated trauma can cause ulcerations and worsen the symptoms.

As pericoronitis is primarily associated with mandibular third molar eruptions, the incidence of the disease varies depending on the third molar eruption pathways or positions. Mandibular third molar eruption positions can be described by two classifications: Pell and Gregory classification and Winter’s classification. Studies have shown that vertically positioned third molars are most commonly associated with pericoronitis compared to other positions, while horizontal positioning had decreased occurrences of pericoronitis. Also, teeth with Pell and Gregory classification A had a greater prevalence of pericoronitis than those with B classification. However, there was no significant difference in prevalence between Pell and Gregory classes I and II.

Systemic factors can promote or exacerbate the presentation of pericoronitis. Patients with impaired immune systems, such as those with uncontrolled diabetes or immunodeficiency disorders, can be more prone to developing pericoronitis. Also, pericoronitis can be triggered or worsened by other systemic conditions that can temporarily compromise the immune response. These include mental or physical stress, upper respiratory infection, or menstruation for females.
