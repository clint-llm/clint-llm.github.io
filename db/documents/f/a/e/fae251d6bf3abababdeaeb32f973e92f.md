Inflammatory dermatoses are often treated by primary care providers, nurse practitioners, dermatologists, and rheumatologists. Topical steroids have long been considered first-line treatment for inflammatory dermatoses but may cause local side effects including skin atrophy, telangiectasias, striae, acneiform eruptions, and rarely cataracts or glaucoma. Pimecrolimus is a non-steroidal agent belonging to the class of topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) initially approved in the United States in 2001. Out of numerous ascomycin derivatives screened, researchers selected pimecrolimus for further development based on favorable anti-inflammatory properties, skin-selective properties, and overall safety profile. Although topical steroids are still regarded as first-line treatment for dermatitis, in some clinical scenarios, TCIs may even be preferred to topical steroids, such as when the skin condition is recalcitrant to steroids or located on sensitive skin or if the patient has experienced local side effects from topical steroids.

Therapy with pimecrolimus requires an interprofessional team approach. Clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), including specialists, will initiate treatment but should use pharmacist resources to verify dosing and indications, as well as potential drug-drug interactions. The pharmacist can also consult with nursing, so they can be alert for possible adverse effects, which with pimecrolimus can be severe. The nurse is also well-positioned to evaluate compliance and report any adverse events or the success or failure of therapy to the rest of the team. This type of interprofessional collaboration will optimize patient outcomes and minimize adverse reactions. [Level 5]

In 2014, a workgroup consisting of experts in atopic dermatitis put forth an update on evidence-based treatment guidelines. The results explicitly addressing the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors are summarized below

**Level of Evidence: I Strength of Recommendation: A**

- In treating atopic dermatitis, TCIs such as pimecrolimus are more efficacious than monotherapy with an emollient. When used as regularly (2 to 3 times weekly), atopic flares decrease, and patients require topical steroids less frequently.

- TCIs, such as pimecrolimus, can be recommended for use as steroid-sparing options on actively inflamed areas of atopic dermatitis.

- Off-label use of pimecrolimus cream can be recommended in atopic dermatitis patients less than 2 years of age.

- There currently is no recommendation for routine blood monitoring in patients using TCIs.

**Level of Evidence: II Strength of Recommendation: B**

- Localized skin burning, stinging, or pruritus is the most common adverse effects associated with the use of TCIs, particularly when applied to areas of acute dermatitis. Patients should receive counsel on these possible side effects and how to limit them. These symptoms may decrease over time with repetitive use or with pretreatment with topical steroids.

- TCIs may be used simultaneously with topical steroids.

**Level of Evidence: III Strength of Recommendation: C**

- As TCIs are a relatively new class of medication, there is no long-term safety data. Data regarding viral skin infections with the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors continuously or intermittently up to 5 years demonstrates no increased prevalence; however, patients should still understand the theoretical risk.

- Prescribers should be aware of and counsel patients regarding the black-box warning for topical calcineurin inhibitors.

With increased familiarity with current recommendations, members of the healthcare team can ensure more favorable outcomes in patients with atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory dermatoses receiving treatment with topical pimecrolimus.
