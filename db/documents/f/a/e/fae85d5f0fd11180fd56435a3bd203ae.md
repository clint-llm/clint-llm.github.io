In accordance with the propriety of the psychiatric evaluation, organicity should first be ruled out.

Once organic perturbations have been ruled out, a full psychiatric exam should be performed. This includes a history of present illness, psychiatric history, social history, substance use history, family psychiatric history, psychiatric review of symptoms, and mental status exam.

Early work in defining this disorder was done by Hagop Akiskal.  His validated questionnaires, the TEMPS-A and Cyclothymic-Hypersensitivity, have been translated into nearly 20 languages with research on several continents.

As mentioned in the introduction, cyclothymic symptomatology overlaps with manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes, without meeting their full diagnostic threshold. Per DSM-5, cyclothymia is classified as the existence of symptomatology for the last two years, present for more days than not. Stability of mood cannot have exceeded any length of time longer than 2 consecutive months. The symptoms identified must have caused significant impairment in the patient's life. And lastly, the symptoms cannot be secondary to another psychiatric or medical illness.
