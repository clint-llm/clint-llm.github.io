Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a progressive multiorgan fibrosing condition mainly caused by patients' exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The condition was first described in 2000; however, several years later, a group of nephrologists explained the pathophysiology and the important role of GBCAs to induce this condition.

Patients with severe renal insufficiency are at high risk of developing this condition if GBCAs are used in MRI. The incidence rate was dramatically reduced in the last years due to strict adherence of the health care providers with the regulatory guidelines that advise the radiologists to avoid using high-risk GBCAs in severe renal failure.

The association between gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was first put forward in a case series comprising of 13 patients, where all the patients had developed NSF after exposure to gadolinium.
