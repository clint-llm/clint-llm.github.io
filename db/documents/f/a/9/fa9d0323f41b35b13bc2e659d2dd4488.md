Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double helix composed of two strands of four types of nucleotides.

Genes, in turn, are a sequence of nucleotides that serve as the basic unit of heredity and code for a specific product, either protein or RNA. The cell relies on genes to be accurately and fully copied, transcribed, and translated to create a functioning product, often a specific protein but occasionally RNA as well. However, genetic sequence mutation can occur, which refers to an unintended alteration in a gene’s coding.

Mutations can reduce functionality or limit the expression of the gene product, potentially damaging or even killing the cell. Genetic mutations, whether acquired or inherited, form the basis for many disease states, cancer, and aging.
