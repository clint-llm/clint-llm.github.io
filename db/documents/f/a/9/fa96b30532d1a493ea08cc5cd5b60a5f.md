Metabolic derangements and urinary infections are the two major causes of any renal stone formation. Struvite calculi are closely related to urinary tract infections (UTI); hence they are also known as infection stones. Infection or colonization by urease-producing organisms like Proteus, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Providentia, Serratia, and Morganella can cause struvite stones.Proteus species produce urease while only 1.4% of Escherichia coli are thought to produce the enzyme. Therefore, Escherichia coli is considered the least likely cause of struvite stone formation.

In general, patients with infection stones are less likely to have a concurrent metabolic abnormality contributing to nephrolithiasis than non-struvite stone formers.

Kang et al. reviewed 70 staghorn stone patients after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. After 3 years, those who had undergone a metabolic evaluation and took specific prophylactic therapy after surgery had a stone formation rate 98% less than the rate in those who did not have metabolic testing or specific preventive treatment.
