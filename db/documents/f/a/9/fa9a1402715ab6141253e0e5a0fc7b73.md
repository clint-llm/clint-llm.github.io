As per the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) registry, the total number of people on the waitlist is 107,485 (as of 5/19/2021). United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is a non-profit organization that functions with local organ procurement organizations to match the donor with the recipient. Hence, it becomes essential to register a patient early, evaluate and optimize them. So, whenever an appropriately matched organ is available, the patient can be scheduled for surgery.
