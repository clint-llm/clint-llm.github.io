The diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma is challenging because of its dual mesenchymal and epithelial differentiation. This differentiation allows the tumor to masquerade histologically as various other reactive, benign, and malignant processes. The immunohistochemical labeling can confirm the diagnosis although a plethora of other more common diagnostic entities that have histologic and immunophenotypic overlap must be considered. The histopathologic diagnosis can best be rendered in the appropriate clinical context (typically a soft tissue mass on the extremity of a young male) and supported with immunohistochemical staining.

The differential diagnosis based on histomorphology generally includes reactive and benign lesions such as granulomatous diseases, nodular fasciitis, fibrohistiocytic lesions, fibromatosis, and tenosynovial giant cell tumors. Malignant lesions in the differential diagnosis include metastatic carcinoma, melanoma, synovial sarcoma, vascular neoplasms, spindled squamous cell carcinoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and extrarenal rhabdoid tumor.

Complete lack of INI-1 expression is characteristic of up to 90% of these tumors.

A summary of helpful immunohistochemical stains is provided for epithelioid sarcoma (ES):

- CD34 positive in half of ES (negative in synovial sarcoma and most carcinomas)

- Vimentin-positive in ES (negative in many carcinomas, except notably endometrial and renal)

- INI-1, complete loss is distinctive as described above in this section

- CK7 negative in ES (positive in synovial sarcoma)

- CK5/6 and p63 negative in ES (positive in squamous cell carcinoma)

- S100 negative in ES (positive in MPNST and many melanomas)

- CD31 negative in ES, except one documented case (positive in vascular lesions)

- SALL4 negative in 89% of ES (positive in 71% of malignant rhabdoid tumors)

- ERG variably positive in ES (negative in all malignant rhabdoid tumors)

- Of note, vascular markers ERG, FLI1, and D240 have been demonstrated in ES
