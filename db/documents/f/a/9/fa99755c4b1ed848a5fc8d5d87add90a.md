Cervical cancer is a significant women's health problem worldwide. Most cases of cervical cancer occur in developing countries that have ineffective screening programs. The incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in the United States have been decreasing in the past 30 years due to widespread screening. In the United States, cervical cancer diagnosis is usually in women who have never received screening or received inadequate screening.
