Beginning on day 26, week 4 of the fetal period, the upper limb begins to form as a limb bud of mesodermal tissue from somites and the lateral plate. The limb forms in the proximal to distal direction and is controlled by several different signaling centers which produce specific factors that control differentiation. The signaling centers include the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) which controls proximal-distal signaling by inducing differentiation of underlying mesoderm and programmed cell death of interdigital tissue, the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) which controls radioulnar limb formation via production of sonic hedgehog protein (SHH), and the Wnt pathway which regulates the ventral/dorsal limb axis.

At about day 36, chondrogenic formations of the digits arise which then begins the entire formation of hand structures. During the sixth and seventh week, early muscle masses are beginning to form throughout the upper extremity and hand. This is the time when the formation of the intrinsic hand muscles begins, including the adductor pollicis development. During week 7, the interdigital apoptosis occurs, allowing the formation of separate digits and followed by ossification of the upper extremity bones in week 8. The majority of upper limb development is complete by week 8, thus developmental abnormalities of the UE are likely to arise in weeks 3 through 8.
