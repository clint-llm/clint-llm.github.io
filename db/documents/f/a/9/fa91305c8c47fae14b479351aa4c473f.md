A specific cause for ACS in children is found in approximately 40% of cases. Within this 40%, most are due to infections, with the next common causes being pulmonary infarction and fat embolism. Infectious causes most commonly are viral, mycoplasma pneumonia, or chlamydia pneumonia.

In adult patients, half of the patients who develop ACS are initially admitted for other reasons, frequently vaso-occlusive crises (VOC). VOC, as discussed earlier, can result in bone marrow or fat emboli to the pulmonary circulation, the most common causes of ACS. VOC of the spine, ribs, and abdomen, have an additional risk. VOC in these body regions can lead to hypoventilation secondary to both pain and opioids, which then triggers hypoxemia/alveolar hypoxia and low arterial oxygen tension, resulting in sickling and ACS.

The pathophysiology of ACS is based on vaso-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature. Whatever the inciting event, deoxygenation of hemoglobin is the common next step in SCD leading to polymerization and sickling of erythrocytes. These sickled erythrocytes then cause further vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and endothelial injury.

Fat emboli are known to cause the release of free fatty acids (FFA) within the pulmonary vasculature due to phospholipase A2. FFA is veryÂ pro-inflammatory, which leads to pulmonary injury with resultant hypoxemia.
