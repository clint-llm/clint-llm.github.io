Desflurane is the most likely inhaled anesthetic to result in carbon monoxide (CO) production, compared with isoflurane and sevoflurane. The mechanism of production of CO is through degradation of desflurane by desiccated CO2 absorbent, barium hydroxide lime. It can produce clinically significant levels of carbon monoxide, stressing the importance of replacing dried CO2 absorbents. Although rare, severe hepatic injury can follow anesthesia with desflurane, along with other inhalational agents, and may include massive hepatic necrosis. The mechanism is immunologic. Desflurane undergoes metabolism by cytochrome P-450 to produce trifluoroacetate, which binds to hepatocyte proteins, forming complexes that stimulate antibody formation. Exposures after antibody formation can lead to hepatic necrosis. This is much less common than with other agents such as halothane but is still possible, given the metabolite. There is currently no treatment for hepatic effects of desflurane; the use of desflurane or similar inhalational anesthetics should be avoided in the future if any hepatic impairment is suspected.
