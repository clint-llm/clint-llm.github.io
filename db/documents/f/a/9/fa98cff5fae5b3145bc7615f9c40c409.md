The general mechanism of action by which the azole antifungal family works is by inhibiting lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, which converts lanosterol to ergosterol in fungus cellular membranes.

**Metabolism**

All azole antifungals are involved in drug-drug interactions via cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolism.
