Infectious disease specialists, both clinicians and pharmacists, need to understand the mechanisms by which bacteria can undergo DNA mutations, as these mutations can confer resistance against agents that were previously effective. By understanding the mechanism and careful tracking through antibiograms, antimicrobial therapy can be targeted for the greatest effectiveness without contributing to mutations that will create "superbugs." This will result in better antibiotic therapy resulting in improved patient outcomes with fewer adverse events and the need for ever stronger broad-spectrum drugs.
