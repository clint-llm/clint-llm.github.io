Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that is characterized by physiologic, biologic, and biochemical abnormalities caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis and the associated inflammatory response can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death. Urosepsis, as the name implies, is sepsis originating from the urogenital tract.
