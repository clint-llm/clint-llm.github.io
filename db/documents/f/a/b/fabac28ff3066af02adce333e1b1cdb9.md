A focused history and physical exam often reveal clinical findings suggestive of upper extremity DVT, which can be confirmed with subsequent imaging studies. The majority of patients present only with limb swelling and arm discomfort. The onset and duration of limb swelling along with any previous history of DVT should be obtained. Patients may also complain of arm heaviness. The physical exam may also reveal limb erythema with visible veins across the chest and upper extremity (Urschelâ€™s sign). Personal and family history of hypercoagulable disorders are relevant, as well as if any prior central venous catheterization has been attempted. In the primary form (PSS), patients will present with a sudden onset of severe limb pain and swelling, often in the dominant arm. These patients are younger and often participate in activities requiring excessive and repeated motions of the upper extremity (e.g., baseball pitcher). In all patients, distal pulses should be assessed. Limbs appearing pale, cool, and mottled are at risk of ischemia. Any motor or sensory deficit should be noted, as these require emergency intervention.
