Risk factors for arrhythmia are similar to risk factors for developing heart disease. A heart-healthy lifestyle with a well-balanced diet, exercising and refraining from tobacco products is essential for prevention. Focal atrial tachycardia persistence can be mitigated by the avoidance of caffeinated products and other stimulant substances.

Atrial tachycardia can produce symptoms such as palpitations, lightheadedness, and pre-syncope, which can understandably generate anxiety. It is therefore essential to convey to patients that although atrial tachycardia can be bothersome, it is not a lethal arrhythmia.
