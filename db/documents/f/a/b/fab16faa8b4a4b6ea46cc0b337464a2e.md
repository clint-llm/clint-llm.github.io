Routine physical exam maneuvers alone are not sufficient for diagnosing presbycusis. An in-office screening audiometry test administered by trained personnel should be considered by providers such as geriatricians who have a large population of older adults at high risk of presbycusis. There should be a low threshold for referral for definitive auditory testing in patients suspected of presbycusis. Imaging is usually not performed except in cases in which there is a discrepancy between presentation and auditory testing, or there are associated neurological changes.

There are many variations of audiometry testing and central auditory testing that are beyond the scope of this review. In general, an audiometry exam tests the ability to hear sounds at varying intensity (loudness) and frequencies (tone). Commonly, pure tone testing (also known as an audiogram) is performed in patients with suspected age-related hearing loss. Pure tones are delivered through the use of headphones to one ear at a time. Patients are asked to respond if they hear a sound. The results are presented in the form of an audiogram, a graph with hearing level (in decibels) on the y-axis and frequency (in hertz) on the x-axis. In presbycusis, the highest frequency sounds are typically affected first, followed by lower and lower frequency sounds as the condition progresses.

Laboratory testing for diseases commonly associated with hearing loss, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, and renal dysfunction, may be indicated but are not required for diagnosis.
