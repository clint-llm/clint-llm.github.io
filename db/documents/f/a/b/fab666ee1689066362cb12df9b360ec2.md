**Upper Airway Cough Syndrome (UACS)**

This includes all nasopharyngeal conditions (including allergic rhinitis (AR), rhinosinusitis, and laryngopharyngitis) that may be associated with post-nasal drip and subtle sensation of irritation of secretions in the back of the throat and the upper airways that present with a cough as the only symptom. Throat examination may reveal signs of pharyngitis and cobble-stone appearance. These conditions can be silent (no symptoms besides a cough) in up to 20% of cases. Because of disease chronicity, it is likely that, over time, patients will become tolerant of other symptoms, which are not as bothersome as a cough. The diagnosis of silent UACS can reliably be made only after patients show significant improvement with prescribed treatment directed to suggestive features in history, physical examination, or laboratory testing.

**Cough-Variant Asthma(C-VA)**

A cough can be the only manifestation of asthma. Unlike silent UACS, the diagnosis of C-VA can be confirmed in most cases with pre and post-bronchodilator spirometry with or without methacholine challenge test (MCT).

**Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB)**

NAEB shares eosinophilic airway inflammation with asthma, but there is no demonstrable airflow limitation on spirometry, and MCT is negative. A chest x-ray is usually normal. Missing this diagnosis is possible because sputum examination and/or bronchoalveolar lavage to detect airway eosinophilia are not routinely performed during the diagnostic work-up, and NAEB tends to respond to corticosteroids in the same way as asthma.

**Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD)**

Reflux triggers cough by a direct effect of acid on the proximal part of the esophagus and the laryngopharyngeal areas or by indirect vagal stimulation through the effect of gastric contents on the distal part of the esophagus. Other symptoms of acid reflux, such as heartburn, may be absent (silent reflux) in as many as 75% of cases of a reflux-induced cough. pH esophageal monitoring may confirm the presence of silent reflux, although anti-reflux therapy does not always resolve a cough.

**Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome (CHS)**

Cough hypersensitivity syndrome is defined as “troublesome coughing triggered by a low level of thermal, mechanical, or chemical exposure.”  It is characterized by enhancement of the cough reflex through sensitization of afferent neuronal pathways of a cough, both at the peripheral and central levels. Patients with CHS develop a cough in an exaggerated response to stimuli that would not otherwise elicit cough. It is thought that this nerve hypersensitivity is a result of various recurrent triggers, such as URTI or AR. A chronic cough is seen with UACS, asthma, and reflux may be induced by the development of cough hypersensitivity. Pharyngeal and/or laryngeal sensations (irritation, tickle, tightness, throat clearing), which are frequently associated with UACS and reflux-induced cough, may represent a sensory neuronal dysfunction of vagal afferents in the upper airways and a phenotype of cough hypersensitivity syndrome.  Symptoms such as dysphonia, dysphagia, dyspnea, and abnormalities of vocal fold motion on laryngoscopy may also be present along with a cough as part of the pharyngeal/laryngeal nerve dysfunction seen with cough hypersensitivity syndrome.
