The formation and maintenance of Baker's cysts can occur through several mechanisms, including

- joint-cyst communication,

- sequestration of synovial fluid in the popliteal fossa due to a valve-like effect between the joint space and cyst (controlled by the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus muscle with flexion and extension at the knee),

- negative intraarticular knee pressure during partial flexion combined with a positive pressure during extension (as a result directing fluid flow towards the cyst from the suprapatellar bursa during flexion);

- gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa enlargement resulting from small traumas to the bursa with muscle contractions; and

- herniation of the joint capsule into the popliteal fossa.
