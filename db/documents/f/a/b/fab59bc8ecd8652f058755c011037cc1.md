Seabather's eruption (SBE), also known as sea lice, is a pruritic dermatitis found in a bathing suit distribution and at sites of friction after bathing in the ocean. The eruption is caused by two saltwater species of Cnidarians: the thimble Jellyfish (Linuche unguiculata) and a sea anemone (Edwardsiella lineata). Both of these species are small enough to become entrapped underneath swimwear. Pressure, as well as exposure to freshwater, lead the organisms to discharge a protective organ called a nemocytes. The nemocytes is a stinging organ that releases various antigenic toxins which induce a host immune response. Typically, this eruption is seen during the spring and summer with higher incidence in May and June. Children less than 15 years old have higher risk of SBE. Those with a history of SBE are also at increased risk and tend to have more severe presentations. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation and treatment of seabather's eruption, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of seabather's eruption.
- Review the presentation of seabather's eruption.
- Summarize the treatment for seabather's eruption.
- Explain the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with seabather's eruption.
