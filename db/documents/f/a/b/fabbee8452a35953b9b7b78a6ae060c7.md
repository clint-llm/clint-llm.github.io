The prognosis of a patient with Fahr disease is variable and unpredictable. There is no correlation between the age of disease onset, symptoms at onset, or extent of calcifications in the brain with the severity of the disease. Penetrance is age-dependent, with a 95% occurrence by the age 50. As such, an asymptomatic disease carrier might present with a negative CT scan at a younger age. Calcifications have been reported to become more extensive with age, as evidenced by follow up scans of confirmed cases.
