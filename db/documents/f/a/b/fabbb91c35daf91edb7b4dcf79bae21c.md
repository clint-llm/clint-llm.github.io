Bax dysregulation can lead to apoptotic dysfunction that increases the likelihood of multiple pathologies.  As a tumor suppressor gene, Bax has a critical role in preventing tumorigenesis, and loss of function often occurs in human tumors. Loss of function mutations can also lead to incomplete negative selection and peripheral tolerance dysfunction, thus causing autoimmune complications. Chronic neurodegenerative conditions, such as Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, or Alzheimer disease, often depend on aberrant apoptotic cell death. Lastly, although necrosis is the primary mechanism of injury during myocardial infarction, it has been seen that reperfusion injury is an apoptosis driven event.
