Pellagra is a condition of niacin deficiency, which is rare in industrialized nations. In individuals with malabsorption, lack of access to food, the use of certain medications, or alcoholism that may impair the absorption or synthesis of niacin, it may lead to a presentation of pellagra. After diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis of patients is excellent. Healthcare professionals working as an interprofessional team should use nutritional education to inform the patients and continue to monitor the patient throughout recovery. This interprofessional team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nursing staff, pharmacists, and nutritionists/dieticians, can best guide patient treatment to an optimal recovery. All team members must maintain accurate records of all interventions and interactions with these patients and exercise open communication channels with other caregivers to ensure optimal patient outcomes.
