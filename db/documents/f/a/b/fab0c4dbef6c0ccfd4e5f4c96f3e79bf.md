The use of tolcapone is contraindicated in patients who have a history of liver disease. Clinicians should also not initiate tolcapone therapy in patients with an ALT or AST value two times the upper limit of normal. If a patient has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis, tolcapone is contraindicated. Tolcapone should also be avoided in patients who have a hypersensitivity to tolcapone.
