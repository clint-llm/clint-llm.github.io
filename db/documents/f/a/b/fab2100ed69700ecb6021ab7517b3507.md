Monocytes are a crucial component of the innate immune system.

To infiltrate the affected sites, the monocytes must first secure themselves to the endothelium and then loosely roll along the vascular surface. The monocyte then firmly adheres to the endothelium and finally passes through the endothelial cells through a process known as diapedesis. Monocytes are then able to penetrate the endothelial basement membrane and migrate to the area of inflammation.

Macrophages can further differentiate into specialized macrophages based on their location.
