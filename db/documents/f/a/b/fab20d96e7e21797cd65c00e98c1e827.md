Myocardial involvement in SSc carries a poor prognosis. Several studies have shown that a significant number of SSc mortality was related to the presence of cardiac disease, including heart failure and arrhythmias. Cardiac disease was found to be the third leading cause of death in SSc after interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In a metanalysis, the hazard ratio of increased mortality was 2.8 (HR = 2.8; 95% CI: 2.1 to 3.8) in patients with cardiac disease.
