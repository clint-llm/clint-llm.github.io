# Continuing Education Activity

"Jumper's knee," also called patellar tendinopathy, is a painful condition of the knee, mainly activity-related, caused by small tears in the patellar tendon that mainly occurs in sports requiring strenuous jumping and results in localized patellar tendon tenderness. The tears are typically caused by accumulated stress on the patellar or quadriceps tendon. As the name implies, the condition is common in athletes from jumping sports, where there is a high demand for the speed and power of leg extensors. These sports often lead to high eccentric quadriceps loadings, such as volleyball, track (long and high jump), basketball, long-distance running, and skiing. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of jumper's knee and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients about their prognosis.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the differential diagnosis of jumper's knee.
- Identify the risk factors for developing jumper's knee.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of jumper's knee.
- Explain the interprofessional team's strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding managing patients with jumper's knee.

# Introduction

"Jumper's knee," also called patellar tendinopathy, is a painful condition of the knee, mainly activity-related, caused by small tears in the patellar tendon that mainly occurs in sports requiring strenuous jumping and results in localized patellar tendon tenderness. The tears are typically caused by accumulated stress on the patellar or quadriceps tendon. As the name implies, the condition is common in athletes from jumping sports, where there is a high demand for the speed and power of leg extensors.

The condition has a male predominance, with a more common occurrence in adolescents and young adults. Contrary to traditional belief, a jumper's knee does not involve inflammation of the knee extensor tendons. Studies dating back 40 years describe jumper's knee as a degenerative condition. Jumper's knee is a clinical diagnosis through detailed history taking and a physical exam. Ultrasound can facilitate the diagnosis, as this imaging study is readily available and affordable. Treatment mainly revolves around conservative measures such as reducing activities that place a loading impact on the knee. Once the pain subsides, restoration of function is achieved through physical and exercise therapy. Surgery usually remains the last resort for chronic refractory cases.

# Etiology

Jumper's knee is an overuse injury of the knee extensor mechanism due to repetitive mechanical stress from athletic activities requiring movements such as jumping, landing, acceleration, deceleration, and cutting.

There are several intrinsic factors of the knee that predispose to this pathology. These include ligamentous laxity, quadriceps and hamstring tightness, excessive Q-angle of the knee, abnormal patellar height, previous, ongoing inflammation of the knee, and excessive force generation on the knee. Other factors can also lead to the development of the jumper's knee, such as excessive volume and frequency of training, the athlete's performance level, and the hardness of the ground where the sport is practiced.

# Epidemiology

Since sports injuries are often under-reported, it is hard to determine the exact frequency of patellar tendinopathy in the United States and internationally. Jumping sports such as volleyball, basketball, and long and high jumps have a high disease prevalence.

# Pathophysiology

Multiple theories have been proposed for the pathogenesis of patellar tendinopathy, mechanical, vascular, and impingement related. However, the chronic overload theory is the most commonly reported. Repetitive overload on the knee extensor tendons will cause it to weaken progressively, eventually leading to failure. Microscopic failure occurs within the tendon at high loads and eventually leads to alterations at the cellular level, which undermine its mechanical properties. Tendon micro-trauma may cause individual fibril degeneration due to stress across the tendon. As the fibril degeneration becomes ongoing, chronic tendinopathy will ensue.

Examination of the tendon under ultrasound shows three pathologic changes. At first, there will be edema along the damaged tendon fibers. The affected tissue is swollen and thickened but still homogenous. The second is a "stage with irreversible anatomical lesions," the tendon has a heterogeneous appearance with hypoechoic and hyperechoic images without edema (granuloma). At this point, the tendinous envelope is still more or less well-defined. In the final stage of the lesion, the tendinous envelope is irregular and thickened. Its fibers appear heterogeneous, yet the swelling has disappeared.

# Histopathology

Historically, the condition was considered to be inflammatory. A study from 2 decades ago demonstrated the absence of inflammatory cells.

Repetitive microtrauma on the tendons causes microscopic changes. Histologic studies of specimens reveal degeneration, fibrinoid necrosis, pseudocyst change, randomized collagen with neovascularization, tenocyte infiltration, micro-tears of the tendinous tissue, focal degeneration near the bone-tendon insertion, hyaline degeneration, and metaplasia.

# History and Physical

Patellar tendinopathy is mainly a clinical diagnosis made through a detailed history and meticulous physical examination. Appropriate questions which will cue in the diagnosis: Sport practiced, schedule of practice and competition, which position the athlete plays, and level of performance. The patient will usually complain of well-localized pain and tenderness on the inferior tip of the patella.

Patellar tendinopathy shares other common signs and symptoms of other knee pathologies, such as pain with prolonged sitting, squatting, and stair climbing. Also, patients may complain of pain from activities that involve prolonged flexion of the knee, otherwise known as the " Movie Theatre sign."

Examination of the knee might reveal a localized swelling overlying the patellar tendon, which is tender to palpate. In addition, the following signs have been described; Basset's sign, "passive extension – flexion sign," where the examiner palpates the anterior aspect of the fully extended knee and identifies the highest tender point, which is usually at the inferior pole of the patella and the proximal part of the patellar tendon. The examination is repeated at 90 degrees of knee flexion, and the sign is positive when there is a marked reduction in tenderness to palpation in the flexed knee position. The other sign is the "standing active quadriceps sign," where the whole patellar tendon is palpated while the patient is standing, and the examination is repeated while the patient is standing on the involved extremity with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion. Similarly, the sign is positive if there is a marked reduction in tenderness to palpation while the quadriceps muscle is contracted. The concept behind these signs was explained in a cadaveric study that showed when the quadriceps muscle is tensioned, as, in 90 degrees of knee flexion, the deep fibers of the tendon do not deform to anterior palpation.

A thorough examination of the entire lower extremity is needed to identify relevant deficits at the hip, knee, and ankle/foot region. Often malalignment of the foot, heel, or tibia can place excess stress on the knee extensor tendons increasing the risk of tendinopathy.

There are multiple scales for evaluating tendon overuse. A relatively more accurate scale is the Victorian Institute Sports tendon Assessment (VISA) score. The scale was tailored specifically to evaluate symptoms and functionality in patellar tendinopathy. The scale has good inter and intra-observer reliability and stability. It is a brief questionnaire that assesses symptoms, simple function tests, and the ability to play sports.

# Evaluation

Currently, there is no widely accepted gold standard diagnostic technique.

Radiographs, including anteroposterior, lateral, and skyline views, are recommended to exclude any acute bony injuries or pathologies. Radiographic changes on the tendon might be noted, such as elongation of the involved pole of the patella, calcification, inferior traction spur known as enthesophyte in chronic cases, and increased density within the patellar tendon matrix. However, these changes are rare in the first six months of symptoms. MRI scans would be indicated in chronic cases and for surgical planning. It can show thickening of the patellar tendon, which is more diagnostic than the presence of edema. Foci of increased signal intensity in both T1 and T2  images have been observed. In chronic cases, MRI scans may reveal the absence of the posterior border of the fat pad. It is often the proximal part of the tendon which is affected and thickened.

# Treatment / Management

There is no evidence-based, preferred treatment of choice for a jumper's knee. Refractory response to treatment is also typical for the condition, often leaving the health professional and patients searching for alternative therapies.

Most patients with jumper's knee are managed through medical and rehabilitative treatment in the initial stages of the disease.

**Non-surgical treatment**focusing on the following: Relative rest rather than immobilization to avoid tendon and muscle atrophy.

**Eccentric training**has been suggested to play a key role in rehabilitating a jumper's knee.

Athletes must avoid activities such as excessive jumping or impact loading of the knee, which only aggravates the situation. As the pain begins to subside, the intensity of rehabilitation therapy and sport-specific training can be slowly increased.

**Surgical treatment**is usually indicated in cases of partial tendon tears and Blazina stage III, where pain continues during rest and activities. Also, it remains the last resort for chronic refractory cases unresponsive to conservative treatment. Traditionally, the gold standard for surgical treatment of patellar tendinopathy involved open debridement of the inferior pole of the patella, as well as debridement of the patellar tendon by excising the angiofibroblastic and degenerative areas. This is followed by reattachment of the tendon using sutures or anchors as indicated. Recently, knee arthroscopy has gained popularity for tissue debridement and release. The arthroscopic procedure has been described as being performed through a direct inferior patellar portal.

# Differential Diagnosis

Jumper's knee can be mistaken for other injuries or pathologies such as Osgood-Schlatter disease, meniscal injuries, patellofemoral syndrome, quadriceps injury, knee bursitis (superficial and deep infrapatellar bursae), osteochondritis dissecans, patellar subluxation, pathologies of the knee fat pad, chondromalacia, or a patellar tracking problem.

# Staging

Blazina et al. first used the term jumper's knee in 1973. They also classified the pathology by stage according to the onset of pain in relation to physical activity. This classification, along with its modifications, is still widely employed. Blazina et al. suggest four stages.

- Pain after sports activity

- Pain at the beginning of sports activity that disappears with warm-up and sometimes reappears with fatigue

- Pain at rest and during activity, along with the deterioration of performance

- Rupture of the tendon

Classifying the pathology into three stages according to the duration of symptoms may be useful.

- Acute when symptoms have been present for 0 to 6 weeks

- Sub-acute when symptoms have been present between 6 to 12 weeks

- Chronic after more than three months

# Prognosis

Most cases of patellar tendinopathy will resolve with nonoperative management.

Rudavsky and Cook say that the process of returning to sports play is slow. This process is often dependent on various factors ranging from the severity of pain, grade of dysfunction, the sport practiced, the quality of rehabilitation, the athlete's performance level, and the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

Joshua et al. performed a systemic search of previous studies to compare the efficacy of treatment for commonly used invasive and non-invasive treatment options. The conclusion was that eccentric squat-based therapy, shockwave, or PRP could be used as monotherapies or adjunct therapies to accelerate recovery. Surgery or shockwave can be considered for patients who fail to improve after six months of conservative treatment. Since patellar tendinopathy is not inflammatory, corticosteroid injections should not be used.

Patellar tendinopathy may cause long-lasting symptoms that can lead to the athlete's early retirement from the sport. In a small prospective case-control study, Kettunen et al. found that 53% of their symptomatic subjects with jumper's knee had quit their sport compared to their asymptomatic counterparts, in which only 7% quit.

# Complications

Athletes, clinicians, coaches, and athletic trainers need to understand that the treatment for patellar tendinopathy can be a slow and sometimes frustrating process. There are multiple pitfalls to be aware of, including the failure to control pain. The athlete's beliefs about pain and pathology may influence the development and management of unresponsive tendinopathies. Because some athletes may have been told that they have weakened tendons due to tears and degeneration, and hence an increased risk of rupture, they may develop fear-avoidance behavior, which can be associated with poorer functional outcomes in individuals suffering from lower-limb tendinopathy. Over-reliance on non-invasive therapies like shockwave therapy and injections instead of including rehabilitation exercises as part of the treatment plan can also lead to complications. Failure to address the athletes' landing kinematics can also bring difficulties. Athletes should have their jump-landing mechanics retrained after adequate rehabilitation.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Patients who undergo patellar tendon debridement and repair should be immobilized in full extension for two weeks. A progressive range of motion and rehabilitation exercises should follow this. Full weight-bearing as tolerated is permissible from day one.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

There is currently insufficient evidence for preventative interventions specific to patellar tendinopathy.

**Soccer-specific balance****training (protective balancing):**a reduction in the incidence of patellar tendinopathy can be achieved relative to the duration of training (a dose-effect relationship).

# Pearls and Other Issues

- Studies have shown that rehabilitation exercises are vital in treating a jumper's knee.

- NSAIDs and steroid injections should be discouraged in managing the jumper's knee.

- The athlete and all personnel in charge of the care and training of the athlete should be aware that the jumper's knee management can be a lengthy process that can sometimes have long-lasting effects.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Managing patellar tendinopathy is a job for physicians trained in the care of musculoskeletal conditions along with other members of the interprofessional healthcare team. Sports medicine physicians, physiatrists, and rheumatologists provide the first line of care. Orthopedic surgeons are consulted for refractory cases or when the knee extensor tendons are partially or completely torn. An interprofessional team of professionals from multiple disciplines, including athletic trainers, physical therapists, sports biomechanists, and sports psychologists, is needed since the condition commonly affects athletes. The orthopedic specialty nurse is often responsible for coordinating care and follow-up and reporting concerns to the clinician. All professionals on the care team must keep accurate, updated records and openly communicate with other team members as needed.

Initially, the physical therapist must work with physicians to implement a nonoperative regimen consisting of therapy with isometric or eccentric exercises as the mainstay treatment. In a level 2 study, at 12 weeks, patients undergoing an eccentric exercise program showed significant improvement compared with those undergoing a concentric exercise program.

Alternative medical treatments have been studied at different levels of evidence, demonstrating mixed and inconclusive results. Acceptable outcomes have been obtained from surgical interventions in refractory cases.

An interprofessional team approach involving clinicians, specialists, orthopedic nursing, and therapists will yield the best results.
