Complications of a retinal migraine include central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), retinal infarction, central retinal venous occlusion, branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO), retinal hemorrhages that can lead to edema of the retina and disc, ischemia of choroid or optic nerve, and vitreous hemorrhage. Many of those could lead to irreversible vision loss in the patient. It is important to avoid the use of triptans, ergots, and beta-blockers in migraines with transient vision loss secondary to the risk of potentiating vasoconstriction and increasing the risk of irreversible visual loss.
