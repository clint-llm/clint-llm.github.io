The majority of angioneurotic edema cases (about 90%) are due to an allergic reaction that produces angioedema within minutes via eliciting a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction (histaminergic mediated mast cells and basophil activation). In contrast, non-allergic angioneurotic edema by inhibiting bradykinin may not be seen for months. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilatory mediator. There is excessive production of bradykinin in ANE, which leads to swelling of the mucosa and submucosal swelling.

During the attack of ANE, plasma bradykinin levels increase sevenfold higher than normal.

Lack of C1-INH activates the contact system (kallikrein-kinin), which finally leads to the overproduction of bradykinin. Bradykinin causes vasodilation and increases vascular permeability. It also leads to the contraction of nonvascular smooth muscle and acts as the main mediator of the pathophysiology of HANE. As such, it prevents the activation of a cascade of proteins leading to the swelling called angioedema. In recent literature, a small but growing number of suspected pathogenic variants in genes for other proteins have been identified to explain the disease in some families, while the pathogenesis in other families remains unclear.
