Paget's disease of the breast might be classified with TNM classification and staging system in the same manner as other breast malignancies. In other words, the presence of Paget disease of the breast does not change the stage of underlying breast cancer. If associated invasive breast cancer or DCIS is not identified, Paget disease is classified as Tis (Paget) disease. A most important aspect of this condition that influences the plan of treatment is underlying breast malignancy. Simple mastectomy has been the standard of treatment for PDB with or without underlying mass previously. Recently, Breast conservative treatment (BCT) has been the treatment of choice for DCIS. No guidelines are available for invasive breast malignancy. When PDB is present in association with a palpable mass or defined mammographic abnormality, the associated breast cancer tends to be a more advanced stage. The chances of underlying multifocal or invasive disease or axillary lymph node positivity are higher than if a mass is absent. The underlying lesion must be removed with a nipple-areolar complex. If wide local excision can be performed with negative margins and acceptable cosmetic results, BCT is the appropriate treatment of choice followed by whole breast radiation therapy (RT).

Women with multicentric cancer or diffuse calcifications should be treated by mastectomy with axillary evaluation, for example, by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Many patients with PDB and a palpable mass are not the candidates for BCT because of the remarkable distance between the primary tumor and the nipple-areolar complex.

The risk of axillary involvement is higher if there is a palpable mass or invasive cancer and need axillary investigation. Patients with DCIS do not require axillary investigation unless the disease is extensive enough to choose mastectomy. If a mastectomy is planned, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is often performed in order to avoid complete axillary lymph node dissection in case an invasive component is identified at final pathology. Patients with clinically suspicious axilla should undergo an initial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy of the palpable axillary nodes; if the disease is confirmed histologically, full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is recommended. In contrast, if the FNA or core biopsy is negative, SLB biopsy should be performed.

Currently, there are no data that the endocrine therapy, including tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, reduce the risk of recurrence of local disease in patients with PDB without an underlying invasive carcinoma or DCIS who are treated with breast-conserving therapy. Recommendations regarding endocrine therapy, as well as other forms of adjuvant systemic therapy such as chemotherapy and trastuzumab, should be based solely upon the characteristics of any associated invasive carcinoma or DCIS. Radiation therapy alone does not always control occult breast cancer; however, it may be used for patients who refuse mastectomy or those who are medically unfit for surgery. Recently, there have been some clinical trials for a procedure called photodynamic therapy for the treatment of mammary and extramammary Paget disease. This procedure involves the use of a drug known as a photosensitizer, along with a special type of light. During this procedure, this drug is injected into the system and absorbed by the affected cells. The drug is activated by the light at a specific wavelength, which destroys the affected cells. Initial results have shown that photodynamic therapy is safe and well-tolerated and, possibly, a less invasive alternative to the surgery. However, the data is limited and more research is needed to determine the effectiveness and long-term safety of the procedure.
