During gestation and the first two weeks that follow fertilization, several cellular divisions occur that lead to blastocyst formation. At the end of the second week, the blastocyte undergoes a process called gastrulation, which involves formation into a stratified structure composed of the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. In the formation of the cervical spine and atlantoaxial joint, mesodermal structures called somites begin to migrate into their mature, functional form as vertebrae.

As the notochord involutes and somites evolve into their mature forms as vertebrae at primary ossification centers. The normal development of the cervical spine in embryogenesis includes the following steps: gastrulation and somatic mesodermal formation, condensation of mesoderm into somites, dermomyotome and sclerotome reorganization, segmentation of somites, chondrification, and ossification of the vertebrae. The axis contains one ossification center for the vertebral body, two for both neural arches, and one for the dens.

These ossification centers of the dens are particularly important since they can be confused as fractures in pediatric patients since the junction between the dens and body of the axis does not complete fusion until about six years of age. The body of the axis and the odontoid process are known to fuse by 4 to 6 years of age and complete development by the age of 25.
