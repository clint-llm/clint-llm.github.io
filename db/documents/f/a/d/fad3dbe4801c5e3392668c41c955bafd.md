Once reperfusion injury has occurred, it can present as acute heart failure, cerebral dysfunction, SIRS (systemic inflammatory response system), and multi-organ failure. The most common presentation of reperfusion in the heart is ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial wall rupture, microvasculature abnormalities, and myocyte death. Myocardial stunning occurs post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is thought to be due to the oxidative stress and high levels of intracellular calcium.

In cases of cerebral ischemic injury, hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct or development of cerebral edema, which is evident by focal neurological deficits and decreased neurology is indicative of reperfusion injury. These changes are usually picked up on repeat CT scans of the brain. With limb ischemia, pain that is out of proportion to the physical findings, decreased pulses, skin changes, and decreased sensations are all indicative of a possible reperfusion injury. Patients can occasionally present with nasal or oral bleeding indicative of deranged coagulation or increased drowsiness or delirium suggestive of possible hepatic and renal shut-down. These are most often seen in cases of multi-organ failure due to reperfusion injury.
