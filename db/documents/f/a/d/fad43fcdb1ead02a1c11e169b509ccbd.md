Cat scratch disease is an illness caused by an intracellular gram-negative rod known as Bartonella henselae. It affects the lymph nodes draining the area where a cat scratch or bite occurs, causing regional lymphadenopathy. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of cat scratch disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify Bartonella henselae as the etiologic agent in cat scratch disease. 
- Describe the pathophysiology of cat scratch disease.
- Review the use of antibiotics in mild to moderate disease and the disseminated form of cat scratch disease.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by cat scratch disease.
