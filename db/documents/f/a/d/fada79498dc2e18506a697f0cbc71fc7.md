The larynx is continuous with pharynx superiorly and the trachea inferiorly. It is comprised of an intricate skeleton of cartilages held together by fibro-elastic membranes. Intrinsic muscles of the larynx moving these cartilages allow it to perform vital functions. Its most fundamental role is as a protective sphincter of the airway, but it also allows effort closure and vocalization. Understanding of the structure and function of the larynx is important for any clinical practitioner as pathology can be life-threatening or have a significant impact on patientsâ€™ quality of life.
