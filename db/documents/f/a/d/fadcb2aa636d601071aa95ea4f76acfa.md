Hemoglobin C is a common hemoglobin variant that has a single amino acid substitution (lysine substituted for the glutamate) in the sixth position of the beta-globin chain. The patients with hemoglobin C trait (HbAC) are phenotypically normal, while patients with hemoglobin C disease (HbCC) may have chronic hemolytic anemia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hemoglobin C disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of hemoglobin C disease.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of hemoglobin C disease.
- Outline the management options available for hemoglobin C disease.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients with hemoglobin C disease.
