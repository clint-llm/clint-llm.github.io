Elderly patients who fall on their shoulders or land on their outstretched arm can sustain proximal humeral fractures.

Children ages three and younger can sustain transphyseal fractures of the distal humerus after a fall or trauma.

Intercondylar fractures at the distal humerus are often treated surgically as well with olecranon osteotomy.
