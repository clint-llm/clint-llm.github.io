Management should be followed primarily by a primary care provider or dermatologist as the mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids, which have many potential side effects. Evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids or other topical immunosuppressives is well documented and supported by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT).
