**General Considerations**

The technical considerations regarding repairing an injured nerve are constantly evolving. Commonly cited factors influencing nerve healing potential following repair include:

- Age: the most important factor. Younger patients have more positive outcomes (compared to adults) and the recovery time is quicker

- Studies have shown that, even in the pediatric population, patients < 6 years of age recovery more quickly compared to their adolescent counterparts

- Level of injury: distal injuries have a better chance of recovery compared to more proximal injuries

- Injury pattern: sharp lacerations/transections do better than crush injuries

- Delay in repair: chronic injuries do poorly

- The technique is critical:

- Secondary tissue damage occurs with excessive handling
- Nerve endings should be properly aligned (and not under tension) during a direct repair

- Excessive suture material used during the repair risks the development of a neuroma at the site of repair

- The general consensus in the literature favors utilizing an epineurial repair

- Epineurial repair ensures the proper orientation of the repair and reduces tension at the repair site


- Traditionally, techniques also included the incorporation of a perineurial repair in addition to an epineurial repair
- Outcome studies comparing epineurial alone versus perineal and epineurial repair techniques often report equivalent results; consideration should be given to excessive suture utilization as this can result in a neuroma at the repair site

**End-to-end Repair**

The gold standard for microsurgical nerve injury reconstruction techniques remains the end-to-end (ETE) direct repair of the nerve stumps without tension. Difficulty with ETE is recognized in the following scenarios:

- Chronicity of the injury (leading to limited nerve stump excursion, neural tissue degeneration, and fibrosis/scarring in the region affected)

- The distance of the nerve injury from its specific muscle targets (i.e. distance from the muscle(s) it innervates)

- Significant gaps separating the injured nerve stumps from each other -- including the surgical inaccessibility of one of the nerve endings

**End-to-side Repair**

End-to-side (ETS) is a technique that can be utilized when the surgeon is concerned regarding the reparability and usability of the injured nerve's proximal stump. There is some literature supporting nerve fiber regeneration and collateral axonal sprouting following ETS repair. However, the efficacy of ETS remains controversial.

ETS is most often given consideration in the following settings:

- Upper extremity nerve injuries

- Facial reanimation

- Nerve reconstruction following tumor surgeries and ablation procedures

- Neuroma formation prevention

**Sutureless Repair Techniques**

Sutureless techniques have been becoming increasingly popular over the last 10 to 15 years. Evolving techniques include:

- Fibrin glue

- Nerve conduits - becoming increasingly popular for larger "gaps" at the nerve injury site

- Conduits are typically polyglycolic acid and collagen-based
- The literature supports conduit use -- relative indications include defects over 8mm, but no greater than 2cm in distance
