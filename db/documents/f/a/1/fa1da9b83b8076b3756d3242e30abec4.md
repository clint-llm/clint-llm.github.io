Concomitant use of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (i.e., macrolide antibiotics) results in higher fentanyl plasma levels and can contribute to fatal respiratory depression. Patients require close monitoring, and the clinician should consider reducing the OTEC dose. Similarly, discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducer medications (i.e., phenytoin) can increase plasma levels of fentanyl, resulting in prolonged OTFC adverse effects. Therefore, patients receiving OTFC and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers must be monitored closely and frequently, along with considering adjusting the dosing of OTFC, as needed.
