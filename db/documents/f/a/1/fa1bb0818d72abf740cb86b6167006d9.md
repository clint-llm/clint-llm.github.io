Female gametogenesis (also referred to as oogenesis) is the process by which diploid (2n) cells undergo cell division through meiosis to form haploid (1n) gametes. A functional understanding of how these haploid cells form in the ovary provides insight into the multitude of pathologies arising from dysfunction during female gametogenesis. The objective of the following article is to discuss the cellular mechanisms behind the formation of haploid gametes, the role and function of haploid gametes formed by female gametogenesis, and the pathophysiology behind the outcomes of incorrect gametogenesis.
