For urgent chest tube placement, care is taken to ensure appropriate skin cleansing, and systemic anti-microbial prophylaxis has been performed. Under emergent conditions, pre-procedural skin cleaning may be abbreviated by pouring a bottle of iodine over the affected area.

Patient preparation with appropriate analgesia and sedation can increase patient comfort. For elective orÂ urgent chest tube placement, consideration should be given for procedural sedation. Discomfort can be further minimized by the liberal use of a local anesthetic while making sure to remain under the toxic limits of the selected agent. Consider utilizing the traditional method of raising a wheal with local anesthetic along the expected incision site, followed by deposition along the planned track, particularly on the periosteum (where nociceptive receptors are present).

Support staff, or the performing provider, should ensure that all equipment has been obtained, tested for functionality, is not expired, and back up equipment is available prior to the start of the procedure.

For trauma patients, the general thought is that all patients should have: IV access, supplemental oxygen with monitoring, hemodynamic monitoring, and advanced airway capability at the bedside.
