Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a spectrum of clinical syndromes characterized by neuronal degeneration involving the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain.

FTD targets brain areas that are responsible for personality, behavior, language learning, motivation, abstract thinking, and executive function. Behavior changes and/or language difficulty are the presenting clinical features followed by loss of executive function and cognitive abilities.
