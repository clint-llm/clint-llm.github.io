The parainfluenza virus is primarily transmitted between people via large-particle aerosols. High quantities of viruses excreted by young children can last on porous surfaces for a duration as long as 10 hours.

Enhanced infection control measures are recommended in places of immunocompromised patient health care if HPIV outbreaks are detected. These measures include strict limits on visitors and patient-to-patient contact, physical distancing, masking of people in contact with HPIV patients, hygienic and cleaning measures of the environmental surfaces. In difficult-to-control outbreaks, screening of asymptomatic patients and staff might be needed.
