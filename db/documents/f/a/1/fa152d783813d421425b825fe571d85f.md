Various systems can regulate cGMP signaling, which leads to vascular smooth muscle (VSM) relaxation in pulmonary arteries. In VSM, cGMP activates type 1 and 2 PKGs. PKG activation promotes calcium-gated potassium channel openings causing relaxation and hyperpolarization. PKG also activates sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic calcium ATPase pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), leading to calcium getting pumped into the SR. As calcium fills, SR extracellular calcium is low. The cumulation of these events means PKG signaling leads to decreased intracellular calcium, thus smooth muscle relaxation. PKG also inhibits Rho-kinase. Rho-kinase inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase. Thus, inhibiting Rho-kinase leads to VSM relaxation.

Based on this signaling model, different signaling nodes might lead to pulmonary hypertension, the opposite of pulmonary relaxation. Free radicals can inhibit the binding of NO to sGC, preventing the production of cGMP, thus leading to PKG not causing relaxation. PDE5 can also degrade cGMP.
