For patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, a systematic laboratory and diagnostic approach is often undertaken when the patient first presents, as the etiology is often unknown. This may include a CBC with differential, blood glucose, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, arterial blood gas, ammonia level, and liver enzymes.

These tests are often followed by specialized testing in consultation with a metabolic specialist. For nonketotic hyperglycinemia, measurement of glycine within the plasma and the cerebral spinal fluid (evaluating for an abnormal CSF-to-plasma glycine ratio), a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (evaluating for diffusion restriction in the infratentorial regions like the posterior limb of the internal capsule, anterior brain stem, posterior tegmental tracts, and cerebellum before the age of 3 months and generalized diffusion restriction of the supratentorial white matter after three months), a brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy, molecular genetic testing, and rarely, analysis of enzymatic activity should be performed, and they can help to establish the diagnosis as well as the extent of the systemic damage.

If the patient has a seizure activity, additional testing may include an electroencephalogram.
