Erlotinib is a reversible first-generation receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (along with gefitinib) acting primarily on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the ErbB receptor family. The drug interacts with both wild-type and mutation EGFR. The ErbB family can form homodimers or heterodimers, which are often implicated in downstream effects and pathogenesis of many types of carcinomas studied in humans. Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) prevent the phosphorylation of their substrate in the cell signaling pathway. EGFR normally plays a role in many cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, and angiogenesis, all of which are hallmarks of cancer.

EGFR mutation in NSCLC is typically an activating mutation. Some patient characteristics that make the presence of EGFR mutation more likely include no history of smoking confirmed adenocarcinoma by histologic analysis, Asian ethnicity, and female sex.
