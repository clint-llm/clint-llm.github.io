The prognosis is good. The maternal and fetal outcomes are favorable when hypotonic labor is recognized early and timely interventions instituted while ensuring close monitoring. The risk of a surgical intervention increases when decreased uterine activity occurs in the presence of a cephalopelvic disproportion, fetal malpositioning, or fetal distress.Â The early decision for cesarean section improves both maternal and fetal outcomes.
