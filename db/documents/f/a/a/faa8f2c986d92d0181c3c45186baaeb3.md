As mentioned in earlier sections, the presentation and prognosis of analgesia-induced nephropathy are variable and unpredictable. Clinicians may expect to regain normal kidney function in most patients who present early in the course of renal involvement. A few individuals will progress to end-stage renal disease and dialysis even after stopping the drug if there is established damage to the renal parenchyma and scarring of the renal tissue.
