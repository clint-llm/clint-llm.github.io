# Continuing Education Activity

Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as lumbar spinal pain of unknown origin either persisting despite surgical intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal pain originally in the same topographical location. The pain may originate after surgery, or the surgery may exacerbate or insufficiently ameliorate existing pain. This activity describes the cause and presentation of failed back surgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of failed back surgery.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with failed back surgery.
- Summarize the treatment for failed back surgery.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by failed back surgery.

# Introduction

Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as “lumbar spinal pain of unknown origin either persisting despite surgical intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal pain originally in the same topographical location.”

# Etiology

Failed back surgery syndrome is a condition with a complex etiology and many factors that predispose patients towards chronic pain. These predictive factors generally divide into preoperative (patient) factors, intraoperative factors, and postoperative factors.

Preoperative patient factors associated with failed back surgery syndrome include anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric comorbidities, obesity, smoking, the presence of litigation or worker’s compensation claims, and physical or radiologic findings such as stenosis, fibrosis, and disc herniation.

Intraoperative risks for developing failed back surgery syndrome include operating at either the wrong vertebral level or operating at a single level while the origin of pain spans several levels, thus providing insufficient pain relief.

Long-term complications of the surgery, either avoidable or inevitable, may also lead to the development of failed back surgery syndrome in some patients. Surgery may exacerbate existing symptoms or cause new symptoms by inducing spinal stenosis, spinal instability, epidural fibrosis, or disruption of adjacent discs.

# Epidemiology

Estimates of the percentage of adults who experience chronic lower back pain during their lifetime range from 51% to 84%.

# Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of failed back surgery syndrome is unclear and is attributable to several factors. Lateral stenosis of the foramina has been identified as the most common structural abnormality identified in patients with FBSS. However, other common pathologies in failed back surgery syndrome patients include painful disc degeneration, disc herniation, neuropathic pain, and pseudoarthrosis.

# History and Physical

An accurate and thorough history and physical examination of patients with persistent pain after lower back surgery are crucial for correct diagnosis. The character and location of the patient’s pain should be identified and compared to presurgical pain; lack of immediate pain relief may indicate operation at the wrong level whereas new-onset pain may indicate surgically-induced nerve damage.

Physical exam for the failed back surgery syndrome patient is generally not useful for identifying a specific etiology of pain, although the practitioner may be able to elicit several suggestive findings.

# Evaluation

X-rays are a simple and inexpensive first imaging evaluation for suspected failed back surgery syndrome. X-rays are useful for detecting vertebral and sacroiliac defects and/or misalignment and are superior to MRIs for the detection of spondylolisthesis.

MRI with and without gadolinium contrast continues to be the gold standard imaging modality for failed back surgery syndrome due to its excellent ability to detect soft tissue abnormalities such as epidural fibrosis and disc herniation.

Other tests may be used to elucidate the etiology of failed back surgery syndrome and differentiate it from other causes of lower back pain. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein may be used to evaluate for possible infection, especially in patients with constitutional symptoms or a predisposition towards infection.

# Treatment / Management

Therapies for the treatment of failed back surgery syndrome broadly split into conservative (physical therapy or medication) and aggressive (interventional or surgical) management. Conservative management should always be the first option before invasive techniques in patients without indications for emergency surgery.

Studies of conservative treatment specifically for failed back surgery syndrome are rare, and the studies that do exist are often contradictory.

Strong Level II (small randomized controlled trial [RCT]) evidence exists for the efficacy of active physical therapy in patients with gabapentinoids.

Interventional treatment for failed back surgery syndrome is highly dependent on the sub-etiology of the patient’s pain and the detection of specific deformities on imaging. If facet joint arthropathy is identified, procedures such as medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation can be performed to relieve the pathology. Radiofrequency ablation must be performed in a continuous mode with a large-bore needle placed parallel to the nerve to maximize the chances of interrupting a significant segment of the nerve and thus achieve prolonged pain relief. Likewise, adhesiolysis has been shown to be an effective treatment for FBSS where epidural fibrosis is a major contributing factor.

Neuromodulatory therapies for failed back surgery syndrome, such as spinal cord stimulation (SCS), involve the implantation of a stimulatory device to mediate the patient’s pain. Strong evidence from large randomized trials exists for the superiority of SCS over conservative management and repeated surgery for FBSS.

Lastly, reoperation may be an option for patients with clearly identified pathologies that may be relieved with surgery. As noted above, reoperation generally correlates with inferior outcomes and higher morbidity compared to implantable technologies such as SCS. However, the presence of certain symptoms, such as bowel/bladder impairment, motor weakness, or neural deficit warrants immediate surgical intervention.

# Differential Diagnosis

In a non-operated back the most common cause of pain is discogenic pain syndrome followed by facet and sacroiliac joint related pain, and with careful testing, the etiology of low back pain can be identified or attributed in the majority of patients.

# Prognosis

Failed back surgery syndrome has proven to be both a difficult condition to experience for patients and a challenging condition to treat for clinicians. Compared to patients with other chronic pain syndromes, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia, FBSS patients have been shown to exhibit a lower quality of life scores and higher amounts of pain, unemployment, opioid use, and disability.

Unsurprisingly, treatment choice has been found to affect outcomes in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. Stronger evidence exists for favorable results in patients treated with SCS.

# Complications

In addition to intractable low back pain, patients with failed back surgery syndrome often suffer from associated disorders. Psychiatric comorbidities are common in FBSS patients and correlate with worse pain outcomes. A survey of failed back surgery syndrome patients by Long and colleagues found that 67 of 78 patients with FBSS suffered from depression, with the vast majority experiencing an onset of depressive symptoms following the initial onset of pain.

Patients with failed back surgery syndrome may also experience complications from attempted treatment of their pain. Prolonged NSAID use has significant adverse effects on gastrointestinal and renal health. Opioids also have significant addictive potential; one study found that opioid overdose was the most common cause of death following lumbar fusion surgery.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Due to the noted difficulty of treating failed back surgery syndrome, avoiding the initial development of pain may be the most effective way of reducing the condition’s burden on the general public. Reasonable non-operative measures including minimally invasive interventional treatments must be tried when indicated, before committing to an operative course. Poor selection of candidates for surgery or surgical technique is a common feature in the development of FBSS.

Patients should receive proper education from a multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses, and physical therapists on possible risks and complications of lower back surgery before and after the operation. One study found that patients cited proper pre-procedure education and realistic setting of expectations as factors that increased their opinion of their surgeon even in spite of the development of chronic post-surgical pain.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

interprofessional pain clinics are the gold standard in the setting of treatment for patients with complex chronic pain syndromes such as failed back surgery syndrome. The interprofessional care team in these clinics consists of pain physicians, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, physical therapists, pharmacists, and occupational therapists. The integration of different members of the healthcare team results in close communication between experts in distinct methodologies of treating chronic pain and promotes a biopsychosocial approach to the patient’s pain.
