Familial short stature (FSS) is the condition characterized by the final adult height below the third percentile of the mean for the patient's age, gender, and population and is in line with the parental heights. Such patients are otherwise healthy and have normal growth velocity and bone age. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of FSS and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the advances in the pathophysiology of familial short stature (FSS).
- Outline the evaluation of FSS and distinguish it from other causes of short stature.
- Summarize the management strategies of familial short stature.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by familial short stature.
