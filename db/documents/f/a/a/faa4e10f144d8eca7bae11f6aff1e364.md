The main factors affecting prognosis in patients with Pancoast tumor who are undergoing trimodal treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) are

1. T-status of the tumor (worse for T4 tumors)

2. Response to induction treatment (better for complete responders)

3. Completeness of resection (dependent on T-status of tumor and response of the tumor to induction treatment)

Longer duration of disease, the presence of Horner syndrome, the extension of tumor into the base of neck/vertebral bodies/great vessels, the involvement of mediastinal lymph nodes, and resection of the tumor by a wide wedge resection are all associated with a worse prognosis.

Tumor burden control by surgery and chemo-radiation, pain relief after treatment, and weight loss of less than 5% are suggestive of a better prognosis.
