A digital rectal examination is mandatory as the first diagnostic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of fecal impaction. When a rectal exam does not reveal fecal impaction or hard fecal masses in the rectum, the possibility of fecal impaction more proximal in the bowel or other causes, such as strictures or volvulus of the colon, should be considered. The most useful and commonly used radiological imaging for evaluation is a CT abdomen with oral or rectal contrast. A plain x-ray of the abdomen can, at times, reveal fecal overloading of the colon with colonic distention of the in the segment proximal to the region of fecal impaction. Rarely, a contrast enema or sigmoidoscopy are indicated in a patient who has no history suggestive of the colonic disease.
