As PET scans use small amounts of radioactive compounds, there is a minimal amount of radiation exposure. The concern occurs with multiple repeated scans. Radiation exposure is of most concern in pregnant women and very young children. Following the radiotracer injection, patients may experience some discomfort at the injection site and bruising from the intravenous cannulation process.

Radiotracer extravasation at the site can also occasionally happen and lead to erythema and/or swelling. Other very uncommon findings experienced by patients may be stomach discomfort, nausea, or headaches, although the vast majority of patients do not feel anything at all. Anxiety and claustrophobia can be encountered in some patients and may require anxiolytics or sedatives in order to proceed with the PET scan.

One should pay great attention to the timing of the sedation in relation to the timing of the radiotracer injection in order not to affect the radiopharmaceutical biodistribution. This would then lead to inconclusive or erroneous interpretations.
