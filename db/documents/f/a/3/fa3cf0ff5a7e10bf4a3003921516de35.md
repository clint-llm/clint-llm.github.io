Renin is an aspartyl protease. Its gene is located on chromosome 1, containing ten exons and nine introns. The gene is responsible for the expression of 406 amino acids, which include pre and pro segments consisting of 20-23 and 43-47 amino acids, respectively. Renin is initially synthesized from pre-pro-renin. Following the expression of pre-pro-renin from the ribosomes of the RER, cleavage of the pre-segment by lytic enzymes immediately occurs to form pro-renin. Once stimulated, pro-renin then transfers to the Golgi body, where it is cleaved and modified into renin in preparation for exocytosis via secretory vesicles.
