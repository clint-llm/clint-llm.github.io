Urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine.

Several different types of urinary incontinence exist, including stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, functional incontinence, mixed incontinence, and overflow incontinence. In most cases, urologic or gynecologic assessment is not necessary during the initial evaluation, but reversible causes should be ruled out. The management of urinary incontinence depends upon which type of incontinence is present and the severity of the symptoms.
