Complications depend mostly on the underlying disease causing protein-losing enteropathy. Patients with Inflammatory bowel disease can develop colon cancer, anemia, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and many other complications. PLE due to ulcerative diseases can have a perforation of ulcer and peritonitis. Patients with Clostridium difficile colitis can develop toxic megacolon. Patients can develop a deficiency of micronutrients and vitamins (particularly fat-soluble vitamins). Due to the loss of immunoglobulins and lymphocytes, patients get prone to recurrent and opportunistic infections.
