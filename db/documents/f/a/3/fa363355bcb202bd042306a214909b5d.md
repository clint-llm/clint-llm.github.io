Encephalopathy is described clinically as an alteration in generalized attention, cognition, or consciousness. It is a form of diffuse cerebral dysfunction with varying severities. The acute form of encephalopathy can range from mild confusion and delirium to coma. In the more chronic, slowly progressive, or static conditions of encephalopathy, there may be retention of attention initially with loss of cognitive capacity.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is useful in evaluating patients with acute and chronic encephalopathies. The primary role of EEG in this setting is to rule out seizures as a cause of altered mental status. Various patterns can be seen in patients with encephalopathy. Abnormal patterns, especially in an acute to subacute onset, are sensitive to encephalopathy but not specific to diagnosing causes. Most encephalopathies are associated with the slowing of dominant rhythms, as well as background activity. This is most likely dueÂ to the involvement of both the cortical neurons and the subcortical white matter dysfunction. Overall, EEG is useful for assessing the degree of cerebral dysfunction in encephalopathy and monitoring the changes along with clinical progression.
