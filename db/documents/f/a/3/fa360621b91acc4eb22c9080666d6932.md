There are two common causes of aortic stenosis (AS), calcified (age-related) aortic stenosis and congenital bicuspid aortic valves. Rarely aortic stenosis and/or aortic regurgitation can be a result of rheumatic heart disease, although this is more commonly a disease of the mitral valve and generally seen in developing countries. Calcified aortic stenosis is by far the most common etiology and is believed to occur via progressive endothelial damage over many years.

Aortic regurgitation can occur in a chronic or acute setting. Causes of acute aortic regurgitation include type A aortic dissection extending to the valve or damage to leaflets from infectious or noninfectious endocarditis. The same pathologies most commonly cause chronic aortic regurgitation in developing countries as aortic stenosis, calcific disease, congenital bicuspid valve issues, and Marfan syndrome. Other less common etiologies include complications following percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasties and transcatheter aortic valve replacements (TAVR), as well as a slew of inflammatory disorders including but not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Takayasu arteritis. The most prevalent etiology of chronic aortic regurgitation in developing countries is rheumatic heart disease.
