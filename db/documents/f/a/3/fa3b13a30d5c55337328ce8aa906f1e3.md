Granuloma annulare (GA) is a cutaneous granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common non-infectious granulomatous disease. The disease is benign and often self-limited. Granuloma annulare usually presents as erythematous plaques or papules arranged in an annular configuration on the upper extremities. In addition to the more common presentation, termed localized granuloma annulare, other clinical variants of granuloma annulare include generalized, perforating, patch, and subcutaneous.
