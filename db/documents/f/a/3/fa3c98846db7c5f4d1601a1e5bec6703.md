The diagnosis and management of hyperaldosteronism are complex and best done by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, pathologist, internist, endocrinologist, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and a surgeon. Surgery is the preferred treatment in primary hyperaldosteronism caused by unilateral disease. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is preferred as it is associated with fewer complications and a shorter hospital stay as compared to open adrenalectomy. Complete adrenalectomy is preferred to partial adrenalectomy due to greater efficacy and resolution of symptoms. For nonsurgical candidates, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were preferred as a medical therapy.

If the patient has bilateral hyperaldosteronism, then medical therapy is preferred. The drug of choice is spironolactone. The pharmacist should assist the clinical team and educate the patient on the importance of drug compliance. In addition, the patient needs to be told that there is a small risk of developing gynecomastia.

The primary care providers, nurses, and dietitians should educate the patient on the importance of salt restriction,Â alcohol cessation, smoking cessation, maintenance of ideal body weight, and aerobic exercise. Follow up is necessary as the risk of adverse cardiac events is high in these patients.

Only a team approach with close communication between the members can the morbidity of hyperaldosteronism be lowered.
