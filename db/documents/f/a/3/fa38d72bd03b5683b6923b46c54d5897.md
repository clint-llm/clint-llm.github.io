A cephalohematoma is an accumulation of blood under the scalp, specifically in the sub-periosteal space. During the birthing process, shearing forces on the skull and scalp result in the separation of the periosteum from the underlying calvarium resulting in the subsequent rupture of blood vessels. This activity reviews the workup of cephalohematomas and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of cephalohematoma.
- Describe the clinical presentation of cephalohematoma. 
- Summarize the treatment of cephalohematoma. 
- Outline the evaluation of cephalohematomas and describe inter-professional management of this condition.
