Mandibular body fractures usually occur between the distal aspect of the canine and a hypothetical line that corresponds to the region of anterior attachment of the masseter muscle. They may be classified based on the anatomic location, the direction of the fracture line, position of teeth relative to the fracture, and favorableness.

These forces that render the fracture unfavorable are exerted by various muscles such as masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid muscle. These muscles distract the proximal bony segment in the superomedial direction. Moreover, two additional muscles (mylohyoid and anterior belly of digastrics) may also play a role in displacing the segments in the posterior and inferior direction.
