In the acute phase of HUS, specimens of the kidney show microvascular injury characterized by deposition of microthrombi along with detached and swollen glomerular endothelial cells associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. Similar changes have been described in other organs. This shows that HUS is a multisystem disease characterized by endothelial cell injury.
