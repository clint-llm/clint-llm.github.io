Dentists commonly inject the superior and inferior alveolar nerves with local anesthetic for dental procedures. The knowledge of the location of these nerves will guide a successful nerve block. But it is crucial to take into consideration the many variations in the nerves. If the classic approach to the nerve block is insufficient, the operator should consider that maybe there is a slight variation in the location of the alveolar nerves.

Dental pain can highlight the importance of the sensory innervation of the alveolar nerves. When a tooth or gingivae is damaged, that region will send pain signals to the brain'. This is a common presentation seen in patients with cavities, cracked teeth, dental abscesses, and oral ulcers.
