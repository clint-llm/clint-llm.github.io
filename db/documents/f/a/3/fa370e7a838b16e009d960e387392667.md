Patients presenting to family physicians with symptoms like palpitations or skipped beats require detailed assessment. Although various cardiac etiologies can cause palpitations, their association with non-cardiac causes like anemia, fever, or drug use or even anxiety in otherwise healthy individuals should also remain in view. Reassurance and lifestyle modification is the mainstay of management in benign occurring VPCs. The patients should also undergo screening for anxiety or panic disorder with the help of a questionnaire. Education of patients about when to seek advice in case of a worsening of symptoms is essential. With the help of an interdisciplinary approach, patients will have the chance to interact with multiple members of the patient care team. Relaying changes in the regimen to the patients is a vital aspect of educating the patients. It should be emphasized to keep a scheduled follow-up of the appointments. If warranted, patients should receive counsel and education regarding the benefits of quitting smoking and losing weight. With the help of written pamphlets or illustrations, patient education should be to enhance the patient's learning.
