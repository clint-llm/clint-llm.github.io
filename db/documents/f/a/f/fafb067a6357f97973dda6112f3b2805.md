Tympanic membrane perforation is when there is a tear in the tympanic membrane leading to a connection between the external auditory canal and the middle ear. This can be caused by infection, trauma, or rapid changes in pressure leading to sudden otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus, and vertigo. Most perforations resolve spontaneously without complications; however, some can become chronic and lead to complications such as hearing loss, chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, and mastoiditis. This article reviews the evaluation and treatment of tympanic membrane perforation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tympanic membrane perforation. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the patient with tympanic membrane perforation.
- Review the management options available for tympanic membrane perforation.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tympanic membrane perforation and improve outcomes.
