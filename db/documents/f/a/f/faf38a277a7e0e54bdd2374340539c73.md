Wet ARMD is differentiated from early or dry ARMD by the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), where new blood vessels from the choroid penetrate through the Bruch membrane and proliferate either between Bruch’s membrane and the RPE or in the subretinal space.

- VEGF accumulation, particularly the VEGF (165) isoform

- Growth of new blood vessels with the proliferation of fibrous tissue

- Leakage of proteins and lipids from the new vessels

- Hemorrhage from the fragile new vessels

- Fibrovascular scar formation, with the death of the neurosensory retina and vision loss
