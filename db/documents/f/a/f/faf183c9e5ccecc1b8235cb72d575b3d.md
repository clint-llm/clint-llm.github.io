Lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in the United States. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women, accounting for approximately a quarter of all cancer deaths. Lung cancer is histologically divided into 2 main types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC comprises about 15% of lung cancer while NSCLC comprises approximately 85%. Since the late 1980s, there has been a decline in the incidence of lung cancer coincident with a decline in smoking, the leading cause of lung cancer. Current treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. The high incidence and prevalence of lung cancer provide a foundation for new insights into the role of public health interventions, genetics, and novel treatment modalities.
