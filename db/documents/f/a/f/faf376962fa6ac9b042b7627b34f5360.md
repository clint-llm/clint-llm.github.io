Geriatric trauma is on the rise and often presents in sinister ways. Because of advanced age, a decline in organ function and limited reserve, geriatric patients are more likely to die compared to younger people when sustaining the same type of trauma. Thus, assessment and treatment of the geriatric trauma patient must be conducted by taking into consideration of their unique physiology and associated co-morbidity. Because geriatric trauma can have diverse presentations, an interprofessional approach is necessary. Often geriatric abuse can present with somatic and neuropsychiatric features, and the key is to be aware of this pathology. The majority of geriatric patients can heal after trauma, but the healing period is long. Many often remain in the hospital for prolonged periods and even when discharged tend to have a residual loss in function. As the care of the geriatric trauma patient improves, it is hoped that the morbidity and mortality will also decrease. Meanwhile, the onus is on healthcare workers to recognize early signs of injury in this very vulnerable population.
