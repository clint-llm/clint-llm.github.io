Reproductive endocrinology and infertility as a field are highly interdisciplinary. It requires a team consisting of physicians, nurses, embryologists, and other personnel in order to provide successful treatment to patients. Good communication among staff and patients are critical in helping the patient navigate the complexities of IVF treatment. Furthermore, it is important to note the increased psychological stress that many patients face when going through IVF. Patients often do not have adequate emotional support from their close social contacts, and research suggests such lack of support leads to lower conception rates and one of the main reasons for attrition from IVF treatment.
