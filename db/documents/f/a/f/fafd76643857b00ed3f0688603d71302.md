The cranial nerve examination is a detailed procedure that requires practice and vigilance to master. Deficits found during the cranial nerve examination may require further evaluation and involvement of otolaryngology, radiology, and neurophysiologic testing professionals. Instances such as intracranial hemorrhage, coma, or stroke necessitate serial testing as part of the overall neurologic examination to evaluate for worsening or progression of pathology.

Assistance from the nursing andÂ intensive care unit staff is vital in discovering changes in conditions that require further evaluation or urgent intervention. An interprofessional approach is suggested to lower morbidity, reduce unnecessary imaging, and improve outcomes.
