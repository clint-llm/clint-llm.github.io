Age is a common contraindication to crutch use.  The very old and very young may not possess the needed torso strength and coordination to use crutches successfully.  Any musculoskeletal or neurological condition that reduces the mobility, strength, and sensation can potentially be a contraindication to the short term or long-term use of crutches.
