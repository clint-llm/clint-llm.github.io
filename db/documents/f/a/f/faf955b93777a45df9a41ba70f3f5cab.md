The prognosis will depend on the etiology and the severity of the airway obstruction.

Acute onset supraglottic airway obstruction must be promptly recognized and treated to achieve the best overall prognosis. If the symptoms are mild and recognized early, the patient may be able to protect their own airway while appropriate medical treatment is begun (such as steroids for an inflammatory process, or antibiotics for an infection. If symptoms are evolving or severe, the clinician must have a very low threshold to secure the airway via endotracheal intubation or surgical airway to avoid disaster. Once a secure airway is obtained, the long-term prognosis will depend on treatment of the underlying pathology.

Chronic and gradual supraglottic airway obstruction can have a more mixed prognosis, again depending on the underlying etiology. Laryngomalacia in young children frequently has a very good prognosis, and may not require intervention if symptoms are mild. Supraglottic obstruction from neoplasm will depend on the histology and stage for overall prognosis, which supraglottic scarring after radiation therapy or after inhalational injury can have long-lasting effects, and potentially poor outcomes due to recurrent and refractory stenosis.
