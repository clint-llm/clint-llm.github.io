Patients with cerebellar dysfunction will often present signs that the patient will notice in the daily activities. Incoordination of hand or foot should prompt a patient to seek medical evaluation. Most cerebellar lesions are unpreventable, but those patients with arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and untreated or uncontrolled high blood triglycerides****should seek medical treatment and normalize them. All of them are risk factors for vertebrobasilar atherosclerosis and strokes.
