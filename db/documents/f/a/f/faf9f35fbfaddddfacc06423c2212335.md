**CAMT**

CAMT is an autosomal recessive disease with two main types described by Ballmaier et al. in 2001.

Type 1 results from a stop codon or frameshift mutation, causing a loss of the intracellular domain of the MPL receptor with complete loss of function of the receptor. This results in early progression to bone marrow failure, with the mean age being one year and 11 months.

Type 2 results from a splicing defect or amino acid substitution, which can affect the MPL receptor's glycosylation and result in an inability to react with thrombopoietin (THPO). These mutations can also cause a loss of hydrogen bonds within the MPL receptor, making it unstable. However, some residual receptor function exists. Bone marrow failure usually occurs at age 3 to 6 years, with the mean age being five years.

However, alternate etiologies have been proposed, including an X-linked variety of CAMT, a homozygous mutation in thrombopoietin, an anti-HLA A2 antibody, and some rare mutations in genes besides c-Mpl which could interfere with MPL receptor signaling and lead to CAMT.

**AAMT**

AAMT can be considered as a heterogeneous group of disorders leading to a common downstream clinical manifestation. Three mechanisms have been proposed:

- Suppression of maturation of megakaryocytes by an exogenous agent: AAMT is seen in association with Ebstein Barr virus (EBV), parvovirus B19, hepatitis C virus, interferon therapy, cytomegalovirus, benzene exposure, alcohol abuse, vitamin B12 deficiency, and radioiodine therapy.

- Suppression of megakaryocyte maturation by endogenous stimuli due to antibody-mediated or T-cell autoimmunity: AAMT has been seen in association with thymoma with a more aggressive disease course, adult-onset Still disease, eosinophilic fasciitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, Graves' disease, and hyperestrogenic states.

- An early manifestation of a stem cell abnormality: AAMT has been described as a precursor to acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
