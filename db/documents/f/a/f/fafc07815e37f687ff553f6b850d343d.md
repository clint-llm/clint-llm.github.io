Primary congenital milia are so common that they could be considered as a typical variation, occurring in up to 40% to 50% of healthy full-term neonates. However, milia may be delayed in premature neonates. Primary and secondary milia occur without significant racial or sex differences; only milia en plaque lesions are more common in females. Moreover, milia can affect persons of any age but is most commonly seen in neonates with the congenital form.
