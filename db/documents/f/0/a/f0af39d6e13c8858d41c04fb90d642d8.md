Once harvested, the graft should be trimmed of all underlying adipose and hair structures, if present. The graft is then secured with simple interrupted sutures, and the donor site is repaired with a layered closure. Particularly on the nose, the surgical defect may be partially closed, taking a Burow's triangle of adjacent skin to facilitate tissue movement. The Burow's triangle of skin can then be used as a FTSG to repair the remainder of the defect.
