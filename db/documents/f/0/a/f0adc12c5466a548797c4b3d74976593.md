VCM exhibits not only acute toxic effects but also chronic carcinogenic effects in those with ongoing significant occupational exposures. VCM is readily absorbed across all body compartments exhibiting acute central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory effects. At high concentrations, death can occur due to CNS and respiratory depression due to a general anesthetic effect.

The chronic hepatic mutagenic effects of VCM on hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells are propagated by metabolic activation of VCM to form chloroethylene oxide which subsequently binds deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), thereby exhibiting effects on proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor gene expression. This effect demonstrates causal links to the development of hepatic angiosarcoma, a rare, aggressive cancer, in humans as well as in animal models.
