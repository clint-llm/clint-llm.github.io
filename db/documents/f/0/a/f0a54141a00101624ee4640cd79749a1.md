Once the patient is admitted, the following care is necessary:

- Do not agitate the patient

- Administer humidified oxygen

- Allow the patient to choose the position which is most comfortable

- Avoid the use of inhalers and sedatives

- Be prepared for a sudden worsening of the clinical condition

- Always have a tracheostomy cut down set at the bedside

With appropriate treatment, most patients improve within 48-72 hours but antibiotics are still required for 7 days. Only afebrile patients should be discharged home.
