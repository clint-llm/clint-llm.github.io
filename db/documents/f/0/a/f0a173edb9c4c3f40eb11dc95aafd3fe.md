The findings from the clinical history and examination of patients with bisphosphonate toxicity depend on the complications that arise. A thorough history of exposure, along with the physical examination, will assist in decision-making for further evaluation and treatment. Given the diversity of the complications, a detailed review of systems helps identify the organs involved.

**Systemic Adverse Effects**

Flu-like symptoms have been observed with intravenous bisphosphonate use.

**Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects**

There are several commonly encountered adverse effects from the oral use of bisphosphonates. Erosive esophagitis can be seen and is thought to be related to suboptimal oral administration of bisphosphonates. Patients should be advised to ingest the drug with a full glass of water and then maintain an upright position for 30-60 minutes. The association between bisphosphonate use and nausea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain appears to be weaker, and the occurrence of any of these symptoms should prompt further evaluation for underlying GI conditions before discontinuation of the bisphosphonates. Proton pump inhibitors can be used to reduce these adverse effects.

**Hypocalcemia**

Several conditions increase the risk of hypocalcemia during bisphosphonates use. Vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and hypomagnesemia are all predisposing factors.

**Ocular Complications**

Even at the recommended dosing, pamidronate can cause scleritis, uveitis, and conjunctivitis.

**Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)**

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a condition characterized by the destruction of bone tissue in the jaw due to a lack of blood supply associated with infection from oral flora.

There are 2 main factors that influence the likelihood of developing ONJ. The first one is the type and total dose of bisphosphonates. The more potent the drug and longer the drug is used, the higher the risk of ONJ. Also, the risk is 15-fold higher, with intravenous bisphosphonates compared to oral bisphosphonates.

Pain and exposed bone are the most common presenting features.

**Subtrochanteric Femoral Fractures**

Although not clearly shown in clinical trials, several case reports describe the association between bisphosphonates and subtrochanteric femoral fractures. These typically occur either spontaneously or following low-impact trauma. They are located in the proximal or mid-femoral diaphysis, and they are seen in patients who are on long term treatment with bisphosphonates. They should be suspected in patients who report vague femoral pain or weakness. Recent reports, however, refute the association with bisphosphonate use. Rather they propose that subtrochanteric femoral fractures are an uncommon type of osteoporotic fracture or a manifestation of rare metabolic bone disorders, such as adult hypophosphatasia. Imaging helps diagnose this condition and referral to a metabolic bone disease specialist may be useful.
