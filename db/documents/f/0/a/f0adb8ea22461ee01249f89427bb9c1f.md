Reactive follicles present in MALToma as in a normal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. These follicles become colonized by neoplastic cells. The involved tissue usually has a polymorphous infiltrate of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and marginal zone B cells. Sometimes these clones have large centroblast-like cells. These cells have large nuclei and scant cytoplasm.
