Chiari I malformation is the most common type and occurs in approximately 0.5 to 3.5% of the general population with a slight female predominance (1.3:1).

Chiari II occurs in 0.44/1000 births without gender predominance but can have a decreased incidence with folate replacement therapy by the mother in utero.

The remaining Chiari malformations are much rarer. Chiari III is the most common of these other variants, consisting of 1-4.5% of all Chiari malformations.
