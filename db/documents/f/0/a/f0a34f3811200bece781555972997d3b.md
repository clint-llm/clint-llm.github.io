Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation cause most cases of sudden cardiac death, with an estimated rate of 300,000 deaths each year in the United States.

Ventricular tachycardia is much more common in the setting of acute coronary syndrome, and around 5Â to 10% of the patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction are found to have ventricular arrhythmias within the first few days of the presentation.

Idiopathic ventricular tachycardia is less common, and it is estimated to have an incidence of around 15 per 100,100 individuals in the general population. Its incidence increases with age, and there is no difference between men and women. The incidence of idiopathic VT has increased over the last two decades, mainly because of early diagnosis and increased awareness. The age at the diagnosis of idiopathy VT varies from 2nd decade to the 70th decade, but the mean age at the time of diagnosis is reported as 52 years in one study.
