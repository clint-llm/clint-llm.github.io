The retroperitoneum houses the kidneys, just below the diaphragm. The left kidney is usually below the 11th rib extending to L3 while the right kidney is slightly lower between the 12th rib and L3. The lower positioning is due to its placement beneath the liver. Both the left and right kidneys sit on the respective psoas major and quadratus lumborum muscles.
