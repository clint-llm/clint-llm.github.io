Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a binocular vision disorder characterized by difficulty maintaining fusion while looking at a near target due to a tendency of the eyes to drift outwards. Commonly associated symptoms of CI include asthenopia (eye strain), diplopia, headaches, blurred vision, movement of print while reading, and difficulty with reading comprehension. Other notable symptoms exhibited after short periods of reading or prolonged near work include sleepiness and the inability to concentrate.
