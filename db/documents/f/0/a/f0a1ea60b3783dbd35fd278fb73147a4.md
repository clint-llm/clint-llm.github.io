**Team-Based In-situ simulation**

In situ simulation (ISS) can improve team performance and highlight the need for changes in systems.

**Streamlining Protocols**

Healthcare simulation offers an opportunity to streamline protocols to improve patient care. A simulated patient or mannequin can be used as a prop in the workflow to highlight deficiencies. For example, Ajmi and colleagues used simulation to reduce door to needle time in stroke patients.

**Patient outcomes**

It is challenging to link simulation efforts to quality-based patient outcomes. Studying simulation-related patient outcomes is complicated by multiple confounders. One prospective study of in situ to improve arrhythmia detection in the ED increased rates of detection from 5 to 55%.

Outcomes have also been demonstrated in procedural simulation training. A study comparing residents trained using simulation-based education and those without showed that those receiving simulation-based training had fewer needle passes, arterial punctures, catheter adjustments, and overall higher success rates for catheter insertion.
