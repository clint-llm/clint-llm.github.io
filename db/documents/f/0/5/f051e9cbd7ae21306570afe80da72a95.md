- The underlying pathogenesis of LS includes an infiltrate of activated T cells releasing interleukin 4 (IL 4) and transforming growth factor β (TGF β). So, these cytokines activate fibroblasts producing significantly altered collagen leading to fibrosis. Besides, the pathogenesis includes vascular damage by the decrease in the number of capillaries.

- Interleukin 1 (IL 1) and interleukin one receptor antagonist (IL 1ra) may also be included in the pathogenesis of lichen sclerosus as well as increased number of monoclonal T lymphocyte CD4 +, lymphocyte T dendritic CD1a + cells, macrophages, mast cells, and decreased number of T lymphocyte CD3 +.

- Another hypothesis has been suggested such as an increased number of circulating IgG autoantibodies targeting extracellular matrix 1 (ECM 1) protein leading to widespread deposition of hyaline material in the dermis.
