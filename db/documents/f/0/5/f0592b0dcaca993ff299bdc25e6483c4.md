Entomophthoramycotina is differentiated from other fungi by their characteristic hyphal morphology. Hyphae are broad, thin-walled, ribbon-like, and mostly aseptate with right or wide-angle branching. The inflammatory reaction seen has a predominance of lymphocytes, plasma cells, epithelioid cells, multinucleate giant cells, and histiocytes. The Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon can be a histological finding seen in entomophthoromycosis, eosinophilic hyaline material around hyphae in hematoxylin eosin-stained sections. This finding is not pathognomic of entomophthoromycosis as this can also be seen in other infections such as sporotrichosis, blastomycosis, and schistosomiasis. Histologically there is no evidence of angioinvasion, necrosis, or tissue infarction.
