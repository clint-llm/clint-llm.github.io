Radiation therapy is recommended in the following situations:

- Early-stage (stage I or II): Radiation therapy is given alone or in combination with chemotherapy.

- Advanced and aggressive lymphomas: Usually, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. However, radiation can be employed for palliation purposes, e.g., pain and lymphadenopathy causing urinary/gastrointestinal tract obstruction.

Radiation therapies are given for several weeks and are mostly given five days a week if given for treatment. Palliative radiation is usually shorter.
