The innervation of the foot involves two terminal branches of the tibial nerve, including the medial plantar nerve and the lateral plantar nerve. The medial plantar nerve innervates the abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, flexor hallucis brevis, and the first lumbrical. The lateral plantar nerve supplies all of the other foot muscles and has a superficial and deep branch. The superficial branch provides muscular and cutaneous innervation, while the deep branch only provides muscular innervation.
