Kidney innervation consists of both afferent and efferent nerves, of which the efferent is strictly sympathetic. These nerves make up the renal plexus, and receive inputs from the celiac and aorticorenal plexuses as well as the least splanchnic nerves. The least splanchnic nerve is primarily responsible for the afferent signaling from the kidney to the brain. The least splanchnic nerve also carries visceral efferent fibers.

Sympathetic input to the organ is brought through visceral efferent fibers and is responsible for stimulating Beta-1-adrenergic receptors in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. This stimulation leads to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS), contributing to the kidney's ability to regulate systemic blood pressure. It is important to note that these nerves are not the exclusive mechanism for blood pressure regulation in the kidney. Baroreceptor response and control of NaCl concentration by macula densa cells are hormonal methods of blood pressure regulation in the kidney.
