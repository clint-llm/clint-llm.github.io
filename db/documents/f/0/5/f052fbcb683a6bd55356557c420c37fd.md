Care coordination between physicians at emergent and urgent care facilities, primary care physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and physical or occupational therapists is key to improved patient outcomes with medial epicondylar fractures. Supervised active range of motion programs prescribed post-intervention, whether nonoperative or operative treatment is initialed, help protect and preserve functionality. Physical therapists and physicians working together help facilitate and execute these exercise programs.

Athletes with a history of elbow injuries require participation in a structured rehabilitation exercise program. An interprofessional team consists of the orthopedic clinician and surgeon, nurse, physical therapist, and coordination with the patient. Types and frequency of practice sessions are gradually managed as a return to sport and play is determined in conjunction with both physician and physical therapist.
