Contraindications to gliptins include type 1 diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis.Â Sitagliptin is contraindicated in individuals who are sensitive to the drug or its components. Caution is necessary when using gliptins in patients with a history of pancreatitis; it would be reasonable to discontinue these drugs if pancreatitis is suspected.

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal insufficiency taking sitagliptin and saxagliptin as these drugs undergo renal excretion; failure to adjust the dose could increase the chance of hypoglycemia.
