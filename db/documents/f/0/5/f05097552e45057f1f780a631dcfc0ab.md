Drug metabolism can affect the plasma concentrations of drugs. For example, prescribers need to be concerned about drug-drug interactions. For example, if rifampin is taken concomitantly with imatinib, imatinib's plasma concentrations can be reduced because rifampin can induce CYP3A4 activity. Thus, imatinib's anticancer activity can be attenuated.
