The patient should be closely monitored for adverse effects mentioned above when starting on atypical antipsychotics. The baseline body mass index should be recorded before treatment with atypical antipsychotics and at every visit for at least six months. The patient’s weight circumference also needs monitoring, and intervention may be necessary if there is an increase in one body mass index unit. The patient should receive counseling in nutrition, possible initiation of a weight loss program, use of medication to help with weight loss, and/or consider switching to another antipsychotic with less weight gain. Monitoring weight gain alone may not be sufficient for assessing diabetes mellitus risk. Some of the tests used to assess the risk of diabetes mellitus include random glucose, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and oral glucose tolerance test. A baseline lipid panel and EKG are also necessary before the initiation of atypical antipsychotics. Clozapine can cause severe neutropenia, and thus neutrophil count (ANC) needs to be monitored.
