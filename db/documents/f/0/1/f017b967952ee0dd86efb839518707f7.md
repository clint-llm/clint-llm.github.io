Trachoma is associated mainly with infection by serovars A, B, Ba, and C of Chlamydia trachomatis. Serovars D-K are conventionally associated with adult inclusion conjunctivitis. Other species of the Chlamydiaceae family, such as Chlamydophilia psittaci and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, have also been implicated.

Trachoma infection occurs as an initial 'active' inflammatory stage, which is more common in pre-school children. This may be mild and may only result in trachomatous conjunctivitis (follicular/papillary). Intense cases are characterized by the presence of papillary hypertrophy.

Recurrent infection, however, elicits a chronic immune response. The presence of intermittent chlamydial antigens provokes this reaction. It is a cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity (Type 4) response. This repeated insult leads to scarring and other forms of permanent damage. This is the chronic 'cicatricial' stage and most commonly occurs in middle age. Most of the scarring in this stage is prominent on the upper tarsal plate. This scar tissue contracts leading to in-turning of the lid, causing entropion, and this entropion eventually leads to trichiasis. Entropion is the most common cause of trichiasis in trachoma patients. Trichiasis, however, may also result from aberrant lashes or metaplastic lashes in rare cases. Ultimately, blinding corneal opacification can develop.
