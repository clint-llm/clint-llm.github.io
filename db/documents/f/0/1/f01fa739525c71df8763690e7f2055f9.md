Blastomyces dermatitidis is the causal agent of blastomycosis.Ajellomyces dermatitidis, a thermally dimorphic fungus. At 25 C, the mycelial form grows as a fluffy white mold, while at 37 C, it grows as a brown folded yeast. The fungus can be isolated in the soil, where it forms a mycelium that penetrates the substratum on which it grows.  It reproduces asexually with small conidia that are 2-10 µm in diameter. In infected cells, Blastomycosis dermatitidis is seen as budding yeast cells that are relatively large at 8 to 10 micrometers in diameter.
