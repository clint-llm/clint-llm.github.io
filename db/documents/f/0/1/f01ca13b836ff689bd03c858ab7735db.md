The blood supply of the Achilles tendon consists mainly of longitudinal arteries that course the length of the tendon. Two main blood vessels supply the tendon. The posterior tibial artery supplies both the proximal and distal sections. The peroneal artery supplies the middle section.

Overall, the tendon has a relatively poor blood supply throughout its length, as measured by vessels per cross-sectional area. Also, there is a relatively hypovascular area in the midsection, which correlates to the location of many injuries: the area approximately 2 to 6 cm from the tendon's insertion point. Some have also suggested that poor vascularity contributes to diminished healing after trauma. Blood supply to the tendon also diminishes with age.
