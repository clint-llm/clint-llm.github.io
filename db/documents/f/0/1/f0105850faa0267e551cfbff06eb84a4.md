Corneal mucous plaques are a mixture of mucin, sloughed epithelial cells, and proteinaceous and lipoidal cell debris. Mucus strands are present between widened intercellular spaces between adjoining healthy epithelial cells as well as in the gaps between degenerated epithelial cells. The epithelial cells present in the plaque range from nucleated or non-nucleated cells to necrotic cells. Other than mucus and epithelial cells, variable amounts of flocculent proteinaceous and lipoidal material are found enmeshed in the plaque.
