**Technique of Biomicroscopy**

The following points must be kept in mind while performing routine microscopy.

**Patient Adjustment**

The patient should be made to sit comfortably on an adjustable height chair to enable them to place their chin easily on the chin rest. The forehead of the patient should be touching the headrest.

**Instrument Adjustment**

The slit lamp height should be adjusted based on the patient's height. A fixation target should be given to the patient at eye level. The illumination system and the microscope should be adjusted with the patient's eye for examination.

**Slit Lamp Examination**

A few important are to be kept in mind while performing slit lamp examination. The examination must be carried out in a semi-dark room so that the examiner's eyes are dark adapted so that the eye is sensitive even with low light intensity. The illumination should be diffused for short a time as possible. The retina should be exposed to ambient light for a minimum period. The medications like ointments and topical anesthetics produce corneal surface disturbance, which can be taken wrongly as pathology. First, the pathology should be located in low ambient illumination, and later higher magnification should be used to examine it.
