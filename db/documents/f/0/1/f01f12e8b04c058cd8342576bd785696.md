Atherosclerotic plaques can build up in peripheral arteries and can lead to peripheral artery disease (PAD). The narrowing of blood vessels from PAD can disrupt blood flow to critical areas. Further complications of PAD can lead to gangrene and in severe cases, amputation. If PAD cannot be managed with lifestyle changes and medications, surgical intervention is required. Interventions include angioplasty, clot removal via a catheter, and bypass surgery.

Occlusion of the superficial femoral (SFA) and common femoral (CFA) arteries is relatively commonly reported. This occlusion can be secondary to thrombotic or embolic mechanisms. In-stent occlusions have also been reported following the initial re-canalization of the SFA. The posterior tibial artery represents one method for recanalization of the SFA or CFA via a retrograde approach using balloon catheters to remove the occlusion.
