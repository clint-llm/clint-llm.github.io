The management of Purtscher retinopathy consists of managing the cause and supportive therapy.

Cases with macular edema may benefit from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents like bevacizumab.

A case of the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome with thrombotic microangiopathy and Purtscher-like retinopathy had successful treatment with eculizumab (a monoclonal antibody that inhibits cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b, thereby blocking the terminal pathway of the complement system).

Other therapies attempted for this retinopathy include oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin) and papaverine hydrochloride.
