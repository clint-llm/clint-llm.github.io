The aorta is primarily composed of vascular smooth muscle and elastin. It is considered both a muscular and elastic artery. Three different layers make up its walls. The first of those layers is the intima, which is the thin inner layer of the aorta. The other two layers are the middle elastic, or media, and the outer fibrous layer, or adventitia.
