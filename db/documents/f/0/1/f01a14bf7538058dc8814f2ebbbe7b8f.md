Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have excellent oral absorption and bioavailability.  Both have a long and variable plasma elimination half-life because of a high volume of distribution, an extended mean residence time (HCQ 1300 hours and CQ 900 hours), and about half the drug metabolites undergoing unmodified renal clearance.  Both drugs are modified by cytochrome P450 in the liver.
