Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of death for AI/AN patients:

- Compared to members of other populations, AI/AN patients may develop DM at a younger age.

- DM may lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the CVD-led death rate is comparatively higher in AI/ANs than in others.

- In the AI/AN population, a genome-wide scan identified a number of chromosome linkages that indicate that genetic factors contribute to their elevated danger of DM and CVD.
- Pertinently, research often indicates that cultural norms and historical factors play important roles in the prevalence of DM and CVD in this population, in addition to race/ethnicity.

Consequently, when designing preventive programs to reduce the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and CVD incidence among adults and children in the AI/AN community, several factors should be considered for counting cultural, economic, and regional factors into account.

- Behavioral risk factors and improvements in lifestyle

- The avoidance of smoking

- A balanced diet

- Increased physical activity.

Evidence indicates that many risk factors lead to the increased incidence of CVD in the AI/AN population:

- Tobacco misuse

- High cholesterol levels

- DM

- Hypertension.

Analysis of SHS outcome results from chronic heart disease (CHD) revealed that the following were important risk factors for CHD in this population:

- Age

- Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol

- Gender

- Total cholesterol

- High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol

- Smoking

- Albuminuria

- DM

- High blood pressure

Interviews of AI adults residing in the seven Montana reservations conducted through the BRFSS demonstrated an alarmingly high level of modifiable risk factors for CVD among those with and without DM. Established significant risk factors for DM and CVD include:

- Physical inactivity

- Obesity

- Hypertension

Of these factors, physical inactivity is changeable, and a controllable risk factor is obesity. By managing regular exercise and obesity, AI/AN members can prevent DM and CVD. Exercise and weight loss are well known to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, avoid or postpone the onset of T2D, lower the risk of CVD, and decrease the risk of heart attack and cerebral stroke.

Native/Indigenous people have several different definitions and perceptions regarding mental illness and assumptions on why and how it occurs. There is no difference between physical complaints and psychological problems, and native/indigenous individuals may convey emotional distress in ways that are not compliant with standard diagnostic categories.

Native/Indigenous people who meet the requirements for conditions of depression, anxiety, or drug dependence are far more likely than specialties or other medical outlets to seek support from a spiritual and/or traditional healer. A lack of knowledge of mental health conditions and resources available and a lack of programs and providers sensitive to aboriginal and indigenous cultures can discourage care for indigenous people.
