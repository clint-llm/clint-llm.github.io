Antibiotics, NSAIDs, and proton pump inhibitors are commonly prescribed and over the counter medications that can precipitate AIN. While patients may or may not develop AIN's clinical symptoms, it can result in an irreversible loss in renal function. Therefore, patient education regarding the adverse effects is paramount. The patients must be advised to limit the use of these medications except when clearly indicated under the treating clinician's close supervision. If the patient develops any clinical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or a rash, they should seek medical attention.
