**Tests for intrinsic factor insufficiency:**

- Anti-intrinsic factor antibody (Specific to pernicious anemia).

- Anti-parietal cells antibody.

- Schilling test: less commonly used, if the antibodies are negative, it is preformed to assist Cbl uptake. Done by injecting free Cbl intr-muscularly and oral intake of radiolabeled Cbl, if the intrinsic factor is sufficient and no issue in its function, then the urine will show the radiolabeled Cbl, otherwise will not.

**Tests for autoimmune atrophic gastritis:**

- Gastroscopy with histopathology: shows lymphocytes and plasma cells in lamina propria and pseudohypertrophy of parietal cells.

- High fasting gastrin.

- Low pepsinogen I

**Others tests:**

- Complete blood count (CBC):

Megaloblastic anemia: the CBC will demonstrate low hematocrit and low hemoglobin (less than 13 g/dL for men, under 12 g/dL for women), with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) greater than 100 fL.

- Peripheral blood smear:

Shows pancytopenia, oval macrocytosis, and hypersegmented neutrophils (at least five lobes) in case of megaloblastic anemia.

- Bone marrow examination:

Megaloblastic hyperplasia in megaloblastic anemia.

- Serum B12 level:

A level below 150 pg per mL is diagnostic for Cbl.
