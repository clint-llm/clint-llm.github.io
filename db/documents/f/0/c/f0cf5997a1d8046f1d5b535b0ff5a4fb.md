Uric acid calculi result from precipitation of excess uric acid. AsÂ these calculi are radiolucent, they are not seen on abdominal x-ray, which can delay the diagnosis and lead to renal failure. Treatment with allopurinol decreases uric acid production but increases hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations. Xanthine, being less soluble, can result in xanthine lithiasis, especially if the patient is dehydrated.

Dental guards and other oral protective devices can hamper proper dental hygiene. Extraction of teeth in early childhood can lead to facial disfigurement as the child grows. But failure to extract the teeth can result in tissue damage with worse cosmetic damage. Vital pulpotomy with the preservation of alveolar bone can be the solution to prevent deformity of the face from teeth extraction.
