Unilateral vocal fold paralysis may manifest itself in a myriad of ways. However, most commonly, hoarseness is the primary complaint. The severity of dysphonia may relate to the position of the paralyzed vocal fold. If the vocal fold is paralyzed in a lateral position, patients will likely complain of a breathy voice, due to air escaping through the glottis because the paralyzed vocal fold can not make contact with the contralateral side. However, if the vocal fold is paralyzed in the midline position, the dysphonia may not be as severe. Dysphagia is another common complaint, due to the inability to entirely close the glottis, which impairs the swallowing mechanism. If severe, this may lead to an inability to protect the airway during the swallow, which may lead to recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Other symptoms may include a breathlessness or shortness of breath, stridor or globus sensation.

A physical exam is usually performed using either indirect laryngoscopy by mirror exam or by using a flexible nasolaryngoscope. At this point, it should be determined if the vocal fold paralysis is bilateral or unilateral. Furthermore, the position in which the paralyzed true vocal fold sits is a key factor that must be determined.
