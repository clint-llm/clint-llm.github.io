The history surrounding sunburn typically involves excessive exposure to the sun without sufficient protection. Most patients will state that they either forgot to apply sunscreen, forgot to reapply, did not expect to be out in the sun as long as they were, or did not wear sun-protective clothing.

On physical examination, there will be various degrees of erythema and pain that are directly proportional to the severity of sun exposure. There may be areas of skin that are unaffected, particularly those covered up by bathing suits, hats, sunglasses, and other protective clothing. Skin may feel warm to the touch, edematous, or pruritic. If the sunburn is severe, patients may experience systemic symptoms such as nausea, fevers, and chills. If blisters are present, it may indicate a deeper, partial thickness burn.
