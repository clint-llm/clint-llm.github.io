All crutches should undergo proper fitting to the user to avoid serious injury.

Axilla crutches: The shoulder pad should sit 2 inches (2 finger widths) below the axilla when the shoulder is relaxed.  The hand grip should be adjusted to allow for a 30-degree flexion to the elbow.  The crutch should sit about 6 inches outside of your feet, with instruction provided not to rest axilla directly on the shoulder pad.

Forearm crutches: The hand grip should allow for 30-degrees of elbow flexion.  The cuff should be 1.5 inches below the elbow, and the crutch should sit 4 inches outside of the patient's feet.

Platform crutches: The platform can vary by design from a flat surface with hand grips to a fully adjustable composite with elbow guards and hand grips.  The fitting should ensure that the angulation promotes stability and does not allow for elbow rubbing.
