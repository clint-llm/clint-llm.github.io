The Loder classification is essential in prognosis. The original study inÂ 1993 found that a patient with SCFE classified as stable did not develop osteonecrosis, whereas 47% of the patient with SCFE that were considered unstable went on to develop osteonecrosis. More recent studies, including a systematic review, have confirmed these findings.
