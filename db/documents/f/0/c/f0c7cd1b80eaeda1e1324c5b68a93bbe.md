Nearly 50% of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) are found incidentally and the disease is generally asymptomatic. Thus, a possibility of RCC should be considered if a renal mass is found on a radiologic study.

The following conditions should be considered in a patient that presents with a renal mass as they can mimic the appearance of RCC:

- Abscess

- Angiomyolipoma (benign neoplasm)

- Renal oncocytoma (benign neoplasm)

- Renal adenoma (benign neoplasm)

- Renal lymphoma

- Renal cyst

- Renal infarction

- Sarcoma

- Metastasis from distant primary lesions e.g. Metastatic melanoma

Differential diagnoses based on the clinical findings would include:

- Acute pyelonephritis

- Bladder cancer

- Chronic pyelonephritis

- Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

- Adult type Wilms tumor
