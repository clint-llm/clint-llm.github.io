Ivabradine is FDA-approved in the United States for use in patients with symptoms due to stable heart failure and an ejection fraction of 35% or less to reduce their risk of hospital admission for worsening heart failure. Ivabradine blocks the channel responsible for the cardiac pacemaker current, I(f), which regulates heart rate. This results in prolonged diastolic time and reduced heart rate. This activity covers ivabradine, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of ivabradine therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of ivabradine
- Identify the indications for initiating therapy with ivabradine.
- Outline the adverse event profile of ivabradine, along with any possible contraindications to its use.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving ivabradine in heart failure.
