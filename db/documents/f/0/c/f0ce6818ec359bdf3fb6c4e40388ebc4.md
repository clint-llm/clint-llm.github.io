Hemophilia A management is best by an interprofessional team that includes hematology nurses. Once the diagnosis is confirmed based on plasma factor VIII levels, patient and family referral for genetic screening and counseling for factor VIII gene mutation analysis to establish carrier status.

The outlook for most patients with hemophilia A is guarded. Repeated transfusions of blood products and related factors is not a benign event. Additionally, these patients are prone to bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

The pharmacist should perform a thorough medication check, looking for any agents that might precipitate bleeding, as well as verifying dosing of clotting factors and any other medications (e.g., pain control.). Nursing can provide patient counseling, reported any concerns to the managing clinician, and monitoring patient progress and status. These interprofessional examples demonstrate how this approach can optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]
