Bacteriostatic antimicrobials most commonly function via the inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis pathways.

As a class, the primary mechanism of action of tetracycline antimicrobials is the reversible inhibition of the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit.

Macrolides function via inhibition of the larger subunit of bacterial ribosomes, the 50S subunit.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has been a successful antimicrobial combination formulation because each of its constituents, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole, prevents effective processing of folic acid and its derivatives in bacteria.

Linezolid has a unique mechanism of action compared to other antimicrobials. It binds to the P site of the 50 S ribosome, which prevents the formation of bacterial ribosomal fMet-tRNA complex and thus preventing bacterial protein synthesis.
