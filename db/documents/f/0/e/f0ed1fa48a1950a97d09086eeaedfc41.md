Globally, there are more than 200 million pregnancies each year. Of these pregnancies, more than 40% are unintended. Unintended does not imply unwanted. Every couple must have the opportunity to plan for pregnancy and choose when they are ready for pregnancy. Of the 40% of unintended pregnancies, early prenatal care is important to prevent poor perinatal outcomes and complications. Opportunities for diagnosing pregnancy and preventing unwanted and unplanned pregnancies exist during routine visits, sports exams, well-woman exams, emergencies, and during acute visits. Taking these opportunities for a pregnancy test can play a major role in getting women to early prenatal care. All women of reproductive age should receive folate at 400 mcg to 800 mcg to prevent neural tube defects. This is a grade A recommendation by the United States Preventive Task Force (USPTF) and The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) since most women present after the critical part of organogenesis.
