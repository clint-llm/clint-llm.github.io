A general ophthalmologist must be well-trained in dealing with cases of ocular trauma. A high index of suspicion for the presence of an intraocular foreign body must be maintained in all cases of ocular injuries, especially in young children who may present without any apparent history of trauma. In cases where a vitreoretinal facility is not available, a proficient specialist must be consulted immediately.
