A strong relationship between the clinician and the patient is imperative for improving healthcare outcomes. Good communication among an interprofessional team is key, which may include an orthopedist, pain medicine physician, physiatrist, spinal surgeon, primary care clinician, physical therapist, dietician, and nurse. Lumbosacral facet joint syndrome may cause debilitating pain without proper management. Modifiable risk factor management, physical therapy, and medication management should serve as first-line treatment.Â Interventional procedures for facet-mediated pain, including radiofrequency neurotomy and intraarticular block, carry level I and II evidence, respectively. The overall outlook for patients with low back pain is often poor, with relapse of pain common following any treatment.
