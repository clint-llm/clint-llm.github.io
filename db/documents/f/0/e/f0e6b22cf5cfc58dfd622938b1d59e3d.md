Broca aphasia is non-fluent aphasia. The output of spontaneous speech is markedly diminished. There is a loss of normal grammatical structure (agrammatic speech). Specifically, small linking words, conjunctions (and, or, but), and the use of prepositions are lost. As an example, a sentence like "I took the dog for a walk." may become "I walk dog." Patients can exhibit interjectional speech where there is a long latency, and the words that are expressed are produced as if under pressure. The ability to repeat phrases is also impaired. Despite these impairments, the words that are produced are often intelligible and contextually correct. In pure Broca aphasia, comprehension is intact.

Patients with Broca aphasia are often veryÂ upset about their difficulty communicating. This may be due to the deficit itself or may be due to damage to adjacent frontal lobe structures which control the inhibition of negative emotions. Broca aphasia can accompany other neurological deficits such as right facial weakness, hemiparesis or hemiplegia, and apraxia.
