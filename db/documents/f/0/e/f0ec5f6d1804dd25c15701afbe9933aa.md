Fine-needle aspiration is a minimally invasive way to get a cell sample from a lesion with theÂ smallest chance of damaging surrounding healthy tissue. In situations of clinical uncertainty, it is a powerful tool to assist in guiding treatment. It is also a way to drain abscesses in cosmetically significant areas such as the breast, albeit with a higher chance of recurrence than traditional incision and drainage. Therefore, fine-needle aspiration is both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool with which healthcare providers of all levels should be familiar.
