The humeral shaft is surrounded by large arm muscles, blood vessels and include the following:

Anterior compartment:

- Brachial artery and vein

- Biceps brachii, brachialis, coracobrachialis

- Musculocutaneous, median and ulnar nerves

Posterior compartment:

- Radial nerve

- Triceps

A fracture that occurs at the midshaft of the humerus usually occurs due to a direct blow to the upper arm. Most frequently, fractures are a result of trauma, such as a fall, motor vehicle accident, or motorcycle accident. In the elderly, it can also occur from a fall on the outstretched arm, where the humerus takes the brunt of the injury instead of the wrist.
