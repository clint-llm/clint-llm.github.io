Pits and fissures of the occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth are more prone to caries development than the smooth surfaces due to their morphological complexity, making dental hygiene more challenging leading to increased plaque accumulation

The use of pit and fissure sealants provides a physical barrier that inhibits microorganisms and food particles accumulation, preventing caries initiation, and arresting caries progression

Permanent first molars, followed by second molars, show the highest caries prevalence. The management of occlusal caries on permanent molars represents a significant challenge because the onset of caries occurs soon after they erupt into the oral cavity. The effectiveness of pit and fissure sealants relays on their long-term retention
