BS is a rare disease with unknown etiology and no universally recognized curable treatment at present. However, it has no severe consequences for the patient's sight. It is important to know the disease to avoid a delay in making the diagnosis, which can result in patient anxiety. Once the diagnosis is made, it is important to inform the patients about the condition, the possible triggers, and some local measures that can be tried during the swelling episodes, such as the application of local cold. It is also important to warn patients about other diseases that can resemble BS and advise them to seek care when the swelling attacks occur, to confirm the diagnosis.
