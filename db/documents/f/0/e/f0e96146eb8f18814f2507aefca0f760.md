Herpetic infections have been well documented, even in ancient Greek literature. Herpes viruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses. Eight types of herpes viruses affect humans (human herpes virus (HHV)).

Herpes simplex encephalitis is an acute or subacute illness associated with focal or global cerebral dysfunction caused by herpes simplex viruses belonging to either type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2(HSV-2). The vast majority of herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by HSV-1, with HSV-2 constituting less than 10%.

Herpes simplex 1 encephalitis (HSV-1) in adults is associated with significant morbidityÂ and death despite treatment with antiviral therapy. Herpes simplex encephalitis is a devastating disease in infants and children, irrespective of treatment.
