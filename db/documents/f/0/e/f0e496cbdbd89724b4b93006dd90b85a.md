Lesions that determine intrinsic interstitial diseases originate from lesions of the alveolar capillaries with protein exudation, hemorrhage, and accumulation of inflammatory elements in the alveolar spaces. Alternatively, edema and interstitial inflammatory infiltration may occur. Interstitial fibrosis represents the consequence of both previous processes. Beyond a didactic schematism, the histopathological findings are manifold; some of those more specific, while others can be found in different conditions.

**Usual Interstitial Pneumonia and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis**

The morphological pattern of the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) identifies a set of modifications of the pulmonary microstructure characterized by the alternation of areas of a normal lung with fibrotic areas and prevalent subpleural and paraseptal distribution. Although this picture describes IPF, it is not exclusive to IPF alone but can also be detected in other clinical entities. Indeed, although the term UIP is often used interchangeably with IPF, other clinical conditions can show the pathological findings of UIP. In particular, IPF is a specific form of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumopathy, an unknown etiology (idiopathic UIP) where the alveolitis produces fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Accurate histopathological analysis, however, can identify distinctive elements. One of the main characteristics of the UIP/IPF pattern is the temporal heterogeneity of fibrosis. This peculiar aspect is represented by the coexistence of dense scar areas of mature collagen fibrosis and "honeycomb" areas, and young fibroblastic proliferation called fibroblastic foci. Furthermore, in the IPF, a polypoid proliferation of myofibroblasts, generally protruding into alveolar or bronchiolar cavities, characterized by a stroma with scarce collagen fibers, can be observed. The interstitial septa appear fibrotic and coated with hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes or with epithelium in bronchiolar metaplasia with a hyperplastic aspect.

**Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia**

It has histological and radiological characteristics different from all the other interstitial diseases of unknown etiology. It is essential to know its morphologic and clinic features as, compared to IPF, this disease manifests a much better prognosis. Morphologically, there are changes in lung architecture that do not fully meet the criteria which underlie the other forms of pulmonary interstitial disease. Three subgroups of the NSIP pattern can be recognized:

- Cellular Pattern: A mild to moderate chronic inflammatory interstitial infiltrate, mainly represented by lymphocytes and plasma cells, occasionally arranged in nodular aggregates

- Fibrous Pattern: Scarce cellular elements with a greater fibrous component

- Mixed Pattern: Coexistence of the two forms

**Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia**

The morphological pattern often shows a bronchiolocentric location with the maintenance of the pulmonary architecture in the areas surrounding the remodeling process. The morphological characteristics are the proliferation of connective tissue (Masson bodies) inside of the small airways and alveolar ducts, with occlusion of the bronchioles (obliterating bronchiolitis) and surrounding alveoli (organized pneumonia).

**Sarcoidosis**

It is a multisystemic inflammatory disease that begins more frequently between 20 and 40 years of age and represents the most frequent of all interstitial lung diseases. The lungs are almost constantly affected (about 90% of cases) with bilateral pulmonary hilar lymph node involvement and possible simultaneous involvement of the lungs. Histopathology features include noncaseating epithelioid granulomas with tightly packed epithelioid cells, Langhans giant cells, and T lymphocytes. These findings are localized in interstitium adjacent to bronchioles as well as around and within vessel walls, pleura, and connective tissue septa. There are Schaumann bodies (laminated concretions of calcium and protein) and asteroid elements (stellate inclusions within giant cells).
