Every state and territory in the US set laws to govern the practice of nursing. These laws are defined in the Nursing Practice Act (NPA). The NPA is then interpreted into regulations by each state and territorial nursing board with the authority to regulate the practice of nursing care and the power to enforce the laws. Fifty states, District of Columbia and 4 United States (US) territories, have state boards of nursing (BON) that are responsible for regulating their individual NPA.

Most states and territories have one nursing board regulating all levels of nursing, including PN/VN (practical nurse /vocational nurse), RN (Registered Nurse), and APN (Advanced Practice Nurse) practice (www.ncsbn.org). Some states, such as California, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Louisiana, have separate state boards for PN/VN, RN, or APN practice. These boards are all members of the National Council State Boards of Nursing (www.ncsbn.org). The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) promotes evidence-based regulatory excellence for patient safety in nursing care and public protection. The NCSBN has supported the Nurse Licensure Compact with 34 state boards of nursing, recognizing a single nursing license to practice in multiple states.
