Some components of the oral mucosa are identified by immunohistochemistry techniques. For example, Langerhan cells require specific immunohistochemical reactions, such as S-100 immunohistochemistry. Merkel cells are not easily observed in samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin and are usually identified with immunohistochemistry techniques. They express simple cytokeratin intermediate filaments CK 7, 8, 18, 19, and 20. Moreover, CK20 is only found in taste buds and Merkel cells in the stratified squamous epithelium
