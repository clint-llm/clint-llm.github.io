Although TA occurs is commonly seen in women of African descent who have tight spiral black hair, it has been suggested from recent studies that the main risk factor for traction alopecia is the associated hair care practices and not the hair types. It is thought that chronic traction could affect the dermal papilla thus leading to a diminution of the hair follicle.
