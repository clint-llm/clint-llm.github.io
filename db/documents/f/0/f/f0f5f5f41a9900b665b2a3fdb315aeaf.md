The physical exam often provides the most valuable information regarding blood loss; however, many lab tests can assess the hemorrhaging patient. The lethal triad is comprised of coagulopathy, hypothermia, and acidosis.

Similar to TEG and ROTEM, prothrombin time (PT), international standardized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen, and platelets can be used to detect coagulopathy. Furthermore, serum lactate and base deficit can be used to monitor the extent of tissue hypoperfusion. Single hematocrit measurements are not recommended for monitoring acute blood loss.
