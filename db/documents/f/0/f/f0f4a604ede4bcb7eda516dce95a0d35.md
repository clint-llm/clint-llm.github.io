Bilirubin metabolism occurs in three phases: prehepatic, intrahepatic, and post-hepatic. Bilirubin is conjugated and becomes water-soluble in the liver and is then excreted through the biliary and cystic ducts to either become stored in the gallbladder or pass through the duodenum. Hence conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs when there is a disease process that affects the hepatic and post-hepatic phase of bilirubin metabolism.

Intrahepatic causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia include:

Hepatocellular disease

- Viral hepatitis (Hepatitis A-E)

- Alcoholic liver disease (alcoholic steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis)

- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- Wilson disease

- Hemochromatosis

Hereditary causes

- Dubin-Johnson syndrome

- Rotor syndrome

Primary biliary cirrhosis

Ischemic hepatitis

Sarcoidosis

Pregnancy

Drug-induced liver injury

Sepsis

Extrahepatic causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia include

Intrinsic to the ductal system

- Gallstones

- Biliary stricture

- Biliary atresia

- Choledochal cyst

- Cholangitis (bacterial, recurrent pyogenic, primary sclerosing, secondary sclerosing)

- Cholangiocarcinoma

- Intrahepatic malignancy

Extrinsic to the ductal system

- Extrahepatic malignancy (lymphoma, pancreatic cancer)

- Chronic pancreatitis
