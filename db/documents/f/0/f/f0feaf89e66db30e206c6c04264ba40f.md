Inferior shoulder dislocation injuries when due to a traumatic mechanism are almost always accompanied by moderate to severe soft tissue injury, proximal humerus fractures, avulsion fractures of the greater tuberosity, fractures of the acromion, clavicle, coracoid process, or glenoid rim, and rotator cuff tears. Rotator cuff and greater tuberosity fractures can occur in approximately 80% of patients. Neurovascular compromise may affect the axillary nerve and brachial plexus.  About 60% of patients have neurologic dysfunction, with the axillary nerve most commonly injured. Arterial injury occurs in three percent of patients that presents with absent radial pulses. Neurologic dysfunction typically resolves with shoulder reduction as the brachial plexopathy is also reduced. Adhesive capsulitis and recurrent dislocations are known long term complications of all shoulder dislocations. Despite the associated injuries, in a case series of 11 patients all were treated with closed reduction techniques and no one had persistent instability at follow up.
