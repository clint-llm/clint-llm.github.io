Most patients present with asymptomatic vascular anomalies of the celiac trunk. However, vital knowledge of the celiac trunk, its branches, and vascular variations is essential for any surgical procedures involving the upper abdomen. These procedures include a liver transplant, diagnostic procedures like angiography for gastrointestinal bleeding, or celiac axis compression syndrome. Recognition of variations in abdominal arteries that supply the liver, pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen can help in reducing the blood loss during surgical procedures involving these areas.
