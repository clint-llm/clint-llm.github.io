Evaluation of DVT includes blood tests to help stratify patients with the risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) include D-dimer assay; levels of antithrombin III (ATIII), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and C-reactive protein (CRP); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Studies have shown all patient presenting with a positive D-dimer and leg swelling have confirmed DVT on evaluation.

Radiologic investigations include an ultrasound of the affected leg and pelvis. It may require additional evaluation in some patients with either CT (computed tomography) scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).

Investigation for portal vein thrombosis includes laboratory test: coagulation studies to rule out inherited coagulation disorders, liver function test, and radiographic imaging. Ultrasound is the first line modality, and this can be done endoscopically. Further imaging modalities are MRI or MRA and possible CT scan.
