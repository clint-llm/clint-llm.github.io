Most first-generation antipsychotic medications are available in oral formulations. Several are also available in injectable intramuscular formulations, which are useful in the treatment of psychotic agitation. Clinicians sometimes use intravenous formulations of haloperidol and droperidol to treat psychosis, agitation, or delirium in acute medical settings. Long-acting, decanoate preparations of haloperidol and fluphenazine are deliverable via intramuscular injection one to two times per month, which is useful for nonadherent patients with daily oral dosing.

Second-generation antipsychotics are available in oral form. Additionally, aripiprazole is available as an intramuscular injection (immediate release) for use in acute settings, and olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, and aripiprazole are available in the form of long-acting injectables for use in nonadherent patients. The injectable form is for use in older and non-compliant patients, so the steady dose of the antipsychotic is available without any withdrawal effects.

First-generation or typical antipsychotic drugs are either high potency or low potency, based on the amount of drug necessary to minimize patient symptoms. Specific dosing of individual agents will not be covered in this class overview article.
