Often hypertension is picked up by nurses charting the patients in ERs and out-patient setting, where prompt recognition and referral to a physician is essential as most of these hypertensive patients might be unaware of their disease, hence the name "silent killer."

Inter-professional communication is of prime importance especially in picking up cases of resistant or difficult to treat hypertension where referral and inter-specialty approach will benefit a patient the most. Effective communication in an interprofessional team approach including nursing staff and nurse practitioner, primary referring physician, cardiologist, nephrologist and pharmacist is essential for ensuring blood pressure control. This team can also monitor for adequate patient compliance as well as potential toxicities and adverse effects, all of which will result in minimizing future complications and reducing health care costs as well as improving patient outcomes.
