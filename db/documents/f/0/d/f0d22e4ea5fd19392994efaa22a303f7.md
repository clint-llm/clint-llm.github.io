The process of fracture healing requires a precise balance of biology and stabilization during the healing process. There are four pillars for adequate bone healing: mechanics, osteogenic cells, scaffolds, and growth factors. In some circumstances, this process does not go as expected, and healing does not occur without additional intervention. Definitions vary among different studies, but overall, a diagnosis can be made when there is no evidence of progression of the healing process for 3 months or no healing after 9 months of the injury.
