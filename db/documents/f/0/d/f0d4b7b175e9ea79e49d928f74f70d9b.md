Farmer's lung disease is an occupational illness of dairy and cattle farmers in many countries. The diagnosis of the disease is usually overlooked because of the lack of patient or clinician awareness.****It often poses a diagnostic dilemma as the patients may exhibit non-specific signs and symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, fevers, myalgias, and joint pains during an acute episode. These symptoms can be mistaken for a viral illness.
