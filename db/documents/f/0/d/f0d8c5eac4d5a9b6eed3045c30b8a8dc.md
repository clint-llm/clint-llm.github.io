**Primary Congenital Glaucoma (PCG)**

Also known as isolated trabeculodysgenesis or goniodysgenesis. The patient presents with raised intraocular pressure in the first six months of life manifested as enlarged corneal diameter, scleral thinning, and Haab striae.

On examination, one can find anterior insertion of the iris to the trabecular meshwork.

**Iris Hypoplasia/Iridogoniodysgenesis**

Clinically the iris appears gray/brown depending on the color of pigmented epithelium of the iris, which gets exposed due to hypoplastic iris stroma. The iris collarette is either absent or hypoplastic and peripherally located with a normal-appearing angle on the gonioscopy.

**Axenfeld-Rieger Anomaly (AXRA)**

Prominent Schwalbe's line (posterior embryotoxon) with attached iris processes to the peripheral cornea has been termed Axenfeld anomaly.

Though the abnormalities have been described as two separate entities, there is considerable overlap in the clinical features, and this spectrum of abnormalities has been called Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly (AXRA).

Systemic abnormalities associated with AXRA have been termed as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome.

**Peters Anomaly**

This anomaly has classically been described as deficient central endothelium and posterior stroma characterized by central opacity to which iris (Peters anomaly I) or lens attaches posteriorly with the formation of cataract (Peters anomaly II).

Type I can further be classified as mild, moderate, and severe depending upon the location of corneal opacity at the periphery, paraxially, and centrally with or without iridocorneal adhesions, respectively.

Similarly, type II Peters anomaly can also have kerato-lenticular adhesions with and without cataracts. This classification system has been proposed by Elbaz U et al. and has simplified the treatment algorithm in different phenotypic presentations of Type I and II peters anomaly.

**Aniridia**

It is characterized by the partial or complete absence of the iris.

Patients with aniridia often have nystagmus.

**CHED**

The patients present with bilateral corneal opacity and poor visual function since early childhood. In patients with early onset, corneal clouding nystagmus can also be noted.

**Sclerocornea**

There is non-progressive scleralization of the cornea varying from peripheral corneal scleralization to diffuse corneal involvement.

**Congenital Iris Ectropion**

This condition is characterized by non-progressive ectropion of the iris epithelium. Other features include a smooth and cryptless iris surface, dysgenetic angle, high iris insertion, and ipsilateral ptosis.
