The entirety of the central nervous system derives from ectoderm. The mesodermally derived notochord induces the neural ectoderm formation. The notochord induces the formation of the neural groove. The neural groove later develops into the neural fold at day 20 post conception. The neural fold closes over itself both rostrally and caudally to form the neural tube. At four weeks gestation, the neural tube develops three outpouchings, the prosencephalon (forebrain), rhombencephalon (hindbrain), and mesencephalon (midbrain). At six weeks, the prosencephalon will again divide into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The diencephalon will form the subthalamic nucleus as well as the thalamus, hypothalamus, retina, and third ventricle.
