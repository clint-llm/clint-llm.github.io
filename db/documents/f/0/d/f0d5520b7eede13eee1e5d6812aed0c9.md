NTM isolation has always been controversial among physicians; this is because the bacteria lives in the ambient, making it very difficult to differentiate colonization versus infection in sterile sputum. So, it is indispensable to achieve the diagnosis of NTM by integrating clinical, radiological, and microbiological aspects. Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria have a slow growth process, resulting in a considerable time to infect the lungs. Sometimes, this particular factor, along with a low index of clinical suspiciousness, could result in either misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Clinical manifestations are similar to tuberculosis lung infection. These could include respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, increased sputum production, and systemic manifestations such as low-grade fever, malaise, and weight loss. The duration of symptoms may vary from a few days to a few weeks. The physical features are not specific and can mimic any infectious process of the lungs.
