Vitamin B12 and folic acid can be given orally or parenterally. If there is no evidence of malabsorption, the generally preferred route for supplementation is oral.

The recommended dose for vitamin B12 supplementation in children is 50 to 100 mcg parenterally once a week until the deficiency is corrected. They may require supplemental doses every month or every other month thereafter, depending on the formulation used (cyanocobalamin versus hydroxocobalamin). In adults, the recommended dose is 1000 mcg parenterally once a week until the deficiency is corrected, followed by supplemental doses every month or every other month. An oral vitamin B12 dose of 1000 mcg daily is equally effective as the above parenteral regimen, provided that there is no intestinal malabsorption issue.

The recommended dose for folic acid supplementation is 1 mg orally once a day until the deficiency is corrected. If the cause of this deficiency is correctable, supplementation can be stopped after repletion. However, in cases with nonreversible causes, indefinite supplementation is recommended.

With adequate supplementation and bone marrow response, hemolytic markers (if intramedullary hemolysis is present) will improve within 1 week and serum hemoglobin/hematocrit levels will completely normalize within 1 to 2 months.
