Since the development of the female external genitalia is dependent on hormones. The vulva region can be affected by endocrine-related conditions. The endocrine system is the system that influences/controls the secretions of hormones. If there is a defect in the endocrine system, males can present with female external genitalia. One example of males with female external genitalia is in "androgen insensitivity syndrome" (AIS). In AIS, androgen receptors are insensitive to androgens. The insensitivity of these receptors makes them unresponsive to testosterone and androgens. Then the external genitals will default into developing into female external genitals.
