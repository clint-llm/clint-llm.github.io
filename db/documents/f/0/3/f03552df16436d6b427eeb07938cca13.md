The pathophysiology behind the common peripheral neuropathies is dependent on their specific disease etiology. For example, ETOH-related peripheral neuropathy may be caused by direct nerve injury or by malnutrition.

HIV-related neuropathies have several distinct categories with variable presentations based on the nerves affected. For example, mononeuropathy multiplex presents at all stages of HIV infection due to varying etiologies. It is often caused by thrombosis of the vasa nervorum, which leads to multiple lesions in various nerves causing primarily axonal loss with relative myelin sparing. Autonomic neuropathy may also occur in the HIV patient when there is damage to the nerves responsible for functions that regulate autonomic activities such as blood pressure, heart rate, or bowel and bladder emptying.

It is important to note that electrodiagnostic testing can only test Type I fibers and cannot detect small fiber neuropathies. Nonetheless, electrodiagnostic testing can help guide the clinician toward this diagnosis if the patient has typical peripheral neuropathy symptoms with normal electrodiagnostic testing. A skin biopsy or autonomic reflex testing may be needed for confirmation. Common disorders that produce small fiber neuropathies are diabetes, amyloidosis, and HIV.
