Type II hypersensitivity reaction refers to an antibody-mediated immune reaction in which antibodies (IgG or IgM) are directed against cellular or extracellular matrix antigens, resulting in cellular destruction, functional loss, or tissue damage. Damage can occur via three different mechanisms:

- Antibody binding to cell surface receptors and altering its activity

- Activation of the complement pathway

- Antibody dependant cellular cytotoxicity
