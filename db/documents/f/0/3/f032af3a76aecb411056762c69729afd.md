Rosuvastatin is a statin medication used as a lipid-lowering agent. The FDA-approved indications are homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidemia, primary dysbetalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and prevention of cardiovascular disease. The non-FDA-approved uses are in non-cardioembolic stroke, secondary prevention in transient ischemic attack (TIA), and perioperative therapy for cardiac risk reduction in noncardiac surgeries. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of rosuvastatin, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating hyperlipidemia as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of rosuvastatin. 
- Describe the potential adverse effects for patients taking rosuvastatin. 
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients on rosuvastatin. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance rosuvastatin where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
