Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs are necessary, although initial imaging may not fully evaluate the complete extent of complex injuries. Additional shoulder, wrist, and hand imaging should also be obtained to rule out concomitant ipsilateral injuries. Radiographs help evaluate the concentricity of humeroulnar and radiocapitellar joints; specifically, lateral films can assist in diagnosing coronoid fractures. While most injuries can be diagnosed with plain radiographs, a computed tomography (CT) scan is routinely obtained for patients with the terrible triad to identify fracture patterns, comminution, and displacement, which may not be evident on plain radiographs. Reconstructed CT scans are helpful to better understand the injury pattern and further assist with preoperative planning.

CT imaging can also detect coronoid, radial head, or olecranon injuries missed on initial radiographs. 3D reconstructions are useful to determine fracture line propagation. Evaluation of fluoroscopic images under anesthesia is beneficial for intraoperative decision-making. Obtaining radiographs after certain mechanisms may be impractical; thus, in select patient populations, performing an examination under anesthesia while taking the elbow through gentle ROM is advantageous. It is important to note and reinforce that prereduction and post-reduction films should be obtained.

For those patients who have already undergone procedural fixation or present in a delayed fashion, imaging should be individualized to the particular patient and their presenting circumstance, as opposed to proceeding with standardized imaging protocols. Nonstandard views may need to be obtained for stiffened joints that are unable to change position to further assess the integrity and alignment of articulating surfaces. Prior internal fixation or radial head implantation may obscure other joint surfaces and misconstrue alignment. CT or MRI should be obtained in these instances.

Various systems exist to assist in further diagnostics: the Mason, Regan and Morrey, and O’Driscoll Classifications.

Under the Mason Classification for radial head fractures:

- Type I radial head fractures are either nondisplaced or minimally displaced (<2 mm), with no mechanical block to rotation

- Type II characterizes displaced (>2 mm) or angulated fractures, with possible mechanical block to forearm rotation

- Type III involves fracture comminution and displacement with confirmed mechanical block to motion

- Type IV radial head fractures are associated with elbow dislocation

The Regan and Morrey Classification system identifies three types of coronoid fractures:

- Type I involves the coronoid tip

- Type II describes a fracture involving 50% or less of coronoid height

- Type III is determined by a fracture of greater than 50% of coronoid height

O’Driscoll Classification system subdivides coronoid injuries based on location and the number of coronoid fragments while recognizing that anteromedial facet fractures are caused by varus posteromedial rotatory forces.
