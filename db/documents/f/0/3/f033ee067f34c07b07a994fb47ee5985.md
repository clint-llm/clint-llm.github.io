The cherry-red spot refers to the reddish area at the center of the macula surrounded by retinal opacification in certain disorders. The retinal opacification may be due to various causes, including accumulation of different materials in the ganglion cells in storage disorders, and retinal ischemia/infarction, as in central retinal arterial occlusion (CRAO). Ruling out serious life-threatening or sight-threatening diseases is paramount in a patient with a cherry-red spot at the macula. The management varies according to the cause.
