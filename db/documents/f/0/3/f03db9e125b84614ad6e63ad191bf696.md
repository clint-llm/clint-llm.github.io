Cost-effective use of health care resources necessitates careful scrutiny to avoid unnecessary tests and treatments.  "Antibiotic stewardship," or the appropriate use of antibiotics in a way that improves patient outcomes, reduces microbial resistance, and decreases the spread of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms, is essential.  As such, a rational and evidence-based approach to the evaluation and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is important.  It is not appropriate to routinely order a urinalysis and urine culture and sensitivity test on every patient admitted to the hospital unless there is a clinical reason to suspect a symptomatic or an occult urinary tract infection. Additionally, when the clean-catch urine culture of a 70-year-old female (who is admitted for a diagnosis unrelated to her urinary tract and has no urinary symptoms) increases to >100,000 CFU/ml of Escherichia coli, which it often will, it is appropriate to resist the temptation to treat the culture results.
