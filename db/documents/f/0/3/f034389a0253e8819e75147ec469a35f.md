Although there are no absolute indications for OAPS, one should consider OAPS for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures associated with significant physical and/or emotional discomfort. The depth of sedation for OAPS will range from minimal sedation or "anxiolysis" to deep sedation, according to the parameters outlined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. The depth required for each patient is determined by multiple considerations, including theÂ level of pain anticipated and the need for akinesia.
