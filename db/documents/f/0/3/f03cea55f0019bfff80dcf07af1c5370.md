The precentral gyrus is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery, which are both branches off of the internal carotid artery. The superior division of the middle cerebral artery supplies the more lateral surface of the precentral gyrus, while the anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial aspect of the precentral gyrus. The precentral gyrus, along with the majority of the cortical surface, is drained by the superficial cerebral veins, which then empty into the superior sagittal sinus.
