Urine culture results may be deemed faulty and inconclusive due to patient factors. Recent antibiotic use is a major culprit, as this therapy may mask the presence of UTI-causing organisms. Furthermore, the use of diuretics or the consumption of large amounts of fluids may also dilute the urine and invariably lead to a decrease in the number of bacteria present in the sample. Moreover, the large consumption of ascorbic acid has been long knownÂ to interfere with the results of urine dipstick results.

Culture results are invariably affected by faulty collection techniques, leading to the contamination of urine and invariably, by urogenital flora.
