**Symptoms**

Sudden toxicity due to overdosage can cause hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Nimodipine-induced refractory vasoplegia may be observed.

**Treatment**

Stop the drug as the first step. Emergency symptomatic management is necessary. Gastric lavage is an option if the toxicity is due to oral intake, and charcoal can be administered in emergency scenarios. Hypotension management is achieved with inotrope, and arrhythmias are managed by a team of cardiologists and emergency department staff. No specific antidote is available. Since nimodipine is highly protein-bound, dialysis is not likely to be of benefit.****Recent case reports suggest that in nimodipine-induced refractory vasoplegia, hydroxocobalamin can be used as a  potential rescue therapy.
