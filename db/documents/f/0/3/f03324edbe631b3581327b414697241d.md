If the classic signs of opioid toxicity are present in a comatose patient, such as constricted pupils and slow respiratory rate, assumptions are often that there is nothing else this patient could have. If after naloxone reversal, the patient appears to have normalized, this assumption can be justified. However, undifferentiated comatose patients are often seen in the emergency setting and can be challenging to evaluate and treat. Traditionally, a "coma cocktail" of 4 medications (dextrose/thiamine/naloxone/flumazenil) was used, but only one of the components of the original cocktail (naloxone) remains in use in emergency care as of early 2019.
