Intrinsic hand deformities represent a challenging condition that disables the patient if left untreated. A thorough physical examination is essential to find the cause of this condition. Nerve repairment and transfers, as well as tendon transfers, have the potential to restore grip and pinch. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of intrinsic hand deformities and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with intrinsic hand deformities.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of a patient with an intrinsic hand deformity.
- Explain the physical exam findings associated with an intrinsic hand deformity.
- Review the management considerations for patients with intrinsic hand deformities.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with intrinsic hand deformities.
