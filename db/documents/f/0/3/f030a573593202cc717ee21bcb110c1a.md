Successful patient outcomes are reliant on well-orchestrated interprofessional team care. Although the surgery is primarily performed by surgeons or dermatologists, they form only part of the extended healthcare team. The involvement of specialist nurses within preoperative, intraoperative (scrub) and post-operative wound dressing environment are fundamental to the patient pathway. While other allied health professionals including physician associates, operating room circulating team members, pathologists, and pharmacists play important roles. Early identification of flap complications through patient education and by nursing staff with appropriate escalation is vital to patient outcomes.
