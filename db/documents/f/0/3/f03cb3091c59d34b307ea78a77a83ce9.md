Imaging should be performed to evaluate for retained pieces of shark teeth in wounds, fractures, and periosteal damage. An x-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan can be used to identify such objects. CT angiography can be used if there is suspicion for vascular injury despite the patient being hemodynamically stable and if there are no “hard signs” (i.e. pulsatile bleeding, rapidly expanding hematoma, etc.) of vascular injury observed.
