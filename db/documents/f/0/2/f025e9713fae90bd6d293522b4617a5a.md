The long-term impact of two to three days of acute, postoperative nociceptive pain, pales in comparison to the centralized pain and its long-term impact on a patient's quality of life. Part of the pain assessment is categorizing the type of pain the patient is experiencing. How the pain is described is high yield. Ask if the pain is burning or sharp and if it is constant or intermittent because the descriptors matter. Examination findings also increase the likelihood of one type of pain over another. If the patient is experiencing symptoms of allodynia or hyperalgesia, this points away from acute pain and suggests a centralized process.

Providers must discuss with the patient the expectations for therapy, as well as they need to teach patients about their pain. Various surgical procedures may put a patient at an increased rate of developing chronic pain. Breast surgery, for example, has a higher likelihood of chronic pain compared to knee placement.

Assessment of pain is not a one-time occurrence. It narrows the differential diagnosis. It is a way to monitor therapy, as well as changes to pain over time. Chronic pain disorder, although appropriate as a diagnosis in some circumstances, is not a blanket label for all patients experiencing prolonged pain.
