Larynx: The larynx is a cartilaginous structure located above the trachea and below the hyoid bone. It comprises three cartilages, namely thyroid, cricoid, and a pair of arytenoid cartilages. The larynx's function is to help control the flow of air in and out of the lungs, prevent food and water from entering the lungs, helps in swallowing, and acts as the main source of speech.

A laryngeal stent is placed through and above true or false vocal cords or far below the true vocal cords to avoid scarring, granulation tissue, and stent failure if placed immediately below true vocal cords.

Trachea: The fibrocartilaginous structure of the lower respiratory tract below the larynx is the trachea. It forms the main trunk of the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is made of 16Â to 20 tracheal cartilages anteriorly and tracheal muscles posteriorly. The function of the trachea is to transport air in and out of the lungs.

Laryngotracheal stenosis is graded based on the percent of obstruction:
