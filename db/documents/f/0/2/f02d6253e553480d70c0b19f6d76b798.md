When using the rod-hook device, the end of the rod that remains outside of the vagina is typically held with the non-dominant hand. The hook end of the rod is then protected between two fingers when entering the vagina. When the practitioner can palpate the amniotic membrane and the presenting part, the non-dominant hand is used to advance the hook to the amniotic membrane. The membrane is then snagged with the hook, and gentle traction is applied in a superior direction to tear the amniotic membrane. Successful rupture of membranes most commonly is determined by the immediate return of amniotic fluid from the vagina. This fluid usually is clear and odorless. However, in certain circumstances, the fluid may either contain meconium or may be blood-tinged. It is important to note the color of the fluid at the time of rupture. Typically, following artificial rupture of membranes, the practitioner should not immediately remove their hand from the vagina because it is at this point that the highest risk of potential cord prolapse can occur and will be noted as the amniotic fluid continues to drain. After the immediate flow of amniotic fluid ceases, and there is no palpable cord in the vagina, the vaginal hand then can be removed.
