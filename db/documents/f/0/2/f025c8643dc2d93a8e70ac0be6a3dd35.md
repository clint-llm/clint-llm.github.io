Cholinergic receptors perform major roles in neural transmission within the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The nicotinic receptor subdivides into two subtypes, N1 and N2. N1 may also be referred to as the peripheral or muscle receptor type, while N2 is known as the central or neuronal receptor subtype.

Muscarinic receptors are divided into five main subtypes M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5.
