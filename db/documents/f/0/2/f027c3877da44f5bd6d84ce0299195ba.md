There are three main categories of bleeding. Lacerations, punctures, and amputations can result in arterial bleeding, which is characterized by spurting or pulsatile, bright red blood.

A weak or absent radial pulse and a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg are two indicators of shock in a hemorrhagic patient.

They define class I shock as losing less than 15% of total blood volume and including mostly normal vital signs. Class II includes a blood loss of 15% to 30% and shows a slight deviation from normal vital signs. The vital sign deviation from normal increases in class III, where blood loss is between 31% and 40%. Finally, class IV includes patients with losses of greater than 40% of total blood volume, which can lead to altered mental status, hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. In recent years several studies questioned the consistency of this classification system. These studies found base deficit (BD) to be a consistent measurement that could aid in classifying hemorrhage. ATLS was updated to include base deficit (BD) as a parameter of the existing hemorrhage classification system.

- Class I: 0 to -2

- Class II: -2 to -6

- Class III: -6 to -10

- Class IV: -10 or less
