Holoprosencephaly occurs as a result of anomalous signaling interactions between the neural crest and neural ectoderm. This primarily results in the abnormal structure of the frontal lobes (derived from telencephalon), among other intracranial structures, as well as craniofacial defects. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of holoprosencephaly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of holoprosencephaly.
- Outline the typical presentation of holoprosencephaly.
- Review the management of holoprosencephaly.
