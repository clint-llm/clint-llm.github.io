**Multimodal Diabetic Ulcer Management**

- **Patient Education:**Education on foot care, as well as control of blood sugar levels, should be performed early. This can also be done with the aid of diabetic educators and social workers.

- **Blood-Sugar Control:**This is managed using a team approach of primary care physician, podiatry, and vascular specialist and based on the severity of the disease and the patient’s attitude toward medication, especially insulin.

- **Decreasing Pressure**, preventing further or new trauma: Offloading pressure to the area can be done with crutches, wheelchairs, and casting. Ulcer healing is improved with total contact casting, irremovable cast walkers compared to removable cast walkers.

- **Improve Peripheral Vascular Circulation:**Antiplatelet agents are the initial drug therapy; however, insufficiency requires surgical bypass.

- **Prevent or Control Infection:**Systemic and source control is achieved using antibiotics and surgical debridement.

- **Topical Ulcer Care:**Principles of wound care include the use of topical agents with dressing and debridement. Shallow ulcers can be managed with occlusive and semi-occlusive dressings. A specialized dressing containing hyaluronic acid, collagen, and surgical intervention for debridement is usually required in full-thickness ulcers.
