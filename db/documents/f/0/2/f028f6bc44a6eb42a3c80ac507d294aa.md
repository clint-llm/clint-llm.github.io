Vision loss and severe oculomotor dysfunction can be permanent if orbital pseudotumor is left untreated or is unresponsive to treatment. The inflammation can spread to contiguous structures such as the periorbital area, the optic nerve, and the intracranial cavity. Multiple cranial nerves may be affected, and sensorimotor hemiparesis may occur. Severe inflammation may cause secondary angle-closure glaucoma because of choroidal effusions that cause the anterior rotation of the ciliary body.
