Almotriptan is contraindicated in patients with renal dysfunction or insufficiency and the elderly due to a physiological decrease in renal function and renal clearance with advanced age.

Minor clearance of almotriptan occurs through the CYP450 system (specifically, CYP3A4); therefore, the clinician should avoid other drugs metabolized through this pathway because they may decrease almotriptan clearance. These drugs include but are not limited to verapamil, nifedipine, losartan, cyclosporine, and moclobemide.

Contraindications to almotriptan also include patients with underlying cardiovascular disease due to the presence of 5HT1B receptors on the coronary arteries. Almotriptan potentially binds to such receptors resulting in further narrowing or spasm of the arteries.
