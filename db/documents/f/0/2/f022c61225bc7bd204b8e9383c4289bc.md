Madelung deformity is a deformity of the distal radius causing a deficiency in the volar ulnar corner, frequently causing wrist pain and cosmetic deformity. The proposed mechanism of the classic congenital form of the deformity is due to an abnormal Vickers ligament leading to restricted growth at the volar ulnar corner of the distal radius. There are various treatment options depending on the cause of the deformity, symptoms, severity, and skeletal maturity at the timeÂ of diagnosis.
