The majority of hernias can be diagnosed with physical examination alone. In patients who have an exam that causes concern for a strangulated hernia, it is important to rule out bowel ischemia. Complete blood count and basic metabolic panel should be checked for leukocytosis and metabolic abnormalities. A lactate level can be helpful, although, with acute strangulated small bowel, this level may be falsely normal up to 8 hours while the blood supply is compromised.
