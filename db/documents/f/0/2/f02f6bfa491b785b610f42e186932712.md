Atrophic vaginitis is an inflammatory condition associated with low estrogen levels. Pre-menopausal women may experience symptoms but more commonly experienced by postmenopausal women. Treatment is typically initiated with localized estrogen therapy to provide symptom relief. Adjunctive therapy with estrogen modulator receptors or radiofrequency treatment may further improve symptoms.
