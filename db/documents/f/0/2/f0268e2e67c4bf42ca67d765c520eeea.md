Acute laryngitis can affect patients of any age, though is more common in the adult population, usually affecting individuals aged 18 to 40, though it may be seen in children as young as three. Isolated voice symptoms in children younger than three should prompt a more thorough workup for additional pathology including vocal cord paralysis, GERD, and neurodevelopmental conditions. Accurate incidence measurements of acute laryngitis remain difficult to elucidate as this condition remains under-reported, with many patients appropriately not seeking medical care for this often self-limited condition.
