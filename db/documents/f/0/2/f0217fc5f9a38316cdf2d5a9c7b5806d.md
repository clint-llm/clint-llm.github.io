Food allergy can have 2 etiology depending on the mechanism of disease: IgE-mediated or type I hypersensitivity and other immunologically non-IgE mediated reactions.

The food allergens are usually water-solubleÂ glycoproteins that are resistant to breakdown and are easily transported across the mucosal surface in the intestine.

Risk factors for severe food allergies or anaphylaxis include:

- Asthma

- Prior episodes of anaphylaxis

- Delay in the use of epinephrine
