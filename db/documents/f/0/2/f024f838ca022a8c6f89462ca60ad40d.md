The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis in the United States are gallstones (35% to 40% of cases) and alcohol use (30% of cases).

The most recent American College of Gastroenterology guidelines recommend checking the triglyceride level in a patient who has no evidence of gallstones and no history of significant alcohol use.

The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is ethanol abuse. Smoking is also an important risk factor. There are several other causes which include tropical pancreatitis, idiopathic pancreatitis, ductal obstruction (pancreas divisum, pseudocysts, stones, tumors, and trauma), mutations in cystic fibrosis genes, hereditary pancreatitis and systemic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
