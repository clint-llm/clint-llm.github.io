Baseline concentrations of calcium and bone mineral density should be established before therapy begins, with follow-up testing at 6 to 12 months post-therapy. Calcium at baseline and continual monitoring are needed if hypocalcemia risk is recurring. The clinician should decrease the dose or discontinue therapy if hypocalcemia occurs during treatment. Magnesium and phosphorus require monitoring at regular intervals.

The physician should offer some form of a drug holiday to patients on alendronate therapy. The accumulation of alendronate in the kidney allows for persistent anti-fracture benefits even after cessation of treatment. Current recommendations suggest tailoring the drug holiday length to individual patients. The average drug holiday in low-risk patients is 3 to 5 years. It also bears mentioning that alendronate is an extremely safe drug, and the benefits of continued therapy often outweigh the benefits of a drug holiday.
