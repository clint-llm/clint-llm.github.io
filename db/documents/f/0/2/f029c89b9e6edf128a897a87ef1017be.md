As previously described, hormones bind to cell surface receptors (i.e., norepinephrine binds beta-adrenergic receptors) to stimulate lipolysis in adipocytes. A number of lipid droplet–associated proteins are known to modulate rates of basal (non-stimulated) and stimulated lipolysis. These proteins include CGI-58 and perilipin. Perilipin is the major protein found in association with lipid droplets in adipocytes.

In the basal state, CGI-58 is bound to perilipin rendering it unable to bind to or activate ATGL. Both ATGL and HSL reside in the cytosol.

In the stimulated state, β-Adrenergic receptors signal adenylyl cyclase to generate cAMP. cAMP then binds PKA resulting in increased activity of the enzyme. PKA then phosphorylates HSL and perilipin, which causes HSL to translocate from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet. Now phosphorylated perilipin releases CGI-58 so that it can bind to and activate ATGL. Similarly to HSL, ATGL also must translocate from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet. It is important to note that MGL is localized on the surface of the lipid droplet, in the cytosol, and the ER independent of the metabolic state.
