The frequency of vesicovaginal fistula is rare in the developed world. In the developing and underdeveloped parts of the world, it has a much higher prevalence.

Hysterectomy is the most common gynecological surgery resulting in vesicovaginal fistula formation, accounting for 80% of the annual incidence in developed countries. The rate of vesicovaginal fistula formation varies with the surgical approach. The highest is with laparoscopic procedures (2.2 in 1000), followed by transabdominal (1 in 1000), and the lowest is with the transvaginal approach (0.2 in 1000).
