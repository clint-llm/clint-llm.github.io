The primary adverse effects of trazodone include headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and drowsiness/somnolence. Other risks include anticholinergic effects (dry mouth), orthostatic hypotension, QT prolongation, torsades, priapism, and an increase in suicidal thoughts. QT prolongation and arrhythmia risks are due to the interaction of trazodone with hERG potassium channels. Antidepressants are associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking, especially in younger adults, adolescents, and children. Despite the presence of anticholinergic side effects, the risk is less than tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine or amitriptyline. The risk for orthostatic hypotension is higher in the elderly, especially those with pre-existing heart conditions, due to the adrenergic α1-receptor blockade. Patients show adverse effects of somnolence and hypotension during the first week of administration. Special care is necessary for men with sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, leukemia, autonomic dysfunction, hypercoagulable state, or those who have a penile anatomic variation as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie disease, as it can cause priapism.

In some cases, trazodone use has correlated with visual hallucinations. Hallucinations generally resolve with the discontinuation of trazodone, and physicians should switch the patient to another antidepressant medication.
