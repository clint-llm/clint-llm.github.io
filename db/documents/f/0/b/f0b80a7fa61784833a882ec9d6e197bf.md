Coronary artery disease remains the number one cause of death in the United States. Given the prevalence of CAD and its risk factors, interprofessional, team-based care may result in significantly improved patient outcomes.

**Hypertension**

- The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) gives a grade A recommendation for universal screening for hypertension in patients greater than 18 years of age and a grade I (current evidence insufficient) recommendation for screening for children and adolescents.

- A systolic and diastolic blood pressure reduction of greater than 10 mmHg and 5 mmHg, respectively, led to a significant absolute risk reduction in CAD-related events (NNT 91).

- A systolic blood pressure reduction to a goal of 130 mmHg reduced the incidence of CAD (NNT 27).

- A 2002 meta-analysis revealed that systolic blood pressure reduction of 20 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg decreases the risk of death from coronary heart disease by about 50% between ages 40 to 49 and by about 1/3 between ages 80 to 89.

**Hyperlipidemia**

- The USPSTF recommends evaluation for statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease between 40 to 75 years of age.

- In 2011, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended universal screening between 9 to 11 years of age and again at 17 to 21 years of age. The American Academy of Pediatrics subsequently endorsed this. Despite the publication of these guidelines, pediatric lipid screening practice patterns have not followed suit.

- An early 1994 review showed that a 10% reduction in serum cholesterol leads to a 50%, 40%, 30%, and 20% drop in CAD risk at age 20, 50, 60, and 70, respectively.

- The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study demonstrated that statins reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events.

**Diabetes**

- The USPSTF recommends screening for abnormal glucose in patients aged 40 to 70 years old who are overweight or obese. Early screening for diabetes can also be a consideration for patients in higher-risk groups. This risk pool includes patients with a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome, or members of specified racial/ethnic groups (Blacks, American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders).

- The American Diabetes Association states that three years is a reasonable screening interval.

- A 2019 meta-analysis of 12 cardiovascular outcomes trials indicated that a 0.5% reduction in A1C conferred a 20% hazard risk reduction (95% CI 4-33%) for major cardiovascular events. This analysis included patients on peptidase-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors.

**Diet**

- The DASH, Mediterranean, and vegetarian diets have the most evidence for cardiovascular disease prevention.

- The DASH diet can reduce systolic blood pressure up to 11.5 mmHg in adults with hypertension.

- A 2017 meta-analysis and systematic review revealed an 8% risk reduction (15 studies, RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.90-0.95) of coronary artery disease for every 200 grams per day of fruits and vegetables. This effect was observable at up to 800 grams per day.

- A 2016 meta-analysis and systematic review revealed a 29% risk reduction (29 studies, RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.80) of coronary artery disease for every 28 grams per day of nut consumption.

- A 2017 narrative review revealed a decreased risk of about 20% to 25% with the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular disease. It was also showed positive effects on endothelin function, arterial stiffness, and cardiac function.

- The American Heart Association recommends the replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.

- While it is challenging to carry out research relating to diet practices and coronary artery disease, much research has taken place in the past.

- The USPSTF recommends offering or referring adults who are obese/overweight and have one additional cardiovascular risk factor intensive behavioral counseling to promote a healthful diet and physical activity (Grade B). The USPSTF also recommends individualizing the decision to offer or refer patients without obesity or other cardiovascular risk factors for behavioral counseling.

**Smoking**

- The USPSTF recommends screening for tobacco use in all adults with each clinical encounter and to provide behavioral and pharmacologic smoking cessation interventions.

- The American Heart Association recommends a combined behavioral and pharmacologic approach to maximize quit rates.

- The risk of coronary artery disease drops to a level of lifetime nonsmokers within four years of quitting, according to the FDA, and within ten years, according to the CDC.

- Behavioral interventions include motivational interviewing (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange for follow-up).

- Pharmacologic interventions such as nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, and bupropion reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms.

- A 2014 Cochrane review revealed that nicotine replacement therapies, such as nicotine gum and the nicotine patch increased the chances of smoking cessation by 49% (55 trials, RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.40-1.60) and 64% (43 trials, RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.52-1.78), respectively. The nicotine oral tablets/lozenges (6 trials, RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.61-2.36), inhaler (4 trials, RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.36-2.67), and nasal sprays (4 trials, RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.73) approximately doubled the chances of success. The combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy increased the likelihood of success by 24% compared to bupropion alone (4 trials, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06-1.45).

- Varenicline doubled the chances of smoking cessation.

- A 2014 Cochrane review showed that bupropion increases the chances of smoking cessation by 62% (44 trials, N=13,728, RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-2.78).

- A 2016 Cochrane review indicated that the combined use of behavioral support and pharmacotherapy had a higher chance of success.

**Obesity**

- A patient's body mass index (BMI) should be measured at each clinical encounter. The USPSTF recommends that practitioners offer obese adults a referral to a multicomponent behavioral interventionist.

- There is a large amount of evidence showing that in obese or overweight patients, even just a modest 5% body weight loss can lead to clinically significant health benefits.

**Exercise**

- The USPSTF recommends patients who are overweight, obese, or have CAD risk factors to intensive behavioral counseling for interventions to promote physical activity for the prevention of CAD.

- According to the National Health Interview Survey, only 20.9% of adults met the 2008 federal physical activity guidelines for aerobic and strengthening activity.

- Approximately 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.

- The AHA/ACC guidelines also recommend resistance strength training to be incorporated into regular physical activity, as this can help improve physical function and ability to exercise.

**Aspirin in Primary Prevention**

- Aspirin has long played a role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention. Although still established for secondary prevention, its use in primary prevention has more recently come into question due to a less favorable risk-benefit ratio.

- The USPSTF recommends aspirin for patients age 50 to 59 years of age, with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, and do not have bleeding risk factors. Aspirin may be considered for those 60 to 69 years of age but may have a less overall benefit and higher bleeding risk.

**New CAD Screening Tests**

**Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score**

- CAC is an established non-invasive screening test for coronary artery disease. It involves a non-contrast CT of the heart, and totals identified coronary artery calcium, a component of atherosclerosis.

- A large prospective cohort study found that CAC improved the detection of at-risk patients for having a coronary event to better match statin therapy with appropriate patients.

- The 2019 AHA/ACC primary prevention guideline recommends CAC for those who are at intermediate-risk (10-year >/=7.5% to <20%) or selected borderline risk (10-year ASCVD risk 5-<7.5%) patients. The CAC score can help patients who desire more information before starting pharmacotherapy. If the CAC score is zero, then the patient does not require a statin as long as the patient does not smoke, have diabetes mellitus, or have a family history of premature clinical ASCVD. If CAC is 1 to 99, a statin is favored in patients aged 55-years old and greater. If the CAC is 100 or in the 75th percentile or higher, then statin treatment is favored.

- The 2017 SCCT (Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography) guideline recommends shared-decision making and CAC consideration for those who are 5% to 20% 10-year ASCVD risk or < 5% 10-year ASCVD risk who have another strong indication such as those with a family history of premature CAD.

**Carotid Intimal Medial Thickness (CIMT)**

- CIMT is another proposed tool for non-invasive risk stratification for CAD. This assessment is accomplished predominantly by ultrasound, but may also use MRI. There has been conflicting data from several large studies regarding this modality, most likely due to non-standard image acquisition and analysis as well as study design differences.

- A 2012 meta-analysis combining CIMT and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) did not substantially improve risk prediction.

- The AHA/ACC changed its stance from class IIa recommendation for its use in intermediate-risk patients in 2010 to recommend against its use in a 2013 update.

- More recently, a 2017 observational multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) found that the combination of CIMT and positive CAC improved the prediction of cardiovascular risk.

**Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) and Endothelin Function**

- FMD is another proposed test that can potentially predict cardiovascular risk by measuring the health of blood vessel endothelial function. Physiologic and pharmacologic stress, such as hypertension, smoking, or certain medications, can alter this.

- There are different methods to measure FMD. Protocols involving vasoactive agents via coronary catheterization is a more direct measurement of the coronary artery endothelial function, more specifically referred to as coronary flow reserve (CFR).

- Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) are more peripheral measurements. A 2015 meta-analysis conferred that these two methods demonstrated similar prognostic value on cardiovascular outcomes. Additional research is necessary to determine whether this screening strategy can improve cardiovascular outcomes.

**Novel biomarkers**

- A 2017 article reviewed novel potential biomarkers for CAD, such as fibrinogen, hs-CRP, lipoprotein-associated PA2, lipoprotein A, hs-troponin, NT-proBNP, and cystatin C. None met all necessary criteria to be considered an ideal biomarker.
