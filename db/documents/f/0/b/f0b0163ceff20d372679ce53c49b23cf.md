One way to prevent CSF leaks is to avoid situations or activities that could injure the brain or spinal cord, such as high-impact sports, roller coasters, and other activities that could result in unexpected jolts or falls. Additionally, people with connective tissue diseases or a history of spinal or brain surgery may be more susceptible to CSF leaks and should take special care.

Another crucial component of controlling and preventing CSF leaks is patient education. The warning signs and symptoms of a CSF leak, which include headache, nausea, and a clear or salty discharge from the nose or ear, should be explained to patients. They should be told to get help from a doctor immediately if they encounter these symptoms.

Patients should also be made aware of the value of adhering to treatment recommendations, including bed rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding activities that raise intracranial pressure. Additionally, patients should be counseled against blowing their nose vigorously because doing so increases the possibility of a CSF leak.
