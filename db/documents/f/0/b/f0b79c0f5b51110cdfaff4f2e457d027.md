In patients with HIT, PTT is commonly useful to monitor argatroban therapy. Clinicians should obtain a baseline PTT, and the initial dosing should be adjusted to obtain a steady-state PTT of 1.5 to 3 times baseline (not to exceed 100 seconds). The PTT should also be obtained 2 hours after the initiation of therapy and after any change in dosage.

In the PCI setting, where a higher argatroban dose is used, activated clotting time (ACT) is used to monitor therapy.
