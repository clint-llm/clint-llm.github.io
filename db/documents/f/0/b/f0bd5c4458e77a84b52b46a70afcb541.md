The desired recipient graft number (total number of grafts needed) is calculated by multiplying the measured recipient area by the desired graft density (target density should be around 30 FUs per cm^2). If planning FUT for graft harvest, the strip length is calculated by dividing the desired recipient graft number by the donor site density (using a densitometer). The strip should be around 1 to 1.5 cm wide, but no larger to allow tension-free wound closure.

Anxiolytics may be given pre-operatively, per surgeon and patient preference.

The administration of antibiotics covering skin flora should is necessary pre-operatively.

A single dose of pre-operative systemic steroids (i.e., 40 mg of prednisone) may help with scalp swelling.

The recipient area is marked, including the proposed hairline and direction/pattern of native FUs.

The donor site is shaved and marked according to the technique employed.

Anesthesia is obtained using a combination of local injections and regional nerve blocks (supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticofrontal, and occipital).

Tumescent anesthesia and tumescent saline are infiltrated to the proposed donor and implantation sites as needed to facilitate graft harvest and placement, respectively.
