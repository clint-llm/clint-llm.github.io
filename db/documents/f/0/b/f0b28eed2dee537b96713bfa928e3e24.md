Clinically symptomatic osteoarthritis progresses slowly over time but can accelerate with trauma or overuse. Radiographic progression is also usually slowly progressive. High-quality data are lacking to support which findings indicate a poor prognostic value. It is generally understood that certain presentations are linked with a less favorable prognosis, including severe pain, muscle weakness, high BMI, worsening radiographic findings, depression, and widespread disease. A high BMI and intensive physical activity at work predict knee replacement surgery in the future.
