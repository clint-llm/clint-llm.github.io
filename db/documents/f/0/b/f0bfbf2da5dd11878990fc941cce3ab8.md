The risorius muscle sits atop the orbicularis oris and the depressor anguli oris at its most anterior aspect and is superficial to the superficial masseter muscle at its posterior portion. There are spaces on the superior and inferior aspects of the muscle. The inferior space is rectangular with its borders comprised of the superficial masseter posteriorly, the platysma inferiorly, the depressor anguli oris anteriorly, and the risorius superiorly. This inferior rectangular space contains a buccal branch of the facial nerve, as well as the facial artery and vein anteriorly. The mandible is deep to this space. The superior triangular space is comprised of the superficial masseter posteriorly, the risorius inferiorly, and the zygomaticus major muscle makes up the hypotenuse. Deep to this space is the buccinator artery, vein, and nerves, all of which sit atop the buccinator muscle.
