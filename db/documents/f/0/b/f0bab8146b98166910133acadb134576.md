Congenital diaphragmatic hernias, such as Bochdalek hernia, are the most common reported anomaly of the diaphragm detected in utero. However, there are other considerations such as congenital diaphragmatic eventration, diaphragmatic paralysis, and extralobar pulmonary sequestration, which are detectable during pregnancy. Congenital diaphragmatic eventration is thought to be secondary to defective development of the diaphragmatic musculature with subsequent focal thinning. Whereas, extralobar pulmonary sequestration is lung parenchyma with separate pleural and vascular supply.

In adults, diaphragmatic rupture or other sources of acquired diaphragmatic hernia can be a consideration.
