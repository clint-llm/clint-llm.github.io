Types of laxatives are classified by the mechanism of action they exert in the body.

- **Bulk-forming Laxatives:**These agents retain fluid in the stool and increase stool weight and consistency.

- **Osmotic Agents:**This class of medicines is poorly absorbable and draws water into the lumen of the bowel.

- **Prokinetic Agents:**Cisapride and tegaserod work as agonists of 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptors.

- **Lubricants:**Mineral oil aid in the passage of stools by its lubricating action throughout the intestines.

- **Stimulants:**They stimulate the myenteric plexus and the Auerbach plexus, which increase intestinal secretions and motility.

- **Surface Active Agents:**Docusate lowers the surface tension, which leads to water and fats penetrating the stool.

- **Guanylate Cyclase Agonist:**Linaclotide induces cGMP; this leads to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which, in turn, causes water and electrolyte secretion into the lumen.

- **Chloride Channel Activator:**Lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, leads to water and chloride secretion into the stool and softer stool consistency.
