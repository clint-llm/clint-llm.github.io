**Posterior Pituitary and Renal System**

During the dehydrated state, the hyperosmolar plasma means less fluid in the plasma, making it more concentrated. With the increase in plasma osmolality, water will move out of the cells, and cells will shrink. There are special neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus that act as osmoreceptors. When these neurons shrink, they undergo stretch and negative pressure suction; thus, they will be depolarized via transient receptor potential vanilloid cation channels. These channels' function is to increase the charge inside the cells and cause them to depolarize, resulting in signaling inside the posterior pituitary, which will lead to the release of the ADH. The ADH works at the renal principal cells and collecting ducts via the V2 receptors, which will prompt an increase in the cAMP inside the cells. This increase in cAMP will induce aquaporin's insertion in the plasma membrane's apical side, creating a channel through which water can be reabsorbed from the filtrate, leading to a reduction in plasma osmolality.

During the hypoosmolar state, the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei neurons will not undergo any stretch or negative pressure suction. This state will result in hyperpolarization of the neuron. This will decrease ADH's release from the posterior pituitary gland, allowing the kidneys to excrete more dilute urine and increase the plasma osmolality back to the physiologic set point.

**Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS)**

There are special cells in the wall of the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney called macula densa cells; their primary function is to sense sodium chloride's (NaCl) concentration in the filtrate. Two physiologic scenarios can happen:

1. The filtrate has a low NaCl concentration: The macula densa cells sense this, so they will signal for the dilation of the afferent renal arterioles, which increases the glomerular hydrostatic pressure and helps the return of the glomerular filtration rate toward normal. The macula densa will also release prostaglandin E2, which will increase the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells, the primary storage of renin. The conversion of angiotensinogen, which is made in the liver, to angiotensin 1, is catalyzed by renin in the vasculature. Then, angiotensin 1 will be converted to angiotensin 2 in the lungs by the angiotensin-converting enzyme.

The effects of angiotensin 2 are:

- Stimulate the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland.

- Increases the blood pressure by the contraction of vascular myocytes, leading to higher hydrostatic pressure, which increases filtrate production.

- Increases sympathetic activity.

- Increases the tubular NaCl reabsorption and excretion of potassium and water, which results in increased plasma NaCl concentration, which will lead to increased plasma osmolality.

2. The filtrate has a high NaCl concentration: In this scenario, the cells of the macula densa decrease their release of prostaglandins, which inhibits the RAAS pathway.
