- Due to its lack of muscular attachments and the pattern of blood supply, the talus is prone to significant injury and long-term morbidity

- Vascular supply to the talus is from the posterior tibial artery, dorsalis pedis artery, and perforating peroneal artery

- Nondisplaced talar fractures receive conservative treatment

- Displaced talar fractures necessitate surgical intervention - anatomic reduction of the fracture fragments is necessary to maintain congruity of the adjacent joints and reduce the incidence of secondary osteoarthrosis and osteonecrosis

- Talar done compression fractures may be radiographically occult, and patients often receive the diagnosis of an ankle sprain; CT is necessary for clinically suspected radiographically-occult foot and ankle fractures

- There are different classification schemes for fractures of the talar neck and body, with important treatment implications for the various fracture types
