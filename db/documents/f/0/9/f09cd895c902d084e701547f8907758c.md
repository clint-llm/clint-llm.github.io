Digoxin and digitoxin are the two main cardioactive steroids used in practice. Both have differences in their kinetics; digitoxin is more readily absorbed, more protein-bound, and with a lower volume of distribution. Digitoxin clears out mostly by hepatic metabolism (80%), whereas digoxin gets eliminated through the renal route.

Eubacterium lentum, an enteric bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract, inhibits digoxin absorption. Antibiotics that may inhibit the growth of these regulatory bacteria in the gut may cause increased digoxin absorption.
