The development of regional anesthesia started with the isolation of local anesthetics, the first being cocaine (the only naturally occurring local anesthetic). The first regional anesthetic technique performed was spinal anesthesia, and the first operation under spinal anesthesia was in 1898 in Germany by August Bier. Before this, the only local anesthetic techniques were topical anesthesia of the eye and infiltration anesthesia.

The central nervous system (CNS) comprises the brain and spinal cord. The term neuraxial anesthesia refers to the placement of local anesthetic in or around the CNS. Spinal anesthesia is a neuraxial anesthesia technique in which local anesthetic is placed directly in the intrathecal space (subarachnoid space). The subarachnoid space houses sterile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the clear fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. There are roughly about 130 to 140 mL of CSF in an adult human which continually cycles throughout the day. Approximately 500 mL of CSF gets produced daily.

Other neuraxial techniques include epidural and caudal anesthesia, each having its particular indications. Spinal anesthesiaÂ is only performed in the lumbar spine for reasons which will be discussed later in this article, used for surgical procedures involving the lower abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities.
