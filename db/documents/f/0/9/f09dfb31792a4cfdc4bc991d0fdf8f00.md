There are many reasons pediatric SBME has increased in utilization, demand, and necessity over the past 20 years. One of the most important is medicine's increasing focus on patient safety. This has obvious implications on a trainee's experience, including the pressure of increased faculty supervision and a push for demonstration of competence. In line with improving patient safety includes a push to practice evidence-based medicine. A growing trend in medicine is the desire to reduce unnecessary interventions and decrease iatrogenic complications; specific to pediatrics is an interest in decreasing lumbar puncture rates in neonatal fever, increased utilization of bag-mask ventilation over intubation, and reduction in appendectomies for uncomplicated appendicitis to name a few.

In addition to decreasing procedure necessity, medical students and residents are increasingly under work hour restrictions.
