Lambl excrescences are rare in clinical medicine but because of their potential to cause embolic events, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes cardiac nurses. Lambl excrescences are rare growths on the valves, especially the aortic valves. Not much is known as to why they occur. They have the potential to embolize but many people remain asymptomatic. Because of the rarity of the disorder, there are no established guidelines on how to manage them. Anecdotal data suggests that in fit patients surgery to excise or replace the valve may be prudent. In others, watching may be undertaken with the provision that the patient is aware of the potential for an embolic stroke.

The outlook for patients who suffer a stroke or ischemic of the bowel is guarded.
