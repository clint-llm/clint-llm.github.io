**Pearls and Key Issues**

- Pulseless VT is a medical emergency that requires immediate defibrillation.

- The energy of 150-200 J on biphasic and 360 J on monophasic defibrillator should be used.

- Delaying defibrillation of pulseless VT dramatically decreases the survival rate.

- Critical interventions in the post-arrest phase are coronary angiography and PCI.

- Implantation of ICD is indicated both for primary and secondary prevention of VT/V-fib.
