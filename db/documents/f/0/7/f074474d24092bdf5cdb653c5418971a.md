The function of the polyol pathway is clear - to provide an alternate route of glucose metabolism when the high glucose levels overwhelm the primary glycolytic pathway. However, the polyol pathway also plays a prominent role in disrupting the redox balance of NADP+ and NADPH.

As mentioned earlier, aldolase reductase utilizes an NADPH to drive the first step. This eventually results in a significant depletion of NADPH levels in the body. Research has shown a decrease of NADPH in the pancreas and lungs of a diabetic patient and a 15% decrease in the lens of a diabetic patient.

This also leads to a subsequent impairment in glucose metabolism. The second step in this pathway, converting sorbitol to fructose, requires NAD+ to drive the reaction forward; this inherently produces a molecule of NADH. This process has a multitude of deleterious effects. Sirtuins are histone deacetylases that are dependent on NAD+ for their function. The depletion of NAD+ impairs the sirtuin pathway, which is responsible for the deacetylation of proteins in the human body.

The surplus of NADH inhibits other glucose metabolic pathways such as the Krebs pathway, the glycolytic pathway, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

The polyol pathway has also been credited as an explanation of complications in diabetic patients, specifically in the kidney, retina, and nerves.
