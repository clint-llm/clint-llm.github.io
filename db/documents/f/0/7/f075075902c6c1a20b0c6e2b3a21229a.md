There may be a slight decrease in penis size in cryptorchid patients.

It has been suggested that adjuvant LHRH treatment be offered to cryptorchid patients with a high risk for infertility due to their insufficient gonadotropin stimulation at the time of surgery. Sperm cryopreservation is another prophylactic option in case of resultant infertility despite the adjuvant LHRH.

Non-union, a rare anomaly involving the epididymis and testicle, can sometimes be mistaken for a testicular nubbin (atrophic testis) when it is actually the vas and epididymis. The actual testicle in this condition is located proximally and can be identified via laparoscopy.
