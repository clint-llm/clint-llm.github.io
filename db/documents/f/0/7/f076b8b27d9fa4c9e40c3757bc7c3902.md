Impetigo can be classified as either primary or secondary.  Primary impetigo involves previously normal skin affected by direct bacterial invasion.  Secondary impetigo involves infection forming at a previous skin wound site.

Any disturbance of the skin barrier leads to access to fibronectin receptors by GABHS and S aureus which require fibronectin for colonization. Trauma, cuts, insect bites, surgery, atopic dermatitis, burns, and varicella are common mechanisms of skin breakdown. Once a lesion is present, self-inoculation to other sites is very common. Malnutrition, immunosuppression, daycare attendance, overcrowding, diabetes, and poor hygiene make one more susceptible to impetigo.

Triggers that breakdown skin and increase susceptibility to impetigo include:

- Varicella

- Herpes

- Scratching

- Lice

- Burns

- Trauma

- Insect bites
