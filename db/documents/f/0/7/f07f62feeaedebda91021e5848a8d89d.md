Chronic suppurative otitis media is a type of ear disease where there is an ongoing chronic infection of the middle ear without an intact tympanic membrane; it usually occurs in early childhood, typically around 2 years of age. An episode of acute otitis media often precedes this condition, and when suspected, prompt isolation of the etiologic agent is necessary. If left untreated, chronic suppurative otitis media can lead to severe complications, including polyps, sclerosis, tympanosclerosis, labyrinthitis, epidural, subdural, or brain abscesses, and conductive or sensorineural hearing loss affecting the child's performance in school. Early detection and initiation of treatment are crucial to have better outcomes and prevent complications.

By following the steps mentioned above, the pediatrician will be able to diagnosed and treat chronic suppurative otitis media properly. It is worthwhile to engage otolaryngology, especially in cases that may require further interventions beyond antibiotics.
