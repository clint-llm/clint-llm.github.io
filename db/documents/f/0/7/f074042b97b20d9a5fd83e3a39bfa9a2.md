The pathophysiology of dysplastic nevi is not well understood. The inheritance pattern is complicated, as they occur more commonly than autosomal dominant inheritance. Unlike patients with familial melanoma who often demonstrate a CDKN2A gene mutation, dysplastic nevi do not commonly display this mutated gene. Recent studies noted that dysplastic nevi are clonal like common nevi, and some have BRAF, p16, or p53 alterations in expression. Also, dysplastic nevi were found to have higher proliferative rates than common nevi, as measured by proliferative markers Ki-67 and cyclin D1.
