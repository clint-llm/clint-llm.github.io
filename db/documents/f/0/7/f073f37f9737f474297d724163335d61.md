There are some other benign or neoplastic lesions in the esophagus clinically and microscopically mimicking liposarcoma. First is the typical lipoma, which is composed of benign mature adipose tissue and lacks lipoblasts or any atypical nuclei. Second is the fibroepithelial polyp, which is usually characterized histologically by fibrovascular cores with overlying non-keratinizing squamous epithelium. Although large polyps may have adipose tissue with myxoid areas, closely mimicking myxoid or well-differentiated liposarcoma, they can be ruled out by immunohistochemical stains (fibroepithelial polyp stains negative for either CDK4 or MDM2). Leiomyoma/leiomyosarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor are two other entities that can mimic liposarcoma. Leiomyoma/leiomyosarcoma are composed of intersecting bundles of smooth muscle cells with characteristic nuclei with blunt ends and are immunohistochemically positive for actin and desmin. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells are also spindle-shaped but show immunoreactivity to CD34 and c-Kit (CD117).
