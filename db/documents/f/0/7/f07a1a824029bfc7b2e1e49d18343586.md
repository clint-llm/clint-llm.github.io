**The Lower Thoracic Splanchnic Nerve:**

This nerve plays a role in pain perception in cases of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. The greater splanchnic nerve assists with the motility of the foregut; it also provides the adrenal medulla by the sympathetic innervation. Additionally, it supplies the alimentary canal, gallbladder, liver,  pancreas, spleen, and the adrenal medulla.

**Lumbar Splanchnic Nerve:**

This nerve provides sympathetic innervation to the smooth muscles of the pelvic viscera and hindgut. Mainly, it targets the kidneys and the large intestine.

**Sacral Splanchnic Nerve:**

The sacral splanchnic nerve gives both sensory and motor innervation to the back of the thigh, part of the pelvis, and most of the lower legs and feet.

**Pelvic Splanchnic Nerve:**

The pelvic viscera controlled parasympathetically via the pelvic splanchnic nerves, which then merges with inferior hypogastric vessels (IHV) and gives branches that contribute innervation to the fundus of the bladder, spermatic cord and ductus deferens. Also, it provides branches into the prostatic plexus for which it supplies the corpora cavernosa, the prostate, and urethra. However, in females, this nerve gives branches to supply the clitoris, the wall of the vagina, and the erectile tissue of the vestibule.
