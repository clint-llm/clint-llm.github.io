There is no blood test that could help in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

MRI of the carpal tunnel is particularly useful preoperatively if a space-occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel is suggested. MRI is a resource-intensive investigation and does not rule out other differential diagnoses.

**Ultrasonography**

Ultrasonography potentially can identify space-occupying lesions in the carpal tunnel. It can also detect abnormalities in the median nerve like an increased cross-sectional area that can be diagnostic of CTS. Ultrasonography can also help to guide steroid injections into the carpal tunnel.

**Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Studies**

Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are the basis for carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis. Other clinical or special exams do not confirm carpal tunnel syndrome but do assist in ruling out other diagnoses. These findings can prompt electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Abnormalities on electrophysiologic testing, in association with specific symptoms and signs, are considered the gold standard for CTS diagnosis. Electrophysiologic testing also can assess the severity of the damage to the nerve and also determine prognosis. CTS is usually divided into mild, moderate, and severe. In mild CTS patients have sensory abnormalities alone on electrophysiologic testing, and in moderate CTS patients have sensory plus motor abnormalities.
