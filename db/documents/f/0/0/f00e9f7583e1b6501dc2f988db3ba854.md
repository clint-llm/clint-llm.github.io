The C1-C3 nerves relay pain signals to the nociceptive nucleus of the head and neck, the trigeminocervical nucleus. This connection is thought to be the cause of referred pain to the occiput and/or eyes. (Wang 2014). Aseptic inflammation and neurotransmission within the C-fibers caused by cervical disc pathology are thought to produce and worsen the pain in a cervicogenic headache.

The trigeminocervical nucleus receives afferents from the trigeminal nerve and the upper three cervical spinal nerves. Neck trauma, whiplash, strain, or chronic spasm of the scalp, neck, or shoulder muscles can increase the sensitivity of the area, which is similar to the allodynia that is seen in late chronic migraines. A lower pain threshold makes patients more susceptible to more severe pain. For this reason, early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention are very important.

About 70 percent of cases of cervicogenic headache involve pathology of the C2-3 zygapophyseal joint, making it the most frequent source.
