**Protein Sequencing**

There are several laboratory methods used to determine the characteristics of a protein. These are tests that determine the type, amount, and charge of the amino acids in a protein.

**Acid Hydrolysis**

- Used to determine the types of amino acids in a protein.

- This method can not determine the sequence.

- Acid hydrolysis is performed by dipping a protein into acid, which denatures the protein.

**Gel Electrophoresis**

- Uses agarose gel to separate proteins primarily by size.

- It can also separate them by charge if electrodes are added.

- Smaller proteins migrate further.

- Larger proteins stay closer to the start site.

- It does not sequence proteins.

- There is an electrophoretic pattern for any polypeptide; therefore, gel electrophoresis can be used to detect it.

**Ninhydrin Reaction**

- It is a chemical reaction that reacts with an amino acid on the amino-terminal (left).

- Reacts with all amino acids creating a purple color.

- The proline reaction creates a yellow color.

- Used to count the number of prolines in a specific protein.

**Edman's Degradation**

- Uses a reagent called phenylisothiocyanate.

- Reacts with any amino acid starting on the amino-terminal.

- Amino acids are identified using thin-layer chromatography or high-performance liquid chromatography.

- The procedure is accurate only up to 30 amino acids.

**Restriction Peptidases**

- Determines a sequence by cutting apart a protein into sets of amino acids.

- The peptidases are restricted in what they can recognize and cut.

- Reverse engineering is then used to figure out how they must have been connected.

- Used to sequence proteins.

- Have to derive the sequence.

- Must first know what amino acids the enzymes recognize.

- Trypsin cuts to the right of LYS and ARG.

- Chymotrypsin cuts to the right of the aromatic amino acids, PHE, TRP.

- Elastase cuts to the right of GLY, ALA, SER, the three smallest amino acids.

- Cyanogen bromide cuts to the right of MET.

- Aminopeptidase cuts to the right of any amino acid on the amino-terminal.

- Mercaptoethanol breaks up disulfide bonds.

- Carboxypeptidase cuts to the left of any amino acid on the carboxyl-terminal.
