The main pathophysiology is the defect in the trabecular meshwork development and the anterior chamber angle. This hampers the aqueous outflow through the anterior chamber, thus leading to increased intraocular pressures. Another theory given by Barkan, which was later disproved, was the presence of an imperforate membrane at the angle of the anterior chamber, which was proposed to impede the aqueous outflow.

Presently, the most accepted theory is that proposed by Anderson, which states that excessive collagen meshwork within the trabeculum prevents normal insertion of the ciliary body and iris.
