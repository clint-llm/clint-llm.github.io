Professionals thoroughly describe heroin toxicity in the literature and popular media. With the high rate of prescription opioid addiction (see opioid use disorder) and the lower cost of heroin, many individuals have developed heroin dependence.

The antidote for heroin overdose or poisoning is naloxone. Naloxone binds with high affinity to the Mu receptors in the CNS.

Naltrexone, a long-acting opioid antagonist, is available both orally and as a long-acting intramuscular injection. However, the risk of precipitating a prolonged withdrawal syndrome prohibits the use as an antidote for initial reversal.
