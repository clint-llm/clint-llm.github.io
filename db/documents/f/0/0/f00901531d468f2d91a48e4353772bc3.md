During the hospital and rehabilitation course, these patients will undoubtedly see many different medical teams. The initial evaluation and stabilization efforts are likely to be performed in the emergency department by the trauma service. When a fracture is present, the orthopedic surgeon is also involved early in the care process and responsible for definitive care of the associated orthopedic injury and potential surgical wounds and incisions. A thorough exam by these initial providers may identify concern for internal degloving early in the hospital course and limit complications during treatment as well asÂ decrease the incidence of missing these often overlooked injuries.

While often not involved in performing the initial drainage of the lesion - they are frequently consulted for wound coverage, chronic lesions, and tissue rearrangement. The plastic surgeon may also assume care in an outpatient setting for contouring or cosmetic procedures after the initial wound is healed.
