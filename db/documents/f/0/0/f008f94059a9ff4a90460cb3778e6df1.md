The assessment of migraine severity can be done through several scales, of which the most commonly used is the Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire (MIDAS).

The initial treatment of a migraine is with drugs and behavioral methods, but often, patients develop refractoriness to these therapies.

When there is suspicion of a rhinogenic headache, the clinician can order a computed tomography (CT) scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses.
