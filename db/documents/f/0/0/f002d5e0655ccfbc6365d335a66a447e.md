VKDB is a potentially devastating consequence of vitamin K deficiency in the neonatal period. Vitamin K prophylaxis in newborns should occur within an hour of birth to prevent severe bleeding. Infants who do not receive an intramuscular injection should receive repeated oral doses for a minimum of 6 weeks.

Vitamin K supplementation in calcific cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis may reduce morbidity and mortality. Patients without contraindications, such as warfarin administration, should be considered for vitamin K supplementation.
