Toxicity from procainamide overdose is rare as it is usually given IV in a monitored setting. However, it is plausible to administer a toxic dose accidentally or when a patient with renal impairment receives an inaccurate dose. Consultation of a medical toxicologist and regional poison control center is necessary in cases of oral procainamide overdose. Treatment would theoretically be similar to an overdose of other Class 1A antiarrhythmics, including quinidine and disopyramide, in which the patient receives hypertonic sodium bicarbonate to block sodium channels.
