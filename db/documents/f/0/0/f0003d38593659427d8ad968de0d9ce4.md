The coronary arteries play a crucial role in maintaining the function of the cardiac muscle by delivering oxygen and other nutrients. The anterior right atrial arteries (ARAA) originate from the right coronary artery (RCA), which emerges from the anterior ascending aorta. The ARAA primarily supplies blood to the anterior portion of the right atrium and secondarily supplies the inter-atrial groove and part of the left atrium.
