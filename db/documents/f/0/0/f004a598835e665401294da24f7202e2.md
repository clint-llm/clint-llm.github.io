Posterior shoulder instability is an uncommon entity and can be difficult to diagnose, especially in cases involving repetitive microtrauma.

- Suprascapular nerve entrapment

- Quadrilateral space syndrome

- Posterior glenoid spur (Bennett lesion)

- Early osteoarthritis

- Tumor

Clinicians should also distinguish between laxity and symptomatic instability. Multiple studies have shown that healthy subjects may demonstrate as much glenohumeral translation as those with symptomatic instability.

Lastly, clinicians should also consider those with psychological problems who are able to voluntarily subluxate their shoulders. These patients may develop instability in adolescence for secondary gain and are able to willingly subluxate their shoulders with the arm at the side.
