Papular acrodermatitis of childhood, otherwise known as Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, is a benign rash associated with a wide variety of viral illnesses. While historically thought to be solely a manifestation of hepatitis B infection, it has been demonstrated to occur following many viral illnesses and vaccination, which suggests that this is an immunologic response rather than a primary manifestation of infection. Papular acrodermatitis of childhood is characterized by the acute eruption of monomorphic skin-colored to pink-red papules on the face, buttocks, and extensor surfaces of the extremities. The lesions usually spontaneously resolve, and treatment is supportive.
