In most US therapy, physicians and support staff are relevant to the procedure. Clinicians are the primary care provider for therapeutic ultrasound, while support staff often assist in monitoring patients and equipment. Musculoskeletal applications of low-intensity ultrasound are an exception to this rule. Due to the limited safety risks for low-intensity ultrasound, many physical therapists and physicians can provide this treatment with little or no assistance.
