Supratrochlear nerve: The supratrochlear nerve is a branch of the frontal nerve (branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve).

Course: The supratrochlear nerve passes forward relative to levator palpebrae superioris muscle; turns medially above the trochlea. Here it gives a descending branch to the infratrochlear nerve then enters into the forehead through the frontal notch.

Branches and area of distribution: The descending branch of the supratrochlear nerve combine with the infratrochlear branch of the nasociliary nerve.
