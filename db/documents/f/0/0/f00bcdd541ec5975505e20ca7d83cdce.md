Like many inhaled anesthetics, enflurane is contraindicated forÂ a patient with a personal history or family history of malignant hyperthermia. Depending on hospital policy, either the machine will be cleaned so there would be no lingering traces of any inhaled gas in the machine, or a different machine used only for patients with malignant hyperthermia will be in the operating room.

Generally, it is contraindicated in pregnancy or during breastfeeding and in patients with convulsive disorders.
