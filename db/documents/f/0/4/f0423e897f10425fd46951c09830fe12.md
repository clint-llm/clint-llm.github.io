Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) (previously called herpes gestationis) is a rare, specific dermatosis of pregnancy. It is a bullous autoimmune, sub-epidermal dermatosis clinically and pathogenetically similar to bullous pemphigoid. It occurs during the third trimester and less commonly in the second trimester or even after delivery, but it can manifest in principle during all three trimesters. It manifests with inflammatory skin lesions and severe pruritus. It recurs in subsequent pregnancies earlier and as a more serious course.
