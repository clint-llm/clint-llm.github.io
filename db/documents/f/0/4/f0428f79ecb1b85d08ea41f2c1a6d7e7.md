The primary function of the Bartholin glands is the production of a mucoid secretion that lubricates the distal end of the vagina during intercourse. The glands become active after menarche and are non-palpable. Each gland is oval-shaped and measures, on average, 0.5 cm. A two-centimeter-long efferent duct connects each gland to the posterolateral aspect of the vaginal orifice (between the hymen and the labia minora).
