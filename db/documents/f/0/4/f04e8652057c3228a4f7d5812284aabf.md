The North American incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ranges from 2.2 to 19.2 cases per 100,000 person-years for ulcerative colitis and 3.1 to 20.2 cases per 200,000 person-years for CD. Prevalence in the United States of adult ulcerative colitis was 238 per 100,000 population and 201 per 100,000 population from data in a large study based on insurance claims. IBD is much more prevalent in North America and Europe than in Asia or Africa. Although most IBD occurs in people age 15 to 30 years, up to 25% of patients will develop IBD by adolescence. There appears to be a bimodal distribution with a second peak of 10% to 15% developing IBD after age 60.

Crohn disease is slightly more common in females compared to males, but ulcerative colitis appears to be equally present in both genders. IBD is generally a disorder of developed countries and colder climates.
