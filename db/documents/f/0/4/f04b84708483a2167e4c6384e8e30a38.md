Beneath the TPF is a loose areolar and avascular plane separating the TPF from the deep temporal fascia. This layer may be referred to as the innominate fascia. It is this plane of tissue that permits the superficial scalp to move freely over the deeper muscular fascial layers. The combination of the superficial loose layers and the deep tight layers allows the scalp to maintain structural integrity with necessary mobility. Additionally, the role of fascia within the human body is to enclose structures (i.e., muscles, viscera, or neurovascular bundles) into discrete organizational patterns.
