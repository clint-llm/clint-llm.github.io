It is essential that clinicians and nursing staff in the newborn nursery maintain clinical suspicion for neonatal hypoglycemia as symptoms are vague and nonspecific. For infants at risk for persistent hypoglycemia, it is vital to establish that the infant can maintain blood glucose levels at target range before discharge home, as persistent hypoglycemia may not manifest clinical symptoms until after the first 48 hours of life, by which time many infants have already been discharged home.
