Interprofessional interventions target identifying T2DM in patients with obesity. Providers should be knowledgeable about medications that promote weight gain and consider alternatives. Nurses check the BMI at each visit and alert the treating provider when the value exceeds 25 kg/m. These patients are screened for T2DM if that has not been done previously. Primary care clinicians recommend lifestyle interventions for all patients with a BMI greater than 25 kg/m. Standard written instructions about diet and exercise are reviewed at each visit.

Clinicians help patients identify measurable weight loss goals to reach a BMI less than 25 kg/m or a 5 to 10% weight loss. A BMI greater than 30 kg/m alerts providers to consider ILI and pharmacological treatments. Registered dieticians and nutritionists provide information for patients to make healthy dietary choices. A multidisciplinary approach with closed-loop communication between primary care providers and endocrinologists can improve outcomes. If ILI and pharmacotherapy fail to achieve adequate diabetes control and weight loss, timely referral to bariatric and metabolic surgeons is essential for optimal patient care.
