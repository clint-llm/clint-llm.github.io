Complications of cardiac amyloidosis are mainly due to structural abnormalities potentiating chances of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrhythmias.

- Atrial fibrillation – can lead to thromboembolism and heart failure.

- Diastolic dysfunction - heart failure. Increased mortality. Increased arrhythmogenesis.

- Heart failure hospitalizations and mortality.

- Ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac conduction abnormalities.

- Autonomic neuropathy - in systemic involvement.

- Tendinopathies - in systemic involvement.
