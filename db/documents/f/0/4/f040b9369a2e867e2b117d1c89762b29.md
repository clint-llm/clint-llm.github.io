Patients with low serum HDL cholesterol can significantly differ in their clinical presentation, depending on the underlying cause.

Patients may have an underlying history of:

- Premature atherosclerosis

- Coronary heart disease

- Peripheral Vascular disease

- Stroke or TIA

- Carotid stenosis

Patients may also have a history of secondary causes of low HDL cholesterol, including the following:

- Tobacco use

- Sedentary lifestyle

- Renal disease

- Medications (beta blockers, thiazides, benzodiazepines)

Patients with HDL deficiency, but normal levels of LDL-C and triglycerides, can present with xanthomas and premature coronary heart disease. Patients with premature coronary disease may show signs of congestive heart failure (jugular venous distention, crackles at lung bases on auscultation, hepatomegaly, pitting edema) or arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation)

Patients with familial lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency may present with corneal opacities, anemia, proteinuria, and kidney failure.

Familial partial LCAT deficiency (fish-eye disease), a variant of LCAT deficiency, was first reported in 1975 in a 61-year-old woman with marked corneal opacifications. The patient's eye resembled "boiled fish." Consequently, this condition was called fish-eye disease. The same corneal opacifications were also seen in her sisters and father.

Tangier disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene. Patients with Tangier disease have evidence of orange mucosa in their oral pharynx. The orange color is secondary to cholesterol-laden macrophages. Other significant clinical findings in Tangier disease are corneal opacification, hepatosplenomegaly, and peripheral neuropathy. In some cases, premature coronary heart disease (CHD) has been reported.
