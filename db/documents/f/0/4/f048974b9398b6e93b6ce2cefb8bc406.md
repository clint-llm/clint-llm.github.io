An individual with AI tends to complain of blurry vision during near visual tasks,Â headaches, visual fatigue, and other asthenopic symptoms (such as eyestrain, diplopia, etc.).

Young children may become symptomatic after an illness or fever.

The clinician should consider other essential factors in the history of the patient, which include: substance abuse, trauma, infectious disease, anemia, demyelinating disease, myasthenia gravis (MG being the more localized finding), and Grave's orbitopathy.
