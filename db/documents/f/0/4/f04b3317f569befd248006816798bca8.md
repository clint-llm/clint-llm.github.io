There have been no treatments proven to be unvaryingly successful. The current mainstay of treatment is strict sun protection with broad-spectrum sunscreens (UVA and UVB protection), photoprotective clothing, tinted windows, and midday sun avoidance. Antimalarials, azathioprine, cyclosporine, thalidomide, beta-carotene, and oral fish oils have demonstrated variable success.
