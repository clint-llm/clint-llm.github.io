Complications of empyema can be secondary to the underlying disease process, and patients may succumb to worsening sepsis, septic shock, or death. Complications can also arise from incomplete drainage due to tube malposition or tube malfunction. This complication can lead to pneumothorax, bronchopleural fistulas, and pleural fibrosis with subsequent trapped lung. One rare complication, empyema necessitans, refers to the extension and subsequent dissection into the subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall.
