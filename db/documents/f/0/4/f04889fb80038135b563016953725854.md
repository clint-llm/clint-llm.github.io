Lab and radiologic tests are done more for excluding other etiologies such as appendicitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, or inflammatory bowel diseases. Stool cultures should be done to make the diagnosis of Y. enterocolitica. If this particular bacteria is suspected, the microbiology department should be notified because isolation of this organism from stool requires the use of a special Cefsulodin-Irgasan-Novobiocin (CIN) agar. In severe progressive cases, especially in immunocompromised patients, CT imaging may be needed to confirm or rule out intrahepatic or splenic abscesses.
