Nerve ablation for back pain is commonly done as an outpatient but still requires the efforts of an interprofessional team. While a physician does the actual ablation, patient monitoring is frequently done by a dedicated nurse/nurse anesthetist. The patient must have the vital signs monitored at regular intervals, and if any sedation is used, the pulse oximeter must be continuously monitored; these duties will often fall to the nursing staff to report any incongruities promptly. Intravenous access should be in place in case the patient develops hypotension or requires more sedation. Finally, if conscious sedation is used, the antidotes to the medications used must be in the room. After the procedure, the patient should be monitored in the recovery room for several hours by the post-anesthesiaÂ recovery nurse. Before discharge, the patient should be informed about the possible side effects of the procedure and when to return to the hospital. Interprofessional teamwork will result in improved patient outcomes.
