Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality. It requires a multifaceted treatment approach, including patient education, pharmacologic management, and surgical interventions to optimize clinical outcomes. Specialty trained HF nurses are essential to the interprofessional team caring for patients with HF. They educate the patient on the importance of lifestyle modifications and medical compliance to help improve morbidity and mortality for the patient. They also educate the patient on symptom and weight management to prevent HF exacerbations and hospital admissions. The HF-trained social worker and case manager can help evaluate the patient in community settings/in-home visits to help the patient adhere to the lifestyle modifications recommended by the medical team. The clinical pharmacists assist the medical providers by reviewing patient medication lists and decreasing potential adverse drug-drug interactions. Primary care medical providers and cardiologists must coordinate care to minimize any adverse outcomes of medical therapy and prevent the progression of this disease. A collaborative interprofessional team can greatly improve the quality of life for patients with HF and decrease mortality.[Level 5]
