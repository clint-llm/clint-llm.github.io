- Asymptomatic carotid stenosis > 60% by angiography or 70% by duplex ultrasound.

- Symptomatic carotid stenosis (cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax) > 50%.

- Carotid endarterectomy can be performed safely under regional anesthesia in patients with a severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and other comorbidities.

- Carotid stenting can be considered in patients with a history of neck irradiation, modified radical neck dissection, or reoperative carotid endarterectomy.

- Only patients with concurrent symptomatic carotid stenosis and symptomatic CAD should be considered for combined carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting.
