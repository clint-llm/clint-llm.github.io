Pulmonary embolisms usually originate from the deep veins of the lower extremities and/or pelvis. Dislodgement of a deep vein thrombus (DVT) can result in the blood clot traveling up the venous system through the right heart and lodging in the pulmonary vasculature. The pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary artery, segmental or sub-segmental branches are common locations for a pulmonary embolus to lodge. Once lodged in the pulmonary vasculature, depending on the size and location of the PE, the blockage may result in hemodynamic heart strain along with a decrease in blood supply to the downstream pulmonary parenchyma. Some common hemodynamic changes include an increase in right heart pressures, increased pulmonary artery pressures, and a decreased diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), resulting in cardiac compromise and hypoxemia. The most severe consequence of pulmonary embolus is the sequential blockade of the right and left pulmonary artery, which completely blocks the right heart outflow tract. This is referred to as a saddle embolus due to the radiographic/anatomic shape of the embolus. PEs resulting in hemodynamic instability involving the right heart system will often lead to flattening of the intraventricular septum on echocardiography. This is an important diagnostic echocardiographic sign in determining the appropriate treatment pathway for a PE.
