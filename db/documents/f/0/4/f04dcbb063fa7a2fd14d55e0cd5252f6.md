Psychosis is a loose description of an amalgamation of psychological symptoms resulting in a loss of contact with reality. It is thought that although around 1.5 to 3.5 percent of people will meet diagnostic criteria for a psychotic disorder, a significantly larger variable number will experience at least one psychotic symptom in their lifetime. Psychosis is a common feature of many psychiatric, neuropsychiatric, neurologic, neurodevelopmental, and medical conditions. It is the hallmark feature of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, a co-occurring aspect to many mood and substance use disorders, as well as a challenging symptom to many neurologic and medical conditions. Psychosis can be highly distressing to patients and loved ones, which is why it has become a primary target of treatment for medical professionals. This activity outlines the evaluation, treatment, and management of psychosis, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing and improving care for patients with this condition.
