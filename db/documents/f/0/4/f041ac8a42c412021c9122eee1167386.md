Linitis plastica is not considered a separate entity in the staging or classification of gastric cancer; rather, it is taken as just a part of the diffuse infiltrating gastric cancer, but its influence on morbidity and mortality is well established.

“Leather bottle” was a term describing the gross appearance of the stomach, where there is limited distensibility of the gastric volume.

**Macroscopic Appearance:**Diffuse infiltration of tumorous tissue in the submucosa and muscularis propria layers of the stomach. The gastric wall is markedly rigid and thickened.

**Microscopic Appearance:**Stromal hypertrophy and hyperplasia with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet ring cells infiltration hence the term “signet cell carcinoma.”
