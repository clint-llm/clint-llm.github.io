Low back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints encountered in clinical practice. It is the leading cause of disability in the developed world and accounts for billions of dollars in healthcare costs annually. Although epidemiological studies vary, the incidence of low back pain is estimated to be anywhere between 5% to more than 30%, with a lifetime prevalence of 60% to 90%. However, radicular symptoms can be a harbinger of more serious conditions, including discopathy or acute disc herniation. Lumbosacral radiculopathy can also appear in the absence of actual lumbar pain. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of lumbosacral radiculopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management

**Objectives:**
- Review the potential etiologies of lumbar radiculopathy.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with lumbosacral radiculopathy, including imaging studies as may be appropriate.
- Summarize the treatment options for lumbosacral radiculopathy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lumbosacral radiculopathy.
