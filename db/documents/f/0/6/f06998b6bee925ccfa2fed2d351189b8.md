Aortic stenosis is a condition more prevalent in the elderly population (fifth through eighth decades). According to a prospective population-based study, the incidence of aortic stenosis was 0.2% during the fifth decade of life, 1.3% during the sixth, 3.9% during the seventh, and 9.8% during the eighth. When comparing the subset of patients with congenital anatomic malformations of the aortic valve to those patients with normal anatomy in those who underwent surgery for isolated aortic stenosis, the fraction of abnormal valves decreased with increasing age. In post-surgery patients less than 50 years of age, two-thirds were found to have a bicuspid valve. In contrast, one-third had unicuspid, ages 50 to 70 saw two-thirds of patients with bicuspid, but one-third had normal tricuspid anatomy. In patients greater than 70 years of age, 60% had tricuspid valve, and 40% had bicuspid.

Aortic regurgitation has an estimated prevalence of 4.9%, also increasing with age until the sixth decade when incidence begins to decrease. However, this number may be artificially low because up to 75% of aortic stenosis patients may have some degree of regurgitation that goes unreported.
