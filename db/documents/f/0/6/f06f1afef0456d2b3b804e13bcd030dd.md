Most individuals with these lesions present similarly. The most common presentation is with angina pectoris, given the occlusive nature of these coronary processes. Essential history elements include evaluating for risk factors of coronary artery disease. It is crucial to ask the patient questions regarding the history of any form of vascular disease, family history of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, age, hyperlipidemia, and smoking history. Some of the most common symptoms of these lesions include:

- Chest pain, pressure, tightness, or heaviness (usually substernal or left-sided) radiating to neck, jaw, or left shoulder or arm

- Shortness of breath

- Palpitations

- Weakness

- Lightheadedness

- Nausea or vomiting

- Sweating

- Feelings of anxiety or impending doom

- Indigestion

Physical examination findings will vary based upon the status of the patientâ€™s disease. Individuals can have chronic coronary artery disease or an acute unstable plaque, and their physical exam findings will manifest in completely different ways. Thus, it is important to evaluate each case distinctly when doing a physical exam. Some items to look for in the physical exam include:

- Tachycardia

- Hypertension or hypotension

- Fever

- Jugular venous distension

- Crackles

- S4 heart sound

- Mitral systolic murmur

- Displaced apical impulse

- Delayed capillary refill

- Peripheral edema
