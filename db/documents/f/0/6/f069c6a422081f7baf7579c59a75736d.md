Vertebral artery injuries can be due to blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, or can occur spontaneously. The majority of vertebral artery injuries are due to blunt trauma from motor vehicle crashes. Falls, strangulation, and pedestrian accidents are less common causes. Closed injuries to the vertebral arteries are usually due to hyperextension coupled with lateral flexion or rotation of the head.

Penetrating trauma to the neck, such as from a gunshot wound, is a rare but devastating cause of vertebral artery injury with high mortality. Injury to the vertebral artery may result from minimal trauma. Multiple case reports describe various sports, trampoline use, amusement park rides, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, childbirth, sexual intercourse, yoga, scuba diving, and chiropractic neck manipulation among several other potential triggers.

Spontaneous vertebral artery injuries occur when the structural integrity of the arterial wall is compromised. While this condition may be associated with vascular or connective tissue disorders such as fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome, the majority of patients diagnosed with a spontaneous cerebral artery dissection have no known history of the underlying predisposing disease. Most “spontaneous” cases correlate with a mildly traumatic event.
