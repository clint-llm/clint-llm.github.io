All patients should undergo routine eye examinations, which is particularly important in patients with risk factors for developing ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Visual field testing and optical coherence tomography (OCT) play an essential role in the diagnosis and management. Patients with an initial diagnosis of PDS and PG need a more stringent follow-up to monitor and control IOP. Proper education regarding therapy and adherence is essential to limit and prevent the progression of glaucomatous damage. Treatment with laser and surgery can be considered in select patients that show uncontrolled IOP with maximum local therapy and glaucomatous progression.
