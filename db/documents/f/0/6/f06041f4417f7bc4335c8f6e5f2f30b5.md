Domestic violence may be difficult to uncover when the victim is frightened, especially when they present to an emergency department or healthcare practitioner's office. The key is to establish an assessment protocol and maintain an awareness of the possibility that domestic and family violence may be the cause of the patient’s signs and symptoms. Screening should be carried out in primary care, obstetric and gynecologic, psychiatric, pediatric, urgent care, and emergency departments.

Establishing that injuries are related to domestic abuse is a challenging task. Life and limb-threatening injuries are priorities. After stabilization and physical evaluation, laboratory tests, X-rays, CT, or MRI may be indicated. It is important that healthcare professionals first attend to the underlying issue that brought the victim to the emergency department.

- The evaluation should start with a detailed history and physical examination. Clinicians should screen all females for domestic violence and refer females who screen positive. This includes females who do not have signs or symptoms of abuse. All healthcare facilities should have a plan in place that provides for assessing, screening, and referring patients for intimate partner violence. Protocols should include referral, documentation, and follow-up.

- Health professionals and administrators should be aware of challenges such as barriers to screening for domestic violence: lack of training, time constraints, the sensitive nature of issues, and a lack of privacy to address the issues.

- Although professional and public awareness has increased, many patients and providers are still hesitant to discuss abuse.

- Patients with signs and symptoms of domestic violence should be evaluated. The obvious cues are physical: bruises, bites, cuts, broken bones, concussions, burns, knife, or gunshot wounds.

- Typical domestic injury patterns include contusions to the head, face, neck, breast, chest, abdomen, and musculoskeletal injuries. Accidental injuries more commonly involve the extremities of the body. Abuse victims tend to have multiple injuries in various stages of healing, from acute to chronic.

- Domestic violence victims may have emotional and psychological issues, such as anxiety and depression. Complaints may include backaches, stomachaches, headaches, fatigue, restlessness, decreased appetite, and insomnia. Women are more likely to experience asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, and diabetes.

**Assessment**

Assuming the patient is stable and not in pain, a detailed assessment of victims should occur after the disclosure of abuse. Assessing safety is a priority. A list of standard prepared questions can help alleviate the uncertainty in the patient's evaluation. If there are signs of immediate danger, refer to advocate support, shelter, a hotline for victims, or legal authorities.

- If there is no immediate danger, the assessment should focus on mental and physical health and establish a history of current or past abuse. These responses determine the appropriate intervention.

- During the initial assessment, a practitioner must be sensitive to the patient’s cultural beliefs. Incorporating a cultural sensitivity assessment with a history of domestic violence victims may allow more effective treatment.

- Patients that have suffered domestic violence may or may not want a referral. Many are fearful of their lives and financial well-being. Hence, they may be weighing the tradeoff in leaving the abuser leading to loss of support and perhaps the responsibility of caring for children alone. The healthcare provider needs to assure the patient that the decision is voluntary and that the provider will help regardless of the decision. The goal is to make resources accessible, safe, secure, and to enhance support.

- If the patient elects to leave their current situation, information for referral to a local domestic violence shelter to assist the victim should be given.

- If there is a risk to life or limb, or evidence of injury, the patient should be referred to local law enforcement officials.

- Counselors often include social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists that specialize in the care of battered partners and children.

**Testing**

**Children**

A detailed history and careful physical exam should be performed. If head trauma is suspected, consider an ophthalmology consultation to obtain indirect ophthalmoscopy.

Laboratory

Laboratory studies are often important for forensic evaluation and criminal prosecution. On occasion, certain diseases may mimic findings similar to child abuse; consequently, they must be ruled out.

Urine

- A urine test may be used as a screen for sexually transmitted diseases. Also, bladder or kidney trauma may be suggested if there is blood in the urine.

- A urine toxicology screening is indicated if there is evidence of an altered level of consciousness, agitation, coma, or an apparent life-threatening event. It should also be ordered the child was discovered in a dangerous environment. Victims of child abuse have a positive urine drug screen up to 15% of the time.

- Basic urine toxicology is often unreliable, with the potential for both false positives and false negatives. Positive screens must be confirmed in cases of potential legal intervention.

- The chain of custody should be followed when sending a urine toxicology specimen to a laboratory. Confirmatory tests are usually sent to outside state-sponsored referral laboratories.

Hematology

If bruises or contusions are present, there is no need to evaluate for a bleeding disorder if the injuries are consistent with an abuse history. Some tests can be falsely elevated, so a child abuse-specialist pediatrician or hematologist should review or follow-up these tests.

Bleeding disorder tests should include:

- Complete blood cell count (CBC)

- Platelet count

- Prothrombin time

- Partial thromboplastin time

- Von Willebrand factor activity and antigen

- Factors VIII and IX levels

Gastrointestinal and Chest Trauma

- Consider liver and pancreas screening tests such as AST, ALT, and lipase. If the AST or ALT is greater than 80 IU/L, or lipase greater than 100 IU/L, consider an abdomen and pelvis CT with intravenous contrast.

- The highest-risk are those with abusive head trauma, fractures, nausea, vomiting, or an abnormal Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 15.

- A troponin level should be considered if there is any evidence of chest trauma such as abrasions, bruises, rib fractures, clavicle fractures, sternal fractures, or a fractured sternum. If elevated to greater than 0.04 ng/mL, consider obtaining a CT of the chest and an echocardiogram.

Imaging

The evaluation of the pediatric skeleton can prove challenging for a non-specialist as there are subtle differences from adults such as cranial sutures and incomplete bone growth. A fracture can be misinterpreted. If there is a concern for abuse, consider consulting a radiologist.

Imaging: Skeletal Survey

A skeletal survey is indicated in children younger than 2 years with suspected physical abuse. The incidence of occult fractures is as high as 1 in 4 in physically abused children younger than 2 years. The clinician should consider screening all siblings younger than 2 years.

The skeletal survey should include two views of each extremity; anteroposterior and lateral skull; and lateral chest, spine, abdomen, pelvis, hands, and feet. A radiologist should review the films for classic metaphyseal lesions and healing fractures, most often involving the posterior ribs. A “babygram” that includes only one film of the entire body is not an adequate skeletal survey.

Skeletal fractures will remodel at different rates, depending on the patient's age, location, and nutritional status.

- Soft tissue swelling is present at zero to 10 days.

- Long bone fractures may take 10 to 21 days to form a soft callus.

Imaging: CT

Three-dimensional reconstruction CT imaging is more specific in detecting skull and rib fractures but involves greater radiation exposure.

If abuse or head trauma is suspected, a CT scan of the head should be performed on all children aged 6 months or younger or children younger than 24 months if intracranial trauma is suspected. Clinicians should have a low threshold to obtain a CT scan of the head when abuse is suspected, especially in an infant younger than 12 months.

An intravenous-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated in unconscious children; who have traumatic abdominal findings such as abrasions, bruises, tenderness, absent or decreased bowel sounds; abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting; or have elevated AST, an ALT greater than 80 IU/L, or lipase greater than 100 IU/L.

Special Documentation

A photograph should be taken before treating injuries.

- Take an identification tag photo.

- Take photos from multiple injury angles and distances.

- Measure and document injury sizes.

- When photographing bite marks, include photos focusing on each dental arch to avoid distortion.

- Check photos as they may be used in court.

**Intimate Partner and Elder**

Laboratory

Evaluate for evidence of dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, infection, substance abuse, improper medication administration, and malnutrition. Tests to consider include:

- CBC

- Basic metabolic panel

- Urinalysis

- Sexually transmitted infection screening

- Calcium

- Magnesium

- Phosphorus

- Drug levels

- Ethanol level

- Urine drug screen

Imaging

- X-rays of bruised of tender body parts to detect fractures

- Head CT scan to evaluate for intracranial bleeding as a result of abuse or the causes of altered mental status

Other

- Pelvic examination with evidence collection if sexual assault

**Evidence Collection**

Domestic and family violence commonly results in the legal prosecution of the perpetrator. Preferably, a team specializing in domestic violence is called in to assist with evidence collection.

Each health facility should have a written procedure for packaging and labeling specimens and maintaining a chain of custody. Law enforcement personnel will often assist with evidence collection and provide specific kits.

It is important to avoid destroying evidence. Evidence includes tissue specimens, blood, urine, saliva, and vaginal and rectal specimens. Saliva from bites can be collected; the bite mark is swabbed with a water-moistened cotton-tipped swab.

Clothing stained with blood, saliva, semen, and vomit should be retained for forensic analysis.
