Patients with aniridic fibrosis syndrome will, of necessity, have a preexisting diagnosis of aniridia; and will likely have multiple associated ocular procedures. Although there are continually improving genetic tests to detect patients with various causes of aniridia

Regular evaluation of the anterior segment and IOP are essential for the early detection of associated comorbidities. Slit lamp, gonioscopy, and indirect ophthalmoscopy can all be useful in the evaluation of the extent of fibrosis. Visual acuity often decreases with the progression of the fibrotic membrane.
