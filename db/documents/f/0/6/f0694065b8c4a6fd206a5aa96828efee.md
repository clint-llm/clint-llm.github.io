Thumb spica splinting has proven to be effective in many different settings for the treatment of thumb, carpal and metacarpal injuries.Â  They are cost-effective, easily learned and taught, and accommodating. Further, splints are simple to manipulate for both the provider and the patient, and they are easy to remove for assessment of the extent and progression of injury throughout the healing process.

At the end of the procedure, the provider should educate the patient on basic splint maintenance, particularly keeping the area clean and dry. Instruct the patient to rest, ice and elevate the affected area in the immediate post-injury period to diminish expected swelling.
