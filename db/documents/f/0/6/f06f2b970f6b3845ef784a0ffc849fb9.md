Triggers of HEÂ include renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., esophageal varices), constipation, infection, medication non-compliance, excessive dietary protein intake, dehydration (e.g., fluid restriction, diuretics, diarrhea, vomiting, excessive paracentesis), electrolyte imbalance, consumption of alcohol, or consumption of certain sedatives, analgesics or diuretics all in the setting of chronic liver disease. In some cases, hepatic encephalopathy may occur following the creation of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
