Salivary gland tumors are heterogeneous in their morphology and are postulated to develop from the same stem-cell differentiation pathways as normal salivary gland tissues. Four main theories have been proposed. These include the basal reserve cell theory, pluripotent unicellular reserve cell theory, semi-pluripotent bicellular reserve cell theory, and the multicellular theory.

- **Basal reserve cell theory**– The basal cells of both excretory and intercalated ducts develop into functional salivary units and are capable of tumor development.

- **Pluripotent unicellular reserve cell theory**– The basal cells of excretory ducts are responsible for developing the functional salivary unit and tumor differentiation.

- **Semi-pluripotent bicellular reserve cell theory**–The basal cells of the excretory duct form the progenitor cells of the intercalated ducts, which then form the striated ducts and acinar units. The basal cells of the excretory duct and the progenitor cells of the intercalated ducts are capable of cellular division and tumor development. In contrast, the acinar unit and striated ducts are terminally differentiated and cannot undergo either.

- **Multicellular theory**– all cellular types in normal salivary glands, including those of acinar units and striated ducts, can cellular division and development into salivary tumors. Each tumor develops from a specific cell of origin.
