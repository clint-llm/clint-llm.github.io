One community-based study in Rochester, MN, estimated that around 16% of first ischemic strokes in the United States are lacunar strokes.

In a similar community-based study of African-Americans in Cincinnati, lacunar infarctions accounted for 22% of first-time ischemic stroke events.

Data comparing the frequency of lacunar strokes among different sexes, races, and worldwide populations are not readily accessible. One study in Japan does state that the frequency of lacunar infarcts has decreased since the 1960s due to more aggressive control of risk factors, primarily hypertension.
