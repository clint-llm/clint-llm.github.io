Obesity is an increasing global challenge for healthcare providers. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the worldwide prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, with more than 1.9 billion adults overweight and 650 million with obesity in 2016.

The literature demonstrates the importance of the physician-patient relationship and frequent clinical interactions in improving patient outcomes in obesity, including adherence to medications, higher motivation, and uptake of preventative care activities.

Specific barriers exist within the medical community related to counseling patients with overweight or obesity. Many clinicians do not think counseling is feasible for various reasons, including time constraints and lack of appropriate training.

Negative attitudes and biases in the healthcare setting towards patients with overweight and obesity have detrimental effects on these high-risk patients who are vulnerable while seeking care and recommendations for health promotion. These findings emphasize the need for improvements in medical education and communication about excess weight.
