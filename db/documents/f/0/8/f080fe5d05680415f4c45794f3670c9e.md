Pitavastatin use can also cause lab abnormalities, including elevated creatine phosphokinase, transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase), alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and glucose. High fasting serum glucose levels and high HgA1c levels have also occurred with pitavastatin use.
