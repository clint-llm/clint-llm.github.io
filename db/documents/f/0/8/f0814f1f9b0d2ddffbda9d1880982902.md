Hyperuricemia is an elevated uric acid level in the blood. The normal upper limit is 6.8mg/dL, and anything over 7 mg/dL is considered saturated, and symptoms can occur.

ThisÂ elevated level is the result of increased production, decreased excretion of uric acid, or a combination of both processes.

Elevated uric acid can also be seen in accelerated purine degradation in high cell turnover states (hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and tumor lysis) and decreased excretion (renal insufficiency and metabolic acidosis). Hyperuricemia can lead to gout and nephrolithiasis. It has also been implicated as an indicator for diseases like metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic renal disease.
