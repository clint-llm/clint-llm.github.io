St John’s Wort has shown encouraging data regarding its effectiveness and safety when used as a monotherapy. It is prepared by the grinding of the flowers of the plant as well as its dried leaves. The dried flowers can be used in a tea and ingested orally or be made into an oil by infusion for topical use. Usually, one would find the ground plant in capsules taken as a dietary supplement. As a supplement, dosing and potency may vary significantly between products and even what is on the label.

Suggested Use: As a dietary supplement, adults should take one 300 mg capsule with 0.3% hypericin content three times a day. One to three capsules daily can be taken with meals or as directed by health care providers. The herbal supplement must be stored in a cool and dry place, away from direct light.
