The most common psychiatric mechanism is thought to be a conversion disorder. A conversion disorder, by definition, implies that the individual is not aware and is not consciously feigning events. A history of sexual or physical abuse is a risk factor for the development of PNES. The majority of patients are adult women. A disproportionate number of patients with PNES have training in health care careers. How these risk factors summate to produce spells is unclear. Other psychiatric comorbidities may include depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, or personality disorders.

Malingering or factitious disorder is thought to be less common as a cause of PNES but might be suspected when there is clear, immediate secondary gain resulting in alterations in behavior.
