Agraphia is not a single entity but a neurologic symptom with a multitude of etiologies. The “differential” for agraphia includes illiteracy, in which the ability to write is not acquired. Agraphia should also be distinguished from abulia, representing a generalized hypofunction and motivational deficit.
