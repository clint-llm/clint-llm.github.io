The incidence of SLAP tears is a controversial topic in the current literature. A 2012 study evaluating trends in SLAP repair found SLAP tears were more common in men (greater than 3:1) compared to women. The highest incidences of SLAP repairs were found in the 20 to 29 and 40 to 49 decades at 29.1 and 27.8 per 10,000 patients, respectively.

The variation in SLAP tear reporting may be attributed to some SLAP tears being considered an incidental finding on advanced imaging or at the time of arthroscopy. SLAP tears are a common coexisting injury in patients with other shoulder pathologies, and they do not always account for the primary cause of symptoms.
