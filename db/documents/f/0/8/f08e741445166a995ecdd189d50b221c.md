The differential diagnosis for BSNS includes other uncommon sinonasal tumors, and it has been incorrectly diagnosed previously due to paucity of knowledge and resultant gaps in histopathological study.

Sinonasal tumors with similar presenting features include solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), fibromatosis, myofibrosarcoma, schwannoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma (SS), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with or without rhabdomyoblastic features (Triton tumor), glomangiopericytoma, and inverted papilloma.

Although difficult to separate visually due to overlapping presentation, the histopathological analysis provides a definitive ability to classify rare sinonasal tumors. In preparation for these comparisons between BSNS and other tumors in the differential diagnosis, recall briefly the features of BSNS - hypercellular, spindle-shaped, patchy or diffuse S100 and SMA staining, lack of SOX10 staining, PAX3-MAML fusion, and rare mitoses or necrosis.

- Solitary fibrous tumors, unlike BSNS, express cytokeratin.

- Fibrosarcomas are less cellular and not S-100 positive.

- Schwannomas and nerve tumors stain positive for SOX1.

- Leiomyosarcoma does not demonstrate S-100 positivity, and features include perinuclear halos around cigar-shaped nuclei.

- Synovial sarcoma can mimic BSNS due to the presence of pseudoglandular structures.

- Fibromatosis, specifically neurofibromatosis type 1, is strongly associated with Triton tumor. While Triton tumor has features of rhabdomyosarcoma in addition to neural features, it is seen in patients slightly younger than those with BSNS.

- Glomangiopericytoma is more epithelioid, does not stain positive for S100, and has a short instead of long fascicular pattern with round or ovoid nuclei.

- The invaginated respiratory epithelial component of BSNS is also seen in inverted papilloma, but inverted papilloma has a significantly more prominent glandular pattern and no spindle cell proliferation.

None of the listed etiologies in the differential demonstrate PAX3-MAML fusion on fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), which is diagnostic for BSNS.

Synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are most often misdiagnosed in place of BSNS.
