Almost 50% of patients with interrupted aortic arch (IAA) have a 22q11.2 deletion; this cause of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome. Approximately 75% to 85% of patients with a 22q11.2 deletion have congenital heart disease that can range from asymptomatic to very severe that requires intervention in the newborn period. Besides an IAA, these patients can have other types of congenital heart diseases that can be classified into two groups, the branchial arch defects, and conotruncal defects. Branchial arch defects include IAA, coarctation of the aorta, and right aortic arch. Conotruncal defects include tetralogy of Fallot, sub-arterial ventricular septal defects, double-outlet right ventricle, and truncus arteriosus. Another syndromeÂ associated with IAA is CHARGE syndrome.
