The administration of local anesthesia is best performed in conjunction with a healthcare team. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other assistants are all responsible for confirming the appropriateness and safety of any proposed procedure. A focused patient assessment is essential, including discussing prior adverse drug reactions or complications related to previous anesthetic use. A team approach with verification of appropriate medication, concentration, maximum dosage, and patient monitoring techniques is needed to minimize potential complications.
