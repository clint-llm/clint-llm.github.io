Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is diverse, both in its clinical presentation and in the types of deficiency. It is a primary humoral immunodeficiency disorder characterized by reduced serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M (IgM), recurrent sinopulmonary infections, autoimmune disorders, granulomatous diseases, enhanced risk of malignancy, and impaired antibody response despite the adequate number of B cells.

It is the most frequent symptomatic primary immunodeficiency disorder worldwide.
