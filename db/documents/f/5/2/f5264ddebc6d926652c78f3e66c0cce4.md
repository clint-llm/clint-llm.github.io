PDPH occurs with low cerebrospinal fluid volume from a leak at the site of the dural puncture that exceeds spinal fluid production resulting in low CSF pressure (intracranial hypotension). Traction precipitates symptoms on pain-sensitive structures such as the meninges, blood vessels (especially veins and sagittal or transverse sinuses), cranial nerves, and upper cervical nerves. Sagging of the brain downward in the upright position contributes to orthostatic symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated evidence of vascular dilation (engorgement of venous sinuses, enhancement of meningeal layers and enlargement of the vascular pituitary gland) to compensate for the diminished volume of CSF. Since physical maneuvers which increase intracranial venous volume (such as coughing, laughing, Valsalva maneuver or internal jugular compression) worsen a headache suggesting that PDPH symptoms are at least in part due to the compensatory central venous dilation.
