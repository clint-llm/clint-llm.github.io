The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a diagnostic test to assess for hidden (occult) blood in the stool. This test is commonly used for colorectal cancer screening, especially in developed nations. Colon cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in both men and women worldwide. Therefore, early detection is imperative. When used correctly for screening, this testing modality has established associations with decreased morbidity and mortality.

When blood enters the upper gastrointestinal tract, the globin part of the hemoglobin molecule is completely digested by the proteolytic enzymes; the heme is converted by bacterial action to porphyrins. Hemoglobin entering the lower part of the large intestine is largely undigested. In normal subjects, the volume of blood lost from the gastrointestinal tract is 0.5 to 1.5 mL per day. The fecal occult blood test does not usually detect this amount of blood.

Standard methods for detecting occult blood are based on detecting hemoglobin or its breakdown products.
