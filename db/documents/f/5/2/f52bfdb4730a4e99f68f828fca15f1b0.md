T cell receptors on the cell surface and lytic granules in the cytoplasm are the two most important components of cytotoxic T cells. The lytic granules are modified lysosomes containing two cytotoxic proteins, the perforin and serine proteases called granzyme. These cytotoxic effecter proteins are secreted when the T cell is activated. T cell receptors are membrane-bound polypeptide structures formed by alpha and beta chains linked by a disulfide bond. It has three distinct regions; an extracellular part which has an antigen-binding site, a positively charged transmembrane region which anchors it to the plasma membrane, and short intracytoplasmic tail. Alpha and beta chain region which form the extracellular portion is composed of one variable and one constant region. The hypervariable domain of both chains forms the antigen-binding site. During T cell development in thymus alpha and beta chain gene segment rearrange to develop antigen diversity.

Cytotoxic TCR is associated with transmembrane glycoprotein CD8, which acts as a co-receptor. Activation of a cytotoxic T cell involves recognition of antigen on MHC class 1 by T cell receptor and a co-stimulatory signal. The co-stimulatory signal is an interaction between the CD28 molecule on the T cell surface and a protein known as B7 on antigen-presenting cells.
