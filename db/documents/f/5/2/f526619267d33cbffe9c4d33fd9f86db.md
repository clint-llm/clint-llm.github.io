Myelin sheaths insulate the axons of nerves. These sheaths are a lipid-rich extension of the plasma membrane produced in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by Schwann cells and by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). The myelin sheath is regularly interrupted along the length of the axon by specialized regions called the nodes of Ranvier, which are necessary for the propagation of an action potential along the axon.
