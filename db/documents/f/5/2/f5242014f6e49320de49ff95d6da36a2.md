Gas exchange occurs in the respiratory zone of the lung, where alveoli are present. The respiratory zone of the lung includes respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. Thin alveolar septa separate adjacent alveoli. Adjacent alveoli have connections via small openings, called pores of Kohn, that allow for collateral airflow and equalization of pressure between alveoli. The control of opening or closing of alveoli to regulate ventilation occurs at the alveolar duct.

The alveolar septum has numerous capillaries and thin walls for gas exchange. In addition to capillary endothelial cells, the alveolar septum contains type I pneumocytes that are very thin and line the alveoli, as well as type II pneumocytes that secrete dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPT) surfactant to decrease alveolar surface tension. Alveolar macrophages, also known as dust cells, are active in defending against pathogens and irritants.

Gas exchange in the alveoli occurs primarily by diffusion. Traveling from the alveoli to capillary blood, gases must pass through alveolar surfactant, alveolar epithelium, basement membrane, and capillary endothelium. According to Fick’s law of diffusion, diffusion of a gas across the alveolar membrane increases with:

- Increased surface area of the membrane

- Increased alveolar pressure difference (PA-Pa)

- Increased solubility of the gas

- Decreased membrane thickness

The exchange of both oxygen and carbon dioxide is perfusion limited. Diffusion of gases reaches equilibrium one-third of the way through the capillary/alveolar interface. Deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary arteries has a PVO2 of 40 mmHg, and alveolar air has a PAO2 of 100 mmHg, resulting in a movement of oxygen into capillaries until arterial blood equilibrates at 100 mmHg (PaO2). Meanwhile, carbon dioxide partial pressure decreases from a PVCO2 of 46 mmHg to a PaCO2 of 40 mmHg in alveolar capillaries due to a PACO2 of 40 mmHg.
