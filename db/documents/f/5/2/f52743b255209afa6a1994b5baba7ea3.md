Management of PCNSL is complex and needs an interprofessional team approach involving neurologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, hematopathologists, radiologists, ophthalmologists, neurosurgeons as well as other allied health professionals. Medical oncology and radiation oncology play a crucial role in the management of PCNSL. It is recommended that these patients are discussed in an interprofessional tumor board for a consensus treatment plan. This approach will facilitate optimal patient care, individualized treatment decisions, and also improve enrollment in the clinical trials. Nursing administers the chemotherapy and pharmacists specialized in oncology will verify agent selection, dose as well as drug interactions. The nurses should alert the treating clinician of any concerns or adverse reactions.

CNS lymphoma has a guarded prognosis, and treatment decisions should be made involving the patient, family, and the healthcare team. The involvement of the palliative care team in the early phases of diagnosis may benefit these patients. Extensive communication with the patient and families improve the outcomes of patients with PCNSL. [Level 4]
