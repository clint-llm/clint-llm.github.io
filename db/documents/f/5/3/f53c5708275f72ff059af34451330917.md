Psoriasis is a chronic proliferative and inflammatory condition of the skin. It is characterized by erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales, particularlyÂ over the extensor surfaces, scalp, and lumbosacral region.

The disorder can also affect the joints and eyes. Psoriasis has no cure and the disease waxes and wanes with flareups. Many patients with psoriasis develop depression as the quality of life is poor. There are several subtypes of psoriasis but the plaque type is the most common and presents on the trunk, extremities, and scalp. Close examination of the plaques usually reveals white silvery scales.

The eye is involved in about 10% of patients, mostly women. In general, the eye is rarely involved alone; it is almost always associated with skin features.
