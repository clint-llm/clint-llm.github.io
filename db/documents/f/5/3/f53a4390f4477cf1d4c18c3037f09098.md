Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a well-known means of advanced life support in patients with significant cardiorespiratory impairment refractory to conventional therapeutic interventions. It is a salvage rescue therapy that can result in negative consequences if utilized by unfamiliar personnel. Nevertheless, there is a niche of critically ill children that will benefit from ECMO, and it is vital to appropriately select candidates to avoid or overcome complications and ethical dilemmas. This activity outlines the use of ECMO in children and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating patients who undergo ECMO.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the modes of support and indications for initiating ECMO in pediatric patients.

- Explain the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique required for ECMO.
- Identify the clinical significance and potential complications commonly observed in children and neonates on ECMO.

- Review healthcare team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve clinical outcomes with the use of pediatric ECMO.
