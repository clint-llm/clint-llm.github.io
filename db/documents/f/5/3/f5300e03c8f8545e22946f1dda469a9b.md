Endophthalmitis is a true ophthalmic emergency and requires appropriate and prompt therapy. The main objectives in endophthalmitis treatment are:

- To eradicate or control infection

- Management of inflammation

- Supportive therapy

**1. To Eradicate or Control Infection**

**A. Systemic Antibiotics**

The use of systemic antibiotics in the setting of exogenous endophthalmitis is controversial as most of the drugs given have poor intraocular penetration. The best-documented drugs achieving therapeutic levels in vitreous are fourth-generation fluoroquinolones

EVS study used ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hourly, amikacin 7.5 mg/kg initial dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 12 hourly. EVS study has concluded that the use of systemic antibiotics does not affect the final visual outcome in postoperative endophthalmitis.

In endogenous endophthalmitis, systemic antimicrobials, in conjunction with intravitreal antimicrobials, reduce the rates of evisceration or enucleation.

**B. Local Antibiotics**(topical/subconjunctival)

A combination of two drugs is preferred during the initial presentation, one having a potent effect on Gram-positive organisms and another on Gram-negative organisms. Once antibiotic sensitivity is determined, targeted intervention is done. In the presence of corneal ulcer or wound abscess, fortified drops (including cefazolin 5% and tobramycin 1.4%) are used. Sub conjunctival antibiotic injections are not routinely used due to issues with patient comfort, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and watering from the eye.

EVS study used vancomycin (25 mg/0.5 ml), ceftazidime (100 mg/0.5 ml) for subconjunctival injection, and topical vancomycin (50 mg/ml) and amikacin (20 mg/ml) every 4 hourly for routine cases or every hour if wound leak was present.

**C. Intravitreal Injections**

The intravitreal route of drug administration helps in achieving high concentrations of the drug in the vitreous cavity without associated systemic side effects. It is essential to ensure the proper dosage of the drug. While inadequate doses cause treatment failure, the excess dose can cause toxic effects on the retina. Two broad-spectrum antibiotics are chosen initially, EVS study utilized intravitreal vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 ml) and amikacin (0.4 mg/0.1 ml).

Recently, there is a trend towards the use of other intravitreal antibiotics such as:

- Ampicillin 5000 mcg/0.1 ml

- Piperacillin/tazobactam 225 mcg (piperacillin 200 mcg and tazobactam 25 mcg/0.1 ml)

- Imipenem/cilastatin (rabbit 50 to 100 mcg and 50 to 100 mcg/0.1ml)

- Carbenicillin (rhesus monkey, 1000 mcg/0.1 ml)

- Ticarcillin 3000 mcg/0.1 ml in albino rabbits

- Cefazolin 2250 mcg/0.1 ml,

- Cefotaxime 400 mcg/0.1 ml

- Ceftriaxone 2000 mcg/0.1 ml

- Cefuroxime 1000 mcg/0.1 ml

- Clindamycin 1000 mcg/0.1 ml

- Levofloxacin 625 mcg/0.1 ml

- Moxifloxacin 500 mcg/0.1 ml

- Ciprofloxacin 100 mcg/0.1 ml

- Aztreonam 100 mcg/0.1 ml

- Colistin 100 mcg/0.1 ml

Viruses usually do not cause suppurative inflammation of the eye or endophthalmitis, and rather they cause retinitis, which may be associated with retinitis. Many of such cases are treated by specific antivirals

**D. Vitrectomy**

Vitrectomy has several advantages over conservative therapy. Vitrectomy improves retinal oxygenation, reduces the inflammatory load within the eye, provides specimens for diagnostic evaluation, allows direct inspection of the retina, allows definitive treatment, reduces the load of infection, and reduces the severity of the disease, and accelerates visual rehabilitation.

According to the EVS study, vitrectomy was better than vitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotics for the most severe cases, i.e., for patients with initial presenting vision being the perception of light alone, and vitrectomy, if performed, is limited to core vitrectomy without inducing posterior vitreous detachment. Contrary to the EVS study, CEVE (complete and early vitrectomy for endophthalmitis) advocates complete vitrectomy, which includes induction and removal of posterior vitreous to prevent exudates from settling over the macula. However, in the periphery, the surgeon must be conservative to avoid iatrogenic break formation.

In delayed-onset endophthalmitis secondary to propionibacterium acnes, pars plana vitrectomy is combined with total capsulectomy and IOL exchange/removal or wash of the capsular bag with antibiotics.

**2. Management of Inflammation**

Corticosteroids are the most potent anti-inflammatory agents used in the management of endophthalmitis. To be useful, they must be given early and in appropriate doses. They should, however, not be used in fungal endophthalmitis as it enhances fungal growth by weakening defense mechanisms within the body. They can be used either as an intravitreal injection, topical drops, or systemically.

The most commonly used corticosteroid intravitreally is dexamethasone (0.4 mg/ 0.1 ml). However, there is no clear consensus regarding the role of intravitreal corticosteroids.

EVS study utilized only topical (prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops), subconjunctival (dexamethasone 6 mg/0.25 ml), and systemic steroids (prednisolone 30 mg twice a day for 5 to 10 days).

**3. Supportive Therapy**

Cycloplegic agent (homatropine 2%, atropine 1%) is an essential part of treatment that relieves ciliary spasms and prevents synechiae formation.

In patients with elevated intraocular pressure, oral and topical medications need to be added. Vitreous tap before intravitreal injection also reduces intraocular pressure.

Hypertonic saline (5% drop or 6% ointment) may be needed in cases of severe corneal edema.

**Prophylaxis**

Endophthalmitis cannot be prevented entirely, but due to various measures taken in recent times, its incidence has come down. Most of the cases of endophthalmitis are exogenous, which prompts for taking prophylactic action.

Proposed measures as prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis include preoperative 5% povidone-iodine antisepsis of conjunctival cul de sac, check for lid infections preoperatively, checking the patency of nasolacrimal duct, use of intracameral cefuroxime 1000 mcg/0.1 ml

A large study on 2 million eyes undergoing cataract surgery in the Aravind Eye Care System showed that intracameral moxifloxacin reduced the incidence of postcataract surgery endophthalmitis, especially in cases with complicated cataract surgery with posterior capsular rent.

However, caution needs to be exercised regarding the use of intracameral antibiotics, as there are reports of retinal toxicity with certain antibiotics. For example, hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV) has been reported after the use of intracameral vancomycin.

The most common contaminants in cases of post-intravitreal injections are streptococci, which are common members of oral flora, and oral flora bacteria may be aerosolized during the speech. The use of masks and adhering to a strict no-talking policy has been noted to be effective in reducing the overall incidence of post-injection endophthalmitis and particularly the incidence of streptococcal endophthalmitis.

Prompt surgical repair of open globe injuries and prophylactic intravitreal injection of antibiotics (particularly in the setting of retained intraocular foreign body) with or without systemic antibiotics have been associated with reduced rates of post-traumatic endophthalmitis.
