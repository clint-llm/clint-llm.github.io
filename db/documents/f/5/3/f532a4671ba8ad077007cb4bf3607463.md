**Congestive heart failure (CHF):**PVOD patients have a similar presentation to CHF patients, such as shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, and leg swelling. Moreover, chest imaging findings are similar in both PVOD and CHF, with signs of congestion such as ground glass opacities (GGOs), septal thickening, pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Echocardiography can differentiate CHF from PVOD, which typically shows left heart dysfunction, and right heart catheterization (RHC) shows postcapillary pulmonary hypertension with elevated PCWP ≥ 15 mmHg in CHF patients.

**Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH):**PVOD and CTEPH patients have similar symptoms. V/Q Scanning of PVOD can show mismatched perfusion defects, leading to misdiagnosis of CTEPH. Hemodynamic findings from RHC also show precapillary pulmonary hypertension (mPAP >20 mmHg, PCWP ≤15 mmHg, and PVR ≥3 Wood Units) in both PVOD and CTEPH. However, CTEPH patients are unlikely to have signs of venous congestion on chest imaging.

**Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension:**Both IPAH and PVOD will have similar symptoms and similar RHC findings. However, IPAH patients usually do not have congestion on chest imaging.

**Interstitial lung diseases (ILD):**Chest imaging of GGOs and septal thickening in PVOD can mimic certain ILDs such as sarcoidosis. However, ILD patients may report other respiratory symptoms related to ILD, such as chronic productive or dry cough, wheezing, or systemic symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss).
