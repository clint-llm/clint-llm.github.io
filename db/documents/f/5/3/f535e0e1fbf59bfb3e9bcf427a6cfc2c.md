About 80% of intramedullary tumors are gliomas, which can be subdivided into astrocytomas and ependymomas. Astrocytomas are more common in children with IMSCTs, while ependymomas are more often found in adults with IMSCT. Astrocytomas peak in the third to fifth decades, often low-grade, and are found most commonly at the thoracic level. Ependymomas are more commonly found in the lower cord, conus, and filum, with a slight male predominance and peak in the third to sixthÂ decades. Hemangioblastomas are the third most common IMSCT, making up about 2 to 15%. Metastatic intramedullary tumors are rare and most frequently develop from lung and breast tumors.
