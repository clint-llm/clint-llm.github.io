When healthcare workers including the nurse practitioner encounter lichen planus, the patient should be referred to the dermatologist for definitive management. Lichen planus may affect the skin, scalp and the mucosal organs and is a relatively difficult disorder to cure.Â Cutaneous LP typically clears spontaneously within 1 to 2 years, so treatment is aimed at reducing pruritus and time to resolution. Many drugs are used to treat the skin manifestations with not much difference among them in effectiveness.

Oral LP may spontaneously resolve within 5 years, but many cases are chronic and never resolve.

The pharmacist should always be aware that some cases of LP may be drug-induced and consult with the treating clinician regarding the patient's case. Withdrawal of the suspected drug leading to the gradual disappearance of lesions confirms the diagnosis, although it may take some time for lesions to fully resolve.
