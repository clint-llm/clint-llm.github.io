**Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**

Paraffin

A common practice to prepare bone tissue samples for IHC involves embedding decalcified tissue in paraffin. Of note, decalcifying bone changes the overall morphology. Trabecular integrity is lost, and the bone cell environment is typically not the same as native mineralized bone.

Methyl Methacrylate (MMA)

Non-decalcified bone tissue samples can embed in Methyl methacrylate (MMA) to better preserve the gross native bone morphology with inorganic phosphates. Sectioning of bone samples embedded with MMA is challenging, with conventional IHC then performed using either heat-induced antigen retrieval (typically for samples under 10 μm thick) or microwave-based heat-induced retrieval. Both of these processes require a high degree of precision concerning temperature control to prevent the sample from being inadvertently damaged.
