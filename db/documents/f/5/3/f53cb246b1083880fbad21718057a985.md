The prognosis of acute scrotal pain depends on the cause. In patients with epididymitis, pain improves within several days of treatment, but the indurationÂ may last weeks or months. Some people with diabetes may develop an abscess leading to sepsis, which is a potential consequence. In patients who developed epididymitis secondary to sexual activity, the partner needs to be referred and treated to stop the cycle of transmission. For patients with a diagnosis of testicular torsion, the diagnosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment. If the treatment is delayed by 12-24 hours, the risk of losing testis and infertility is high.
