**Type 1 Distal**

Autoimmune diseases are the commonest cause in adults: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, thyroiditis, hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis

Inherited, AD or AR: Genetic primary causes of distal RTA include mutations of genes that encode the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger (AE1) or subunits of the H-ATPase pump respectively

Genetic associations: Marfan syndrome, Ehler Danlos syndrome, sickle cell disease, congenital obstruction of the urinary tract

Nephrocalcinosis: Chronic hypercalcemia, medullary sponge kidney

Tubulointerstitial diseases: chronic pyelonephritis, chronic interstitial nephritis, obstructive uropathy, renal transplant rejection

Hypergammaglobulinemic states: Monoclonal gammopathy, multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, cryoglobulinemia, chronic liver disease

Drugs: Lithium, amphotericin B, NSAIDs, lead, antivirals

Miscellaneous: Idiopathic, familial hypercalciuria, glue sniffing (toluene inhalation in recreational drug abuse)

**Type 2 Proximal**

Hypergammaglobulinemic states: Most common cause in adults-monoclonal gammopathy(light chain), multiple myeloma, amyloidosis

Inherited: AD or AR putative mutations in Na-H antiporter in apical membrane and Na-HCO3 cotransporter in the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells respectively

Drugs: Lead or other heavy metals, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide, topiramate)

Autoimmune: Sjogren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

Miscellaneous: Interstitial nephritis, Fanconi syndrome, vitamin D deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, chronic hepatitis, idiopathic

**Type 3 Mixed**

Inherited: Mutations in carbonic anhydrase II.

**Type 4 Hyperkalemic RTA**

Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism: most common cause in adults is diabetic nephropathy-destruction of JG apparatus due to vascular hyalinosis

Drugs: Potassium-sparing diuretics, beta blockers, NSAIDs, calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), ACEi, ARBs, renin inhibitors, heparin, TMP/SMX

Autoimmune: SLE

Genetic: Sickle cell disease, pseudohypoaldosteronism

Miscellaneous: Interstitial nephritis, chronic obstruction of the urinary tract, adrenal insensitivity to angiotensin II, renal insufficiency
