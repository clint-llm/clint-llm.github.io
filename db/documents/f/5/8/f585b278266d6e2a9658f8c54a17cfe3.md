Healthcare providers at any level caring for a patient with a gastrojejunostomy should recall that the patient's anatomy is significantly different from the average patient, and they require much more attention. Subtle findings such as difficulty passing stool and flatus or nausea and emesis may indicate an internal hernia and thus, a closed-loop obstruction requiring immediate operative intervention. Unfortunately, the complications secondary to a gastrojejunostomy may not declare themselves on plain abdominal films or even CT scans, which may lead to significant delays in diagnosis. It is thus imperative that even relatively minor changes in the patient's status such as tachycardia or persistent but moderate abdominal pain immediately to be reported to the entire healthcare team to ensure complications are not missed.
