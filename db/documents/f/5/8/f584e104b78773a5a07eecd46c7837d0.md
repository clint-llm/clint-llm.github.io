Before obtaining central venous access via catheterization, it is essential to regard strict aseptic technique, prep with chlorhexidine, and use sterile full-body barriers to reduce the risk of catheter-associated infection. Additionally, positioning is another important factor that affects the caliber of the veins to allow easier cannulation. In the Trendelenburg position, gravity allows the central venous filling to increase to produce a better-engorged vein and, ultimately, a larger target for access. The increased venous filling also helps to reduce the risk of air embolism.
