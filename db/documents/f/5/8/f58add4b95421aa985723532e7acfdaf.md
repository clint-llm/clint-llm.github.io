Dermatomyositis is thought to be the result of a humoral mediated attack directed against the muscle capillaries and the endothelium of arterioles. The initiating event is the activation of completer factor-3 (C3), which forms C3b and C4b. This is followed by the formation of the neoantigen C3bNEO and the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex (MAC). The membrane attack complex deposits on vascular walls and causes inflammation. Hypoxic injury to the muscle fibers ensues, leading to atrophy of muscle fibers, particularly the fibers at the periphery that are the most remote and away from the vascular supply. Over time, the capillary density reduces, and muscle fibers start to undergo necrosis and degeneration.
