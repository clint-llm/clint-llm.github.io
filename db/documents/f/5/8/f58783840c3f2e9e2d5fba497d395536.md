There is no vaccine to prevent shigellosis. However, the disease can be limited by practicing certain precautions:

- Frequent and careful handwashing with water and soap

- Supervised handwashing of children in daycare centers and homes with children who are not completely toilet trained

- People with shigellosis should not handle food and water for others unless they are disease-free

- In children who wear diapers and have the disease, precautions are required in handlingÂ and disposing of diapers

- Drink only boiled or treated water and avoid eating raw poorly handled food from the vendors while visiting developing countries

- Avoid sexual contact with a patient having diarrhea or recently recovered from diarrheal illness

- Practice safe sex

- Avoid swimming pools when infected
