Coral snakes are members of the Elapidae family, and 40 to 50 species exist in the Americas. In the United States, three types predominate: Micrurus fulvius (eastern coral snake, located in Florida and the southeast US) and Micrurus tener (Texas coral snake, located in Texas and Northwestern Mexico), and Micruroides euryxanthus (Sonoran coral snake, located in the Southeastern US and the state of Sonora, Mexico) inhabit the US. Coral snakes in North America (north of Mexico City) are recognized by their circumferential bands (non-circumferential shape is found on the non-venomous shovel-nosed snake) of red, yellow, and black. This activity reviews coral snake toxicity, its presentation, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of coral snake toxicity.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with coral snake toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment options for coral snake toxicity.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by coral snake toxicity.
