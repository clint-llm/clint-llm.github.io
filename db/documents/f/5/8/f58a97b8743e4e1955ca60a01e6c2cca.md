The maxillary process fuses with the frontonasal process, thus altering the nasal pits into a primeval nasal cavity, through forming a floor for its posterior part and forming the anterior nares altogether. The development of the nasal cavity can be described in four stages

- The first stage: nasal placodes formation

- The second stage: nasal placodes convert into nasal grooves

- The third stage: the nasal grooves give rise to the nasal pits

- The fourth stage: the nasal pits deepen, this is associated with the formation of the posterior nares

The nasal placodes are linked to the development of the palate and lip, and often a defect in the placode can lead to the finding of cleft lip or cleft palate.

Interestingly, nasal trauma is detectable since the fourth month of fetal life. Compression of the nose structures in fetal growth depends on the location of fetus extremities.

Additionally, the nasal septum deviation is already be detectable in fetuses, which enables clinicians to estimate the nasal septum growth and symmetry, and therefore, predict the tendency to dysfunction occurring in the upper respiratory tract.
