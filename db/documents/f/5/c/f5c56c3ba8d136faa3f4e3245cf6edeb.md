A wide variety of illnesses can be associated with catatonia. The studies of incidence and epidemiology of catatonia center mainly around psychiatric patients. In retrospective studies, rates of catatonia among all psychiatric patients range from 0.5% - 2.1%; although, some prospective studies have found the incidence to be as high as 17.1%. One prospective and retrospective study by Stöber et al. using the DSM-III-R criteria found the rate of catatonia to be 24.4%. Among patients with mood disorders, rates have been higher, ranging from 13% - 27%. Historically, as schizophrenia has been associated with catatonia, studies have been performing measuring the rates of catatonia starting in the 1910s. Two studies in 1911 and 1913 found the incidence rates for catatonia to be 50% and 19.5%, respectively. One retrospective study published in 1979 found the rate, between 1938 and 1960, of 990 patients to be 16.9%. More recent studies vary, with one published in 1998 found the rate to be 40.2%, and another in 2002, found it to be 10.3%. Overall, in schizophrenia patients, rates have been found to be as low as 1% and as high as 50%.
