The pathophysiology is most commonly theorized to be the result of one of three mechanisms.

A study using rodent models found that during the postictal period, hypoperfusion occurs in the areas which had the epileptogenic discharges. Significant decreases in pO2 (pO2 < 10 mmHg) were found in localized regions of the brain leading to memory and behavioral impairments.

In humans, similar focal tissue hypoperfusion had been found by measuring the cerebral blood using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with flow reductions of at least 10 mL/100 g/min.

Severe hypoperfusion/hypoxia, which occurs in specific brain areas after a focal seizure or a generalized seizure, is responsible for the negative sequelae following the seizure.
