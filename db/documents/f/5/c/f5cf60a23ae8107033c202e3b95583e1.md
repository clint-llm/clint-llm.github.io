Renal oncocytomas can be treated conservatively with partial nephrectomy if possible based upon size.

In a case series of 70 patients who underwent total or partial nephrectomy, surgery was curative in 68 of the patients. One patient had stable metastatic disease in the liver, and one patient died with metastatic disease in the bone and liver. The study concluded that while the vast majority of renal oncocytomas are benign and areÂ cured with surgical excision, some may exhibit metastasis.
