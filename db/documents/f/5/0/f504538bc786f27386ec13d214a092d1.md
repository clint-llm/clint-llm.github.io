Quetiapine has a strong affinity for the 5-HT2 receptor. Although quetiapine has many complex mechanisms, it mediates its pharmacological effect mainly via its 5HT2 antagonistic action. It also acts on dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors. Quetiapine is an antagonist for D2 receptors and 5-HT2 receptors.

Blocking the D2 receptor in mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways is indicated in the treatment of schizophrenia for negative and positive symptoms, respectively. Increased dopamine in these pathways has been shown to be associated with schizophrenia. Jensen et al. also reported that antidepressant activity is also mediated by its 5HT2A and 5-HT7 antagonistic properties. Furthermore, norquetiapine has an affinity for other receptors, such as H1 histamine receptor, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7 serotonergic receptors, M1, M3, and M5 muscarinic receptors, and Î±1-adrenergic receptors.
