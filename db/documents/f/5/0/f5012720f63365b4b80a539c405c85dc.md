The mechanism of paralysis of the facial nerve is dependent on the cause. Due to the facial nerve running through a narrow bony canal within the intratemporal course, any cause of inflammation or growth of the nerve will result in ischaemic changes through compression. The nerve is narrowest at the labyrinthine segment; therefore, compression is most likely to occur at this point. Additionally, any cause of skeletal abnormality or trauma may result in disruption of the relationship between the facial nerve and its bony canal, causing paralysis. Some iatrogenic causes of facial nerve palsy (such as acoustic neuroma surgery) occur due to secondary stretching forces as a result of the surgery.
