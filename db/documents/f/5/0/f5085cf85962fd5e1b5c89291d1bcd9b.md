Although clinicians have historically relied on the return of bowel function before starting enteral feeding, recent data indicates that early feeding is both safe and effective.

While The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) guidelines do not specifically reference intestinal trauma patients, the guidelines do reference the critically ill and surgical patients; therefore, many of these guidelines translate to the intestinal trauma population. Although individualized decisions must be made for each patientâ€™s situation, the guidelines support enteral nutrition in cohorts of critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients. Enteral tube feeding can be continued for patients who are on stable doses of vasopressors.

ASPEN recommends enteral nutrition for critically ill patients who can tolerate it. Bolus feeds, when compared to continuous enteral feeds, allows for fewer interruptions and larger volumes, but no difference in mortality.

The debate of whether trophic tube feeds are sufficient versus the need to escalate to goal tube feeds is largely unsolved, especially in the setting of intestinal trauma. However, general guidelines indicate that it is more important to escalate to goal in patients who have worse nutritional status as compared to patients who are more nutritionally optimized prior to hospitalization.

The use of gastric residual volumes is not recommended.

If enteral nutrition cannot be tolerated, then it is recommended to initiate parenteral nutrition after approximately seven days.

The clinical conundrum facing clinicians caring for the hypotensive intestinal trauma patient is not well explored in the literature. Both the use of vasopressors and large volume resuscitation have been associated with anastomotic leaks in the intestinal trauma patient.

Continuation of the Foley catheter is not necessary in the absence of urogenital injury and should be removed early in the postoperative course. No studies examined the ideal timing for removal after intestinal injury; however, extrapolating from studies examining removal after non-trauma intestinal surgery indicates that the Foley should be removed on postoperative day one unless the surgery involved the mid to low rectum.
