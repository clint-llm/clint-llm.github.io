The prevalence of hyperthyroidism is different according to the ethnic group, while in Europe, the frequency is affected by dietary intake of Iodine, and some cases are due to autoimmune disease. Subclinical hyperthyroidism occurs more in women older than 65 than in men, while overt hyperthyroidism rates are 0.4 per 1000 women and 0.1 per 1000 men and vary with age.

Any analysis of the global epidemiology of hyperthyroidism will delineate along the lines of iodine-sufficient regions and iodine-deficient regions.

Graves disease is typically seen in younger patients and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in that demographic. Toxic multifocal goiter is typically seen in older individuals and is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in this respective demographic. Both Graves disease and toxic multifocal goiter have a female predilection and are typically seen in patients with pertinent family and personal medical histories.

The 1977 Whickham Survey was an evaluation of the spectrum of thyroid disorders in County Durham in northeastern England. Although the demographics of the Whickham Survey consisted of primary inhabitants of a community in northeast England (and hence, poor extrapolation potential), the survey did show interesting results of hyperthyroidism. The Whickham Survey demonstrated a prevalence of hyperthyroidism in women, approximately ten times more than that of men (2.7% versus 0.23%).
