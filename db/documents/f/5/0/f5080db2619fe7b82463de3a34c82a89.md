Early chemotherapy trials with paclitaxel in advanced bronchioloalveolar carcinoma showed a somewhat better outcome than another similar stage adenocarcinoma but were poor nevertheless. Hirsch et al. demonstrated that these tumors have a high expression of EGFR mutation, opening up a potential early therapeutic target. Two large trials (SWOG and MSKCC- VANDERBILT) demonstrated a robust response to erlotinib and gefitinib, as frontlines of therapy more often in bronchioloalveolar carcinoma patients.

However, erstwhile mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinomas are more frequently K ras mutation-positive (reported at 75%) with low expression of EGFR mutation. Therefore, they are somewhat more responsive to taxane-based chemotherapy and are not ideal candidates for EGFR targeted therapy.

Finally, like other variants of adenocarcinoma, the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma with lepidic growth has also been positively impacted by the advent of immunotherapy in general, and PD1-L1 inhibitors to be specific.
