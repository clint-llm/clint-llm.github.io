Several factors should be considered while interpreting the prognosis of a breast mass. Among them, sex steroid levels are significantly important. The endogenous sex steroids are well-established risk factors for breast cancer and result in a higher tumor growth rate in post-menopausal women. Moreover, the results of steroid hormone levels in a post-menopausal woman with a breast mass might predict the risk of developing breast cancer in up to 20 years. Collectively,  the risk of developing breast cancer directly correlates with the circulating sex hormone levels, and the five main determinants of circulating steroidal sex hormones are alcohol, exercise, diet, body weight, and smoking.
