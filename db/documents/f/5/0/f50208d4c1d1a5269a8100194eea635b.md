Before initiating OMT, a somatic dysfunction should be present. Somatic dysfunction is a change in joint or muscle function or architecture. Somatic dysfunction describes tissue texture changes, asymmetry, restriction of motion, and tenderness. Examples of possible somatic dysfunctions of the iliopsoas include hypertonic tissue texture, restriction in hip extension, and tenderness of the iliopsoas. Patients who would benefit from MET or CS treatments may also present with symptoms of psoas syndrome, as described above.

The choice of MET or CS as a treatment modality depends on the patient’s status and physician preference. CS is a passive treatment that involves monitoring the psoas, shortening the muscle into a position of ease, and holding this position for an extended period. CS is appropriate for a patient in extreme discomfort or someone unable to produce a coordinated muscle contraction. MET is an active treatment that requires the patient to provide a voluntary isometric muscle contraction against the physician, followed by muscle relaxation during which the physician will take the dysfunction further into the restrictive barrier. During both techniques, the patient must be able to provide feedback to the physician.
