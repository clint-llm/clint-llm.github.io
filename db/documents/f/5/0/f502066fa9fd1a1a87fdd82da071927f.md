Since hypothalamic hamartomas present with a plethora of psychiatric symptoms, these patients need a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation process. Diagnostic tools, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) and the Overt Aggression Scale, can be useful.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists frequently have to evaluate youth presenting with rage and anger. Distinguishing between predatory and affective aggression at this time is very important. Also, if the patient presents with a history of inappropriate smiling or giggling, this should alert the psychiatrists that gelastic epilepsy could be present, and the patient should obtain a referral for a thorough neurological assessment. Gelastic seizures often fail to demonstrate EEG changes; therefore, a video EEG is the recommended approach.
