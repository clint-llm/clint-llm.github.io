Alveolar lipoproteinosis is a rare disease with non-specific diagnostic features. An interprofessional approach including pathologists and pulmonologists is mandatory to assess the diagnosis competently. The pulmonologist has to suspect the diagnosis when performing a bronchoalveolar lavage on a patient explored for an interstitial disease. The gross appearance of the liquid can be suggestive of the diagnosis. Additionally, the pathologist can make the diagnosis on liquid or tissue samples. In the bronchoalveolar lavage, the granular material with the presence of eosinophilic bodies and granules are key features. In tissue samples, the presence of alveoli filled with PAS-positive eosinophilic material is a hallmark. The presence of fibrosis or inflammatory infiltrates should highlight the possibility of an associated disease.
