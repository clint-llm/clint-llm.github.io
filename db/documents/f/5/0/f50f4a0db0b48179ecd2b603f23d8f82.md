Transplantation has now become a standard treatment option for many end-stage disease processes. As the number of transplantations performed each year and the longevity of transplant recipients is steadily on the rise, it is crucial to identify transplant-related complications such as osteoporosis at an early stage and treat patients appropriately. This activity reviews in detail the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of transplantation osteoporosis and highlights the role of early preventive therapy in reducing morbidity and improving quality of life in transplant recipients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of transplantation osteoporosis.
- Review the risk factors associated with an increased incidence of transplantation osteoporosis.
- Describe the management of treatment of transplantation osteoporosis.
