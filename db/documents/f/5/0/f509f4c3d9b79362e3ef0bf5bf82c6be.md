Black piedra is asymptomatic, although the nodes on the hair strand look unsightly. When untreated, it may persist for months or even years. It is a communicable disease, and the patients and their close contacts must always exercise proper personal hygiene. To prevent black piedra, patients should be counseled regarding good personal hygiene, especially when traveling to tropical countries. They must avoid sharing combs, hats, and hair ornaments and avoid activities like swimming in stagnant water.
