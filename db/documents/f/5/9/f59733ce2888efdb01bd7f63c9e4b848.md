The etiopathogenesis of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and other related vasculitides have largely been attributed to anti-neutrophil-cytoplasmic antibodies or ANCA. These are host-derived auto-antibodies against shielded neutrophilic antigens. These antibodies react against primary granules present in neutrophils and monocytes. The formation of these antibodies has been hypothesized to be a two-step process.

Only 70% of cases of MPA have ANCA at the time of diagnosis, and most of the cases of limited MPA do not have ANCA at all. This has led to the understanding that other factors may also play a role in its etiopathogenesis. These include, but are not limited to:

- Infectious Causes: There is considerable overlap in the clinical presentation of various infectious processes and MPA leading to this implication. A possible role of chronic nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus has been suggested in relapsing GPA as well.

- Drugs: Various drugs like hydralazine, thionamides, sulfasalazine, and minocycline, among others, have been observed to be associated with the incidence of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

- Genetic Factors: More recently, a genome-wide study conducted in Europe reported genes like HLA-DP, HLA-DR3, and alpha-1 antitrypsin in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitides.

MPA has also been linked to the exposure of silica by inducing autoimmunity in patients with some genetic susceptibility.
