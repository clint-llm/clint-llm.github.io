GivenÂ the frequency of urinary tract infections in hospitals, UTIs (especially complicated UTIs) remains a clinical entity causing considerable confusion, diagnostic uncertainty, and a source of significant inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions.

The most important clinical criteria for initially diagnosing a simple UTI are symptoms (increased urinary frequency, urgency, hematuria, dysuria, or suprapubic pain). There must also be an appropriate clinical scenario in which infection of the urogenital tract is the most likely explanation for these symptoms. It is appropriate to start empiric treatment with first-line antibiotics in this situation. A urine sample should also be sent for microscopy and culture before starting treatment, although that is not always possible. The urine sample would almost always show an abnormal red cell or white cell count, positive nitrites, and bacteria.

In general, any urinary tract infection that fails to resolve on first-line therapy or in a high-risk patient population should be considered a complicated UTI. Complicated UTI symptoms include all of those listed above, as well as additional findings such as fever, chills, flank pain, sepsis from a urological source, cystitis symptoms lasting >7 days, known multiple antibiotic resistance, permanent Foley or suprapubic catheters, acute mental status changes (especially in the elderly) and high-risk patient populations (pregnancy, immunocompromised state, renal transplant, abnormal urinary function as in patients with neurogenic or dysfunctional bladders, immediate post-urological surgery, renal failure, pediatrics, etc.).

Severe complicated urinary tract infections can present as undifferentiated sepsis or even septic shock.

Complicated urinary tract infections may also present with nonspecific symptoms, atypical presenting features (delirium in the elderly), signs mimicking an acute abdomen, be a trigger for precipitating diabetic emergencies such as diabetic ketoacidosis, and even present without any symptoms (asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy).
