The FDA-approved indications for desflurane are induction or maintenance of anesthesia in adults. It may also be used to maintain anesthesia in pediatric patients following induction with agents other than desflurane. Desflurane is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Desflurane (1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) was first synthesized in the 1970s; it is halogenated exclusively with fluorine and is very resistant to defluorination.
