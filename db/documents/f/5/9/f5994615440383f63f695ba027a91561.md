Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a non-fermenting gram-negative rod, is the third most common after Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter and similar to Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Burkholderia cepacia.

Risk factors for this infection include chronic respiratory diseases, especially cystic fibrosis, hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, organ transplant patients, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hemodialysis patients, and neonates.

These empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials usually do not cover this particular pathogen, especially carbapenems, although no specific predominance was identified with them over other antimicrobials.
