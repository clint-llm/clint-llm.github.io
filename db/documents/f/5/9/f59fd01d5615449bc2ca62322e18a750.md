Diabetes is a complex disease that has systemic manifestations best managed by an interprofessional team. Patient education is critical. This starts at the primary care level with primary care providers describing the consequences of diabetes and poor diabetes control. Diabetes and ophthalmology nurses can play a key role in this role as patient educators. The nurses arrange for follow up and keep the rest of the team up to date about the status of patients. Pharmacists can serve as patient advocates with innovations in diabetes management through medication counseling and management, lifestyle counseling, and informing the clinician when appropriate. Patient outcomes are improved when patients understand the full range of manifestations of their underlying pathology. [Level 5]
