The treatment of the pentalogy of Cantrell is tailored towards the presence of defects and their extent. Many types of reconstruction and repairs are described that can be single or multi-staged and require an interprofessional team approach. Treatment involves neonatal resuscitation to a temporary covering of contents protruding out of the ventral abdominal wall and, finally, surgical correction. Surgical management of cardiac, diaphragmatic, and other defects is crucial and initially involves covering the defects. Assessment for risk factors for mortality should be evaluated. The surgical aim involves correcting cardiac malformations, restoring cardiac position and anatomy, and repairing the thoracoabdominal wall and diaphragmatic defects.

Initial conservative management includes prophylactic antibiotics and daily dressing changes to allow epithelialization of the omphalocele sac.

Avoiding high postoperative intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure following repair of the abdominal wall and the sternal defects is crucial.
