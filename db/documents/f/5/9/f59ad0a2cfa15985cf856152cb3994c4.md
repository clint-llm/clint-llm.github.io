Hypercalciuria is generally considered to be the most common identifiable metabolic risk factor for calcium nephrolithiasis. It also contributes to osteopenia and osteoporosis. Its significance is primarily due to these two clinical entities: nephrolithiasis and bone resorption. On average, hypercalciuric calcium stone formers have decreased bone mineral density than matched controls which are neither stone formers nor hypercalciuric. Even among kidney stone patients, those with hypercalciuria will have average bone calcium density measurements 5% to 15% lower than their normocalciuric peers. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of hypercalciuria and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of hypercalciuria.
- Summarize the treatment of hypercalciuria.
- Describe the evaluation of patients with hypercalciuria.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypercalciuria.
