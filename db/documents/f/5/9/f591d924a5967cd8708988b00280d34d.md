All nerve agents exert their predominant effect by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase at the nerve junction. A phosphorus group on the agent covalently binds to the cholinesterase-active site which prevents the enzyme from hydrolyzing acetylcholine at the nerve junction. This leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine and overstimulation of both the muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Because the main method of breakdown acetylcholine is inhibited, these effects are prolonged if not treated promptly.
