Patients with uveitis associated with macular edema are at risk of developing severe to profound vision loss. The visual prognosis also depends upon the associated uveitis features. Association with posterior uveitis has the worst prognosis as the lesion and subsequent scarring involves the macula. With newer treatment options as long-acting intravitreal corticosteroid implants and immunomodulatory therapy, the visual prognosis has improved dramatically.
