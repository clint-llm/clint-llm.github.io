Chronic low back pain, inclusive of discogenic etiology, is an interprofessional problem involving primarily physical therapists, primary care physicians, orthopedists, neurosurgeons, and pain medicine specialists. Interprofessional communication must be encouraged through gathering, lecturing, and sharing recent updates in treatment. Given the societal and economic burden of this disease, all practitioners have a responsibility to address this issue, given the strains on global healthcare costs.

Furthermore, given the lack of specificity of axial low back pain and often-seen positive imaging in many asymptomatic patients, an emphasis should be made on proper history-taking. This can help prevent unnecessary treatments and risk harm to the patient.
