Although seroma aspiration is generally considered a safe procedure, there are recognized complications that may occur:

- Bleeding

- Neurovascular damage

- Infection: All invasive procedures carry a risk of infection. The need for multiple aspirations increases this risk. It should be noted that evidence in the literature suggests large untreated seromas are associated with infection,Â and therefore a decision to aspirate should be based on a risk assessment by the clinician.

- Implant damage: In periprosthetic seromas, such as following breast implant surgery, there is a risk of implant puncture and rupture during aspiration. This is a significant complication that may necessitate a return to theatre. This risk can be mitigated using ultrasound guidance and an intravenous cannula or blunt needle.

- Pneumothorax: Aspiration of chest wall seromas carry the risk of damage to the underlying pleura, which may cause a pneumothorax. Any symptoms of acute shortness of breath or difficulty breathing during or immediately after aspiration warrant emergency assessment and consideration of obtaining a chest radiograph.
