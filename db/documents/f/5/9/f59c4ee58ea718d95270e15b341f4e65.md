The most common complications of the endoscopic brow lift are paresthesia/dysesthesia, asymmetry, alopecia, lagophthalmos, and the need for revision. Motor nerve injury to the frontal branch of the facial nerve, the most feared complication, is less common. Fortunately, temporary paresis is far more common than permanent paralysis. Other complications include edema, wound dehiscence, eye problems, glabellar irregularity, granuloma, hematoma, infection, pain, palpability of implanted materials (e.g., screws or tines), pruritus, screw exposure, seroma, skin burn, and scar.

Nonetheless, patient satisfaction with endoscopic brow lift is high (greater than 98%), and reports of significant complications are rare.

Lastly, while the endoscopic brow lift mayÂ possess a lower complication profile compared to the traditional open approaches, open approaches still may provide a more effective or durable lift. There is very little available data on the subject.
