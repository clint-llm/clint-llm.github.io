Iris cysts are not common and can provide a challenge for clinicians in terms of diagnosis and management. Iris is the colored muscular diaphragm with a circular central aperture forming the pupil. It is uveal tissue composed of stroma anteriorly and two layers of pigment epithelial cells posteriorly.

Primary cysts can arise from both the pigment epithelium and stroma. Secondary cysts may arise from the iris tissue or the implantation of other material. Knowledge of the condition and the method of evaluating iris cysts is important to making the correct diagnosis. There are controversies regarding the best management, and often treatments are advised in a step-wise fashion in terms of invasiveness. Treatment is sometimes indicated to prevent secondary complications.
