Zinc plays an important role in cellular processes, being an integral part of various metalloenzymes and transcription factors. It is particularly important in nucleic acid and protein synthesis, wound healing, normal immune function, and free-radical scavenging. As there is no free exchange of stored zinc, the metabolic needs must be met by the dietary supply of zinc. Human breast milk is a rich source of zinc, especially in the first 1 to 2 months of lactation, and there also is a zinc-binding ligand in breast milk which increases the bioavailability of zinc in human breast milk which is absent in animal milk. Enteral zinc absorption occurs through the small intestine, primarily in the jejunum through the transporting protein ZIP4. Mutations in gene coding this protein prevent proper enteric zinc absorption, and the affected individuals manifest with features of zinc deficiency.
