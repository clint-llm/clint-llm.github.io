Overall, azilsartan is well-tolerated in most patients in terms of adverse effects. In a controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of azilsartan medoxomil to the ACE inhibitor ramipril in 784 patients, the overall number of adverse events was reported to be much less frequent with azilsartan. Patients were started on a dose of 20 mg of azilsartan and 2.5 mg of ramipril once daily for two weeks, then were titrated up to dosages of 40 or 80 mg of azilsartan and 10 mg of ramipril for 22 weeks.

During the treatment period, dizziness and hypotension occurred more often with the azilsartan treatment groups, and cough, a class side effect commonly encountered with ACE inhibitors, occurred more frequently with the ramipril group (8.2% of participants).

Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension remained the most common adverse effect leading to discontinuation of azilsartan in placebo-controlled trials.
