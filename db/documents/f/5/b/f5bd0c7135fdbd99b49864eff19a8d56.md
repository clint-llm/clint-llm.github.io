Primary cardiac tumors are much rarer than secondary malignant lesions occurring in about 0.001 to 0.3% of the autopsies. Almost 90% of primary cardiac tumors excised surgically are benign. Until recently, cardiac myxomas had wide recognition as the most common primary benign cardiac neoplasm of adulthood, representing nearly 80% of benign tumors. Secondary malignant disease of the heart and pericardium is considerably more common than primary cardiac malignant disease; in some estimates, it is 30 to 1000 times more common. In a random autopsy series, the frequency of metastatic involvement was 0.4%; in patients with confirmed cancer, cardiac involvement can be as high as 20%. Spread to the heart is generally via direct tumor extension, venous/lymphatic spread, or arterial metastasis. The most common underlying malignant diseases with secondary cardiac involvement are carcinoma of the lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, kidneys, melanoma, lymphoma, and leukemia.
