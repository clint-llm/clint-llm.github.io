The following dose of PDE inhibitors is usually recommended for the treatment of erectile dysfunction:

- Sildenafil: 25 mg to 100 mg orally administered 1 hour before intercourse

- Tadalafil: 5 mg to 20 mg orally administered  1 hour before intercourse

- Vardenafil: 10 mg to 20 mg orally administered  1 hour before intercourse

- Some clinicians and researchers recommend chronic daily use of low-dose PDE5 inhibitors. They have increased penile blood flow and improved endothelial function, in addition to a reduction of apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in the corpus cavernosum.

The oral doses of PDE5 inhibitors recommended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):

- Sildenafil 20 mg three times daily

- Tadalafil 40 mg once daily

For patients with lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with concomitant ED, tadalafil 5 mg is preferred. Characteristics of different types of PDE5Is appear in **Table 1**.
