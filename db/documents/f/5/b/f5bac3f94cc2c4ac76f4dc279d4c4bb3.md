The LAMA2 gene, which encodes for the laminin-alpha2 subunit, is located on chromosome 6q22.33. LAMA2 expresses in a wide variety of tissues, includingÂ skeletal muscle, astrocytes, pericytes of capillaries in the brain, and Schwann cells. Fagerberg et al. revealed the expression of the LAMA2 protein-encoding gene via a quantitative transcriptomics analysis of over 27 different human tissues including but not limited to: pancreas, heart, fat, thyroid.
