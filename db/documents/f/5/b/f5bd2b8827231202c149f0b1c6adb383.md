EHEC clinically manifests as bloody diarrhea (visibly bloody stool specimen) without fever and usually a white blood cell count above 10,000/microL at times associated with abdominal pain. The incubation period between exposure to EHEC and onset of symptoms is typically 3 to 4 days.

HUS is a major complication of EHEC infection. It is a clinical triad of anemia secondary to hemolysis, impaired renal function, and thrombocytopeniaÂ mainly affecting young children. HUS following bloody diarrhea secondary to EHEC is called D+ HUS or typical HUS; whereas, HUS caused by other causes is referred to as D- HUS or atypical HUS.
