An interprofessional team should manage the patient with ITP. The clinicians and nursing staff may monitor subjects with a less severe disease if it does not involve important organ systems. The clinician should refer patients with complications to a hematologist, coordinating closely with the patient's clinician to maximize management and progress. The pharmacist should be involved in the coordination of drug therapy and monitoring for complications and interactions. All interprofessional team members must maintain accurate records of all interactions and interventions with the patient so all personnel involved in care have access to the same updated patient information. Open lines of communication are essential to ensure proper and timely care, particularly if any concerns arise, such as adverse effects or a deterioration in the patient's condition. An interprofessional team approach will result in the best outcomes. [Level 5]
