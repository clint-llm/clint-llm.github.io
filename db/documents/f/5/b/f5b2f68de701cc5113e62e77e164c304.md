Scuba diving is considered to be a safe sport when an individual is properly trained and takes appropriate precautions. However, there can be disastrous complications if circumstances are unfavorable or appropriate precautions are not taken. One such potential complication is immersion pulmonary edema. Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) is used by many as an umbrella term for scuba divers’ pulmonary edema (SDPE) and swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE). Both of these conditions share similar presenting symptoms, diagnostics, and treatment. Case studies from the 1980s to the present time highlight differences in pathophysiology and certain predisposing factors. The pathophysiology is not completely understood, and both conditions are likely underdiagnosed since postmortem exams with pulmonary edema exhibit non-specific findings of heavy edematous lungs and frothy sputum in the airways. These same findings can be found following drowning and prolonged resuscitation efforts.
