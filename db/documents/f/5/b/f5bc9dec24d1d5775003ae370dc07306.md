CT and MRI are sensitive modalities in detecting abscess. Initial workup should include an x-ray of the head and neck and complete blood cell count. X-ray of head and neck can help identify compression or deviation of the trachea and subcutaneous air related to necrotic tissue. These imaging modalities can be useful if there is a need to evaluate possible ascending bacterial spread to the sinus cavities. Complete blood cell count can help rule in infectious etiology based on total white blood cell count and predominant white blood cell line that appears. For bacterial infections, there should be an increase in neutrophil count in individuals that are not immunocompromised.
