In the United States, esophageal cancers represent the fifth most common gastrointestinal cancer, with an estimated 16,940 cases per year, and are the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The highest-risk area, called the “esophageal cancer belt,” includes portions of northern Iran, southern Russia, central Asian countries, and northern China, where squamous cell cancers dominate all cases by 90%. In this risk area, esophageal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer. In contrast, the United States is considered a low-risk area with an increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma mostly due to an upsurge of obesity and GERD, and conversely a steady decrease in squamous cell carcinoma because of the long-term reduction in tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Adenocarcinoma is largely a disease of white male individuals. Conversely, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence rates are highest among blacks and Asians.
