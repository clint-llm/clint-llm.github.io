Biotin is a B-complex vitamin that serves as an essential coenzyme for five carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and coenzyme for acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2. Biotin deficiency affects the activity of biotin-dependent carboxylases. These carboxylases facilitate various metabolic reactions such as gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid metabolism. This activity reviews the evaluation of biotin deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of biotin deficiency.
- Review the evaluation of biotin deficiency.
- Outline the management options available for biotin deficiency.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ensure better outcomes.
