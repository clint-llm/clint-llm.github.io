Pertinent history and physical examination should be performed before starting. The most important for patient history is any allergies, prior adverse effects to anesthetics, or any family history of complications with anesthetics. The physical exam includes evaluating the thoracic spine for any signs of scoliosis, surgery, infection, severely restricted range of motion, or findings that will make thoracic spinal anesthesia more challenging or impossible. In addition, a basic neurologic exam of gross motor and sensory function should be assessed. Lastly, A review of laboratory studies and vital signs (normal blood pressure and absence of fever) should be conducted to identify patients who may be at risk of complications. A procedural time-out is then performed, confirming the patient's name, the procedure, any known allergies, and confirm consent was given.
