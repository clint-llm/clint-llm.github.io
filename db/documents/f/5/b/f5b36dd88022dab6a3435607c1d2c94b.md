The virus enters the body through mucous membranes and infects cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The filovirus then replicates within causing their necrosis and subsequent release of thousands of new viral particles into the body. The virus then spreads systemically in a rapid fashion through suppression of Type-I interferon response. Systemic spread to lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and thymus and other immunologic tissue results in further virus propagation. Autopsies show that fatal disease usually results in necrosis of tissues of organs such as liver and spleen.
