The diagnostic histopathological hallmark of tuberculosis is an epithelioid granuloma with central caseation necrosis. Tubercles are spherical nodules and have 3-4 cellular zones showing following features from the center to outwards:

- A central caseation necrosis

- An inner cellular zone containing lymphocytes, macrophages, epithelioid and giant cells

- An outer cellular zone of lymphocytes, immature macrophages, and plasma cells

- In healing lesions a rim of fibrosis

In caseation necrosis, there is low pH, low oxygen tension, and high fatty acid levels, all of which inhibit the growth of the tubercle bacillus and hence contain the infection.
