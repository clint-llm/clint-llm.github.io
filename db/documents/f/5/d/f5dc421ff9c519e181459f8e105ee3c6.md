Because bipolar disorder is a clinical diagnosis, making the correct diagnosis requires a comprehensive clinical assessment, including the directed patient interview, preferably supplemented by interviews of their relatives and the longitudinal course of their condition. Currently, there is no biomarker or neuroimaging study to aid in making the diagnosis.

Most patients with bipolar disorder are not correctly diagnosed until approximately 6 to 10 years after first contact with a healthcare provider, despite the presence of clinical characteristics of the condition.

Although not highly sensitive and specific, self-report screening tools for BD may aid clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis. The most studied screening tools are the Mood Disorders Questionnaire (sensitivity 80%, specificity 70%) and the Hypomania Checklist 32 (sensitivity 82%, specificity 57%).

A significant diagnostic challenge is distinguishing between unipolar and bipolar depression because episodes of unipolar major depression and bipolar depression have the same general diagnostic criteria. Clinicians must inquire about past manic, hypomanic, and depressive episodes in patients presenting with symptoms of a depressive episode. Inquiry into past hypomanic or manic episodes is particularly important for patients with early onset of their first depressive episode (ie, in patients younger than 25 years), a high number of lifetime depressive episodes (5 or more episodes), and a family history of bipolar disorder. These findings in the patient’s history have been shown to increase the likelihood of a bipolar rather than a unipolar diagnosis.

Other factors increasing the likelihood of a diagnostic change from MDD to BD include the presence of psychosis, unresponsiveness to antidepressants, the induction of manic or hypomanic symptoms by antidepressant drug treatment, and polymorbidity, defined as 3 or more comorbid conditions.
