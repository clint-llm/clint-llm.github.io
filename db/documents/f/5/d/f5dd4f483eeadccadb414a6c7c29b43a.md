Given the circle system is the most commonly used breathing system in the United States, its significance will be discussed here. Advantages of this breathing system include good control of anesthetic depth, ability to scavenge exhaled gasses, lower requirements of fresh gas flow due to the CO2 absorber, conservation of heat and humidity, and minimal contribution to anatomic dead space as only components distal to and including the Y-piece contribute to dead space. Of note, the CO2 absorber may break down volatile anesthetics into clinically measurable concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin by generating carbon monoxide. This reaction is of greatest risk when using desflurane and CO2 absorbents with high quantities of strong bases such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH).

Additionally, in rat and non-human primate studies, sevoflurane degradation by the absorbent has produced a byproduct called compound A. Compound A has been shown to cause nephrotoxicity in these animal studies, but the same effects have never been demonstrated in humans.
