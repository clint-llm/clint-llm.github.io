Management of transfusion iron overload is based on the duration of transfusion dependence and the severity of the underlying disease. The success of therapy significantly depends on patient adherence. Therefore, the treatment regimen should be adjusted to improve patient compliance.

Prophylactic iron chelation therapy should be initiated before clinically significant iron overload occurs. Phlebotomy is not usually done as most of the patients are already anemic. Traditionally after 15 to 20 units of blood transfusions, an iron-chelating agent is initiated. Deferoxamine and deferasirox are commonly used in the United States.

Deferoxamine is the treatment of choice for transfusion iron overload. It is administered as a continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion. In the body, it chelates circulating and tissue iron and eliminates it in urine and bile. In contrast, deferasirox is an orally active iron chelator. After absorption, hepatocyte and other tissues take up deferasirox. Deferasirox chelates tissue iron and eliminates it mainly in bile.

Both deferoxamine and deferasirox monotherapy significantly reduce cardiac and hepatic siderosis.
