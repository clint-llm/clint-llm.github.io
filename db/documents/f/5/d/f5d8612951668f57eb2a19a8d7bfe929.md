Tubular carcinoma of the breast is a distinct, relatively rare low-grade neoplasm, accounting for approximately 1 to 2% of invasive breast cancers. Its diagnosis relies on histopathological examination of the surgical specimen. Because of its favorable prognosis, some studies have proposed that a diagnosis of tubular carcinoma might warrant less aggressive surgical or adjuvant treatment. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of tubular carcinoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of tubular breast carcinoma.
- Explain the appropriate evaluation of tubular breast carcinoma.
- Discuss the treatment and management options available for tubular breast carcinoma.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance tubular breast carcinoma and improve outcomes.
