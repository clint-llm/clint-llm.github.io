Isolated DRS leads to an excellent long-term prognosis for vision if managed appropriately. With a motley of non-surgical and surgical options available, features of DRS such as abnormal head posture, globe retraction, shoots, and misalignment of the visual axes can be improved. Advances in surgery such as transposition of vertical muscles also aid in improving ductions in patients of DRS.
