Sertraline is an antidepressant medication within the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) class. Sertraline is an antidepressant with primarily inhibitory effects on presynaptic serotonin reuptake. This inhibition of serotonin reuptake results in an accumulation of serotonin. Serotonin in the central nervous system plays a role in regulating mood, personality, and wakefulness, which is why blocking serotonin reuptake is beneficial in disorders such as major depression.

Sertraline also has minimal effects on norepinephrine and dopamine uptake, and research has shown that it has more dopaminergic activity than other medications in the same SSRI class. Sertraline's mechanism of action makes it highly efficacious when used in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions.
