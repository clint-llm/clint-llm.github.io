The signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease can be classified into visceral, hematologic, skeletal, and metabolic components. The visceral components include enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).

Hematological components can include thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukopenia. Cerebroside accumulation in the bone marrow is thought to decrease platelet production resulting in low platelet count. Similarly, cerebroside accumulation in the spleen is thought to result in an excessive break down of red blood cells resulting in anemia as well as more active removal of white blood cells (WBC) resulting in a low WBC count. The rapid and premature destruction of blood cells can lead to an increased risk of bleeding and infections.

The skeletal components can include bone crisis, the death of bone cells (called avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis), a low bone density compared to normal peak density, pathological bone fracture, and Erlenmeyer flask deformity. Much of these skeletal abnormalities are attributed to the buildup of glucocerebroside-laden macrophages in the bone-marrow where they restrict blood flow and the delivery nutrients and oxygen which can result in intense pain, bone cell necrosis, low bone density, and growth abnormalities.
