Osteopathic manipulative treatment is a form of manual therapy that can be used to decrease and treat pain. It is poorly understood among many healthcare professionals, but spreading the knowledge about OMT and teaching techniques among interdisciplinary teams can create a more common ground among providers. More understanding about OMT can also provide interprofessional healthcare team membersÂ with more tools for treating patients and providing patient-centered care. Osteopathic manipulative treatment can also reduce the number of pain medications a patient takes and improve patient outcomes.

When employing OMT for any condition, the treating clinician should communicate this to other team members so they are aware that the patient is receiving this procedure and can factor that into their own treatment decisions. OMT as a therapeutic intervention in the context of interprofessional cooperation can improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
