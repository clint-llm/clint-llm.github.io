Complications from untreated spider veins are infrequent and do not usually cause any health problems. In severe cases associated with varicose veins, there is a higher chance of developing sores or skin ulcers, and thrombophlebitis. As with any procedure, there are risks of complications, and therapeutic procedures for spider veins are no exceptions; however, these risks are very low.
